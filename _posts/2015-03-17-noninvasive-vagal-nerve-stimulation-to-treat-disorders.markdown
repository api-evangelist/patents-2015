title: Non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation to treat disorders
abstract: Devices, systems and methods are disclosed for treating bronchial constriction related to asthma, anaphylaxis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exercise-induced bronchospasm and post-operative bronchospasm. The treatment comprises transmitting impulses of energy non-invasively to selected nerve fibers that activate neural pathways to reduce the release of acetycholine from airway-related vagal preganglionic neurons within the brain of the patient. The transmitted energy impulses, comprising magnetic and/or electrical energy, stimulate the selected nerve fibers to produce the bronchodilation.

The field of the present invention relates to the delivery of energy impulses and or fields to bodily tissues for therapeutic purposes. The invention relates more specifically to devices and methods for treating conditions associated with bronchial constriction including asthma anaphylaxis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD exercise induced bronchospasm and post operative bronchospasm. The energy impulses and or fields that are used to treat those conditions comprise electrical and or electromagnetic energy delivered non invasively to the patient.

The use of electrical stimulation for treatment of medical conditions is well known. For example electrical stimulation of the brain with implanted electrodes has been approved for use in the treatment of various conditions including pain and movement disorders such as essential tremor and Parkinson s disease. Another application of electrical stimulation of nerves is the treatment of radiating pain in the lower extremities by stimulating the sacral nerve roots at the bottom of the spinal cord Paul F.

Another example of electrical stimulation for treatment of medical conditions is vagus nerve stimulation VNS also known as vagal nerve stimulation . It was developed initially for the treatment of partial onset epilepsy and was subsequently developed for the treatment of depression and other disorders. The left vagus nerve is ordinarily stimulated at a location within the neck by first surgically implanting an electrode there and then connecting the electrode to an electrical stimulator U.S. Pat.

Many such therapeutic applications of electrical stimulation involve the surgical implantation of electrodes within a patient. In contrast devices used for the medical procedures that are disclosed herein do not involve surgery. Instead the present devices and methods stimulate nerves by transmitting energy to nerves and tissue non invasively. A medical procedure is defined as being non invasive when no break in the skin or other surface of the body such as a wound bed is created through use of the method and when there is no contact with an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice e.g. beyond the mouth or beyond the external auditory meatus of the ear . Such non invasive procedures are distinguished from invasive procedures including minimally invasive procedures in that the invasive procedures insert a substance or device into or through the skin or other surface of the body such as a wound bed or into an internal body cavity beyond a body orifice.

For example transcutaneous electrical stimulation of a nerve is non invasive because it involves attaching electrodes to the skin or otherwise stimulating at or beyond the surface of the skin or using a form fitting conductive garment without breaking the skin Thierry KELLER and Andreas Kuhn. Electrodes for transcutaneous surface electrical stimulation. Journal of Automatic Control University of Belgrade 18 2 2008 35 45 Mark R. PRAUSNITZ. The effects of electric current applied to skin A review for transdermal drug delivery. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 18 1996 395 425 . In contrast percutaneous electrical stimulation of a nerve is minimally invasive because it involves the introduction of an electrode under the skin via needle puncture of the skin. In what follows comparison is sometimes made between the disclosed noninvasive methods versus comparable invasive methods for purposes of demonstrating feasibility and or validation of the noninvasive methods.

Another form of non invasive electrical stimulation is magnetic stimulation. It involves the induction by a time varying magnetic field of electrical fields and current within tissue in accordance with Faraday s law of induction. Magnetic stimulation is non invasive because the magnetic field is produced by passing a time varying current through a coil positioned outside the body inducing at a distance an electric field and electric current within electrically conducting bodily tissue. The electrical circuits for magnetic stimulators are generally complex and expensive and use a high current impulse generator that may produce discharge currents of 5 000 amps or more which is passed through the stimulator coil to produce a magnetic pulse. The principles of electrical nerve stimulation using a magnetic stimulator along with descriptions of medical applications of magnetic stimulation are reviewed in Chris HOVEY and Reza Jalinous The Guide to Magnetic Stimulation The Magstim Company Ltd Spring Gardens Whitland Carmarthenshire SA34 0HR United Kingdom 2006. In contrast the magnetic stimulators that are disclosed herein are relatively simpler devices that use considerably smaller currents within the stimulator coils. Accordingly they are intended to satisfy the need for simple to use and less expensive non invasive magnetic stimulation devices for use in treating bronchoconstriction as well as use in treating other conditions.

Potential advantages of such non invasive medical methods and devices relative to comparable invasive procedures are as follows. The patient may be more psychologically prepared to experience a procedure that is non invasive and may therefore be more cooperative resulting in a better outcome. Non invasive procedures may avoid damage of biological tissues such as that due to bleeding infection skin or internal organ injury blood vessel injury and vein or lung blood clotting. Non invasive procedures are generally painless and may be performed without the dangers and costs of surgery. They are ordinarily performed even without the need for local anesthesia. Less training may be required for use of non invasive procedures by medical professionals. In view of the reduced risk ordinarily associated with non invasive procedures some such procedures may be suitable for use by the patient or family members at home or by first responders at home or at a workplace. Furthermore the cost of non invasive procedures may be significantly reduced relative to comparable invasive procedures.

In the present application the non invasive delivery of energy is intended ultimately to dilate constricted bronchial passages of the lung by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle and or inhibit mucous production by the mucous glands. The smooth muscles that line the bronchial passages are controlled by a confluence of vagus and sympathetic nerve fiber plexuses. Spasms of the bronchi during asthma attacks anaphylactic shock and other pulmonary disorders can often be directly related to pathological signaling within these plexuses as described below.

Asthma and other airway occluding disorders resulting from immune responses and inflammation mediated bronchoconstriction affects an estimated eight to thirteen million adults and children in the United States. A significant subclass of asthmatics suffers from severe asthma. An estimated 5 000 persons die every year in the United States as a result of asthma attacks. Up to twenty percent of the populations of some countries are affected by asthma estimated to be more than a hundred million people worldwide. Asthma s associated morbidity and mortality are rising in most countries despite the increasing use of anti asthma drugs.

Asthma is characterized as a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways. Typical symptoms are coughing wheezing tightness of the chest and shortness of breath. Asthma is a result of increased sensitivity to foreign bodies such as pollen dust mites and cigarette smoke. The body in effect overreacts to the presence of these foreign bodies in the airways. As part of the asthmatic reaction an increase in mucous production is often triggered exacerbating airway restriction. Smooth muscle surrounding the airways goes into spasm resulting in constriction of airways. The airways also become inflamed. Over time this inflammation can lead to scarring of the airways and a further reduction in airflow. This inflammation leads to the airways becoming more irritable which may cause an increase in coughing and increased susceptibility to asthma episodes.

In general there are three mechanisms that may be triggered in acute asthma and other conditions such as anaphylaxis as described below . First allergens induce smooth muscle bronchoconstriction through Ig E dependent release of mast cell mediators such as histamines prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Second airway hyper responsiveness resulting from local and central neural reflex stimulation and by mediators of inflammation can increase bronchoconstriction. A third mechanism may stimulate mucosal thickening and edematous swelling of the bronchial walls through increased microvascular permeability and leakage.

In the case of asthma it appears that the airway tissue has both i a hypersensitivity to an allergen that causes the overproduction of the cytokines that stimulate the cholinergic receptors of the nerves and or ii a baseline high parasympathetic tone or a high ramp up to a strong parasympathetic tone when confronted with any level of cholinergic cytokine. The combination can be lethal. Anaphylaxis appears to be mediated predominantly by the hypersensitivity to an allergen causing the massive overproduction of cholinergic receptor activating cytokines that overdrive the otherwise normally operating vagus nerve to signal massive constriction of the airways. Drugs such as epinephrine drive heart rate up while also relaxing the bronchial muscles effecting temporary relief of symptoms from these conditions. Publications cited below show that severing the vagus nerve an extreme version of reducing the parasympathetic tone has an effect similar to that of epinephrine on heart rate and bronchial diameter in that the heart begins to race tachycardia and the bronchial passageways dilate.

Asthma is typically managed with inhaled medications that are taken after the onset of symptoms or by injected and or oral medications that are taken chronically. The medications typically fall into two categories those that treat the inflammation and those that treat the smooth muscle constriction. A first strategy is to provide anti inflammatory medications like steroids to treat the airway tissue reducing the tendency of the airways to over release the molecules that mediate the inflammatory process. A second strategy is to provide a smooth muscle relaxant e.g. an anticholinergic to reduce the ability of the muscles to constrict. As treatments anticholinergics improve lung function by modifying neural reflexes and parasympathetic vagal tone. While inferior to beta2 agonists as a primary treatment inhaled anticholinergics are effective as an adjunct to beta2 agonists and the combination offers an advantage in reducing hospital admissions.

It is sometimes advised that patients rely on anti inflammatory medications and avoidance of triggers rather than on the bronchodilators as their first line of treatment. For some patients however these medications and even the bronchodilators are insufficient to stop the constriction of their bronchial passages.

Anaphylaxis ranks among the other airway occluding disorders as the most deadly claiming many deaths in the United States every year. Anaphylaxis the most severe form of which is anaphylactic shock is a severe and rapid systemic allergic reaction to an allergen. Minute amounts of allergens may cause a life threatening anaphylactic reaction. Anaphylaxis may occur after ingestion inhalation skin contact or injection of an allergen. Anaphylactic shock usually results in death in minutes if untreated. It is a life threatening medical emergency because of rapid constriction of the airway resulting in brain damage through oxygen deprivation.

The triggers for anaphylactic reactions range from foods nuts and shellfish to insect stings bees to medication radio contrasts and antibiotics . It is estimated that 1.3 to 13 million people in the United States are allergic to venom associated with insect bites 27 million are allergic to antibiotics and 5 8 million suffer food allergies. In addition anaphylactic shock can be brought on by exercise. Yet all such reactions are mediated by a series of hypersensitivity responses that result in uncontrollable airway occlusion driven by smooth muscle constriction and dramatic hypotension that leads to shock. Cardiovascular failure multiple organ ischemia and asphyxiation are the most dangerous consequences of anaphylaxis.

Anaphylactic shock requires immediate advanced medical care. Current emergency measures include rescue breathing administration of epinephrine and or intubation if possible. Rescue breathing may be hindered by the closing airway but can help if the victim stops breathing on his own. Clinical treatment typically includes administration of antihistamines which inhibit the effects of histamine at histamine receptors but which are usually not sufficient in anaphylaxis and high doses of intravenous corticosteroids. Hypotension is treated with intravenous fluids and sometimes vasoconstrictor drugs. For bronchospasm bronchodilator drugs such as salbutamol are administered Phil LIEBERMAN.

The number of people who are susceptible to anaphylactic responses is estimated to be more than 40 million in the United States. Given the common mediators of both asthmatic and anaphylactic bronchoconstriction it is not surprising that asthma sufferers are at higher than average risk for anaphylaxis. Tragically many of these patients are fully aware of the severity of their condition but nevertheless die while struggling in vain to manage the attack medically. Many of these fatal incidents occur in hospitals or in ambulances in the presence of highly trained medical personnel who are powerless to break the cycle of inflammation and bronchoconstriction and life threatening hypotension in the case of anaphylaxis affecting their patient. Unfortunately prompt medical attention for anaphylactic shock and asthma are not always available. For example epinephrine is not always available for immediate injection. Even in cases where medication and attention is available life saving measures are often frustrated because of the nature of the symptoms. Constriction of the airways frustrates resuscitation efforts and intubation may be impossible because of swelling of tissues. Typically the severity and rapid onset of anaphylactic reactions does not render the pathology amenable to chronic treatment but requires more immediately acting medications. Epinephrine is among the most popular medications for treating anaphylaxis commonly marketed in so called Epipen formulations and administering devices which potential sufferers carry with them at all times. In addition to serving as an extreme bronchodilator epinephrine raises the patient s heart rate dramatically in order to offset the hypotension that accompanies many reactions. This cardiovascular stress can result in tachycardia heart attacks and strokes.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is a major cause of disability and is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. More than 12 million people are currently diagnosed with COPD. An additional 12 million likely have the disease but are unaware of their condition. COPD is a progressive disease that makes it increasingly difficult for the patient to breathe. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of mucus wheezing shortness of breath chest tightness and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD although long term exposure to other lung irritants such as air pollution chemical fumes or dust may also contribute to COPD. In COPD there is abnormally low air flow within the bronchial airways for a variety of reasons including loss of elasticity in the airways and or air sacs inflammation and or destruction of the walls between many of the air sacs and overproduction of mucus within the airways.

The term COPD includes two primary conditions emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis. In emphysema the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged causing them to lose their shape and become floppy. This damage can also destroy the walls of the air sacs leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many small ones. In chronic obstructive bronchitis the patient suffers from permanently irritated and inflamed bronchial tissue that is slowly and progressively dying. This causes the lining to thicken and form thick mucus making it difficult to breathe. Many of these patients also experience periodic episodes of acute airway reactivity i.e. acute exacerbations wherein the smooth muscle surrounding the airways goes into spasm resulting in further constriction and inflammation of the airways. Acute exacerbations occur on average between two and three times a year in patients with moderate to severe COPD and are the most common cause of hospitalization in these patients with mortality rates of approximately 11 . Frequent acute exacerbations of COPD cause lung function to deteriorate quickly and patients never recover to the condition they were in before the last exacerbation. As with asthma current medical management of these acute exacerbations is often insufficient Dick D. BRIGGS Jr. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overview prevalence pathogenesis and treatment.

Exercise induced bronchospasm EIB results from a transient increase in airway resistance that occurs five to ten minutes after initiation of exercise. It produces symptoms such as shortness of breath cough wheezing chest tightness or pain. Eighty to ninety percent of patients with asthma also have EIB but up to a quarter of non asthmatic athletes may also experience EIB. The condition is usually treated with short acting bronchodilator medication with or without the addition of anti inflammatory agents taken 15 to 30 minutes before initiation of exercise. However many patients do not respond to those treatments or they experience unwanted side effects. Accordingly one objective of the present invention is to provide an alternative to pharmacological treatment through the use of noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation before and or after exercise Taru SINHA and Alan K. David. Recognition and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Am Fam Physician 67 2003 769 774 .

Bronchospasm is one of the most significant respiratory complications that can occur during surgical anesthesia and asthmatic patients as well as some patients with COPD are at elevated risk for it. Because the beneficial effects of steroids on airway reactivity occurs over a period of hours patients at risk of experiencing bronchospasm during surgery are sometimes treated with steroids starting 24 48 h before surgery. The patients who are actually wheezing before surgery also receive treatment with inhaled beta 2 adrenergic agents and corticosteroids. Such wheezing may also be experienced by patients without pre existing reactive airway disease due to pulmonary edema pneumothorax drug reactions aspiration and endobronchial intubation. If the pharmacological treatment does not stop or prevent the wheezing the surgery may be deferred but this is not always practical or possible in view of the need for surgery. Accordingly one objective of the present invention is to provide an alternative to pharmacological treatment through the use of noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation before surgery.

Despite precautions and pre treatments bronchospasm may nevertheless occur during surgery in which case beta 2 adrenergic agents may also be administered through an endotracheal tube. For some patients those agents may not be effective or are otherwise contraindicated and the bronchospasm may continue even after the surgery is completed. Accordingly another objective of the present invention is to provide an alternative to pharmacological treatment for bronchospasm that occurs during and after surgery through the use of noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation Peter ROCK and Preston B. Rich. Postoperative pulmonary complications. Current Opinion in Anaesthesiology 16 2003 123 132 .

Unlike cardiac arrhythmias which can be treated chronically with pacemaker technology or in emergent situations with defibrillators implantable and external there is no commercially available medical equipment that can chronically reduce the baseline sensitivity of the smooth muscle tissue in the airways to reduce the predisposition to asthma attacks to reduce the symptoms of COPD or to break the cycle of bronchial constriction associated with an acute asthma attack or anaphylaxis. Therefore there is a need in the art for new products and methods for treating the immediate symptoms of bronchial constriction resulting from pathologies such as anaphylactic shock asthma COPD exercise induced bronchospasm and post operative bronchospasm. In particular there is a need in the art for non invasive devices and methods to treat the immediate symptoms of bronchial constriction.

Although energy has been applied previously to patients in such a way as to bring about bronchodilation those investigations involve methods that are invasive. For example U.S. Pat. No. 7 740 017 entitled Method for treating an asthma attack to DANEK et al. discloses an invasive method for directing radio frequency energy to the lungs to bring about bronchodilation. U.S. Pat. No. 7 264 002 entitled Methods of treating reversible obstructive pulmonary disease to DANEK et al. discloses methods of treating an asthmatic lung invasively by advancing a treatment device into the lung and applying energy. Those invasive methods attempt to dilate the bronchi directly rather than to stimulate nerve fibers that in turn bring about bronchodilation.

In contrast the present invention discloses the use of noninvasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve VNS to dilate constricted bronchi. U.S. Pat. No. 6 198 970 entitled Method and apparatus for treating oropharyngeal respiratory and oral motor neuromuscular disorders with electrical stimulation to FREED et al. describes noninvasive electrical stimulation methods for the treatment of asthma and COPD but they involve direct stimulation of muscles instead of the vagus nerve. The present invention is unexpected because previous reports teach away from the use of invasive or noninvasive VNS to treat bronchoconstriction. Thus in most subjects with asthma vagal nerve activity contributes in varying degree to bronchoconstriction OKAYAMA M Yafuso N Nogami H et al. A new method of inhalation challenge with propranolol comparison with methacholine induced bronchoconstriction and role of vagal nerve activity. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 80 1987 291 9 .

Identification and treatment of bronchoconstriction induced by a vagus nerve stimulator employed for management of seizure disorder. Chest 127 1 2005 401 402 . Yet other reports list dyspnea or shortness of breath as common side effects of VNS which is contrary to the objectives of the present invention MORRIS G L 3rd Mueller W M.

The vagus nerve innervates the heart which raises additional concerns that even if VNS could be used to dilate bronchi such vagus nerve stimulation could trigger cardiac or circulatory problems including bradycardia hypotension and arrhythmia particularly if the right vagus nerve is stimulated SPUCK S Tronnier V Orosz I Sch nweiler R Sepehrnia A Nowak G Sperner J.

Transient atrial fibrillation after the implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator. Epilepsia 45 12 2004 1645 . In fact vasovagal reactions are classically brought about by a triggering stimulus to the vagus nerve resulting in simultaneous enhancement of parasympathetic nervous system vagal tone and withdrawal of sympathetic nervous system tone.

Accordingly we performed experiments which are described herein showing first that invasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can in fact produce bronchodilation without first producing bronchoconstriction Thomas J. HOFFMANN Steven Mendez Peter Staats Charles W. Emala Puyun Guo. Inhibition of Histamine Induced Bronchoconstriction in Guinea Pig and Swine by Pulsed Electrical Vagus Nerve Stimulation. Neuromodulation 12 4 2009 261 269 . The success of those and subsequent experiments motivated the present disclosure that noninvasive methods and devices can also produce bronchodilation in humans provided that the disclosed special devices and stimulation methods are used. Those devices and methods address not only the problems of producing bronchodilation and avoiding the production of abnormal heart rate or blood pressure but also the problem of stimulating at the skin of the patient in such a way that a vagus nerve is selectively modulated and in such a way that side effects including muscle twitching and stimulation pain are minimized or avoided.

The present invention involves devices and methods for the treatment of asthma COPD anaphylaxis exercise induced bronchospasm post operative bronchospasm and other pathologies involving constriction of the primary airways. It uses an energy source comprising magnetic and or electrical energy that is transmitted non invasively to or in close proximity to a selected nerve to temporarily stimulate block and or modulate the signals in the selected nerve.

The present invention is particularly useful for the acute relief of symptoms associated with bronchial constriction e.g. asthma attacks COPD exacerbations and or anaphylactic reactions. The teachings of the present invention provide an emergency response to such acute symptoms by producing an almost immediate airway dilation enabling subsequent adjunctive measures such as the administration of epinephrine to be effectively employed. The invention may be useful for treating bronchoconstriction in patients who cannot tolerate the side effects of albuterol or other short acting agonists who do not gain sufficient benefit from anticholinergic medications including tioproprium bromide or whose airway resistance is too high to get adequate benefit from inhaled medications. In preferred embodiments the disclosed methods and devices do not produce clinically significant side effects such as changes in heart rate or blood pressure.

One aspect of the method includes stimulating inhibiting blocking or otherwise modulating nerves that directly or indirectly modulate parasympathetic ganglia transmission by stimulation or inhibition of preganglionic to postganglionic transmissions. According to this feature of the invention noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation with the disclosed devices can activate pathways causing release of norepinephrine serotonin and GABA inhibitory neurotransmitters onto airway related vagal preganglionic neurons AVPNs thereby preventing release of acetylcholine in the airways and resulting in bronchorelaxation. These neural pathways also innervate the mucous glands in the lungs and other airway passages. Thus the activation of these neural pathways also inhibits mucous production in the airways increasing airflow to and from the patient s lungs.

In an alternative embodiment the fibers responsible for bronchodilation are interneurons that are completely contained within the walls of the bronchial airways. These interneurons are responsible for modulating the cholinergic nerves in the bronchial passages. In this embodiment the increased activity of the interneurons will cause inhibition or blocking of the cholinergic nerves responsible for bronchial constriction thereby facilitating opening of the airways.

In yet another aspect of the present invention the selected nerve fibers comprise those that send an afferent vagal signal to the brain which then triggers an efferent sympathetic signal to stimulate the release of catecholamines comprising endogenous beta agonists epinephrine and or norepinephrine from the adrenal glands and or from nerve endings that are within the lung or distributed throughout the body.

The stimulating step is preferably carried out without substantially stimulating excitatory nerve fibers such as parasympathetic cholinergic nerve fibers that are responsible for increasing the magnitude of constriction of smooth muscle. In this manner the activity of the nerve fibers responsible for bronchodilation are increased without increasing the activity of the cholinergic fibers which would otherwise induce further constriction of the smooth muscle. Alternatively the method may comprise the step of actually inhibiting or blocking these cholinergic nerve fibers such that the nerves responsible for bronchodilation are stimulated while the nerves responsible for bronchial constriction are inhibited or completely blocked. This blocking inhibiting signal may be separately applied to the inhibitory nerves or it may be part of the same signal that is applied to the nerve fibers directly responsible bronchodilation.

In yet another aspect of the present invention stimulation of a vagus nerve randomizes afferent neural signals sent to the central nervous system or it randomizes efferent signals sent from the central nervous system to the bronchi thereby resetting the phase relations between bronchiole smooth muscle oscillators. A consequence of this phase resetting is that it promotes an avalanche type reopening of bronchioles within regions of the lung that had been poorly ventilated or it prevents avalanche type closing of bronchioles.

The method of treating bronchial constriction includes applying an energy impulse to a target region in the patient preferably over a period of less than two minutes and acutely reducing the magnitude of bronchial constriction in the patient. Preferably the bronchodilation effect lasts from about 2 to 8 hours.

The energy impulse is transmitted non invasively from an energy source comprising magnetic and or electrical sources of energy. As used herein the term acutely means that the energy impulse immediately begins to interact with one or more nerves to produce a response in the patient. The energy impulse is preferably sufficient to promptly and quantitatively ameliorate a symptom for example to increase the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second FEV1 of the patient by a clinically significant amount in a period of time less than about 6 hours preferably less than 3 hours and more preferably less than 90 minutes and even more preferably less that 15 minutes. A clinically significant amount is defined herein as at least a 12 increase in the patient s FEV1 versus the FEV1 measured prior to application of the energy impulse. In an exemplary embodiment the energy impulse is sufficient to increase the FEV1 by at least 19 over the FEV1 as predicted. Preferably the increase in FEV1 is accompanied by a clinically significant improvement in Peak Expiratory Flow PEF and Work of Breathing WOB .

In one embodiment of the invention the stimulator comprises a source of electrical power and two or more remote electrodes that are configured to stimulate a deep nerve relative to the nerve axis. The stimulator comprises two electrodes that lie side by side within separate stimulator heads wherein the electrodes are separated by electrically insulating material. Each electrode is in continuous contact with an electrically conducting medium that extends from the interface element of the stimulator to the electrode. The interface element also contacts the patient s skin when the device is in operation.

Current passing through an electrode may be about 0 to 40 mA with voltage across the electrodes of about 0 to 30 volts. The current is passed through the electrodes in bursts of pulses. There may be 1 to 20 pulses per burst preferably five pulses. Each pulse within a burst has a duration of about 20 to 1000 microseconds preferably 200 microseconds. A burst followed by a silent inter burst interval repeats at 1 to 5000 bursts per second bps similar to Hz preferably at 15 50 bps and even more preferably at 25 bps. The preferred shape of each pulse is a full sinusoidal wave.

A source of power supplies a pulse of electric charge to the electrodes or magnetic stimulator coil such that the electrodes or magnetic stimulator produce an electric current and or an electric field within the patient. The electrical or magnetic stimulator is configured to induce a peak pulse voltage sufficient to produce an electric field in the vicinity of a nerve such as a vagus nerve to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation. By way of example the threshold electric field for stimulation of the nerve may be about 8 V m at 1000 Hz. For example the device may produce an electric field within the patient of about 10 to 600 V m preferably less than 100 V m and an electrical field gradient of greater than 2 V m mm. The electric fields produced by the present invention at the vagus nerve are generally sufficient to excite all myelinated A and B fibers but not the unmyelinated C fibers. However by using a reduced amplitude of stimulation excitation of A delta and B fibers may also be avoided.

The preferred stimulator shapes an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to a long nerve such as a vagus. By selecting a suitable waveform to stimulate the nerve along with suitable parameters such as current voltage pulse width pulses per burst inter burst interval etc. the stimulator produces a correspondingly selective physiological response in an individual patient such as bronchodilation. Such a suitable waveform and parameters are simultaneously selected to avoid substantially stimulating nerves and tissue other than the target nerve particularly avoiding the stimulation of nerves that produce pain.

Treating or averting of an exacerbation of bronchoconstriction may also be implemented within the context of control theory. A controller comprising for example one of the disclosed vagus nerve stimulators a PID and a feedforward model provides input to the patient via stimulation of one or both of the patient s vagus nerves. Feedforward models may be grey box models that incorporate knowledge of the bronchi and their physiological control. They may also be black box models particularly models that make use of support vector machines. Data for exercising the models are from noninvasive physiological and or environmental signals obtained from sensors located on or about the patient. A grey box model involving coupled Duffing oscillators that models bronchial smooth muscle dynamics is disclosed. The model predicts the abrupt onset of asthma and its abrupt termination through use of vagus nerve stimulation which is described in terms of phase diagrams.

The novel systems devices and methods for treating bronchial constriction are more completely described in the following detailed description of the invention with reference to the drawings provided herewith and in claims appended hereto. Other aspects features advantages etc. will become apparent to one skilled in the art when the description of the invention herein is taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Hereby all issued patents published patent applications and non patent publications that are mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes to the same extent as if each individual issued patent published patent application or non patent publication were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.

Once air is inhaled through the mouth or nose it travels through the trachea and a progressively bifurcating system of bronchi containing cartilage and bronchioles which contain little or no cartilage until it finally reaches the alveoli where the gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen takes place. Through constriction or relaxation of smooth muscle within their walls the bronchioles change diameter to either reduce or increase air flow. The bronchioles between the fourth and eighth bifurcation are thought to be most important in that regard. Normally an increase in diameter bronchodilation to increase air flow is stimulated by circulating epinephrine adrenaline or sympathetic nerve fibers or so called iNANC nerve fibers and a decrease in diameter bronchoconstriction is stimulated by parasympathetic cholinergic nerve fibers histamine cold air and chemical irritants. Reflexes have evolved to regulate the caliber of bronchioles in which afferent nerves send state dependent sensory signals to the central nervous system which in turn sends efferent controlling signals back to the bronchi and bronchioles thereby allowing smooth muscle and other components in the bronchi to adapt their caliber as needed to respond to such things as exercise air borne irritants and infectious agents.

The present invention teaches non invasive devices and methods for treating abnormal bronchial constriction by stimulating selected nerve fibers that are responsible for reducing the magnitude of constriction of smooth bronchial muscle such that the activity of those selected nerve fibers is increased and smooth bronchial muscle is dilated. In particular the present invention provides methods and devices for immediate relief of acute symptoms associated with bronchial constriction such as asthma attacks COPD exacerbations anaphylactic reactions exercise induced bronchospasm and post operative bronchospasm. The stimulated nerve fibers are particularly those associated with a vagus nerve tenth cranial nerve .

In a preferred embodiment electrodes applied to the skin of the patient generate currents within the tissue of the patient. An objective of the invention is to produce and apply electrical impulses that interact with the signals of one or more nerves to achieve the therapeutic result of bronchodilation. Much of the disclosure will be directed specifically to treatment of a patient by stimulation in or around a vagus nerve with devices positioned non invasively on or near a patient s neck. In particular the present invention can be used to directly or indirectly stimulate or otherwise modulate nerves that innervate bronchial smooth muscle. However it will be appreciated that the devices and methods of the present invention can be applied to other tissues and nerves of the body including but not limited to other parasympathetic nerves sympathetic nerves spinal or cranial nerves.

The methods described herein of applying an impulse of energy to a selected region of a vagus nerve may be refined to propagate signals directly or indirectly via the central nervous system to at least one of the anterior bronchial branches of a vagus nerve or alternatively to at least one of the posterior bronchial branches thereof. Preferably the propagated impulse is provided to at least one of the anterior pulmonary or posterior pulmonary plexuses aligned along the exterior of the lung. As necessary the impulse may be directed to nerves innervating only the bronchial tree and lung tissue itself. In addition the impulse may be directed to a region of the vagus nerve to stimulate block and or modulate both the cardiac and bronchial vagal branches. As recognized by those having skill in the art this embodiment should be carefully evaluated prior to use in patients known to have preexisting cardiac issues.

Overview of Physiological Mechanisms by which Vagus Nerve Stimulation May Bring about Bronchodilation

A vagus nerve is composed of motor and sensory fibers. The vagus nerve leaves the cranium and is contained in the same sheath of dura matter with the accessory nerve. The vagus nerve passes down the neck within the carotid sheath to the root of the neck. The branches of distribution of the vagus nerve include among others the superior cardiac the inferior cardiac the anterior bronchial and the posterior bronchial branches. On the right side the vagus nerve descends by the trachea to the back of the root of the lung where it spreads out in the posterior pulmonary plexus. On the left side the vagus nerve enters the thorax crosses the left side of the arch of the aorta and descends behind the root of the left lung forming the posterior pulmonary plexus.

A vagus nerve in man consists of over 100 000 nerve fibers axons mostly organized into groups. The groups are contained within fascicles of varying sizes which branch and converge along the nerve and which are surrounded by perineurium epineurium and fibrotic connective tissue. Each fiber normally conducts electrical impulses only in one direction which is defined to be the orthodromic direction and which is opposite the antidromic direction. Besides efferent output fibers that convey signals to the various organs in the body from the central nervous system the vagus nerve conveys sensory information about the state of the body s organs back to the central nervous system. Some 80 90 of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerve are afferent sensory nerves communicating the state of the viscera to the central nervous system.

The largest nerve fibers within a left or right vagus nerve are approximately 20 m in diameter and are heavily myelinated whereas only the smallest nerve fibers of less than about 1 m in diameter are completely unmyelinated. When the distal part of a nerve is electrically stimulated a compound action potential is recorded by an electrode located more proximally. A compound action potential contains several peaks or waves of activity that represent the summated response of multiple fibers having similar conduction velocities. The waves in a compound action potential represent different types of nerve fibers that are classified into corresponding functional categories with approximate diameters as follows A alpha fibers afferent or efferent fibers 12 20 m diameter A beta fibers afferent or efferent fibers 5 12 m A gamma fibers efferent fibers 3 7 m A delta fibers afferent fibers 2 5 m B fibers 1 3 m and C fibers unnnyelinated 0.4 1.2 m . The diameters of group A and group B fibers include the thickness of the myelin sheaths.

In mammals two vagal components have evolved in the brainstem to regulate peripheral parasympathetic functions. The dorsal vagal complex DVC consisting of the dorsal motor nucleus DMNX and its connections controls parasympathetic function primarily below the level of the diaphragm while the ventral vagal complex VVC comprised of nucleus ambiguus and nucleus retrofacial controls functions primarily above the diaphragm in organs such as the heart thymus and lungs as well as other glands and tissues of the neck and upper chest and specialized muscles such as those of the esophageal complex.

The parasympathetic portion of the vagus innervates ganglionic neurons which are located in or adjacent to each target organ. The VVC appears only in mammals and is associated with positive as well as negative regulation of heart rate bronchial constriction bronchodilation vocalization and contraction of the facial muscles in relation to emotional states. Generally speaking this portion of the vagus nerve regulates parasympathetic tone. The VVC inhibition is released turned off in states of alertness. This in turn causes cardiac vagal tone to decrease and airways to open to support responses to environmental challenges.

The parasympathetic tone is balanced in part by sympathetic innervations which generally speaking supplies signals tending to relax the bronchial muscles so that over constriction does not occur. Overall airway smooth muscle tone is dependent on several factors including parasympathetic input inhibitory influence of circulating epinephrine iNANC nerves and sympathetic innervations of the parasympathetic ganglia. Stimulation of certain nerve fibers of the vagus nerve up regulation of tone such as occurs in asthma or COPD attacks or anaphylactic shock results in airway constriction and a decrease in heart rate. In general the pathology of severe asthma COPD and anaphylaxis appear to be mediated by inflammatory cytokines that overwhelm receptors on the nerve cells and cause the cells to massively upregulate the parasympathetic tone.

The role of a vagus nerve in controlling the caliber of a bronchus or bronchiole lumen is illustrated in . The bronchus or bronchiole is tubular in shape and the left side of shows a cross section of its anatomy viewed left to right from its central air containing lumen to its periphery. The figure as drawn is a composite of structures that are found in large bronchi to small bronchioles and it is not intended to be a complete representation of the bronchioles and their control. The air in the lumen is in contact with a layer of mucus . That layer comprises water and various macromolecular glycoproteins disposed in a gel sol structure. It may also contain trapped inhaled particles and cells that participate in an immune response to inhaled viruses bacteria and other antigens. The mucus is produced by cells in and near the epithelial layer that lines the inner surface of the airway. The epithelium of the larger airways comprises ciliated basal goblet brush and small granule cells among which the goblet cells are responsible for much of the mucus. Larger airways also contain glands that contain two secretory cell types the serous and the mucous cell secretions from which reach the lumen via a duct inserted through the epithelium . The epithelium of the distal airways consists mainly of ciliated and bronchiolar exocrine Clara cells and the latter cells produce much of the mucus there. Transport of the mucus to the mouth is due to ciliary beating of ciliated cells of the epithelium and to airflow.

A basement membrane anchors the epithelium to loose connective tissue that lies beneath the membrane. The lamina propria is the layer of connective tissue that lies immediately beneath the epithelium which together with the epithelium constitutes the mucosa or mucous membrane .

Cells that participate in host defense are present in the lamina propria such as cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems including macrophages neutrophils eosinophils dendritic cells mast cells natural killer cells and lymphocytes. Those immune cells interacting with the epithelial cells are responsible for much of the defensive properties of the airways Nicholas A. EISELE and Deborah M. Anderson. Host defense and the airway epithelium frontline responses that protect against bacterial invasion and pneumonia. Journal of Pathogens 2011 249802 pp. 1 15 Laurent P. NICOD. Pulmonary defense mechanisms. Respiration 66 1999 2 11 .

Variable amounts of elastin may also be present in the lamina propria or the elastin may appear as a layer under a generally separated or discontinuous circumferential layer of smooth muscle . Contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscle modulates the diameter of the bronchiole and its lumen which thereby modulates the flow of air between the trachea and the alveoli where gas exchange occurs.

Capillaries or other small blood vessels are also present in the lamina propria and blood vessels arteries and veins e.g. venules occupy the region of adventitia between the smooth muscle layer and the peripheral site of bronchiolar attachment to alveoli or other lung structure such as cartilage John WIDDICOMBE. The airway vasculature. Experimental Physiology 78 1993 433 452 .

Afferent nerve fibers within the bronchi and bronchioles sense the status of the airways and send that information towards the central nervous system. The brainstem and other central nervous tissue in turn process and integrate that information along with information sensed from other lung structures and other organs e.g. respiratory muscles vasculature heart etc. then send control signals along efferent nerve fibers to directly or indirectly modulate the activity of structures within the bronchi and bronchioles. Those neuronally modulated structures are primarily the smooth muscle and the secretion glands but the blood vessels the immune cells within the lamina propria and cells within the epithelium may be modulated as well.

Although both the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system innervate the airways the parasympathetic branch dominates especially with respect to control of airway smooth muscle and secretions. Parasympathetic tone in the airways is regulated by reflex activity often initiated by activation of airway stretch receptors and polymodal nociceptors as now described Marie Claire MICHOUD. Neurohumoral control of the airways. Chapter 30 pp. 363 370 In Physiologic Basis of Respiratory Disease. Q Hamid S Shannon and J Martin eds. Hamilton Ontario BC Decker 2005 BARNES P J. Modulation of neurotransmission in airways. Physiol Rev 1992 72 699 729 .

The afferent parasympathetic nerve fibers are typically subclassified as low threshold mechanosensors and nociceptive like fibers slow conducting capsaicin sensitive bronchopulmonary C fibers . The low threshold mechanosensors can be further subclassified as slowly SAR and rapidly RAR adapting stretch receptors. Less populous receptor types e.g. those that respond particularly to punctate mechanical stimulation or rapid changes in pH also exist Michael J. CARR and Bradley J. Undem. Bronchopulmonary afferent nerves. Respirology 8 2003 291 301 Thomas TAYLOR CLARK and Bradley J. Undem. Transduction mechanisms in airway sensory nerves. J Appl Physiol 101 2006 950 959 Giuseppe Sant AMBROGIO. Nervous receptors of the tracheobronchial tree. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 49 1987 611 627 .

SARs lie in close association with airway smooth muscle and respond to stretch of the airway wall. Some fire throughout the respiratory cycle and others burst in response to lung inflation with progressive increases in discharge rate as a function of lung volume.

RARs are found throughout the tracheobronchial tree primarily in and under the epithelium and in close approximation to bronchial venules. They are exquisitely sensitive to mechanical stimuli and respond with a rapidly adapting discharge to large and rapid lung inflations and deflations. RARs are also stimulated or sensitized by intraluminal chemical irritants smoke dust and environmental toxins. Because of the latter properties they are also known as irritant receptors.

Bronchial C fiber receptors which are innervated by nonmyelinated vagal afferent fibers lie in the walls of the conducting airways. Their endings extend into the space between epithelial cells or form a plexus immediately beneath the basement membrane. The nociceptive nerves are more responsive to chemical mediators than the stretch sensitive RAR and SAR fibers e.g. nicotine acids histamine serotonin bradykinin and other mediators of inflammation . The C fibers are often referred to as polymodal fibers because they respond to a broad range of stimuli. Activation of sensory C fiber receptors in the airways mucosa sets up axon reflexes with release of sensory neuropeptides. These neuropeptides cause vasodilatation possibly with edema and plasma exudation submucosal gland secretion structural and functional changes in the epithelium and possibly airway smooth muscle contraction M.

The majority of afferent parasympathetic innervation to the lower airways is carried by the vagus nerves See . The vagal afferent nerve fibers arise from cell bodies located in the vagal sensory ganglia. These ganglia take the form of swellings found in the cervical aspect of the vagus nerve just caudal to the skull. There are two such ganglia termed the inferior and superior vagal ganglia. They are also called the nodose and jugular ganglia respectively See . The jugular superior ganglion is a small ganglion on the vagus nerve just as it passes through the jugular foramen at the base of the skull. The nodose inferior ganglion is a ganglion on the vagus nerve located in the height of the transverse process of the first cervical vertebra.

Terminations of each group of fibers SAR RAR and C are found in largely non overlapping regions of the nucleus of the solitary tract NTS See . Second order neurons in the pathways from these receptors innervate neurons located in respiratory related regions of the medulla pons and spinal cord. Those pathways control not only the bronchiole structures shown in but also the rate and depth of respiration and cardiopulmonary activity more generally Leszek KUBIN George F. Alheid Edward J. Zuperku and Donald R. McCrimmon. Central pathways of pulmonary and lower airway vagal afferents. J Appl Physiol 101 2006 618 627 Jeffrey C. SMITH Ana P. L. Abdala Ilya A. Rybak and Julian F. R. Paton. Structural and functional architecture of respiratory networks in the mammalian brainstem. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 364 2009 2577 2587 .

Both afferent and efferent parasympathetic fibers traverse or skirt the nodose and jugular ganglia See . With regard to the efferent parasympathetic fibers which send control signals back to the bronchioles preganglionic motor fibers ganglionic branches from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the special visceral efferents from the nucleus ambiguus descend to the nodose inferior vagal ganglion and form a band that skirts the ganglion. Thus signals that are processed in the nucleus of the solitary tract NTS are sent to airway related vagal preganglionic neurons AVPNs located in the most rostral parts of the dorsal vagal nucleus and in the rostral nucleus ambiguus. From these preganglionic neurons cholinergic outflow is sent via descending efferent intramural parasympathetic ganglia and then to tracheobronchial effector systems. In particular postganglionic efferent cholinergic fibers profusely innervate the smooth muscle and the submucosal glands . In humans there is comparatively little innervation of the airway epithelium airway blood vessels or lamina propria . Because the lamina propria is poorly innervated by efferent parasympathetic nerves in humans cells of inflammatory and immune systems that are contained therein such as macrophages may receive little direct control there from those efferent nerves although such control may be more significant in non human species CZURA C J Tracey K J. Autonomic neural regulation of immunity. J Intern Med 257 2 2005 156 66 .

The acetylcholine that is released from the preganglionic and postganglionic nerve fibers acts on target cell membranes through muscarinic receptors including M2 and M3. The M3 receptors are found on bronchial airway smooth muscle and submucosal glands causing smooth muscle contraction and secretion when activated. Thus contraction of airway smooth muscle is mediated by acetylcholine induced activation of M3 receptors which couple to the heterotrimeric G protein Gq 11 resulting in stimulation of phospholipase C and an increase in intracellular calcium. M3 receptors are also possibly found on endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle . M2 receptors are also found on airway smooth muscle and submucosal glands. However M2 activation by acetylcholine does not cause smooth muscle contraction but instead antagonizes smooth muscle relaxation that is induced by beta adrenoceptors see below . Thus activation of M2 receptors inhibits the generation and accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate cAMP thereby preventing bronchodilation. Other mechanisms may also modulate the contraction of the smooth muscle cells. For example histamine that is released from activated mast cells may also cause bronchoconstriction. This is because H1 receptors are located in human bronchial muscle and are linked to transduction systems that cause increased intracellular Ca2 which leads to muscle contraction.

The M2 receptors also play a significant role in the endings of the nerve fibers that transmit acetylcholine across the neuromuscular junction. M2 receptors in those fibers self limit the transmission of acetylcholine i.e. some of the transmitted acetylcholine activates those M2 receptors so as to then inhibit that same transmission. When this feedback inhibition becomes dysfunctional excessive acetylcholine is transmitted to the smooth muscle leading to hyper responsiveness to allergens and excessive bronchoconstriction. Allergen induced M2 receptor dysfunction is dependent upon selective recruitment of eosinophils to the airway nerves. Activated eosinophils release major basic protein which binds to M2 receptors and prevents binding of acetylcholine. The binding of a virus may also affect the structure of the M2

Proc Am Thorac Soc 2 4 2005 297 304 .

Noncholinergic parasympathetic nerves also innervate the airways. Noncholinergic parasympathetic transmitters are not co released with acetylcholine from a single population of postganglionic parasympathetic nerves. Instead an anatomically and functionally distinct parasympathetic pathway regulates nonadrenergic noncholinergic relaxations of airway smooth muscle. The preganglionic nerves innervating airway noncholinergic parasympathetic ganglia may be unmyelinated and may originate from a distinct location in nucleus ambiguus or may be derived from the dorsal motor nuclei of the vagus nerves See . Unlike cholinergic contractions of the airway smooth muscle which can reach a near maximum within about 30 seconds and can nearly completely reverse at the same rate noncholinergic parasympathetic nerve mediated relaxations are both slow in onset and reversal requiring several minutes to reach equilibrium.

Noncholinergic parasympathetic neurotransmitters include the vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP the peptide pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide PACAP peptide histidine isoleucine peptide histidine methionine and nitric oxide NO . Fibers with those neurotramsmitters are primarily under parasympathetic control although sympathetic nerves in the airways have also been shown to include such fibers MATSUMOTO K Aizawa H Takata S Inoue H Takahashi N Hara N. Nitric oxide derived from sympathetic nerves regulates airway responsiveness to histamine in guinea pigs. J Appl Physiol 83 5 1997 1432 1437 . Both VIP and NO synthase have been localized to nerve fibers innervating airway smooth muscle and to parasympathetic ganglia in the airways. Because such non adrenergic non cholinergic nerve fibers inhibit activities such as smooth muscle contraction they are known as iNANC fibers. Excitatory non adrenergic non cholinergic eNANC nerve fibers also exist. Responses to those fibers are mediated by the release of tachykinins such as substance P. In the presence of muscarinic blockade vagal stimulation causes dilatation of preconstricted airways via noncholinergic neurotransmitters demonstrating the dominance or overabundance of iNANC fibers relative to eNANC fibers.

It should be noted that a number of nonbronchiolar afferent nerve subtypes may also induce a withdrawal of cholinergic tone including baroreceptors skeletal muscle and diaphragmatic afferents and pulmonary stretch receptors some of which are also conveyed by the vagus nerve. These disparate afferent inputs may be simultaneously recruited for example during exercise. It should also be noted that although shows a reflex loop involving afferent and efferent nerve fibers sending signals from and to a single bronchiole in reality signals from the afferent fibers emanating from one bronchiole may result in efferent signals that are sent to another bronchiole. This is particularly important as it relates to the cooperative behavior of smooth muscle throughout the airways as described later in connection with avalanches of bronchoconstriction and bronchodilation.

Turning now to control of the airways by the sympathetic nervous system it is known that some sympathetic pulmonary afferent nerves exist. However unlike the well characterized parasympathetic afferent nerve fibers described above the sympathetic afferent fibers have been described only as capsaicin sensitive substance P containing spinal afferent neurons in the upper thoracic T1 T4 dorsal root ganglia DRG that innervate the airways and lung KOSTREVA D R Zuperku E J Hess G L Coon R L Kampine J P.

With regard to the efferent sympathetic nerves human airway smooth muscle is largely devoid of sympathetic adrenergic efferent innervation in contrast to some other mammals with relatively few fibers reaching the level of secondary bronchi and terminal bronchioles. Nevertheless some sympathetic fibers do innervate the glands vasculature and parasympathetic ganglia of the human bronchial tree. Furthermore recent evidence has suggested asthma patients do have such sympathetic innervations within the bronchial smooth muscle. Alpha adrenergic receptors are localized on pulmonary and bronchial blood vessels bronchial epithelial cells submucosal glands in parasympathetic ganglia and on cholinergic and C afferent nerve fibers where limited sympathetic innervation may occur. Beta adrenergic receptors are numerous on airway smooth muscle despite a lack of significant sympathetic innervation there the significance of which is that beta adrenergic control may be via circulating catecholamines rather than by the release of neurotransmitters from local nerve fibers.

In fact the most significant parts of the sympathetic nervous system in regards to control of the airways may be within the parasympathetic ganglia and in the adrenal medulla. Postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers intermingle with cholinergic nerves in parasympathetic ganglia where sympathetic fibers may modulate cholinergic neurotransmission Allen C MYERS.

BAKER D. G. Basbaum C. B. Herbert D. A. Mitchell R. A. Transmission in airway ganglia of ferrets Inhibition by norepinephrine. Neurosci. Lett. 41 1983 139 43 Richardson J and Beland J. Nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system in human airways. J Appl Physiol 41 764 771 1976 . shows fibers emanating from sympathetic ganglia that impinge upon the parasympathetic ganglia. Some of those fibers may terminate in the parasympathetic ganglia to modulate the parasympathetic fibers that reach the bronchi and a small number of the sympathetic fibers may actually pass through or near the parasympathetic ganglia to reach the bronchi.

Epinephrine acts as a circulating hormone to participate in the regulation of bronchomotor tone through the stimulation of beta 2 receptors. Beta adrenergic receptors are numerous on airway smooth muscle and their stimulation by circulating catecholamines produces bronchodilatation. Epinephrine is derived mostly from the adrenal medulla which is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system See . The cells of the adrenal medulla are innervated directly by fibers from intermediolateral nucleus IML in the thoracic spinal cord from T5 T11 . Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers the adrenal medulla can be considered to be a specialized sympathetic ganglion. It is ordinarily only during strenuous exercise that epinephrine concentrations are raised sufficiently to cause significant bronchodilation e.g. to counteract bronchospasm that is induced by exercise in asthma BERKIN K E Inglis G C Ball S G et al. Airway responses to low concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline in normal subjects. Q J Exp Physiol 70 1985 203 209 Neil C THOMSON Kenneth D Dagg Scott G Ramsay. Humoral control of airway tone. Thorax 51 1996 461 464 . Repeated stimulation of some vagus nerve fibers may cause the repeated pulsatile systemic release of epinephrine and or other catecholamies leading eventually to circulating steady state concentrations of catecholamines that are determined by the stimulation frequency as well as the half life of circulating catecholamines.

The preceding paragraphs describe the efferent and afferent nerve fibers that respectively send signals to and from the bronchi and bronchioles. The paragraphs that follow describe the processing of the afferent sensory signals within the central nervous system to produce the efferent controlling signals see . The neurons of this central respiratory network drive two functionally and anatomically distinct pools of motoneurons. Both groups have to be precisely coordinated to ensure efficient ventilation. One set located within the spinal cord innervates the diaphragm and intercostal muscles that force air into the lungs. A second group of motoneurons with which this discussion is primarily concerned is located within the nucleus ambiguus and to a lesser extent within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The latter group projects via the vagus nerve to coordinate the activity of laryngeal and bronchial muscle so as to control airway resistance and airflow.

The relevant interconnected centers shown in are located in the medulla nucleus tractus solitarius nucleus ambiguus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus rostral ventral lateral medulla rostral ventral medial medulla medullary raphe nuclei the pons midbrain periaqueducatal gray locus ceruleus raphe nuclei e.g. dorsal the diencephalon hypothalamic nuclei particularly the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the telencephalon amygdala and its connections to the brain cortex .

Consider first the input to the central pathways. Vagal afferents traverse the brainstem in the solitary tract with some eighty percent of the terminating synapses being located in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius NTS . The NTS projects to a wide variety of structures as shown in including the amygdala raphe nuclei periaqueductal gray nucleus ambiguus and the hypothalamus. The NTS also projects to the parabrachial nucleus which in turn projects to the hypothalamus the thalamus the amygdala the anterior insular and infralimbic cortex lateral prefrontal cortex and other cortical regions.

A subset of NTS neurons receiving afferent input from SARs termed pump or P cells mediates the Breuer Hering reflexes and inhibits neurons receiving afferent input from RARs. Those reflexes are related to the control of spontaneous breathing rate and depth especially in children and exercising adults and they are also related to respiratory sinus arrhythmia in which the heart rate is modulated by the respiratory rate and depth.

P cells and second order neurons in the RAR pathway provide inputs to regions of the ventrolateral medulla involved in control of respiratory motor pattern. The core circuit components that constitute the neural machinery for generating respiratory rhythm and shaping inspiratory and expiratory motor patterns are distributed among three adjacent structural compartments in the ventrolateral medulla the Botzinger complex pre Botzinger complex and rostral ventral respiratory group.

Axon collaterals from both P cells and RAR interneurons and likely from NTS interneurons in the C fiber pathway project to the para brachial pontine region where they may contribute to plasticity in respiratory control as well as integration of respiratory control with other systems including those that provide for voluntary control of breathing sleep wake behavior and emotions.

Consider now the output from the central pathways. Airway related vagal preganglionic neurons AVPNs are the final common pathway from the central nervous system to the airways and transmit signals to the intrinsic bronchial ganglia that are part of the network for automatic feedback control. In most mammals the motor preganglionic component of the network innervating the airways arises mainly from the nucleus ambiguus and to a lesser extent from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus DMV . Of these two groups of neurons AVPNs within the rostral nucleus ambiguus play a greater role in generating cholinergic outflow to airway smooth muscle.

Acetylcholine release at the bronchial smooth muscle is triggered by the activation of AVPNs resulting in bronchoconstriction. Such activation of AVPNs is typically triggered by vagal C fibers via the activation of the NTS wherein glutamate is released into the AVPNs. This C fiber activation may be in response to irritants allergens trauma or idiopathic mechanisms associated with hypersensitivity. The activation may also be via A delta fibers whose cell bodies reside in the jugular ganglia which like the C fibers resemble the nociceptive fibers of the somatosensory system in that they have relatively high thresholds to mechanical stimuli and respond to classic nociceptive fiber selective stimuli such as capsaicin and bradykinin Michael J. CARR and Bradley J. Undem. Bronchopulmonary afferent nerves. Respirology 8 2003 291 301 .

Thus the simplest feedback loop shown in is one in which signals from afferent fibers to the NTS result in subsequent direct activation of the AVPNs by the NTS resulting in a level of broncho constriction that is a function of the magnitude of the C or jugular A delta fiber activation. It is understood that this level of constriction is largely a balance between the effects of cholinergic stimulation iNANC relaxation and relaxation due to circulating catecholamines. Mechanistically the preganglionic nerves innervating airway noncholinergic parasympathetic ganglia may originate from a distinct location in nucleus ambiguus or may be derived from the dorsal motor nuclei of the vagus nerves dmnX .

However AVPNs receive connections from multiple sites within the brain not just the NTS and these additional connections may inhibit glutamate mediated activation of the AVPNs. Such additional connections have been demonstrated by retrograde transneuronal labeling with pseudorabies virus in C8 cord transected rats. They include connections of the AVPNs to the amygdala hypothalamus periaqueductal grey matter of the midbrain PAG locus ceruleus and raphe nuclei see HADZIEFENDIC S Haxhiu M A.

Thus the response of the AVPNs to excitatory inputs also depends on the inhibitory inflow to the AVPNs. Many inhibitory cell groups projecting to the AVPNs are linked to the hypothalamus and a function of those projections is related in part to the control of respiration during sleep maintenance of attention motivation and arousal states Musa A. HAXHIU Serdia O. Mack Christopher G. Wilson Pingfu Feng and Kingman P. Strohl. Sleep networks and the anatomic and physiologic connections with respiratory control. Frontiers in Bioscience 8 2003 d946 962 . When activated GABA and galaninergic cells inhibit histamine containing neurons of the tuberomamillary nucleus TMN and the orexin producing cells of the lateral hypothalamic area LHA . This inhibition causes withdrawal of excitatory inputs from TMN and LHA neurons to serotonin 5 HT expressing cells of raphe nuclei RN and the locus coeruleus LC norepinephrine synthesizing cells. In addition activation of neurons within the ventrolateral preoptic area directly inhibits LC and RN neurons as well as GABA containing cells of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray PAG which project to AVPNs. Stimulation of the LC noradrenergic cell group and activation of parabrachial nucleus is known induce centrally mediated airway smooth muscle relaxation Michele BAROFFIO Giovanni Barisione Emanuele Crimi and Vito Brusasco.

Thus acting in opposition to glutamate mediated and possibly substance P activation of the AVPNs by the NTS are GABA and or serotonin and or norepinephrine from the periaqueductal gray raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus respectively. As shown in control of the inhibitory influence by the PAC LC and RN on the AVPNs may be exerted directly at sites within the nucleus ambiguus or dorsal motor nucleus. The inhibitory influence may also be on the nucleus tractus solitarius NTS which is connected bidirectionally to these centers. Thus the inhibition may decrease the activation of the AVPNs by the NTS rather than simply inhibiting an already existing activation of the AVPNs by the NTS. Alternatively the inhibitory influence on the NTS may occur indirectly via the hypothalamus owing to bidirectional connections between the NTS and hypothalamus.

The activation of inhibitory circuits in the periaqueductal gray raphe nucei and locus coeruleus by the hypothalamus or NTS may also cause circuits connecting each of these structures to modulate one another. Thus the periaqueductal gray communicates with the raphe nuclei and with the locus coeruleus and the locus coeruleus communicates with the raphe nuclei as shown in PUDOVKINA O L Cremers T I Westerink B H.

Another structure also has a significant influence on AVPN activity namely the amygdala. The prefrontal cortex innervates the amygdala which projects to multiple targets regulating autonomic functions including the PAG the NTS and the nucleus ambiguus. Projections from the amygdala to the PAG are significant because the PAG neurons coordinate functions of multiple visceral organs involved in responses to stress including those involving the airway. The effects of amygdala activity transmitted via the PAG to the AVPNs may be inhibitory or stimulatory depending upon whether the patient is experiencing active or passive coping responses. As shown in such control of AVPN activity via the amygdala may be modulated by connections to the NTS either directly or via the hypothalamus.

Finally consider central modulation of the airways via the sympathetic nervous system. Only a limited number of discrete regions within the supraspinal central nervous system project to sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the intermediolateral column see . The most important of these regions are the rostral ventral lateral medulla RVLM the rostral ventromedial medulla RVMM the midline raphe the paraventricular nucleus PVN of the hypothalamus the medullocervical caudal pressor area mCPA and the A5 cell group of the pons. The first four of these connections to the intermediolateral nucleus are shown in STRACK A M Sawyer W B Hughes J H Platt K B Loewy A D. A general pattern of CNS innervation of the sympathetic outflow demonstrated by transneuronal pseudorabies viral infections. Brain Res. 491 1 1989 156 162 .

The rostral ventral lateral medulla RVLM is the primary regulator of the sympathetic nervous system sending excitatory fibers glutamatergic to the sympathetic preganglionic neurons located in the intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord. Afferents affecting cardiopulmonary function synapse in the NTS and their projections reach the RVLM via the caudal ventrolateral medulla. However resting sympathetic tone also comes from sources above the pons from hypothalamic nuclei various hindbrain and midbrain structures as well as the forebrain and cerebellum which synapse in the RVLM. Only the hypothalamic projection to the RVLM is shown in KC P Dick T E. Modulation of cardiorespiratory function mediated by the paraventricular nucleus. Respir Physiol Neurobiol 174 1 2 2010 55 64 .

The RVLM shares its role as a primary regulator of the sympathetic nervous system with the rostral ventromedial medulla RVMM and medullary raphe. Differences in function between the RVLM versus RVMM medullary raphe have been elucidated in the case of cardiovascular control. In that case barosensitive sympathetic efferents appear to be regulated primarily through the RVLM whereas the cutaneous circulation is regulated predominantly through the RVMM and medullary raphe. In the case of respiratory control less is known although it is thought that nociceptive sympathetic efferents are regulated through the RVMM and serotonin containing medullary raphe. Differential control of the RVLM by the hypothalamus may also occur via circulating hormones such as vasopressin. The RVMM contains at least three populations of nitric oxide synthase neurons that send axons to innervate functionally similar sites in the NTS and nucleus ambiguus. Circuits connecting the RVMM and RVLM may be secondary via the NTS and hypothalamus Paul M. PILOWSKY Mandy S. Y. Lung Darko Spirovski and Simon McMullan.

Accordingly the present invention considers bronchiole segments to be oscillators in which a mathematical variable corresponding to each bronchiole segment represents the time varying radius of a bronchiole lumen relative to a value representing a time averaged radius of that bronchiole. Because segments of the bronchial tree are fluctuating according to the invention the oscillating branches collectively give rise to fluctuations in overall respiratory impedance. It is thought that an asthma attack or other bronchoconstrictive exacerbation may correspond to an avalanche of airway constrictions in which the constriction in one bronchiole segment increases the likelihood that another bronchiole branch in the same tree structure of the lung will constrict. The mechanisms linking one bronchiole segment to another include the shared airflow in the lumens that connect one bronchiole to another and neural connections to multiple bronchioles. As a result of the interconnected bronchiole fluctuations some initial heterogeneity of airway constriction within different regions of the lung which might seem to be of little physiological consequence may actually become amplified by avalanches of airway constrictions such that eventually large heterogeneous regions of the lung become unavailable for normal respiration.

Models have been constructed to explain such heterogeneity and avalanches of closure and of reopening but they have been used only to assess the risk of an asthma attack rather than to explain or predict the actual occurrence of an asthma attack. A model of lung dynamics that is disclosed towards the end of this application is intended to make such a prediction for use in a feedforward controller. It does so by making oscillation of any one bronchiole oscillator be a function of the state of other bronchiole oscillators as well as a function of external conditions such as the presence of inhaled irritants and the accumulated effects of electrical stimulation of a vagus nerve. In one aspect of the present invention the stimulation of a vagus nerve randomizes e.g. through the quasi random stimulation of individual fibers within the vagus nerve afferent neural signals sent to the central nervous system thereby resetting the phase relations between bronchiole oscillators and consequently allowing for an avalanche type reopening of bronchioles within regions of the lung that had been poorly ventilated or for an inhibition of an avalanche type bronchiolar closing. Quasi random stimulation of efferent fibers by VNS may also be involved in such avalanche type reopening ALENCAR A M Arold S P Buldyrev S V Majumdar A Stamenovic D Stanley H E Suki B.

Mention was made above of a phase resetting mechanism wherein stimulation of the vagus nerve blocks a bronchial closing avalanche or promotes a re opening bronchial avalanche. In view of the foregoing discussion of ways in which the vagus nerve can affect the bronchi a large number of additional physiological mechanisms can be envisaged many of which are not mutually exclusive. Depending on the details of the stimulation waveform and stimulation devices the vagal nerve stimulation may stimulate block or otherwise modulate particular types of nerve fibers within the vagus nerve e.g. afferent vs. efferent nerve fiber types A B and or C parasympathetic or sympathetic etc. . The stimulation may generate action potentials that propagate in orthodromal or in antidromal directions. More particular mechanisms may also be envisaged. For example parasympathetic efferent cholinergic fibers could be blocked directly thereby inhibiting bronchoconstriction. Such inhibition could involve muscarinic receptors M2 or M3 or both. As another example the VNS could result in the stimulation of efferent iNANC nerve fibers that promote bronchodilation. Alternatively small numbers of sympathetic efferent fibers could directly cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle or fibers from sympathetic ganglia could stimulate parasympathetic ganglia thereby indirectly stimulating iNANC fibers to cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. Alternatively fibers from sympathetic ganglia could inhibit parasympathetic ganglia thereby inhibiting parasympathetic cholinergic fibers from constricting smooth muscle. Alternatively norepinephrine outflow from the sympathetic innervated pulmonary vasculature could promote bronchodilation or fibers from the interomediolateral nucleus could stimulate the adrenal gland producing circulating epinephrine that relaxes bronchial smooth muscle. Furthermore stimulation of the vagus nerve could directly inhibit the activation of the AVPNs by the nucleus tractus solitarius NTS . Alternatively the inhibitory influence on the NTS may occur indirectly via activation of the hypothalamus and or amygdala and or periaqueductal gray and or locus coeruleus and or raphe nuclei. Alternatively the inhibition may be the combined result of inhibitory and excitatory influences within the AVPNs the and influences shown in . According to this aspect of the invention noninvasive VNS with the disclosed devices activates pathways causing release of norepinephrine serotonin and or GABA inhibitory neurotransmitters onto the AVPNs thereby preventing or reducing the release of acetylcholine in the airways and resulting in bronchorelaxation. According to this view noninvasive VNS acts as a central specific airway anticholinergic but without any of the side effects of systemic anticholinergic therapy. In addition these same inhibitory neurotransmitters act on the mucous glands throughout the airway passages in the nose mouth throat and lungs of the patient. Therefore the noninvasive VNS taught by the present invention also serves to inhibit mucous production in these airway passages resulting in increased airflow throughout these passages. Thus the present invention can provide a dual benefit 1 an immediate reduction in acetylcholine release to the lungs providing an immediate within minutes or seconds bronchodilation effect for the patient and 2 a decrease in mucous production which provides a more gradual improvement of airflow to the patient. After providing a description of Applicant s nerve stimulating devices and methods the present disclosure will describe animal experiments that test some of these potential mechanisms.

Description of Applicant s Magnetic and Electrode Based Nerve Stimulating Modulating Devices Describing in Particular the Electrical Waveform that is Used to Stimulate a Vagus Nerve.

Although the magnetic stimulator coil is shown in to be a single coil in practice the coil may also comprise two or more distinct coils each of which is connected in series or in parallel to the impulse generator . Thus the coil that is shown in represents all the magnetic stimulator coils of the device collectively. In a preferred embodiment that is discussed below coil actually contains two coils that may be connected either in series or in parallel to the impulse generator .

The item labeled in as is a volume surrounding the coil that is filled with electrically conducting medium. As shown the medium not only encloses the magnetic stimulator coil but is also deformable such that it is form fitting when applied to the surface of the body. Thus the sinuousness or curvature shown at the outer surface of the electrically conducting medium corresponds also to sinuousness or curvature on the surface of the body against which the conducting medium is applied so as to make the medium and body surface contiguous. As time varying electrical current is passed through the coil a magnetic field is produced but because the coil winding is toroidal the magnetic field is spatially restricted to the interior of the toroid. An electric field and eddy currents are also produced. The electric field extends beyond the toroidal space and into the patient s body causing electrical currents and stimulation within the patient. The volume is electrically connected to the patient at a target skin surface in order to significantly reduce the current passed through the coil that is needed to accomplish stimulation of the patient s nerve or tissue. In a preferred embodiment of the magnetic stimulator that is discussed below the conducting medium with which the coil is in contact need not completely surround the toroid.

The design of the magnetic stimulator which is also adapted herein for use with surface electrodes makes it possible to shape the electric field that is used to selectively stimulate a relatively deep nerve such as a vagus nerve in the patient s neck. Furthermore the design produces significantly less pain or discomfort if any to a patient than stimulator devices that are currently known in the art. Conversely for a given amount of pain or discomfort on the part of the patient e.g. the threshold at which such discomfort or pain begins the design achieves a greater depth of penetration of the stimulus under the skin.

An alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown in which is a schematic diagram of an electrode based nerve stimulating modulating device for delivering impulses of energy to nerves for the treatment of medical conditions. As shown device may include an impulse generator a power source coupled to the impulse generator a control unit in communication with the impulse generator and coupled to the power source and electrodes coupled via wires to impulse generator . In a preferred embodiment the same impulse generator power source and control unit may be used for either the magnetic stimulator or the electrode based stimulator allowing the user to change parameter settings depending on whether coils or the electrodes are attached.

Although a pair of electrodes is shown in in practice the electrodes may also comprise three or more distinct electrode elements each of which is connected in series or in parallel to the impulse generator . Thus the electrodes that are shown in represent all electrodes of the device collectively.

The item labeled in as is a volume contiguous with an electrode that is filled with electrically conducting medium. As described below in connection with particular embodiments of the invention conducting medium in which the electrode is embedded need not completely surround an electrode. As also described below in connection with a preferred embodiment the volume is electrically connected to the patient at a target skin surface in order to shape the current density passed through an electrode that is needed to accomplish stimulation of the patient s nerve or tissue. The electrical connection to the patient s skin surface is through an interface . In one embodiment the interface is made of an electrically insulating dielectric material such as a thin sheet of Mylar. In that case electrical coupling of the stimulator to the patient is capacitive. In other embodiments the interface comprises electrically conducting material such as the electrically conducting medium itself or an electrically conducting or permeable membrane. In that case electrical coupling of the stimulator to the patient is ohmic. As shown the interface may be deformable such that it is form fitting when applied to the surface of the body. Thus the sinuousness or curvature shown at the outer surface of the interface corresponds also to sinuousness or curvature on the surface of the body against which the interface is applied so as to make the interface and body surface contiguous.

The control unit controls the impulse generator to generate a signal for each of the device s coils or electrodes. The signals are selected to be suitable for amelioration of a particular medical condition when the signals are applied non invasively to a target nerve or tissue via the coil or electrodes . It is noted that nerve stimulating modulating device or may be referred to by its function as a pulse generator. Patent application publications US2005 0075701 and US2005 0075702 both to SHAFER contain descriptions of pulse generators that may be applicable to the present invention. By way of example a pulse generator is also commercially available such as Agilent 33522A Function Arbitrary Waveform Generator Agilent Technologies Inc. 5301 Stevens Creek Blvd Santa Clara Calif. 95051.

The control unit may also comprise a general purpose computer comprising one or more CPU computer memories for the storage of executable computer programs including the system s operating system and the storage and retrieval of data disk storage devices communication devices such as serial and USB ports for accepting external signals from the system s keyboard and computer mouse as well as any externally supplied physiological signals see analog to digital converters for digitizing externally supplied analog signals see communication devices for the transmission and receipt of data to and from external devices such as printers and modems that comprise part of the system hardware for generating the display of information on monitors that comprise part of the system and busses to interconnect the above mentioned components. Thus the user may operate the system by typing instructions for the control unit at a device such as a keyboard and view the results on a device such as the system s computer monitor or direct the results to a printer modem and or storage disk. Control of the system may be based upon feedback measured from externally supplied physiological or environmental signals. Alternatively the control unit may have a compact and simple structure for example wherein the user may operate the system using only an on off switch and power control wheel or knob.

Parameters for the nerve or tissue stimulation include power level frequency and train duration or pulse number . The stimulation characteristics of each pulse such as depth of penetration strength and selectivity depend on the rise time and peak electrical energy transferred to the electrodes or coils as well as the spatial distribution of the electric field that is produced by the electrodes or coils. The rise time and peak energy are governed by the electrical characteristics of the stimulator and electrodes or coils as well as by the anatomy of the region of current flow within the patient. In one embodiment of the invention pulse parameters are set in such as way as to account for the detailed anatomy surrounding the nerve that is being stimulated Bartosz SAWICKI Robert Szmuro Przemysaw Ponecki Jacek Starzy ski Stanisaw Wincenciak Andrzej Rysz. Mathematical Modeling of Vagus Nerve Stimulation. pp. 92 97 in Krawczyk A. Electromagnetic Field Health and Environment Proceedings of EHE 07. Amsterdam 105 Press 2008 . Pulses may be monophasic biphasic or polyphasic. Embodiments of the invention include those that are fixed frequency where each pulse in a train has the same inter stimulus interval and those that have modulated frequency where the intervals between each pulse in a train can be varied.

In addition or as an alternative to the devices to implement the modulation unit for producing the electrical voltage current profile of the stimulating blocking and or modulating impulse to the electrodes or coils the device disclosed in patent publication No. US2005 0216062 may be employed. That patent publication discloses a multifunctional electrical stimulation ES system adapted to yield output signals for effecting electromagnetic or other forms of electrical stimulation for a broad spectrum of different biological and biomedical applications which produce an electric field pulse in order to non invasively stimulate nerves. The system includes an ES signal stage having a selector coupled to a plurality of different signal generators each producing a signal having a distinct shape such as a sine wave a square or a saw tooth wave or simple or complex pulse the parameters of which are adjustable in regard to amplitude duration repetition rate and other variables. Examples of the signals that may be generated by such a system are described in a publication by LIBOFF A. R. LIBOFF. Signal shapes in electromagnetic therapies a primer. pp. 17 37 in Bioelectromagnetic Medicine Paul J. Rosch and Marko S. Markov eds. . New York Marcel Dekker 2004 . The signal from the selected generator in the ES stage is fed to at least one output stage where it is processed to produce a high or low voltage or current output of a desired polarity whereby the output stage is capable of yielding an electrical stimulation signal appropriate for its intended application. Also included in the system is a measuring stage which measures and displays the electrical stimulation signal operating on the substance being treated as well as the outputs of various sensors which sense conditions prevailing in this substance whereby the user of the system can manually adjust it or have it automatically adjusted by feedback to provide an electrical stimulation signal of whatever type the user wishes who can then observe the effect of this signal on a substance being treated.

The stimulating blocking and or modulating impulse signal preferably has a frequency an amplitude a duty cycle a pulse width a pulse shape etc. selected to influence the therapeutic result namely stimulating blocking and or modulating some or all of the transmission of the selected nerve. For example the frequency may be about 1 Hz or greater such as between about 15 Hz to 50 Hz more preferably around 25 Hz. The modulation signal may have a pulse width selected to influence the therapeutic result such as about 1 microseconds to about 1000 microseconds. For example the electric field induced or produced by the device within tissue in the vicinity of a nerve may be about 5 to 600 V m preferably less than 100 V m and even more preferably less than 30 V m. The gradient of the electric field may be greater than 2 V m mm. More generally the stimulation device produces an electric field in the vicinity of the nerve that is sufficient to cause the nerve to depolarize and reach a threshold for action potential propagation which is approximately 8 V m at 1000 Hz. The modulation signal may have a peak voltage amplitude selected to influence the therapeutic result such as about 0.2 volts or greater such as about 0.2 volts to about 40 volts.

An objective of the disclosed stimulators is to provide both nerve fiber selectivity and spatial selectivity. Spatial selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the electrode or coil configuration and nerve fiber selectivity may be achieved in part through the design of the stimulus waveform but designs for the two types of selectivity are intertwined. This is because for example a waveform may selectively stimulate only one of two nerves whether they lie close to one another or not obviating the need to focus the stimulating signal onto only one of the nerves GRILL W and Mortimer J T. Stimulus waveforms for selective neural stimulation. IEEE Eng. Med. Biol. 14 1995 375 385 . These methods complement others that are used to achieve selective nerve stimulation such as the use of local anesthetic application of pressure inducement of ischemia cooling use of ultrasound graded increases in stimulus intensity exploiting the absolute refractory period of axons and the application of stimulus blocks John E. SWETT and Charles M. Bourassa. Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve. In Electrical Stimulation Research Techniques Michael M. Patterson and Raymond P. Kesner eds. Academic Press. New York 1981 pp. 243 295 .

To date the selection of stimulation waveform parameters for nerve stimulation has been highly empirical in which the parameters are varied about some initially successful set of parameters in an effort to find an improved set of parameters for each patient. A more efficient approach to selecting stimulation parameters might be to select a stimulation waveform that mimics electrical activity in the anatomical regions that one is attempting stimulate indirectly in an effort to entrain the naturally occurring electrical waveform as suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 6 234 953 entitled Electrotherapy device using low frequency magnetic pulses to THOMAS et al. and application number US20090299435 entitled Systems and methods for enhancing or affecting neural stimulation efficiency and or efficacy to GLINER et al. One may also vary stimulation parameters iteratively in search of an optimal setting U.S. Pat. No. 7 869 885 entitled Threshold optimization for tissue stimulation therapy to BEGNAUD et al . However some stimulation waveforms such as those described herein are discovered by trial and error and then deliberately improved upon.

Invasive nerve stimulation typically uses square wave pulse signals. However Applicant found that square waveforms are not ideal for non invasive stimulation as they produce excessive pain. Prepulses and similar waveform modifications have been suggested as methods to improve selectivity of nerve stimulation waveforms but Applicant did not find them ideal Aleksandra VUCKOVIC Marco Tosato and Johannes J Struijk.

As seen there individual sinusoidal pulses have a period of and a burst consists of N such pulses. This is followed by a period with no signal the inter burst period . The pattern of a burst followed by silent inter burst period repeats itself with a period of T. For example the sinusoidal period may be 200 microseconds the number of pulses per burst may be N 5 and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter burst period may have a period of T 40000 microseconds which is comparable to 25 Hz stimulation a much smaller value of T is shown in to make the bursts discernable . When these exemplary values are used for T and the waveform contains significant Fourier components at higher frequencies 1 200 microseconds 5000 sec as compared with those contained in transcutaneous nerve stimulation waveforms as currently practiced.

Applicant is unaware of such a waveform having been used with vagus nerve stimulation but a similar waveform has been used to stimulate muscle as a means of increasing muscle strength in elite athletes. However for the muscle strengthening application the currents used 200 mA may be very painful and two orders of magnitude larger than what are disclosed herein. Furthermore the signal used for muscle strengthening may be other than sinusoidal e.g. triangular and the parameters N and T may also be dissimilar from the values exemplified above A. DELITTO M.

High frequency electrical stimulation is also known in the treatment of back pain at the spine Patent application US20120197369 entitled Selective high frequency spinal cord modulation for inhibiting pain with reduced side effects and associated systems and methods to ALATARIS et al.

Those methods involve high frequency modulation in the range of from about 1.5 KHz to about 50 KHz which is applied to the patient s spinal cord region. However such methods are different from the present invention because for example they are invasive they do not involve a bursting waveform as in the present invention they necessarily involve A delta and C nerve fibers and the pain that those fibers produce whereas the present invention does not they may involve a conduction block applied at the dorsal root level whereas the present invention may stimulate action potentials without blocking of such action potentials and or they involve an increased ability of high frequency modulation to penetrate through the cerebral spinal fluid which is not relevant to the present invention. In fact a likely explanation for the reduced back pain that is produced by their use of frequencies from 10 to 50 KHz is that the applied electrical stimulus at those frequencies causes permanent damage to the pain causing nerves whereas the present invention involves only reversible effects LEE R C Zhang D Hannig J. Biophysical injury mechanisms in electrical shock trauma. Annu Rev Biomed Eng 2 2000 477 509 .

The use of feedback to generate the modulation signal may result in a signal that is not periodic particularly if the feedback is produced from sensors that measure naturally occurring time varying aperiodic physiological signals from the patient see . In fact the absence of significant fluctuation in naturally occurring physiological signals from a patient is ordinarily considered to be an indication that the patient is in ill health. This is because a pathological control system that regulates the patient s physiological variables may have become trapped around only one of two or more possible steady states and is therefore unable to respond normally to external and internal stresses. Accordingly even if feedback is not used to generate the modulation signal it may be useful to artificially modulate the signal in an aperiodic fashion in such a way as to simulate fluctuations that would occur naturally in a healthy individual. Thus the noisy modulation of the stimulation signal may cause a pathological physiological control system to be reset or undergo a non linear phase transition through a mechanism known as stochastic resonance. In normal respiratory physiology sighing at irregular intervals is thought to bring about such a resetting of the respiratory control system. Experimentally noisy artificial ventilation may increase respiration B. SUKI A. Alencar M. K. Sujeer K. R. Lutchen J. J. Collins J. S. Andrade E. P. Ingenito S. Zapperi H. E.

So in one embodiment of the present invention the modulation signal with or without feedback will stimulate the selected nerve fibers in such a way that one or more of the stimulation parameters power frequency and others mentioned herein are varied by sampling a statistical distribution having a mean corresponding to a selected or to a most recent running averaged value of the parameter and then setting the value of the parameter to the randomly sampled value. The sampled statistical distributions will comprise Gaussian and 1 f obtained from recorded naturally occurring random time series or by calculated formula. Parameter values will be so changed periodically or at time intervals that are themselves selected randomly by sampling another statistical distribution having a selected mean and coefficient of variation where the sampled distributions comprise Gaussian and exponential obtained from recorded naturally occurring random time series or by calculated formula.

In another embodiment devices in accordance with the present invention are provided in a pacemaker type form in which electrical impulses are generated to a selected region of the nerve by a stimulator device on an intermittent basis to create in the patient a lower reactivity of the nerve.

Applicant s Animal Experiments Demonstrating that the Disclosed Stimulation Waveform and Devices Bring about Bronchodilation by Particular Physiological Mechanisms

Applicant performed animal experiments using invasive methods in an attempt to 1 demonstrate that it is in fact possible to stimulate the vagus nerve to produce bronchodilation without first producing bronchoconstriction and 2 elucidate physiological mechanisms that may explain such bronchodilation. Such animal experiments were then performed using noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation as now described.

Inhibition of Histamine Induced Bronchoconstriction in Guinea Pig and Swine by Pulsed Electrical Vagal Nerve Stimulation

A first set of experiments was performed to determine whether applying a low voltage electrical signal to the vagus nerve could reduce histamine induced bronchoconstriction in swine and guinea pigs. Sixteen guinea pigs were anesthetized and had bipolar electrodes positioned on the cervical vagus nerves. Intravenous histamine was titrated to elicit a moderate increase in pulmonary inflation pressure Ppi . Histamine was then administered with or without concurrent vagus nerve stimulation VNS .

The results are illustrated in . In an animal s airway pressure is shown as a function of time and at intervals shown there bronchoconstriction was induced using a brief histamine challenge. With histamine alone as the intervention the challenge is seen to produce significant increases of airway pressure but when the challenge is performed in combination with stimulation of the vagus nerve VNS according to the present invention a significantly smaller increase of airway pressure is observed. shows the results of a succession of such challenges in a single animal. As seen there the magnitude of the increase is variable but a challenge that includes VNS almost invariably results in a smaller increase in airway pressure than a challenge with histamine alone. Results like those shown in are shown in for sixteen animals. As seen there the magnitude of the air pressure increase varies from animal to animal but almost invariably when VNS is included with the challenge the result is a smaller increase in airway pressure than a challenge with histamine alone. In general VNS reduced the peak change in Ppi following a histamine challenge by approximately 60 .

Similar results were confirmed in a study in swine demonstrating that the VNS procedure is applicable to larger animals as well. These studies suggest that VNS can reduce bronchoconstriction and may prove useful as a therapy in the treatment of reactive airway disease HOFFMANN T. J. Mendez S. Staats P. Emala C. W. Guo P.

Low Voltage Vagal Nerve Stimulation Reduces Bronchoconstriction in Guinea Pigs Through Catecholamine Release.

A second set of experiments was performed to evaluate the mechanism of action by which VNS reduces bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs. Under IACUC approved protocols male Hartley guinea pigs were anesthetized with urethane and ventilated by tracheostomy. Bronchoconstriction was induced via intravenous histamine or acetylcholine with or without simultaneous bilateral VNS at 25 Hz 200 ms 1 3 V. Airway pressure recordings that are similar to those shown in were made. Low voltage VNS was found to attenuate histamine induced bronchoconstriction 4.4 0.3 vs. 3.2 0.2 cm H2O p

Blockade of nitric oxide synthesis by pretreatment with L NAME a primary mediator of inhibitory non adrenergic non cholinergic iNANC bronchodilator pathways had little or no effect on VNS mediated attenuation of bronchoconstriction. Sympathetic nerve depletion with guanethidine also had little or no effect on VNS mediated attenuation of bronchoconstriction. However pretreatment with propranolol did reversibly blocked the effect. As shown in without pretreatment with propranolol the effect of VNS at the indicated times was to reduce the magnitude of bronchoconstriction produced by histamine H that was administered at the indicated times. However when propranolol was administered as a pretreatment as shown in the VNS mediated attenuation of bronchoconstriction was blocked.

Ligating both cephalic vagus nerves caudal to the stimulating electrodes did not block VNS mediated attenuation of bronchoconstriction but ligating the vagus nerves between the electrodes and head did block the attenuation of bronchoconstriction as compared with the situation prior to ligation . These unexpected findings suggest that VNS could inhibit bronchoconstriction through a purely afferent vagus pathway but not a purely efferent vagus pathway. We also found that low voltage VNS increased circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine. These results indicate that low voltage VNS attenuates histamine induced bronchoconstriction via activation of afferent nerves in part by producing a systemic increase in catecholamines likely arising from the adrenal medulla. Furthermore we tested whether the attenuation by VNS of histamine induced increases in Ppi was mediated by direct efferent stimulation of sympathetic nerve fibers traveling within the cervical vagus nerve or by stimulation of parasympathetic iNANC nerves in the guinea pig lung. Our results rule out both of these possibilities since ligation of the vagal nerve caudal to the electrodes did not eliminate the bronchoprotection afforded by low voltage VNS. Moreover pretreatment with guanethidine or L NAME to block norepinephrine or nitric oxide release from sympathetic or iNANC nerves respectively did not block the bronchoprotection afforded by low voltage VNS. Although we demonstrated that the VNS mediated attenuation of bronchoconstriction involves the participation of vagal afferent nerves and therefore the central nervous system and that sympathetic non vagal efferent pathways were also implicated in the mechanisms the design of the experiments was such that efferent signals sent from the central nervous system to the lungs via the vagus nerve other than those involving sympathetic or iNANC nerves were not investigated separately. In that regard we can conclude only that VNS stimulation between a ligated vagus nerve and the lung did not attenuate bronchoconstriction with the understanding that such a ligated nerve is not conveying signals to the lung from the central nervous system.

To ensure that the dissection and placement of the stimulation leads direct to the vagus nerve had not damaged the nerve the amplitude of the applied signal was increased significantly beyond the anticipated therapeutic level until the classic vaso vagal responses of bradycardia and bronchoconstriction were observed. We found that in the guinea pig model stimulation of efferent C fibers causing both bradycardia and bronchoconstriction could only be achieved at voltages 10 20 greater than those that were used to inhibit bronchoconstriction HOFFMANN T.

These preliminary animal data indicate that VNS activates afferent nerves and may act through a sympathetic reflex pathway to mediate bronchodilation. Thus we found that bronchodilation resulting from stimulation of the vagus nerve works by causing the systemic release of the natural endogenous agonists epinephrine and norepinephrine. These catecholamines can reach the constricted bronchial smooth muscle through an internal systemic pathway thereby overcoming any potential problems with inhaled agonists for example due to mucus congestion. The electrical field delivered to the vagus nerve was optimized to stimulate the release of these hormones into the circulation at concentrations that produce bronchial smooth muscle relaxation but have little effect on heart rate or blood pressure. The data suggest that the release of these catecholamines is mediated by a parasympathetic afferent vagal signal to the brain which then triggers an efferent sympathetic signal to stimulate the release of catecholamines from the adrenal glands. These animal data show that the stimulator is effective even if the vagus nerve is tied off distal to the electrode and that the bronchodilation effect can be blocked with the blocker propranolol. In addition stimulation was found to be ineffective in animals that have had their adrenal glands removed.

Evaluation of Noninvasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation in Ragweed Sensitized Beagle Dogs Methacholine Induced Bronchoconstriction.

Noninvasive VNS was developed and tested in an established hypersensitive beagle asthma model to confirm that the noninvasive VNS had a safety and efficacy profile similar to percutaneous VNS. The stimulating device was similar to one shown in known by the inventors as the AlphaCore device . Dogs were subjected to methacholine Mch challenges inducing 100 increase in airway resistance black bar . Dogs were then treated with noninvasive VNS for 90 to 120 seconds 2 min . Treatment with noninvasive VNS resulted in a significant reduction in Mch induced bronchoconstriction which occurred within 1 minute of the VNS barber pole bar .

Subsequent to the noninvasive VNS stimulation the dogs were repeatedly challenged with the same dose of Mch at 15 30 60 90 and 120 minutes. Noninvasive VNS effects lasted for up to 2 hours through 5 additional challenges without additional VNS stimulations required with no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate. These results are comparable at the same time points to results obtained with high dose albuterol a bronchodilator medication instead of VNS in the same beagle model at the indicated time points . In a second experiment propranolol was given intravenously prior to either albuterol or noninvasive VNS resulting in a significant reduction in methacholine induced bronchoconstriction. We conclude from these experiments that the foregoing results that we had obtained in experiments involving invasive VNS may be extrapolated to the present invention involving noninvasive VNS.

Consider now which nerve fibers may be stimulated by the non invasive vagus nerve stimulation. The waveform disclosed in contains significant Fourier components at high frequencies e.g. 1 200 microseconds 5000 sec even if the waveform also has components at lower frequencies e.g. 25 sec . Transcutaneously A beta A delta and C fibers are typically excited at 2000 Hz 250 Hz and 5 Hz respectively i.e. the 2000 Hz stimulus is described as being specific for measuring the response of A beta fibers the 250 Hz for A delta fibers and the 5 Hz for type C fibers George D. BAQUIS et al. TECHNOLOGY REVIEW THE NEUROMETER CURRENT PERCEPTION THRESHOLD CPT . Muscle Nerve 22 Supplement 8 1999 S247 5259 . Therefore the high frequency component of the noninvasive stimulation waveform will preferentially stimulate the A alpha and A beta fibers and the C fibers will be largely unstimulated.

However the threshold for activation of fiber types also depends on the amplitude of the stimulation and for a given stimulation frequency the threshold increases as the fiber size decreases. The threshold for generating an action potential in nerve fibers that are impaled with electrodes is traditionally described by Lapicque or Weiss equations which describe how together the width and amplitude of stimulus pulses determine the threshold along with parameters that characterize the fiber the chronaxy and rheobase . For nerve fibers that are stimulated by electric fields that are applied externally to the fiber as is the case here characterizing the threshold as a function of pulse amplitude and frequency is more complicated which ordinarily involves the numerical solution of model differential equations or a case by case experimental evaluation David BOINAGROV Jim Loudin and Daniel Palanker. Strength Duration Relationship for Extracellular Neural Stimulation Numerical and Analytical Models. J Neurophysiol 104 2010 2236 2248 .

For example REILLY describes a model the spatially extended nonlinear nodal model or SENN model that may be used to calculate minimum stimulus thresholds for nerve fibers having different diameters J. Patrick REILLY. Electrical models for neural excitation studies. Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest 9 1 1988 44 59 . According to REILLY s analysis the minimum threshold for excitation of myelinated A fibers is 6.2 V m for a 20 m diameter fiber 12.3 V m for a 10 m fiber and 24.6 V m for a 5 m diameter fiber assuming a pulse width that is within the contemplated range of the present invention 1 ms . It is understood that these thresholds may differ slightly from those produced by the waveform of the present invention as illustrated by REILLY s figures for example because the present invention prefers to use sinusoidal rather than square pulses. Thresholds for B and C fibers are respectively 2 to 3 and 10 to 100 times greater than those for A fibers Mark A. CASTORO Paul B. Yoo Juan G. Hincapie Jason J. Hamann Stephen B. Ruble Patrick D. Wolf Warren M. Grill. Excitation properties of the right cervical vagus nerve in adult dogs. Experimental Neurology 227 2011 62 68 . If we assume an average A fiber threshold of 15 V m then B fibers would have thresholds of 30 to 45 V m and C fibers would have thresholds of 150 to 1500 V m. The present invention produces electric fields at the vagus nerve in the range of about 6 to 100 V m which is therefore generally sufficient to excite all myelinated A and B fibers but not the unmyelinated C fibers. In contrast invasive vagus nerve stimulators that have been used for the treatment of epilepsy have been reported to excite C fibers in some patients EVANS M S Verma Ahuja S Naritoku D K Espinosa J A. Intraoperative human vagus nerve compound action potentials. Acta Neurol Scand 110 2004 232 238 .

It is understood that although devices of the present invention may stimulate A and B nerve fibers in practice they may also be used so as not to stimulate the largest A fibers A delta and B fibers. In particular if the stimulator amplitude has been increased to the point at which unwanted side effects begin to occur the operator of the device may simply reduce the amplitude to avoid those effects. For example vagal efferent fibers responsible for bronchoconstriction have been observed to have conduction velocities in the range of those of B fibers. In those experiments bronchoconstriction was only produced when B fibers were activated and became maximal before C fibers had been recruited R. M. McALLEN and K. M. Spyer. Two types of vagal preganglionic motoneurones projecting to the heart and lungs. J. Physiol. 282 1978 353 364 . Because proper stimulation with the disclosed devices does not result in bronchoconstriction evidently the bronchoconstrictive B fibers are possibly not being activated when the amplitude is properly set. Also the absence of bradycardia or prolongation of PR interval suggests that cardiac efferent B fibers are not stimulated. Similarly the jugular A delta fibers are RAR like afferents that behave physiologically like C fibers. Because stimulation with the disclosed devices does not produce nociceptive effects that would be produced by jugular A delta fibers or C fibers evidently the A delta fibers may not be stimulated when the amplitude is properly set.

To summarize the foregoing discussion the delivery in a patient suffering from severe asthma COPD anaphylactic shock or other bronchoconstrictive exacerbation of an impulse of energy sufficient to stimulate block and or modulate transmission of signals of vagus nerve fibers will result in relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle dilating airways. The most likely mechanisms do not involve the stimulation of C fibers bronchodilation resulting from stimulation of the vagus nerve works in part by causing the systemic release of the natural endogenous agonists from the adrenal medulla and the stimulation of afferent A and B nerve fibers of the vagus nerve activates neural pathways causing the release of norepinephrine and or serotonin and or GABA onto airway related vagal preganglionic neurons AVPNs thereby antagonizing bronchoconstriction that is mediated by cholinergic nerve fibers. In addition the release of these inhibitory neurotransmitters causes an inhibition of mucous production in the mucous glands within the airway passages.

Stimulating blocking and or modulating the signal in selected nerves to reduce parasympathetic tone provides an immediate emergency response much like a defibrillator in situations of severe asthma or COPD attacks or anaphylactic shock providing immediate temporary dilation of the airways and optionally an increase of heart function until subsequent measures such as administration of epinephrine rescue breathing and intubation can be employed. Treatment in accordance with the present invention provides bronchodilation and possibly increased heart function for a long enough period of time so that administered medication such as epinephrine has time to take effect before the patient suffocates.

A preferred embodiment of magnetic stimulator coil comprises a toroidal winding around a core consisting of high permeability material e.g. Supermendur embedded in an electrically conducting medium. Toroidal coils with high permeability cores have been theoretically shown to greatly reduce the currents required for transcranial TMS and other forms of magnetic stimulation but only if the toroids are embedded in a conducting medium and placed against tissue with no air interface.

Although Carbunaru and Durand demonstrated that it is possible to electrically stimulate a patient transcutaneously with such a device they made no attempt to develop the device in such a way as to generally shape the electric field that is to stimulate the nerve. In particular the electric fields that may be produced by their device are limited to those that are radially symmetric at any given depth of stimulation into the patient i.e. z and p are used to specify location of the field not x y and z . This is a significant limitation and it results in a deficiency that was noted in of their publication at large depths of stimulation the threshold current in the device s coil for long axons is larger than the saturation current of the coil. Stimulation of those axons is only possible at low threshold points such as bending sites or tissue conductivity inhomogeneities . Thus for their device varying the parameters that they considered in order to increase the electric field or its gradient in the vicinity of a nerve may come at the expense of limiting the field s physiological effectiveness such that the spatial extent of the field of stimulation may be insufficient to modulate the target nerve s function. Yet such long axons are precisely what we may wish to stimulate in therapeutic interventions such as the ones disclosed herein.

Accordingly it is an objective of the present invention to shape an elongated electric field of effect that can be oriented parallel to such a long nerve. The term shape an electric field as used herein means to create an electric field or its gradient that is generally not radially symmetric at a given depth of stimulation in the patient especially a field that is characterized as being elongated or finger like and especially also a field in which the magnitude of the field in some direction may exhibit more than one spatial maximum i.e. may be bimodal or multimodal such that the tissue between the maxima may contain an area across which induced current flow is restricted. Shaping of the electric field refers both to the circumscribing of regions within which there is a significant electric field and to configuring the directions of the electric field within those regions. The shaping of the electric field is described in terms of the corresponding field equations in commonly assigned application US20110125203 application Ser. No. 12 964 050 entitled Magnetic stimulation devices and methods of therapy to SIMON et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference. Thus the present invention differs from the device disclosed by CARBUNARU and Durand by deliberately shaping an electric field that is used to transcutaneously stimulate the patient. Whereas the toroid in the CARBUNARU and Durand publication was immersed in a homogeneous conducting half space this is not necessarily the case for our invention. Although our invention will generally have some continuously conducting path between the device s coil and the patient s skin the conducting medium need not totally immerse the coil and there may be insulating voids within the conducting medium. For example if the device contains two toroids conducting material may connect each of the toroids individually to the patient s skin but there may be an insulating gap from air or some other insulator between the surfaces at which conducting material connected to the individual toroids contact the patient. Furthermore the area of the conducting material that contacts the skin may be made variable by using an aperture adjusting mechanism such as an iris diaphragm. As another example if the coil is wound around core material that is laminated with the core in contact with the device s electrically conducting material then the lamination may be extended into the conducting material in such a way as to direct the induced electrical current between the laminations and towards the surface of the patient s skin. As another example the conducting material may pass through apertures in an insulated mesh before contacting the patient s skin creating thereby an array of electric field maxima. In the dissertation cited above Carbunaru FAIERSTEIN made no attempt to use conducting material other than agar in a KCl solution and he made no attempt to devise a device that could be conveniently and safely applied to a patient s skin at an arbitrary angle without the conducting material spilling out of its container. It is therefore an objective of the present invention to disclose conducting material that can be used not only to adapt the conductivity of the conducting material and select boundary conditions thereby shaping the electric fields and currents as described above but also to create devices that can be applied practically to any surface of the body. The volume of the container containing electrically conducting medium is labeled in as . Use of the container of conducting medium allows one to generate induce electric fields in tissue and electric field gradients and electric currents that are equivalent to those generated using current magnetic stimulation devices but with about 0.001 to 0.1 of the current conventionally applied to a magnetic stimulation coil. This allows for minimal heating of the coil s and deeper tissue stimulation. However application of the conducting medium to the surface of the patient is difficult to perform in practice because the tissue contours head arms legs neck etc. are not planar. To solve this problem in the preferred embodiment of the present invention the toroidal coil is embedded in a structure which is filled with a conducting medium having approximately the same conductivity as muscle tissue as now described.

In one embodiment of the invention the container contains holes so that the conducting material e.g. a conducting gel can make physical contact with the patient s skin through the holes. For example the conducting medium may comprise a chamber surrounding the coil filled with a conductive gel that has the approximate viscosity and mechanical consistency of gel deodorant e.g. Right Guard Clear Gel from Dial Corporation 15501 N. Dial Boulevard Scottsdale Ariz. 85260 one composition of which comprises aluminum chlorohydrate sorbitol propylene glycol polydimethylsiloxanes Silicon oil cyclomethicone ethanol SD Alcohol 40 dimethicone copolyol aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly and water . The gel which is less viscous than conventional electrode gel is maintained in the chamber with a mesh of openings at the end where the device is to contact the patient s skin. The gel does not leak out and it can be dispensed with a simple screw driven piston.

In another embodiment the container itself is made of a conducting elastomer e.g. dry carbon filled silicone elastomer and electrical contact with the patient is through the elastomer itself possibly through an additional outside coating of conducting material. In some embodiments of the invention the conducting medium may be a balloon filled with a conducting gel or conducting powders or the balloon may be constructed extensively from deformable conducting elastomers. The balloon conforms to the skin surface removing any air thus allowing for high impedance matching and conduction of large electric fields in to the tissue. A device such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 591 776 entitled Magnetic stimulators and stimulating coils to PHILLIPS et al. may conform the coil itself to the contours of the body but in the preferred embodiment such a curved coil is also enclosed by a container that is filled with a conducting medium that deforms to be contiguous with the skin.

Agar can also be used as part of the conducting medium but it is not preferred because agar degrades in time is not ideal to use against skin and presents difficulties with cleaning the patient and stimulator coil. Use of agar in a 4M KCl solution as a conducting medium was mentioned in the above cited dissertation Rafael Carbunaru FAIERSTEIN Coil Designs for Localized and Efficient Magnetic Stimulation of the Nervous System. Ph.D. Dissertation Department of Biomedical Engineering Case Western Reserve May 1999 page 117 UMI Microform Number 9940153 UMI Company Ann Arbor Mich. . However that publication makes no mention or suggestion of placing the agar in a conducting elastomeric balloon or other deformable container so as to allow the conducting medium to conform to the generally non planar contours of a patient s skin having an arbitrary orientation. In fact that publication describes the coil as being submerged in a container filled with an electrically conducting solution. If the coil and container were placed on a body surface that was oriented in the vertical direction then the conducting solution would spill out making it impossible to stimulate the body surface in that orientation. In contrast the present invention is able to stimulate body surfaces having arbitrary orientation.

That dissertation also makes no mention of a dispensing method whereby the agar would be made contiguous with the patient s skin. A layer of electrolytic gel is said to have been applied between the skin and coil but the configuration was not described clearly in the publication. In particular no mention is made of the electrolytic gel being in contact with the agar.

Rather than using agar as the conducting medium the coil can instead be embedded in a conducting solution such as 1 10 NaCl contacting an electrically conducting interface to the human tissue. Such an interface is used as it allows current to flow from the coil into the tissue and supports the medium surrounded toroid so that it can be completely sealed. Thus the interface is material interposed between the conducting medium and patient s skin that allows the conducting medium e.g. saline solution to slowly leak through it allowing current to flow to the skin. Several interfaces are disclosed as follows.

One interface comprises conducting material that is hydrophilic such as Tecophlic from The Lubrizol Corporation 29400 Lakeland Boulevard Wickliffe Ohio 44092. It absorbs from 10 100 of its weight in water making it highly electrically conductive while allowing only minimal bulk fluid flow.

Another material that may be used as an interface is a hydrogel such as that used on standard EEG EKG and TENS electrodes Rylie A GREEN Sungchul Baek Laura A Poole Warren and Penny J Martens. Conducting polymer hydrogels for medical electrode applications. Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 11 2010 014107 13 pp . For example it may be the following hypoallergenic bacteriostatic electrode gel SIGNAGEL Electrode Gel from Parker Laboratories Inc. 286 Eldridge Rd. Fairfield N.J. 07004.

A third type of interface may be made from a very thin material with a high dielectric constant such as those used to make capacitors. For example Mylar can be made in submicron thicknesses and has a dielectric constant of about 3. Thus at stimulation frequencies of several kilohertz or greater the Mylar will capacitively couple the signal through it because it will have an impedance comparable to that of the skin itself. Thus it will isolate the toroid and the solution it is embedded in from the tissue yet allow current to pass.

The preferred embodiment of the magnetic stimulator coil in reduces the volume of conducting material that must surround a toroidal coil by using two toroids side by side and passing electrical current through the two toroidal coils in opposite directions. In this configuration the induced current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium. Thus minimal space for the conducting medium is required around the outside of the toroids at positions near from the gap between the pair of coils. An additional advantage of using two toroids in this configuration is that this design will greatly increase the magnitude of the electric field gradient between them which is crucial for exciting long straight axons such as the vagus nerve and certain other peripheral nerves.

This preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in . respectively provide top and bottom views of the outer surface of the toroidal magnetic stimulator . respectively provide top and bottom views of the toroidal magnetic stimulator after sectioning along its long axis to reveal the inside of the stimulator.

As seen in the coils and cores around which they are wound are mounted as close as practical to the corresponding mesh with openings through which conducting gel passes to the surface of the patient s skin. As seen in each coil and the core around which it is wound is mounted in its own housing the function of which is to provide mechanical support to the coil and core as well as to electrically insulate a coil from its neighboring coil. With this design induced current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium.

Different diameter toroidal coils and windings may be preferred for different applications. For a generic application the outer diameter of the core may be typically 1 to 5 cm with an inner diameter typically 0.5 to 0.75 of the outer diameter. The coil s winding around the core may be typically 3 to 250 in number depending on the core diameter and depending on the desired coil inductance.

Greater flexibility is obtained by adding to the impulse generator a bank of capacitors that can be discharged at different times. Thus higher impulse rates may be achieved by discharging capacitors in the bank sequentially such that recharging of capacitors is performed while other capacitors in the bank are being discharged. Furthermore by discharging some capacitors while the discharge of other capacitors is in progress by discharging the capacitors through resistors having variable resistance and by controlling the polarity of the discharge the control unit may synthesize pulse shapes that approximate an arbitrary function.

The design and methods of use of impulse generators control units and stimulator coils for magnetic stimulators are informed by the designs and methods of use of impulse generators control units and electrodes with leads for comparable completely electrical nerve stimulators but design and methods of use of the magnetic stimulators must take into account many special considerations making it generally not straightforward to transfer knowledge of completely electrical stimulation methods to magnetic stimulation methods. Such considerations include determining the anatomical location of the stimulation and determining the appropriate pulse configuration OLNEY R K So Y T Goodin D S Aminoff M J. A comparison of magnetic and electric stimulation of peripheral nerves. Muscle Nerve 1990 13 957 963 J. NILSSON M. Panizza B. J. Roth et al.

Furthermore a potential practical disadvantage of using magnetic stimulator coils is that they may overheat when used over an extended period of time. Use of the above mentioned toroidal coil and container of electrically conducting medium addresses this potential disadvantage. However because of the poor coupling between the stimulating coils and the nerve tissue large currents are nevertheless required to reach threshold electric fields. At high repetition rates these currents can heat the coils to unacceptable levels in seconds to minutes depending on the power levels and pulse durations and rates. Two approaches to overcome heating are to cool the coils with flowing water or air or to increase the magnetic fields using ferrite cores thus allowing smaller currents . For some applications where relatively long treatment times at high stimulation frequencies may be required e.g. treating acute asthma attacks by stimulating the vagus nerve neither of these two approaches are adequate. Water cooled coils overheat in a few minutes. Ferrite core coils heat more slowly due to the lower currents and heat capacity of the ferrite core but also cool off more slowly and do not allow for water cooling since the ferrite core takes up the volume where the cooling water would flow.

A solution to this problem is to use a fluid which contains ferromagnetic particles in suspension like a ferrofluid or magnetorheological fluid as the cooling material. Ferrofluids are colloidal mixtures composed of nanoscale ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic particles suspended in a carrier fluid usually an organic solvent or water. The ferromagnetic nanoparticles are coated with a surfactant to prevent their agglomeration due to van der Waals forces and magnetic forces . Ferrofluids have a higher heat capacity than water and will thus act as better coolants. In addition the fluid will act as a ferrite core to increase the magnetic field strength. Also since ferrofluids are paramagnetic they obey Curie s law and thus become less magnetic at higher temperatures. The strong magnetic field created by the magnetic stimulator coil will attract cold ferrofluid more than hot ferrofluid thus forcing the heated ferrofluid away from the coil. Thus cooling may not require pumping of the ferrofluid through the coil but only a simple convective system for cooling. This is an efficient cooling method which may require no additional energy input U.S. Pat.

Riehl et al. Riehl et al. and Ghiron et al. .

Magnetorheological fluids are similar to ferrofluids but contain larger magnetic particles which have multiple magnetic domains rather than the single domains of ferrofluids. U.S. Pat. No. 6 743 371 Magneto sensitive fluid composition and a process for preparation thereof to John et al. . They can have a significantly higher magnetic permeability than ferrofluids and a higher volume fraction of iron to carrier.

Commercially available magnetic stimulators include circular parabolic figure of eight butterfly and custom designs that are available commercially Chris HOVEY and Reza Jalinous THE GUIDE TO MAGNETIC STIMULATION The Magstim Company Ltd Spring Gardens Whitland Carmarthenshire SA34 0HR United Kingdom 2006 . Additional embodiments of the magnetic stimulator coil have been described U.S. Pat. No. 6 179 770 entitled Coil assemblies for magnetic stimulators to Stephen Mould Kent DAVEY. Magnetic Stimulation Coil and Circuit Design. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering Vol. 47 No. 11 November 2000 1493 1499 . Many of the problems that are associated with such conventional magnetic stimulators e.g. the complexity of the impulse generator circuitry and the problem with overheating are largely avoided by the toroidal design shown in .

Thus use of the container of conducting medium allows one to generate induce electric fields in tissue and electric field gradients and electric currents that are equivalent to those generated using current magnetic stimulation devices but with about 0.001 to 0.1 of the current conventionally applied to a magnetic stimulation coil. Therefore with the present invention it is possible to generate waveforms shown in with relatively simple low power circuits that are powered by batteries. The circuits may be enclosed within a box as shown in or the circuits may be attached to the stimulator itself to be used as a hand held device. In either case control over the unit may be made using only an on off switch and power knob. The only other component that may be needed might be a cover 39 to keep the conducting fluid from leaking or drying out between uses. The currents passing through the coils of the magnetic stimulator will saturate its core e.g. 0.1 to 2 Tesla magnetic field strength for Supermendur core material . This will require approximately 0.5 to 20 amperes of current being passed through each coil typically 2 amperes with voltages across each coil of 10 to 100 volts. The current is passed through the coils in bursts of pulses as described in connection with shaping an elongated electrical field of effect.

In another embodiment of the invention electrodes applied to the surface of the neck or to some other surface of the body are used to non invasively deliver electrical energy to a nerve instead of delivering the energy to the nerve via a magnetic coil. The vagus nerve has been stimulated previously non invasively using electrodes applied via leads to the surface of the skin. For example U.S. Pat. No. 7 340 299 entitled Methods of indirectly stimulating the vagus nerve to achieve controlled asystole to John D. PUSKAS discloses the stimulation of the vagus nerve using electrodes placed on the neck of the patient but that patent is unrelated to the treatment of bronchoconstriction. Non invasive electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve has also been described in Japanese patent application JP2009233024A with a filing date of Mar. 26 2008 entitled Vagus Nerve Stimulation System to Fukui YOSHIHOTO in which a body surface electrode is applied to the neck to stimulate the vagus nerve electrically. However that application pertains to the control of heart rate and is unrelated to the treatment of bronchoconstriction.

Patent application US2010 0057154 entitled Device and method for the transdermal stimulation of a nerve of the human body to DIETRICH et al. discloses a non invasive transcutaneous transdermal method for stimulating the vagus nerve at an anatomical location where the vagus nerve has paths in the skin of the external auditory canal. Their non invasive method involves performing electrical stimulation at that location using surface stimulators that are similar to those used for peripheral nerve and muscle stimulation for treatment of pain transdermal electrical nerve stimulation muscle training electrical muscle stimulation and electroacupuncture of defined meridian points. The method used in that application is similar to the ones used in U.S. Pat. No. 4 319 584 entitled Electrical pulse acupressure system to McCALL for electroacupuncture U.S. Pat. No. 5 514 175 entitled Auricular electrical stimulator to KIM et al. for the treatment of pain and U.S. Pat.

A related application is US2006 0122675 entitled Stimulator for auricular branch of vagus nerve to LIBBUS et al. Similarly U.S. Pat. No. 7 386 347 entitled Electric stimulator for alpha wave derivation to CHUNG et al. described electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve at the ear. Patent application US2008 0288016 entitled Systems and Methods for Stimulating Neural Targets to AMURTHUR et al. also discloses electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve at the ear. However none of the disclosures in these patents or patent applications for electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve at the ear are used to treat bronchoconstriction.

Embodiments of the present invention may differ with regard to the number of electrodes that are used the distance between electrodes and whether disk or ring electrodes are used. In preferred embodiments of the method one selects the electrode configuration for individual patients in such a way as to optimally focus electric fields and currents onto the selected nerve without generating excessive currents on the surface of the skin. This tradeoff between focality and surface currents is described by DATTA et al. Abhishek DATTA Maged Elwassif Fortunato Battaglia and Marom Bikson. Transcranial current stimulation focality using disc and ring electrode configurations FEM analysis. J. Neural Eng. 5 2008 163 174 . Although DATTA et al. are addressing the selection of electrode configuration specifically for transcranial current stimulation the principles that they describe are applicable to peripheral nerves as well RATTAY F.

Considering that the nerve stimulating device in and the nerve stimulating device in both control the shape of electrical impulses their functions are analogous except that one stimulates nerves via a pulse of a magnetic field and the other stimulates nerves via an electrical pulse applied through surface electrodes. Accordingly general features recited for the nerve stimulating device apply as well to the latter stimulating device and will not be repeated here. The preferred parameters for each nerve stimulating device are those that produce the desired therapeutic effects.

A preferred embodiment of an electrode based stimulator is shown in . A cross sectional view of the stimulator along its long axis is shown in . As shown the stimulator comprises two heads and a body that joins them. Each head contains a stimulating electrode. The body of the stimulator contains the electronic components and battery not shown that are used to generate the signals that drive the electrodes which are located behind the insulating board that is shown in . However in other embodiments of the invention the electronic components that generate the signals that are applied to the electrodes may be separate but connected to the electrode head using wires. Furthermore other embodiments of the invention may contain a single such head or more than two heads.

Heads of the stimulator are applied to a surface of the patient s body during which time the stimulator may be held in place by straps or frames not shown or the stimulator may be held against the patient s body by hand. In either case the level of stimulation power may be adjusted with a wheel that also serves as an on off switch. A light is illuminated when power is being supplied to the stimulator. An optional cap may be provided to cover each of the stimulator heads to protect the device when not in use to avoid accidental stimulation and to prevent material within the head from leaking or drying. Thus in this embodiment of the invention mechanical and electronic components of the stimulator impulse generator control unit and power source are compact portable and simple to operate.

Details of one embodiment of the stimulator head are shown in . The electrode head may be assembled from a disc without fenestration or alternatively from a snap on cap that serves as a tambour for a dielectric or conducting membrane or alternatively the head may have a solid fenestrated head cup. The electrode may also be a screw . The preferred embodiment of the disc is a solid ordinarily uniformly conducting disc e.g. metal such as stainless steel which is possibly flexible in some embodiments. An alternate embodiment of the disc is a non conducting e.g. plastic aperture screen that permits electrical current to pass through its apertures e.g. through an array of apertures fenestration . The electrode also in seen in each stimulator head may have the shape of a screw that is flattened on its tip. Pointing of the tip would make the electrode more of a point source such that the equations for the electrical potential may have a solution corresponding more closely to a far field approximation. Rounding of the electrode surface or making the surface with another shape will likewise affect the boundary conditions that determine the electric field. Completed assembly of the stimulator head is shown in which also shows how the head is attached to the body of the stimulator .

If a membrane is used it ordinarily serves as the interface shown as in . For example the membrane may be made of a dielectric non conducting material such as a thin sheet of Mylar biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate also known as BoPET . In other embodiments it may be made of conducting material such as a sheet of Tecophlic material from Lubrizol Corporation 29400 Lakeland Boulevard Wickliffe Ohio 44092. In one embodiment apertures of the disc may be open or they may be plugged with conducting material for example KM10T hydrogel from Katecho Inc. 4020 Gannett Ave. Des Moines Iowa 50321. If the apertures are so plugged and the membrane is made of conducting material the membrane becomes optional and the plug serves as the interface shown in .

The head cup is filled with conducting material in for example SIGNAGEL Electrode Gel from Parker Laboratories Inc. 286 Eldridge Rd. Fairfield N.J. 07004. The head cup and body of the stimulator are made of a non conducting material such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The depth of the head cup from its top surface to the electrode may be between one and six centimeters. The head cup may have a different curvature than what is shown in or it may be tubular or conical or have some other inner surface geometry that will affect the Neumann boundary conditions that determine the electric field strength.

If an outer membrane is used and is made of conducting materials and the disc in is made of solid conducting materials such as stainless steel then the membrane becomes optional in which case the disc may serve as the interface shown in . Thus an embodiment without the membrane is shown in . shows that this version of the device comprises a solid but possibly flexible in some embodiments conducting disc that cannot absorb fluid the non conducting stimulator head into or onto which the disc is placed and the electrode which is also a screw. It is understood that the disc may have an anisotropic material or electrical structure for example wherein a disc of stainless steel has a grain such that the grain of the disc should be rotated about its location on the stimulator head in order to achieve optimal electrical stimulation of the patient. As seen in these items are assembled to become a sealed stimulator head that is attached to the body of the stimulator . The disc may screw into the stimulator head it may be attached to the head with adhesive or it may be attached by other methods that are known in the art. The chamber of the stimulator head cup is filled with a conducting gel fluid or paste and because the disc and electrode are tightly sealed against the stimulator head cup the conducting material within the stimulator head cannot leak out.

In some embodiments the interface and or its underlying mechanical support comprise materials that will also provide a substantial or complete seal of the interior of the device. This inhibits any leakage of conducting material such as gel from the interior of the device and also inhibits any fluids from entering the device. In addition this feature allows the user to easily clean the outer surface of the device e.g. with isopropyl alcohol or similar disinfectant avoiding potential contamination during subsequent uses of the device.

In some embodiments the interface comprises a fluid permeable material that allows for passage of current through the permeable portions of the material. In these embodiments a conductive medium such as a gel is preferably situated between the electrode s and the permeable interface. The conductive medium provides a conductive pathway for electrons to pass through the permeable interface to the outer surface of the interface and to the patient s skin.

In other embodiments of the present invention the interface in is made from a very thin material with a high dielectric constant such as material used to make capacitors. For example it may be Mylar having a submicron thickness preferably in the range 0.5 to 1.5 microns having a dielectric constant of about 3. Because one side of Mylar is slick and the other side is microscopically rough the present invention contemplates two different configurations one in which the slick side is oriented towards the patient s skin and the other in which the rough side is so oriented. Thus at stimulation Fourier frequencies of several kilohertz or greater the dielectric interface will capacitively couple the signal through itself because it will have an impedance comparable to that of the skin. Thus the dielectric interface will isolate the stimulator s electrode from the tissue yet allow current to pass. In one embodiment of the present invention non invasive electrical stimulation of a nerve is accomplished essentially substantially capacitively which reduces the amount of ohmic stimulation thereby reducing the sensation the patient feels on the tissue surface. This would correspond to a situation for example in which at least 30 preferably at least 50 of the energy stimulating the nerve comes from capacitive coupling through the stimulator interface rather than from ohmic coupling. In other words a substantial portion e.g. 50 of the voltage drop is across the dielectric interface while the remaining portion is through the tissue.

The selection of the material for the dielectric constant involves at least two important variables 1 the thickness of the interface and 2 the dielectric constant of the material. The thinner the interface and or the higher the dielectric constant of the material the lower the voltage drop across the dielectric interface and thus the lower the driving voltage required . For example with Mylar the thickness could be about 0.5 to 5 microns preferably about 1 micron with a dielectric constant of about 3. For a piezoelectric material like barium titanate or PZT lead zirconate titanate the thickness could be about 100 400 microns preferably about 200 microns or 0.2 mm because the dielectric constant is 1000.

One of the novelties of the embodiment that is a non invasive capacitive stimulator hereinafter referred to more generally as a capacitive electrode arises in that it uses a low voltage generally less than 100 volt power source which is made possible by the use of a suitable stimulation waveform such as the waveform that is disclosed herein . In addition the capacitive electrode allows for the use of an interface that provides a more adequate seal of the interior of the device. The capacitive electrode may be used by applying a small amount of conductive material e.g. conductive gel as described above to its outer surface. In some embodiments it may also be used by contacting dry skin thereby avoiding the inconvenience of applying an electrode gel paste or other electrolytic material to the patient s skin and avoiding the problems associated with the drying of electrode pastes and gels. Such a dry electrode would be particularly suitable for use with a patient who exhibits dermatitis after the electrode gel is placed in contact with the skin Ralph J. COSKEY. Contact dermatitis caused by ECG electrode jelly. Arch Dermatol 113 1977 839 840 . The capacitive electrode may also be used to contact skin that has been wetted e.g. with tap water or a more conventional electrolyte material to make the electrode skin contact here the dielectric constant more uniform A L ALEXELONESCU G Barbero F C M Freire and R Merletti.

As described below capacitive biomedical electrodes are known in the art but when used to stimulate a nerve noninvasively a high voltage power supply is currently used to perform the stimulation. Otherwise prior use of capacitive biomedical electrodes has been limited to invasive implanted applications to non invasive applications that involve monitoring or recording of a signal but not stimulation of tissue to non invasive applications that involve the stimulation of something other than a nerve e.g. tumor or as the dispersive electrode in electrosurgery.

Evidence of a long felt but unsolved need and evidence of failure of others to solve the problem that is solved by the this embodiment of the present invention low voltage non invasive capacitive stimulation of a nerve is provided by KELLER and Kuhn who review the previous high voltage capacitive stimulating electrode of GEDDES et al and write that Capacitive stimulation would be a preferred way of activating muscle nerves and fibers when the inherent danger of high voltage breakdowns of the dielectric material can be eliminated. Goal of future research could be the development of improved and ultra thin dielectric foils such that the high stimulation voltage can be lowered. L. A. GEDDES M. Hinds and K. S. Foster.

It is understood that in the United States according to the 2005 National Electrical Code high voltage is any voltage over 600 volts. U.S. Pat.

This embodiment of the present invention uses a different method to lower the high stimulation voltage than developing ultra thin dielectric foils namely to use a suitable stimulation waveform such as the waveform that is disclosed herein . That waveform has significant Fourier components at higher frequencies than waveforms used for transcutaneous nerve stimulation as currently practiced. Thus one of ordinary skill in the art would not have combined the claimed elements because transcutaneous nerve stimulation is performed with waveforms having significant Fourier components only at lower frequencies and noninvasive capacitive nerve stimulation is performed at higher voltages. In fact the elements in combination do not merely perform the function that each element performs separately. The dielectric material alone may be placed in contact with the skin in order to perform pasteless or dry stimulation with a more uniform current density than is associated with ohmic stimulation albeit with high stimulation voltages L. A. GEDDES M. Hinds and K. S. Foster. Stimulation with capacitor electrodes. Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 25 1987 359 360 Yongmin KIM H. Gunter Zieber and Frank A. Yang. Uniformity of current density under stimulating electrodes. Critical Reviews in Biomedical Engineering 17 1990 6 585 619 . With regard to the waveform element a waveform that has significant Fourier components at higher frequencies than waveforms currently used for transcutaneous nerve stimulation may be used to selectively stimulate a deep nerve and avoid stimulating other nerves as disclosed herein for both noncapacitive and capacitive electrodes. But it is the combination of the two elements dielectric interface and waveform that makes it possible to stimulate a nerve capacitively without using the high stimulation voltage as is currently practiced.

Another embodiment of the electrode based stimulator is shown in showing a device in which electrically conducting material is dispensed from the device to the patient s skin. In this embodiment the interface in is the conducting material itself. respectively provide top and bottom views of the outer surface of the electrical stimulator . provides a bottom view of the stimulator after sectioning along its long axis to reveal the inside of the stimulator.

Individual wires not shown connect the impulse generator in to the stimulator s electrodes . The two electrodes are shown here to be elliptical metal discs situated between the head compartment and rear compartment of the stimulator . A partition separates each of the two head compartments from one another and from the single rear compartment . Each partition also holds its corresponding electrode in place. However each electrode may be removed to add electrically conducting gel in to each head compartment . An optional non conducting variable aperture iris diaphragm may be placed in front of each of the electrodes within the head compartment in order to vary the effective surface area of each of the electrodes. Each partition may also slide towards the head of the device in order to dispense conducting gel through the mesh apertures . The position of each partition therefore determines the distance between its electrode and mesh openings which is variable in order to obtain the optimally uniform current density through the mesh openings . The outside housing of the stimulator as well as each head compartment housing and its partition are made of electrically insulating material such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene so that the two head compartments are electrically insulated from one another. Although the embodiment in is shown to be a non capacitive stimulator it is understood that it may be converted into a capacitive stimulator by replacing the mesh openings with a dielectric material such as a sheet of Mylar or by covering the mesh openings with a sheet of such dielectric material.

In one embodiment the magnetic stimulator coil in has a body that is similar to the electrode based stimulator shown in . To compare the electrode based stimulator with the magnetic stimulator refer to which shows the magnetic stimulator sectioned along its long axis to reveal its inner structure. As described below it reduces the volume of conducting material that must surround a toroidal coil by using two toroids side by side and passing electrical current through the two toroidal coils in opposite directions. In this configuration the induced electrical current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium. Thus minimal space for the conducting medium is required around the outside of the toroids at positions near from the gap between the pair of coils. An additional advantage of using two toroids in this configuration is that this design will greatly increase the magnitude of the electric field gradient between them which is crucial for exciting long straight axons such as the vagus nerve and certain peripheral nerves.

As seen in a mesh has openings that permit a conducting gel within in to pass from the inside of the stimulator to the surface of the patient s skin at the location of nerve or tissue stimulation. Thus the mesh with openings is the part of the magnetic stimulator that is applied to the skin of the patient.

As also seen in the coils and cores around which they are wound are mounted as close as practical to the corresponding mesh with openings through which conducting gel passes to the surface of the patient s skin. As shown each coil and the core around which it is wound is mounted in its own housing the function of which is to provide mechanical support to the coil and core as well as to electrically insulate a coil from its neighboring coil. With this design induced current will flow from the lumen of one toroid through the tissue and back through the lumen of the other completing the circuit within the toroids conducting medium. A difference between the structure of the electrode based stimulator shown in and the magnetic stimulator shown in is that the conducting gel is maintained within the chambers of the electrode based stimulator which is generally closed on the back side of the chamber because of the presence of the electrode but in the magnetic stimulator the hole of each toroidal core and winding is open permitting the conducting gel to enter the interconnected chambers .

Selected nerve fibers are stimulated in different embodiments of methods that make use of the disclosed electrical stimulation devices including stimulation of the vagus nerve at a location in the patient s neck. At that location the vagus nerve is situated within the carotid sheath near the carotid artery and the interior jugular vein. The carotid sheath is located at the lateral boundary of the retopharyngeal space on each side of the neck and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The left vagus nerve is sometimes selected for stimulation because stimulation of the right vagus nerve may produce undesired effects on the heart but depending on the application the right vagus nerve or both right and left vagus nerves may be stimulated instead.

The three major structures within the carotid sheath are the common carotid artery the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve. The carotid artery lies medial to the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve is situated posteriorly between the two vessels. Typically the location of the carotid sheath or interior jugular vein in a patient and therefore the location of the vagus nerve will be ascertained in any manner known in the art e.g. by feel or ultrasound imaging. Proceeding from the skin of the neck above the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the vagus nerve a line may pass successively through the sternocleidomastoid muscle the carotid sheath and the internal jugular vein unless the position on the skin is immediately to either side of the external jugular vein. In the latter case the line may pass successively through only the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath before encountering the vagus nerve missing the interior jugular vein. Accordingly a point on the neck adjacent to the external jugular vein might be preferred for non invasive stimulation of the vagus nerve. The magnetic stimulator coil may be centered on such a point at the level of about the fifth to sixth cervical vertebra.

The vagus nerve is identified in along with the carotid sheath that is identified there in bold peripheral outline. The carotid sheath encloses not only the vagus nerve but also the internal jugular vein and the common carotid artery . Features that may be identified near the surface of the neck include the external jugular vein and the sternocleidomastoid muscle . Additional organs in the vicinity of the vagus nerve include the trachea thyroid gland esophagus scalenus anterior muscle and scalenus medius muscle . The sixth cervical vertebra is also shown in with bony structure indicated by hatching marks.

Methods of treating a patient comprise stimulating the vagus nerve as indicated in using the electrical stimulation devices that are disclosed herein. The position and angular orientation of the device are adjusted about that location until the patient perceives stimulation when current is passed through the stimulator electrodes. The applied current is increased gradually first to a level wherein the patient feels sensation from the stimulation. The power is then increased but is set to a level that is less than one at which the patient first indicates any discomfort. Straps harnesses or frames are used to maintain the stimulator in position not shown in . The stimulator signal may have a frequency and other parameters that are selected to produce a therapeutic result in the patient. Stimulation parameters for each patient are adjusted on an individualized basis. Ordinarily the amplitude of the stimulation signal is set to the maximum that is comfortable for the patient and then the other stimulation parameters are adjusted.

The stimulation is then performed with a sinusoidal burst waveform like that shown in . The pattern of a burst followed by silent inter burst period repeats itself with a period of T. For example the sinusoidal period r may be 200 microseconds the number of pulses per burst may be N 5 and the whole pattern of burst followed by silent inter burst period may have a period of T 40000 microseconds which is comparable to 25 Hz stimulation. More generally there may be 1 to 20 pulses per burst preferably five pulses. Each pulse within a burst has a duration of 1 to 1000 microseconds preferably 200 microseconds. A burst followed by a silent inter burst interval repeats at 1 to 5000 bursts per second bps preferably at 5 50 bps and even more preferably 10 25 bps stimulation 10 25 Hz . The preferred shape of each pulse is a full sinusoidal wave although triangular or other shapes may be used as well. For some patients a single stimulation session of 90 to 120 seconds may be performed acute situation . For other patients the stimulation may be performed for 30 minutes and the treatment is performed once a week for 12 weeks or longer chronic situation . However it is understood that parameters of the stimulation protocol may be varied in response to heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of patients.

In other embodiments of the invention pairing of vagus nerve stimulation may be with a time varying sensory stimulation. The paired sensory stimulation may be bright light sound tactile stimulation or electrical stimulation of the tongue to simulate odor taste e.g. pulsating with the same frequency as the vagus nerve electrical stimulation. The rationale for paired sensory stimulation is the same as simultaneous paired stimulation of both left and right vagus nerves namely that the pair of signals interacting with one another in the brain may result in the formation of larger and more coherent neural ensembles than the neural ensembles associated with the individual signals thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect. For example the hypothalamus is well known to be responsive to the presence of bright light so exposing the patient to bright light that is fluctuating with the same stimulation frequency as the vagus nerve or a multiple of that frequency may be performed in an attempt to enhance the role of the hypothalamus in producing the desired therapeutic effect. Such paired stimulation does not necessarily rely upon neuronal plasticity and is in that sense different from other reports of paired stimulation Navzer D. ENGINEER Jonathan R. Riley Jonathan D.

The individualized selection of parameters for the nerve stimulation protocol may based on trial and error in order to obtain a beneficial response without the sensation of pain or muscle twitches. Ordinarily the amplitude of the stimulation signal is set to the maximum that is comfortable for the patient and then the other stimulation parameters are adjusted. Alternatively the selection of parameter values may involve tuning as understood in control theory and as described below. It is understood that parameters may also be varied randomly in order to simulate normal physiological variability thereby possibly inducing a beneficial response in the patient Buchman T G.

Before presenting data in which the disclosed vagus nerve stimulation devices and methods are applied to patients as a preliminary we describe measurements that are used to measure bronchoconstriction or bronchodilation. The magnitude of bronchial constriction in a patient is typically evaluated with a measurement referred to as the Forced Expiratory Volume in one second FEV1 . FEV1 represents the amount of air that a patient exhales expressed in liters in the first second of a pulmonary function test which is typically performed with a spirometer. The spirometer compares the FEV1 result to a standard for the patient which is based on the predicted value for the patient s weight height sex age and race. This comparison is then expressed as a percentage of the FEV1 as predicted. Thus if the volume of air exhaled by a patient in the first second is 60 of the predicted value based on the standard the FEV1 will be expressed in both the actual liters exhaled and as a percentage of predicted i.e. 60 of predicted . In practice a baseline value of FEV1 is measured and after a therapeutic intervention a second value of FEV1 is measured in order to ascertain the efficacy of the intervention.

Certain other non invasive measurements may act as surrogates for the measurement of FEV1. Those other measurements are particularly useful for patients who cannot cooperate to perform measurements made by spirometry or for situations in which it is not possible to perform spirometry. Because those other measurements may be used to generate a non invasive continuous signal that indicates the efficacy of stimulating the selected nerves they will be discussed below in connection with their use to provide a feedback signal in the present invention for adjusting the power of the applied impulse as well as for adjustment of other stimulation parameters. It should be noted here that one of them the interrupter technique Rint measures airway resistance which according to Poiseuille s Law for laminar air flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the caliber of dilation of the bronchi.

The measurement of FEV1 entails first measuring forced expiration volume as a function of time the maximum expiratory flow volume curve or MEFV which may be depicted in different ways e.g. normalized to percentage of vital capacity then reading the value of the MEFV curve at the one second point. Because a single parameter such as FEV1 cannot characterize the entire MEFV curve it is understood that the MEFV curve itself or a set of parameters derived from it more accurately represents the patient s respiratory status than the FEV1 value alone Francois HAAS Kenneth Axen and John Salazar Schicchi. Use of Maximum Expiratory Flow Volume Curve Parameters in the Assessment of Exercise induced Bronchospasm. Chest 1993 103 64 68 . For example applicants also report Peak Expiratory Flow PEF which is the maximal flow achieved during the maximally forced expiration initiated at full inspiration measured in liters per minute. Furthermore it is understood that in order to understand the functional relationship between the magnitude of bronchoconstriction literally a reduction in the average caliber of bronchial lumen and FEV1 one does so by first considering the relation of each of them to the MEFV curve Rodney K. LAMBERT and Theodore A. Wilson. Smooth muscle dynamics and maximal expiratory flow in asthma. J Appl Physiol 99 1885 1890 2005 .

FEV1 is used as an objective index of airway obstruction in a patient but for a given value of FEV1 different patients may subjectively perceive different amounts of breathlessness corresponding to the work and effort associated with breathing Work of Breathing or WOB . Therefore it is also useful to quantify the patient s subjective sensation of breathlessness which is often made as a visual analogue scale VAS value BIJL HOFLAND I D Cloosterman S G Folgering H T Akkermans R P van den Hoogen H van Schayck C P. Measuring breathlessness during histamine challenge a simple standardized procedure in asthmatic patients. Eur Respir J. 13 1999 955 60 Donald A. MAHLER.

As discussed below in connection with a description of Applicant s clinical data the present application discloses systems and methods for increasing a patient s FEV1 in a relatively short period of time. Preferably an impulse of energy in the form of non invasive vagus nerve stimulation is applied to the patient which is sufficient to increase the FEV1 of the patient by a clinically significant amount in a period of time less than about 6 hours preferably less than 3 hours and more preferably less than 90 minutes. In an exemplary embodiment the clinically significant increase in FEV1 occurs in less than 15 minutes following ninety seconds of vagus nerve stimulation. A clinically significant amount is defined herein as at least a 12 increase in the patient s FEV1 versus the FEV1 prior to application of the electrical impulse.

Method and devices of the present invention are therefore particularly useful for providing substantially immediate relief of acute symptoms associated with bronchial constriction such as asthma attacks COPD exacerbations and or anaphylactic reactions. One of the key advantages of the present invention is the ability to provide almost immediate dilation of the bronchial smooth muscle in patients suffering from acute bronchoconstriction opening the patient s airways and allowing them to breathe and more quickly recover from an acute episode i.e. a relatively rapid onset of symptoms that are typically not prolonged or chronic .

Clinical Data Demonstrating that the Disclosed Stimulation Waveform and Devices Bring about Bronchodilation

As with the animal data that were described above we first tested the feasibility of the invention using invasive procedures percutaneous vagus nerve stimulation then proceeded to demonstrate the invention using totally noninvasive clinical measurements as follows.

The purpose of this follow up study was to investigate both the safety and efficacy of VNS in humans delivered through a percutaneous electrode pVNS for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations. The study subjects were limited to consenting adult emergency department ED patients with no further respiratory problems or other pre existing medical conditions. Twenty four ED patients ages 18 65 years who failed to respond to one hour of standard of care SOC were treated with the percutaneous placement of an electrode near the right carotid sheath under ultrasound guidance and then administered 60 minutes of pVNS and SOC. They were compared with a non randomized control group of 76 subjects who received only SOC.

The primary study outcome measures included adverse events Force Expiratory Volume in 1 sec FEV1 and improvement in perceived Work of Breathing WOB measured on a visual analogue scale. Stimulation for 60 minutes showed remarkable improvement in both FEV1 and WOB without serious adverse events with superiority in these values over SOC at 15 30 and 60 minutes with p values of less than 0.05 MINER J.

Thirty asthma patients were enrolled in an FDA IDE prospective multi centered pilot study to assess safety and efficacy of the disclosed noninvasive VNS device the AlphaCore device . The subjects had a documented reversible component of bronchoconstriction and were instructed to withhold use of an inhaled rescue medication SABA until they experienced mild to moderate bronchoconstriction. They then reported to the physician s office for treatment with the AlphaCore and monitoring of vital signs dyspnea and spirometry before during and for 90 min after a single 90 second treatment.

During the 90 seconds of stimulation most patients reported an immediate improvement in breathing. This was reflected in a rapid increase in FEV1 within one minute of stimulation. FEV1 continued to improve over the following 90 minutes . Similar improvements were seen in Peak Expiratory Flow PEF with greater than a 10 improvement by 90 min . Subjectively patients reported a significant improvement in breathing as reflected in work of breathing VAS score improvement of nearly half in the first few minutes after stimulation followed by continued reduction in the VAS score . No adverse events were reported during or after stimulation. There were no significant changes in ECG heart rate or systolic or diastolic blood pressure .

In practice the patients who are administered noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation nVNS in the setting of an emergency department will also be administered a variety of medications prior to and after the nVNS. To ascertain whether the use of nVNS as an adjunctive treatment to standard of medicinal care for the relief of acute bronchoconstriction is safe and effective and whether the results are influenced by the variety of standard medications that are taken the following pilot clinical trial was performed. After consent was obtained and screening completed six subjects were stimulated two times 30 minutes apart for 90 seconds each using the AlphaCore device as described above. The subjects were assessed prior to and immediately post the first stimulation and at 15 30 60 and 90 minutes. Follow up was also conducted at day 7 and day 30. The medications take prior to and after the nVNS are shown as a table in . summarizes the FEV1 data for these patients as a function of time following the initial stimulation. The 30 minute measurement was taken immediately after the second stimulation. summarizes the Work of Breathing VAS data for these patients as a function of time. They demonstrate an improvement in lung function and a decrease in the work of breathing respectively. No clinically significant adverse events requiring unusual treatment were reported although one patient had a treatable respiratory tract infection upon enrollment and another patient reported chest tightness at day 4 from the date of the stimulation treatment and continued to be treated with medications.

We therefore conclude from the foregoing preliminary clinical data that noninvasive VNS can safely induce significant bronchodilation during an exacerbation of asthma even in patients with a poor response to standard pharmacological treatment.

Individualized treatment may be based on the methods that will now be described in connection with the use of control theory to select stimulation parameters. In brief the patient s physiological and medical state are modeled a set of differential equations for example as coupled nonlinear oscillators measurements concerning the patient s function are made preferably using ambulatory measurement sensors parameters of the equations are estimated using the measurements including measurement of the patient s function following stimulation with different parameters that may be used for the stimulation protocol and a treatment protocol set of stimulation parameters is selected in nearly real time that will provide the best outcome and avoid or ameliorate the effects of undesired events.

If it is desired to maintain a constant stimulation in the vicinity of the vagus nerve or any other nerve or tissue that is being stimulated control theory methods may also be employed to modulate the power of the stimulator in order to compensate for patient motion or other mechanisms that would otherwise give rise to variability in the power of stimulation. In the case of stimulation of the vagus nerve such variability may be attributable to the patient s breathing which may involve contraction and associated change in geometry of the sternocleidomastoid muscle that is situated close to the vagus nerve identified as in . Such modulation may be accomplished using controllers e.g. PID controllers that are known in the art of control theory as now described.

The System also receives input from the Controller which in this case may comprise the vagus nerve stimulation device as well as electronic components that may be used to select or set parameters for the stimulation protocol amplitude frequency pulse width burst number etc. or alert the patient as to the need to use or adjust the stimulator i.e. an alarm . For example the controller may include the control unit in . Feedback in the schema shown in is possible because physiological measurements of the System are made using sensors. Thus the values of variables of the system that could be measured define the system s state the System Output . As a practical matter only some of those measurements are actually made and they represent the Sensed Physiological Input to the Controller.

The preferred sensors will include ones ordinarily used for ambulatory monitoring selected to characterize the heart and lung and the modulation of their function by the autonomic nervous system. For example the sensors may comprise those used in conventional Holter and bedside monitoring applications for monitoring heart rate and variability ECG respiration depth and rate core temperature hydration blood pressure brain function oxygenation skin impedance and skin temperature. The sensors may be embedded in garments or placed in sports wristwatches as currently used in programs that monitor the physiological status of soldiers G. A. SHAW A. M. Siegel G. Zogbi and T. P. Opar. Warfighter physiological and environmental monitoring a study for the U.S. Army Research Institute in Environmental Medicine and the Soldier Systems Center. MIT Lincoln Laboratory Lexington Mass. 1 Nov. 2004 pp. 1 141 . The ECG sensors should be adapted to the automatic extraction and analysis of particular features of the ECG for example indices of P wave morphology as well as heart rate variability indices of parasympathetic and sympathetic tone. Measurement of respiration using noninvasive inductive plethysmography mercury in silastic strain gauges or impedance pneumography is particularly advised in order to account for the effects of respiration on the heart. A noninvasive accelerometer may also be included among the ambulatory sensors in order to identify motion artifacts. Although some events such as the onset of atrial fibrillation can be detected from the ECG alone or other sensor output an event marker may also be included in order for the patient to mark relevant circumstances and sensations.

Detection of the phase of respiration may be performed non invasively by adhering a thermistor or thermocouple probe to the patient s cheek so as to position the probe at the nasal orifice. Strain gauge signals from belts strapped around the chest as well as inductive plethysmography and impedance pneumography are also used traditionally to non invasively generate a signal that rises and falls as a function of the phase of respiration. After digitizing such signals the phase of respiration may be determined using software such as puka which is part of PhysioToolkit a large published library of open source software and user manuals that are used to process and display a wide range of physiological signals GOLDBERGER A L Amaral L A N Glass L Hausdorff J M Ivanov P Ch Mark R G Mietus J E Moody G B Peng C K Stanley H E. PhysioBank PhysioToolkit and PhysioNet Components of a New Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals. Circulation 101 23 2000 e215 e220 available from PhysioNet M.I.T. Room E25 505A 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge Mass. 02139 . In one embodiment of the present invention the control unit contains an analog to digital converter to receive such analog respiratory signals and software for the analysis of the digitized respiratory waveform resides within the control unit . That software extracts turning points within the respiratory waveform such as end expiration and end inspiration and forecasts future turning points based upon the frequency with which waveforms from previous breaths match a partial waveform for the current breath. The control unit then controls the impulse generator for example to stimulate the selected nerve only during a selected phase of respiration such as all of inspiration or only the first second of inspiration or only the expected middle half of inspiration.

It may be therapeutically advantageous to program the control unit to control the impulse generator in such a way as to temporally modulate stimulation by the magnetic stimulator coils or electrodes depending on the phase of the patient s respiration. In patent application JP2008 081479A entitled Vagus nerve stimulation system to YOSHIHOTO a system is also described for keeping the heart rate within safe limits. When the heart rate is too high that system stimulates a patient s vagus nerve and when the heart rate is too low that system tries to achieve stabilization of the heart rate by stimulating the heart itself rather than use different parameters to stimulate the vagus nerve. In that disclosure vagal stimulation uses an electrode which is described as either a surface electrode applied to the body surface or an electrode introduced to the vicinity of the vagus nerve via a hypodermic needle. That disclosure is unrelated to the problem of bronchoconstriction that is addressed herein but it does consider stimulation during particular phases of the respiratory cycle for the following reason. Because the vagus nerve is near the phrenic nerve Yoshihoto indicates that the phrenic nerve will sometimes be electrically stimulated along with the vagus nerve. The present applicants did not experience this problem in the experiments reported here so the problem may be one of a misplaced electrode. In any case the phrenic nerve controls muscular movement of the diaphragm so consequently stimulation of the phrenic nerve causes the patient to hiccup or experience irregular movement of the diaphragm or otherwise experience discomfort. To minimize the effects of irregular diaphragm movement Yoshihoto s system is designed to stimulate the phrenic nerve and possibly co stimulate the vagus nerve only during the inspiration phase of the respiratory cycle and not during expiration. Furthermore the system is designed to gradually increase and then decrease the magnitude of the electrical stimulation during inspiration notably amplitude and stimulus rate so as to make stimulation of the phrenic nerve and diaphragm gradual. Patent application publication US2009 0177252 entitled Synchronization of vagus nerve stimulation with the cardiac cycle of a patient to Arthur D. Craig discloses a method of treating a medical condition in which the vagus nerve is stimulated during a portion of the cardiac cycle and the respiratory cycle. That disclosure pertains to the treatment of a generic medical condition so it is not specifically directed to the treatment of bronchoconstriction.

In the present application stimulation of selected nerve fibers during particular phases of respiration for the treatment of bronchoconstriction may be motivated by two additional physiological considerations. The first is that contraction of bronchial smooth muscle appears to be intrinsically rhythmic. It has been reported that bronchial smooth muscle contracts preferentially over two phases during mid inspiration and early expiration. When the vagus efferent nerves are repetitively stimulated with electric pulses the bronchus constricted periodically tonic constriction is almost absent in the bronchus in response to the vagally mediated descending commands KONDO Tetsuri Ichiro Kobayashi Naoki Hayama Gen Tazaki and Yasuyo Ohta. Respiratory related bronchial rhythmic constrictions in the dog with extracorporeal circulation. J Appl Physiol 88 2000 2031 2036 . Accordingly a rationale for stimulating the vagus nerve during particular phases of the respiratory cycle is that such stimulation may be used to counteract or inhibit the constriction that occurs naturally during those specific phases of respiration. If the counteracting or inhibiting effects occur only after a delay then the timing of the stimulation pulses must precede the phases of respiration during which the contraction would occur by an interval corresponding to the delay.

Another motivation for stimulating the vagus nerve during particular phases of respiration is that an increase or decrease in the duration of subsequent phases of respiration may be produced by applying the stimulation during particular phases of respiration M. SAMMON J. R. Romaniuk and E. N. Bruce. Bifurcations of the respiratory pattern produced with phasic vagal stimulation in the rat. J Appl Physiol 75 1993 912 926 . In particular a narrow window may exist at the expiratory inspiratory transition in which it may be possible to induce bursts of inspiratory activity followed by a prolonged breath. Accordingly if it is therapeutically beneficial to induce deep breaths those breaths might be induced by stimulating during that time window. In fact the physiologically meaningful cycle of stimulation in this case is not a single respiratory cycle but is instead a collective sequence of respiratory cycles wherein it makes sense only to speak of stimulation during particular parts of the sequence.

In some embodiments of the invention overheating of the magnetic stimulator coil may also be minimized by optionally restricting the magnetic stimulation to particular phases of the respiratory cycle allowing the coil to cool during the other phases of the respiratory cycle. Alternatively greater peak power may be achieved per respiratory cycle by concentrating all the energy of the magnetic pulses into selected phases of the respiratory cycle.

In our clinical experiments that were summarized above the electrical impulses delivered to the vagus nerve were optimized to have little effect on heart rate or blood pressure. However during asthma or COPD attacks or anaphylactic shock it is sometimes the case that a significant increase or decrease in heart rate accompanies airway constriction. In cases of unsafe or suboptimal heart rates the teachings of the present invention permit not only prompt airway dilation but also an improved heart rate to enable subsequent life saving measures that otherwise would be ineffective or impossible due to severe constriction or other physiological effects. Treatment in accordance with the present invention provides not only bronchodilation but also optionally improved heart function for a long enough period of time that administered medication such as epinephrine has time to take effect before the patient suffocates. This is because the stimulating blocking and or modulating signal can also improve the heart function by potentially elevating or decreasing heart rate.

Furthermore as an option in the present invention parameters of the stimulation may be modulated by the control unit to control the impulse generator in such a way as to temporally modulate stimulation by the magnetic stimulator coil or electrodes in such a way as to achieve and maintain the heart rate within safe or desired limits. In that case the parameters of the stimulation are individually raised or lowered in increments power frequency etc. and the effect as an increased unchanged or decreased heart rate is stored in the memory of the control unit . When the heart rate changes to a value outside the specified range the control unit automatically resets the parameters to values that had been recorded to produce a heart rate within that range or if no heart rate within that range has yet been achieved it increases or decreases parameter values in the direction that previously acquired data indicate would change the heart rate in the direction towards a heart rate in the desired range. Similarly the arterial blood pressure is also recorded non invasively in an embodiment of the invention and as described above the control unit extracts the systolic diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure from the blood pressure waveform. The control unit will then control the impulse generator in such a way as to temporally modulate nerve stimulation by the magnetic stimulator coil or electrodes in such a way as to achieve and maintain the blood pressure within predetermined safe or desired limits by the same method that was indicated above for the heart rate. Thus even if one does not intend to treat bronchoconstriction embodiments of the invention described above may be used to achieve and maintain the heart rate and blood pressure within desired ranges.

Let the measured output variables of the system in be denoted by y i 1 to Q let the desired reference or setpoint values of ybe denoted by rand let the controller s input to the system consist of variables u j 1 to P . The objective is for a controller to select the input uin such a way that the output variables or a subset of them closely follows the reference signals r i.e. the control error e r yis small even if there is environmental input or noise to the system. Consider the error function e r yto be the sensed physiological input to the controller in i.e. the reference signals are integral to the controller which subtracts the measured system values from them to construct the control error signal . The controller will also receive a set of measured environmental signals v k 1 to R which also act upon the system as shown in .

The functional form of the system s input u t is constrained to be as shown in . Ordinarily a parameter that needs adjusting is the one associated with the amplitude of the signal shown in . As a first example of the use of feedback to control the system consider the problem of adjusting the input u t from the vagus nerve stimulator i.e. output from the controller in order to compensate for motion artifacts.

Nerve activation is generally a function of the second spatial derivative of the extracellular potential along the nerve s axon which would be changing as the position of the stimulator varies relative to the axon F. RATTAY. The basic mechanism for the electrical stimulation of the nervous system. Neuroscience 89 2 1999 335 346 . Such motion artifact can be due to movement by the patient e.g. neck movement or movement within the patient e.g. sternocleidomastoid muscle contraction associated with respiration or it can be due to movement of the stimulator relative to the body slippage or drift . Thus one expects that because of such undesired or unavoidable motion there will usually be some error e r y in the intended r versus actual y nerve stimulation amplitude that needs continuous adjustment.

Accelerometers can be used to detect all these types of movement using for example Model LSM330DL from STMicroelectronics 750 Canyon Dr 300 Coppell Tex. 75019. One or more accelerometer is attached to the patient s neck and one or more accelerometer is attached to the head of the stimulator in the vicinity of where the stimulator contacts the patient. Because the temporally integrated outputs of the accelerometers provide a measurement of the current position of each accelerometer the combined accelerometer outputs make it possible to measure any movement of the stimulator relative to the underlying tissue.

The location of the vagus nerve underlying the stimulator may be determined preliminarily by placing an ultrasound probe at the location where the center of the stimulator will be placed KNAPPERTZ V A Tegeler C H Hardin S J McKinney W M. Vagus nerve imaging with ultrasound anatomic and in vivo validation. Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 118 1 1998 82 5 . The ultrasound probe is configured to have the same shape as the stimulator including the attachment of one or more accelerometer. As part of the preliminary protocol the patient with accelerometers attached is then instructed to perform neck movements breathe deeply so as to contract the sternocleidomastoid muscle and generally simulate possible motion that may accompany prolonged stimulation with the stimulator. This would include possible slippage or movement of the stimulator relative to an initial position on the patient s neck. While these movements are being performed the accelerometers are acquiring position information and the corresponding location of the vagus nerve is determined from the ultrasound image. With these preliminary data it is then possible to infer the location of the vagus nerve relative to the stimulator given only the accelerometer data during a stimulation session by interpolating between the previously acquired vagus nerve position data as a function of accelerometer position data.

For any given position of the stimulator relative to the vagus nerve it is also possible to infer the amplitude of the electric field that it produces in the vicinity of the vagus nerve. This is done by calculation or by measuring the electric field that is produced by the stimulator as a function of depth and position within a phantom that simulates the relevant bodily tissue Francis Marion MOORE. Electrical Stimulation for pain suppression mathematical and physical models.

Mathematical Modelling of Vagus Nerve Stimulation. pp. 92 97 in Krawczyk A. Electromagnetic Field Health and Environment Proceedings of EHE 07. Amsterdam IOS Press 2008 . Thus in order to compensate for movement the controller may increase or decrease the amplitude of the output from the stimulator u in proportion to the inferred deviation of the amplitude of the electric field in the vicinity of the vagus nerve relative to its desired value.

For present purposes no distinction is made between a system output variable and a variable representing the state of the system. Then a state space representation or model of the system consists of a set of first order differential equations of the form d y dt F t y u v r where t is time and where in general the rate of change of each variable yis a function F of many other output variables as well as the input and environmental signals.

Classical control theory is concerned with situations in which the functional form of Fis as a linear combination of the state and input variables but in which coefficients of the linear terms are not necessarily known in advance. In this linear case the differential equations may be solved with linear transform e.g. Laplace transform methods which convert the differential equations into algebraic equations for straightforward solution. Thus for example a single input single output system dropping the subscripts on variables may have input from a controller of the form 

Optimal selection of the parameters of the controller could be through calculation if the coefficients of the corresponding state differential equation were known in advance. However they are ordinarily not known so selection of the controller parameters tuning is accomplished by experiments in which the error e either is or is not used to form the system input respectively closed loop or open loop experiments . In an open loop experiment the input is increased in a step or random binary sequence of steps and the system response is measured. In a closed loop experiment the integral and derivative gains are set to zero the proportional gain is increased until the system starts to oscillate and the period of oscillation is measured. Depending on whether the experiment is open or closed loop the selection of PID parameter values may then be selected according to rules that were described initially by Ziegler and Nichols. There are also many improved versions of tuning rules including some that can be implemented automatically by the controller LI Y. Ang K. H. and Chong G. C. Y.

Commercial versions of PID controllers are available and they are used in 90 of all control applications. However performance of system control can be improved by combining the feedback closed loop control of a PID controller with feed forward control wherein knowledge about the system s future behavior can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. For example if the sensed environmental input in is such the environmental input to the system will have a deleterious effect on the system after a delay the controller may use this information to provide anticipatory control input to the system so as to avert or mitigate the deleterious effects that would have been sensed only after the fact with a feedback only controller. Because the present invention is concerned with anticipating and averting acute medical events the controller shown in will generally make use of feed forward methods Coleman BROSILOW Babu Joseph. Feedforward Control Chapter 9 In Techniques of Model Based Control. Upper Saddle River N.J. Prentice Hall PTR 2002. pp 221 240 . Thus the controller in may be a type of predictive controller methods for which have been developed in other contexts as well such as when a model of the system is used to calculate future outputs of the system with the objective of choosing among possible inputs so as to optimize a criterion that is based on future values of the system s output variables.

A mathematical model of the system is needed in order to perform the predictions of system behavior. Models that are completely based upon physical first principles white box are rare especially in the case of physiological systems. Instead most models that make use of prior structural and mechanistic understanding of the system are so called grey box models one of which is described below in connection with the forecasting of asthma attacks. If the mechanisms of the systems are not sufficiently understood in order to construct a white or grey box model a black box model may be used instead. Such models comprise autoregressive models Tim BOLLERSLEV. Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity.

For the present invention a grey box model is preferred but if a black box model must be used instead the preferred model will be one that makes use of support vector machines. A support vector machine SVM is an algorithmic approach to the problem of classification within the larger context of supervised learning. A number of classification problems whose solutions in the past have been solved by multi layer back propagation neural networks or more complicated methods have been found to be more easily solvable by SVMs. In the present context a training set of physiological data will have been acquired that includes whether or not the patient is experiencing some type of acute attack. Thus the classification of the patient s state is whether or not an attack is in progress and the data used to make the classification consist of the remaining acquired physiological data evaluated at A time units prior to the time at which the attack data are acquired. Thus the SVM is trained to forecast the imminence of an attack A time units into the future. After training the SVM it is implemented as part of the controller to sound an alarm and advise the use of vagal nerve stimulation whenever there is a forecast of an imminent attack Christopher J. C.

Although classical control theory works well for linear systems having one or only a few system variables special methods have been developed for systems in which the system is nonlinear i.e. the state space representation contains nonlinear differential equations or multiple input output variables. Such methods are important for the present invention because the physiological system to be controlled will be generally nonlinear and there will generally be multiple output physiological signals. It is understood that those methods may also be implemented in the controller shown in Torkel GLAD and Lennart Ljung. Control Theory. Multivariable and Nonlinear Methods. New York Taylor and Francis 2000 Zdzislaw BUBNICKI. Modern Control Theory. Berlin Springer 2005 .

Turning now to the use of feedback to control the system consider the problem of adjusting the input u t from the vagus nerve stimulator i.e. output from the controller in order to maintain the forced expiratory volume in one second FEV or an alternate lung function index FEV VC at a predetermined value using vagus nerve stimulation. Instead of using actual measurement of FEV surrogate measurements of FEVcan also be made namely pulsus paradoxus accessory muscle use or airway resistance Rint as now described.

Three types of non invasive measurements are currently recognized as being surrogates for the measurement of FEV1 pulsus paradoxus accessory muscle use and airway resistance. In the preferred embodiment pulsus paradoxus is measured which is based on the observation that in asthmatic patients as well as other patients experiencing bronchoconstriction the patient s blood pressure waveform will rise and fall as a function of the phase of respiration. In the preferred embodiment the blood pressure waveform and the magnitude of any accompanying pulsus paradoxus is measured non invasively with an arterial tonometer that is placed for example on the patient s wrist James RAYNER Flor Trespalacios Jason Machan Vijaya Potluri George Brown Linda M. Quattrucci and Gregory D. Jay. Continuous Noninvasive Measurement of Pulsus Paradoxus Complements Medical Decision Making in Assessment of Acute Asthma Severity. CHEST 130 2006 754 765 . Digitization and analysis of the blood pressure waveform may be performed in a computer dedicated to that purpose in which case the numerical value of the continuously varying pulsus paradoxus signal would be transferred to the control unit through a digital interface connecting the control unit and dedicated computer. Alternatively the control unit may contain an analog to digital converter to receive the analog tonometric signal and the analysis of the blood pressure waveform would be performed within the control unit . Instead of using an arterial tonometer to measure the blood pressure wave form and any accompanying pulsus paradoxus it is also possible to use a pulse oximeter attached for example to the patient s finger tip Donald H ARNOLD Cathy A Jenkins Tina V Hartert. Noninvasive assessment of asthma severity using pulse oximeter plethysmograph estimate of pulsus paradoxus physiology. BMC Pulmonary Medicine 10 2010 17 U.S. Pat. No. 7 044 917 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 869 402 entitled Method and apparatus for measuring pulsus paradoxus to Arnold . A dedicated computer may be used to acquire and analyze the blood pressure waveform and the magnitude of pulsus paradoxus which would be transferred to the control unit as indicated above for the tonometrically acquired signal or the analog pulse oximetry signal may be digitized and processed within the control unit as indicated above.

Accessory muscle use may also be used as a surrogate for the measurement of FEV1 ARNOLD D H Gebretsadik T Minton P A Higgins S Hartert T V Clinical measures associated with FEV1 in persons with asthma requiring hospital admission. Am J Emerg Med 25 2007 425 429 . The accessory muscles are not used during restful tidal breathing of a normal patient but are used during labored breathing. The sternocleidomastoid muscles are the most important accessory muscles of inspiration. They run from the mastoid processes to insert along the medial third of the clavicle. To measure their use a standard electromyogram may be performed the signal from which may be digitized and transferred to the control unit as indicated above T. DE MAYO R. Miralles D. Barrero A. Bulboa D. Carvajal S. Valenzuela and G. Ormeno. Breathing type and body position effects on sternocleidomastoid and suprahyoid EMG activity. Journal of Oral Rehabilitation 32 7 2005 487 494 Roberto MERLETTI Alberto Botter Amedeo Troiano Enrico Merlo Marco Alessandro Minetto. Technology and instrumentation for detection and conditioning of the surface electromyographic signal State of the art. Clinical Biomechanics 24 2009 122 134 . Alternatively non invasive plethysmography may be used to measure accessory muscle use because as ventilatory demands increase these muscles contract to lift the sternum and increase the anteroposterior diameter of the upper rib cage during inspiration. The anteroposterior diameter may be measured for example by respiratory inductance plethysmography RIP and electrical impedance tomography EIT . RIP uses elastic bands around the chest and abdomen to assess changes in lung volume. EIT measures regional impedance changes with electrodes around the patient s chest each of them injecting and receiving small currents. Such impedance changes have been correlated with dimensional changes of the lung. The plethysmography signal may be digitized and transferred to the control unit as indicated above as a measure of the extent to which rib cage geometry is changing as the result of accessory muscle use.

Another surrogate for the measurement of FEV1 is the measurement of airway resistance P. D. BRIDGE H. Lee M. Silverman. A portable device based on the interrupter technique to measure bronchodilator response in schoolchildren. Eur Respir J 9 1996 1368 1373 . Airway resistance is defined as the ratio of the difference between mean alveolar pressure and airway opening pressure to flow measured at the mouth and it may be measured using devices that are commercially available e.g. MicroRint Catalog No. MR5000 from Micromedical Ltd. and Cardinal Health UK 232 Ltd The Crescent Jays Close Basingstoke RG22 4BS U.K. . Such devices have a serial or USB port that permits the control unit to instruct the device to perform the airway resistance measurement and receive the airway resistance data in return via a serial or USB port in the control unit . Because the measurement is necessarily intermittent rather than continuous and because it requires the patient to breathe passively through a mouthpiece or face mask this surrogate for the measurement of FEV1 is not the preferred one. For those measurements that give intermittent readings interpolation may be used to construct a continuous surrogate signal of FEV1 or other measured signals which may be designated as the system output y t .

The functional form of the system s input u t is constrained to be as shown in . Ordinarily the parameter that needs adjusting is the one associated with the amplitude of the signal shown in which should be increased or decreased to accommodate motion related changes and drift. Rather than adjust the amplitude manually one may use the PID that was described above wherein the gains of the PID are tuned according to the Ziegler Nichols or other rules. Thereafter the PID adjusts the amplitude automatically so as to best maintain the patient s FEVor surrogate value at a preferred value. The default amplitude parameter is then reset according to its average value over time as the PID continuously adjusts the value of the input u t thorough adjustment of the stimulator signal s amplitude and any other parameters that may have been tuned .

If feedforward rather than or in addition to feedback is to be used to control the system a feedforward model must be specified. The paragraphs that follow describe such a feedforward model which is based on the observation that bronchial smooth muscle may be oscillating. The properties of oscillators are currently understood through the analysis of differential equation prototypes such as Duffing s oscillator 

Duffing s equation describes oscillations in the displacement y that are qualitatively different than those exhibited by a linear harmonic driven oscillator. Because it embodies a double well potential it is appropriate when a system is preferentially in one of two states such as a constricted state versus a dilated state as in the case of a bronchiole oscillator. If there were more than two preferential states a potential having three or more wells may be assumed as would be the case if the bronchiole oscillator had relaxed dilated and intermediate states. A network of coupled oscillators is constructed by making the displacement of one oscillator be a function of one or more of the other oscillators displacements i.e. by coupling each oscillator to other oscillators. Each oscillator in the network can in general have different parameter values and the network can have different forms of local or non local coupling.

Other well studied non linear oscillators include Van der Pol FitzHugh Nagumo Morris Lecar Ellias Grossberg and Stuart Landau. Although the detailed oscillations described by such prototypical equations are dependent on the detailed form of the equations and their initial conditions the qualitative behaviors of such non linear coupled oscillator equations may often be understood independently of the particular form of the non linear equation. For example it is well understood in general that non linear oscillators including a set of coupled non linear oscillators may exhibit qualitatively different behaviors when the parameters of their equations lie within certain bounds. When graphs are drawn showing the value of one parameter on one axis and the value of another parameter on another axis regions of this parameter space may be circumscribed to show what sets of parameter values correspond to each type of qualitatively different dynamics i.e. a phase diagram. Examples of such phase diagrams are given by MATTHEWS and STROGATZ which circumscribe different regions of phase space having qualitatively different dynamics and which are also described below in connection with Paul C. MATTHEWS and Steven H. Strogatz. Phase diagram for the collective behavior of limit cycle oscillators. Phys. Rev. Lett. 65 1990 1701 1704 .

When dealing with coupled nonlinear oscillators such as coupled Duffing oscillators the two or more oscillators may eventually all oscillate with the same phase or they may prefer to oscillate with unrelated phases again depending on the range in which the parameter values lie. In the case of a two well oscillator the relation between the phase of different oscillators refers not only to simultaneously occurring peaks and valleys of displacement but also whether oscillators are simultaneously trapped in the same potential well. Chimera states in which part of the system is phase locked and simultaneously another part of the system exhibits oscillators with unrelated phases are also possible. Chimera states may be particularly significant in regards to the regional inhomogeneity of the lung when one portion of the lung exhibits unrelated phases and another region exhibits phase locking. These qualitatively different types of dynamic behavior are influenced by the presence of noise and they are exhibited by nonlinear oscillators generally of which the Duffing oscillator is only one example GUEVARA M.

When one or more of the parameters of the set of coupled nonlinear oscillators may be varied under external influences to produce qualitative changes of phase in the system the parameter is said to be an order parameter. According to the present invention bronchioles of the lung may be represented mathematically as nonlinear oscillators that are coupled to one another and an order parameter for the system is the concentration of an environmental lung irritant as shown in . Another order parameter is related to the magnitude and duration of vagus nerve stimulation which will be described below. Consider first only the changes in phase that occur as the concentration of the irritant increases. Moving along the lower axis in at increasing irritant concentration the successive phases that are encountered as the concentration is increased are called successively phase drift irregular region and phase locked. The dynamics of the system in each of those phases is represented in in which the average over multiple bronchioles of bronchiole constriction is shown as a function of time. For present purposes bronchial constriction may be defined as the average of y y over many bronchioles where yis a time averaged radius in a normal bronchiole and y is a bronchiole displacement from that radius such that as y becomes smaller the constriction becomes larger.

Within the phase drift phase there are only small fluctuations of constriction amplitude averaged over many bronchioles. This corresponds to a situation in which the bronchioles are oscillating more or less independently of one another. Within the irregular phase there are small fluctuations along with occasional irregularly timed large amplitude constrictions. The dynamics are not periodic but may instead exhibit aperiodic dynamics such as deterministic chaos Hopf oscillation quasiperiodicity and large oscillation Paul C. MATTHEWS and Steven H. Strogatz. Phase diagram for the collective behavior of limit cycle oscillators. Phys. Rev. Lett. 65 1990 1701 1704 Paul C. MATTHEWS Renato E. Mirollo and Steven H. Strogatz. Dynamics of a large system of coupled nonlinear oscillators. Physica D Nonlinear Phenomena 52 2 3 1991 293 331 . During the phase locked phase there are large amplitude constrictions as evidenced by the average of the displacement y over many bronchioles. In that phase the constrictions correspond to almost all bronchioles in some region s of the lung being trapped in one well of the double well potential namely the well corresponding to a constricted bronchiole as would occur in an asthma attack. However the lung as a whole may also be in a chimera state wherein some regions of the lung are in one phase such as the phase locked phase while other regions of the lung may be in some other phase such as the phase drift phase so that not all bronchioles of the lung need be constricted during an asthma attack.

Irritant concentrations may be measured non invasively in real time for an ambulatory patient Kirk J. ENGLEHARDT and John Toon. Asthma attack Vest based sensors monitor environmental exposure to help understand causes web page www at the Georgia Tech Research Institute .gtri of Georgia Tech .gatech educational domain .edu in subdomain casestudy asthma vest helps id asthma causes patent application US20110144515 entitled Systems and methods for providing environmental monitoring to BAYER et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 7 119 900 entitled Pollen sensor and method to OKUMURA et al . For physical external irritants the unit of irritation should be selected accordingly such as temperature for cold air as an irritant.

It is understood however that in some patients external irritant triggers are hard to identify and some irritant triggers may well be endogenous substances. In that case according to the invention a surrogate for an unknown or endogenous trigger concentration may be the concentration of exhaled nitric oxide which can be measured noninvasively using miniature gas sensors placed in the vicinity of the patient s mouth GILL M Walker S Khan A Green S M Kim L Gray 5 Krauss B. Exhaled nitric oxide levels during acute asthma exacerbation. Acad Emerg Med 12 7 2005 579 86 Oleksandr KUZMYCH Brett L Allen and Alexander Star. Carbon nanotube sensors for exhaled breath components. Nanotechnology 18 2007 375502 pp 1 7 . Accordingly what is labeled as Concentration of Environmental Irritants in may be replaced by the concentration of any other exogenous or endogenous trigger or by a surrogate for an asthma trigger.

Referring again to the phase diagram in note that the vertical axis is labeled as Accumulated Vagus Nerve Stimulation Effects. According to the present invention the effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation in inhibiting bronchiole constriction is a function of the electric field produced by the stimulation and its waveform the duration of the stimulation and if stimulation has ceased the time since cessation of the last stimulation. Let the numerical value of the accumulated Accumulated Vagus Nerve Stimulation Effects with a particular stimulation waveform be denoted as S t . It may for present purposes be represented as a function that increases at a rate proportional to the stimulation electric field V at the site of the nerve and decays with a time constant such that after prolonged stimulation the accumulated stimulation effectiveness will saturate at a value equal to the product of V and . Thus if Tis the duration of a vagal nerve stimulation then for time tT S t S T exp t T where the time t is measured from the start of a stimulus and Sis the value of S when t 0. Then according to as electrical stimuli to the vagus nerve are applied it is possible for the lung system as a whole to switch from one phase of bronchial constriction to another even if the lung is exposed to a constant irritant environment.

For example if the system begins in the phase locked phase shown in asthma attack it can be simulated up and out of that phase into the phase drift phase and after stimulus ceases the system will eventually decay back into the phase locked phase assuming that the patient s physiology remains stationary . The situation with any given individual would depend upon that individual s particular phase diagram but if the individual has a diagram like the one shown in then the best strategy for preventing or terminating unwanted bronchoconstriction would be to stimulate the vagus nerve for as long as possible with as high an electric field as possible so as to drive the system out of its current phase and into the phase drift phase or maintain it in the drift phase for as long as possible. However that strategy may not be practical because at some electric field the stimulus would be too painful and would produce side effects. In any event the vagus nerve stimulation is not intended to be continuous as could have been the case with an implanted stimulator. Furthermore because of decay of the accumulated stimulus effect additional stimulation may be increasingly ineffective as the effect saturates at a level determined by the stimulation electric field V and decay time constant .

Implementation of this model of an asthma attack requires a more detailed mathematical embodiment of the invention. For example in one embodiment the bronchiole oscillators are represented as coupled Duffing oscillators as in the following equations with two oscillators. Such a representation can be expanded to any number of oscillators by making all oscillators coupled to all other oscillators so as to emphasize neural or humoral feedback loops or only to oscillators bronchioles in proximity to one another so as to emphasize local nearest neighbor effects or some intermediate coupling configuration.

According to the invention the presence of irritant in the airstream of any bronchiole or other trigger surrogate is accounted for by making parameters describing the potential P be a function of the flow and concentration of environmental irritant. For example with the asymmetric potential

An increase in the parameter c would increase the stability of the potential well corresponding to bronchoconstriction independently of any changes in the flow. Accordingly stimulation of the bronchioles by histamine the parasympathetic nervous system or any other factor that promotes bronchoconstriction should be accompanied by an increase in the parameter c. Conversely a decrease in the parameter c would increase the stability of the potential well corresponding to bronchodilation. Accordingly stimulation of the bronchioles by epinephrine the sympathetic nervous system or any other factor that promotes bronchodilation should be accompanied by a decrease in the parameter c. For example one may write c as c c c where an increase in ccaused bronchoconstriction and an increase in ccauses bronchodilation. Then the vagal nerve stimulation S t which was defined above may be introduced through the parameter c. For example . . . .

Breathing is to some extent under voluntary control so that an individual can deliberately vary the driving function t . On the other hand breathing is also to some extent involuntary and controlled by the nervous system. Accordingly one may expand the above model to account for respiratory reflexes H. T. MILHORN Jr. R. Benton R. Ross and A. C. Guyton. A mathematical model of the human respiratory control system. Biophys J. 5 1965 27 46 . To do so the coupling parameter s may also be made to be a function of multiple oscillator values possibly at a previous time t A so as to account for the time delay A in neural reflexes between afferent signals and efferent effects that couple oscillators to one another. Such an expanded neural control model may be used to forecast t or alternatively non physiological models may be used to forecast future values of t based on previous values of t CAMINAL P Domingo L Giraldo B F Vallverd M Benito S Vazquez G Kaplan D. Variability analysis of the respiratory volume based on non linear prediction methods. Med Biol Eng Comput 42 1 2004 86 91 . It is understood that additional extensions of the above dynamical model may make the anatomy and physiology more complete accurate or detailed for example one may wish to create a more realistic model of the patient s lung anatomy than what was described above LEE S. L. A. Kouzani A. Z. Hu E. J. From lung images to lung models A review. IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 2008 2377 2383 .

Usefulness of this method is dependent on the extent to which the patient is willing to undergo measurement to allow estimation of an embodiment of the equations parameters. It is understood that the measurement will consist of a period of baseline monitoring followed by a period during which the vagus nerve is stimulated using a default stimulation protocol or during which vagal nerve stimulation parameters are varied. The most useful measurements would be ones in which nearby groups of bronchioles are measured separately so as to be able to estimate parameters separately for those localized groups of oscillators. This will require imaging of the lung in order to evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of bronchiolar constriction.

Many methods exist for the noninvasive imaging of the lung. However the noninvasive imaging methods that are preferred here are those that may be performed by continuous noninvasive ambulatory monitoring. At the present time the preferred imaging methods comprise electrical impedance tomography and acoustic imaging. Electrical impedance tomography EIT is an imaging technique in which an image of the conductivity of the chest is inferred from surface electrical measurements. To perform EIT conducting electrodes are attached to the skin of the patient and small alternating currents are applied to some or all of the electrodes. The resulting electrical potentials are measured and the process may be repeated for numerous different configurations of applied current. A calculation is then performed to infer the lung structure that could have given rise to the measured electrical potentials David HOLDER.

The other noninvasive ambulatory imaging method acoustic imaging involves the placement of multiple microphones on the patient s chest and back. It is particularly useful to detect and localize groups of bronchioles that have abruptly opened and made a corresponding sound KOMPIS M Pasterkamp H Wodicka G R. Acoustic imaging of the human chest.

Estimation of parameters of the equations from continuously acquired data may be made using existing methods such as the multiple shooting and recursive e.g. Kalman filter approaches Henning U. VOSS and Jens Timmer. Nonlinear dynamical system identification from uncertain and indirect measurements.

Estimation of parameters in nonlinear systems using balanced synchronization. Physical Review E 77 2008 016208 pp 1 14 . As the patient s ambulatory data evolve in time the estimated parameters may also evolve in time and must be updated.

After parameter estimation numerical simulation with the coupled oscillator equations into the future may forecast the imminent onset of an asthma attack i.e. an abrupt transition wherein groups of bronchioles constrict see . It is understood that the simulation must occur at a rate that is significantly faster than actual time otherwise there would be little warning for the patient. When such a warning is given the patient or a caregiver would perform vagus nerve stimulation as described above in order to avert the asthma attack.

For situations in which it is impractical to use the above gray box model of asthma for example if the patient is unwilling to wear the electrical impedance tomography and acoustic imaging sensors for measuring respiratory heterogeneity then one may instead use the black box approach that was described above using the remaining sensors respiration environmental sensors etc. . In that case the patient would mark the onset of an asthma attack with an event button and the set of ambulatory measurements would be used to train a support vector machine classifier model. After training that model could be used to forecast the asthma attack and advise the patient to perform vagus nerve stimulation or to select stimulation parameters so as to most rapidly terminate an ongoing bronchoconstrictive exacerbation.

In another aspect of the invention the applicant has discovered that many seemingly disparate disorders may in fact have common causes that manifest into different symptoms or disorders in different individuals. Specifically the applicant has discovered that in certain individuals who may suffer from disorders such as depression asthma COPD migraine cluster headache anxiety fibromyalgia epilepsy and the like certain areas of the brain are prone to periodic or continuous excessive excitatory neurotransmitter levels. These periodic excessive excitatory neurotransmitter levels can be caused by certain triggers such as noxious substances entering the lungs that cause airway reactivity or other triggers such as chocolate or seafood that can cause migraines in certain individuals. In other cases the patient may have pathologically high excitatory neurotransmitter levels on a continuous basis without any particular trigger. One example of an excitatory neurotransmitter is glutamate which is known to be associated with migraines.

The excessive excitatory neurotransmitter levels in a patient s brain can be caused by inaccurate signals from the body transmitted through the vagus nerve or other nerves or these excessive levels can be caused by the brain overreacting to normal signals coming from the body. In some cases these excessive excitatory neurotransmitter levels may be caused by inappropriate inactivity in the production and or release of inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA serotonin and or norepinephrine. A reduced level of these inhibitory neurotransmitter levels can result in excessive levels of the excitatory neurotransmitters that they are meant to balance.

The present invention seeks to address this imbalance in neurotransmitters in the brain that can result in many of the disorders mentioned above. Specifically afferent nerve fibers in the vagus nerve are stimulated with the devices signals and methods described above to heighten activity in areas of the brain e.g. the periaqueducatal gray locus ceruleus and or raphe nuclei resulting in the release of inhibitory neurotransmitter levels such as GABA norephinephrine and or serotonin . For example as discussed above heightened activity in the locus coeruleus will result in a release of norephinephrine or an increase the release of norephinephrine. This release of inhibitory neurotransmitters suppresses the excessive excitatory neurotransmitters and creates balance in the brain such that the brain either does not overreact to certain stimuli and or to modulate the pathologically high level of excitatory neurotransmitters.

Although the invention herein has been described with reference to particular embodiments it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present invention. It is therefore to be understood that numerous modifications may be made to the illustrative embodiments and that other arrangements may be devised without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
