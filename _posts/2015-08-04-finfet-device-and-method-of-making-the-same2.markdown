This disclosure relates generally to tunnel field effect transistor and more specifically but not exclusively to finFETs.

CMOS technology has been scaling down in size for 40 years under the guidance of Moore s law. To continue scaling tunnel field effect transistors TFETs such as finFETs are being used. It has been understood that TFETs have advantages for low power applications because of its intrinsic low sub threshold swing and low off state leakage. TFETS are further improved by using strained silicon. Strained silicon refers to the application of stress uniaxial and biaxial stress in the structure to create changes in the direct gate tunneling current. Decreases increases in the gate tunneling current for various stresses primarily result from repopulation into a sub band with a larger smaller out of plane effective mass. Hole tunneling current is found to decrease for biaxial and uniaxial compressive stress and increase for biaxial tensile stress. For p type finFETs the gate tunneling current increases for biaxial tensile stress but decreases for biaxial and longitudinal compressive stresses. For n type finFETS the opposite occurs. FinFET devices are being adopted for advanced CMOS technology nodes such as 22 nm 14 16 nm and future 10 nm and 7 nm node for improved drivability and short channel effect. However traditional strain enhancement such as embedded SiGe for p channel metal oxide semiconductor PMOS has shown reduced effectiveness due to smaller SiGe volume from scaled fin source and drain regions.

Accordingly there is a need for systems apparatus and methods that improve upon conventional strain enhancement approaches including the improved methods system and apparatus provided hereby.

Accordingly the dimensions of the depicted features may be arbitrarily expanded or reduced for clarity. In accordance with common practice some of the drawings are simplified for clarity. Thus the drawings may not depict all components of a particular apparatus or method. Further like reference numerals denote like features throughout the specification and figures.

The exemplary methods apparatus and systems disclosed herein advantageously address the need for improved strain enhancement in finFET devices. Gate stress has a stronger effect in the scaled channel region of a finFET device. By breaking the gate at different distances to the fin stress strain is induced in the fin channel region which will enhance or degrade device performance depending on the device type NMOS or PMOS and strain type tensile or compressive . In one example a break is made in the gate element at a desired position without completely breaking the gate element so that it maintains conductivity for circuit functionality. In another example an active gate element is above an active fin element and a dummy fin element that partially breaks the active gate element. In another example a dummy gate element adjacent to an active gate element contains a dummy fin element that partially breaks the dummy gate element. In another example a first dummy fin element partially breaks an active gate element and a second dummy fin element partially breaks a dummy gate element. In another example the dummy fin element is of the same material as the active fin element. In another example the dummy fin element partially breaks a gate element but does not extend to the substrate like the active fin element.

In the following examples a dummy fin element is shown and described. However it should be understood that the break or cut made in a gate element by the dummy fin element may be made without the use of a dummy fin element such as an open break. In addition the following examples use the term active and dummy where active is intended to signify that the element is part of an active working transistor and dummy is intended to signify that the element is part of an inactive non working transistor. and B illustrate a finFET device with a dummy fin element in an active gate element in accordance with some examples of the disclosure. As shown in the top down view of a finFET device may include an active gate element extending horizontally from left to right a first dummy gate element extending in parallel and spaced from the active gate element and a second dummy gate element extending in parallel and spaced from the active gate element on an opposite side of the active gate element from the first dummy gate element . It should be understood that although two dummy gate elements are shown there may be more than two.

The finFET device may include a first dummy fin element under and perpendicular to the active gate element that extends to both sides of the active gate element towards the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element a first active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the first dummy fin element that extends parallel to the first dummy fin element under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element a second active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the first active fin element that extends parallel to the first active fin element under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element a third active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the second active fin element that extends parallel to the second active fin element under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element a fourth active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the first active fin element opposite the first active fin element that extends parallel to the first active fin element under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element a fifth active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the fourth active fin element that extends parallel to the fourth active fin element under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element and a sixth active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the fifth active fin element that extends parallel to the fifth active fin element under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element .

As shown in the partial side view of along the cut lines indicated in the finFET device may include a substrate an isolation layer on a first side of the substrate the first dummy fin element extending from the first side of the substrate through the isolation layer and partially into the active gate element the first active fin element extending from the first side of the substrate through the isolation layer and partially into the active gate element the fourth active fin element a gate isolation layer surrounding the portions of the first dummy fin element the first active fin element and the fourth active fin element within the active gate element and a interlayer dielectric layer on a first surface of the active gate element . The width of the first dummy fin element the active fin elements and may be approximately 10 nm wide. The height of the first dummy fin element the active fin elements and may be approximately 30 50 nm high. The isolation layer and the gate isolation layer may be composed of oxide nitride or other non conductive material.

The first dummy fin element creates an additional break in the active gate element that releases the compressive stress in the active gate element . By releasing the compressive stress in the active gate element the drain saturation current may be changed. For example in a finFET configured as a p channel metal oxide semiconductor PMOS transistor the stress release may cause the drain saturation current to decrease by up to approximately 45 . In a finFET configured as an n channel metal oxide semiconductor NMOS transistor the stress release may cause the drain saturation current to increase by up to approximately 55 . The increase or decrease in the drain saturation current is caused by the increase in the flow of holes or electrons depending on the carrier for the particular transistor in the active fin elements fin channel region between the source and drain regions to either side of the gate element resulting from the release of stress in the active gate element. Thus the first dummy fin element in the active gate element enhances a PMOS configured finFET while degrading an NMOS configured finFET.

The finFET device may include a first dummy fin element under and perpendicular to the first dummy gate element that extends to both sides of the first dummy gate element a second dummy fin element under and perpendicular to the second dummy gate element that extends to both sides of the second dummy gate element a first active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the first dummy fin element and the second dummy fin element that extends parallel to the first dummy fin element and the second dummy fin element and a fourth active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the first active fin element with the first dummy fin element and the second dummy fin element between the first active fin element and the fourth active fin element .

As shown in the partial side view of along the cut lines indicated in the finFET device may include a substrate an isolation layer on the substrate the first active fin element extending from the substrate through the isolation layer and partially into the active gate element the fourth active fin element extending from the substrate through the isolation layer and partially into the active gate element a gate isolation layer surrounding the portions of the first active fin element and the fourth active fin element within the active gate element and a interlayer dielectric layer on the active gate element . While not shown in the first dummy fin element and the second dummy fin element extending from the substrate through the isolation layer and partially into the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element respectively similar to that shown in .

The first dummy fin element and the second dummy fin element create an additional break in the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element respectively. These breaks release the compressive stress in the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element respectively. By releasing the compressive stress in the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element mechanical coupling between the active gate element and the dummy gate elements and causes a reduction in the tensile stress of the adjacent active gate element . Reducing the tensile stress in the active gate element may change the drain saturation current. For example in a finFET configured as a PMOS transistor the tensile stress release may cause the drain saturation current to increase. In a finFET configured as an NMOS transistor the tensile stress release may cause the drain saturation current to decrease. Thus the dummy fin elements and in the dummy gate elements and enhance an NMOS configured finFET while degrading a PMOS configured finFET.

The finFET device may include a first active fin element extending perpendicular to and under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element a second active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the first active fin element that extends parallel to the first active fin element under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element a third active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the second active fin element that extends parallel to the second active fin element under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element a fourth active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the first active fin element opposite the first active fin element that extends parallel to the first active fin element under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element a fifth active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the fourth active fin element that extends parallel to the fourth active fin element under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element a sixth active fin element adjacent to and spaced from the fifth active fin element that extends parallel to the fifth active fin element under the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element .

The finFET device may include a first dummy fin element under and perpendicular to the active gate element between the first active fin element and the fourth active fin element a second dummy fin element under and perpendicular to the active gate element adjacent to the third active fin element on an opposite side from the second active fin element a third dummy fin element under and perpendicular to the first dummy gate element adjacent to the sixth active fin element on an opposite side from the fifth active fin element and a fourth dummy fin element under and perpendicular to the second dummy gate element adjacent to the sixth active fin element on an opposite side from the fifth active fin element .

As shown in the partial side view of along the cut lines indicated in the finFET device may include a substrate an isolation layer on the substrate the first dummy fin element extending from the substrate through the isolation layer and partially into the active gate element the first active fin element extending from the substrate through the isolation layer and partially into the active gate element the fourth active fin element extending from the substrate through the isolation layer and partially into the active gate element a gate isolation layer surrounding the portions of the first dummy fin element the first active fin element and the fourth active fin element within the active gate element and a interlayer dielectric layer on the active gate element . While not shown in the second dummy fin element the third dummy fin element and the fourth dummy fin element extend from the substrate through the isolation layer and partially into the active gate element the first dummy gate element and the second dummy gate element respectively similar to that shown in .

For the finFET device the active gate element over the fourth active fin element the fifth active fin element and the sixth active fin element may be configured as an NMOS transistor device while the active gate element over the first active fin element the second active fin element and the third active fin element may be configured as a PMOS transistor device. Thus the finFET device may contain both an enhanced PMOS device and an enhanced NMOS device in the same structure. It should be noted that the first dummy fin element is closer to the first active fin element than the fourth active fin element . This way the effect of the first dummy fin element enhances the PMOS device on the left without substantially degrading the performing of the NMOS device on the right. Alternatively the PMOS device and the NMOS device may be a type device or a type device.

As shown in the partial side view of along the cut lines indicated in the finFET device may include a substrate an isolation layer on the substrate the first dummy fin element extending from the substrate through the isolation layer and partially into the active gate element a gate isolation layer surrounding the portion of the first dummy fin element within the active gate element and a interlayer dielectric layer on the active gate element . The first dummy fin element the first active fin element and the fourth active fin element may be composed of the same conductive material. By having the first dummy fin element composed of the same material as the first and fourth active fin elements and as well as other active fin elements allows the dummy fin element to be constructed in the same manner and at the same time as the first active fin element and the fourth active fin element . This will allow a simplified more efficient and cost effective manufacturing process.

As shown in the partial side view of along the cut lines indicated in the finFET device may include a substrate an isolation layer on the substrate the first dummy fin element extending from a second surface of the active gate element upward partially into the active gate element the first active fin element and the fourth active fin element extending from the substrate through the isolation layer and partially into the active gate element a gate isolation layer surrounding the portions of the first dummy fin element the first active fin element and the fourth active fin element within the active gate element and a interlayer dielectric layer on the active gate element . The width of the first dummy fin element may be approximately 20 nm wide while the width of the active fin elements and may be approximately 10 nm wide. By having the dummy fin element on top of the isolation layer the manufacture of the finFET device may be easier with less material cost and fewer steps. By increasing the width of the first dummy fin element greater than the active fin elements the amount of stress relief can be increased without the need to impact the width of the active fin elements that would have an impact on the channel regions of the finFET device .

As shown in the process continues in with removal of the first oxide film. Next in the second oxide film is removed and an oxide silicon nitride SiN hard mask HM film is applied. In a fin element is patterned such as the first dummy fin element and the active fin elements and in then a shallow trench isolation STI oxide is applied before a chemical mechanical planarization CMP process followed by dipping the structure to form an STI oxide layer. In a gate isolation layer such as gate isolation layer is deposited along with a dummy poly gate film and then patterned to form gate elements such as the active gate element first dummy gate element and second dummy gate element in . In an interlayer dielectric such as interlayer dielectric layer in oxide is applied followed by a CMP process.

As shown in the process continues in with the removal of the dummy poly gate film and gate isolation layer depositing a high K HK film and metal gate for N and PFET and followed by separate CMP process for the gate elements. In another oxide film is deposited an N source region is opened and the EPI P source extension is formed. In another oxide film is deposited a P source region is opened and the EPI N source extension is formed. In the ILD oxide to gate layer is removed a SiN layer is deposited and then etched back to form a source spacer. In the process concludes with depositing an ILD layer and application of a CMP process followed by the formation of the source contact and the drain contact separately.
