Humans and other mammals have numerous microbial niches and interventions to modulate the microbiota thereof have been focused on antibiotics which effect largely non specific eradication of the microbiota in an effort to target a pathogen probiotics largely in the form of lactic acid producing bacteria in food products prebiotics stimulatory materials primarily carbohydrates that increase bacterial growth and or activity and synbiotics combinations of prebiotics and probiotics see e.g. WO 2011 022542 . Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are characterized by an inappropriate immunological intolerance or an abnormal immune response and affect up to 50 million Americans. Current treatments for such conditions such as immunosuppressant drugs carry a risk of dangerous systemic side effects such as infection organ damage and the development of new autoimmunities. There is therefore a need for improved diagnostic and prognostic measures preventative measures and treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

A healthy microbiota provides the host with multiple benefits including colonization resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens essential nutrient biosynthesis and absorption and immune stimulation that maintains a healthy gut epithelium and an appropriately controlled systemic immunity. In settings of dysbiosis or disrupted symbiosis microbiota functions can be lost or deranged resulting in increased susceptibility to pathogens altered metabolic profiles or induction of proinflammatory signals that can result in local or systemic inflammation or autoimmunity. Thus the intestinal microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of many diseases and disorders including a variety of pathogenic infections distal to the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore in response to the need for durable efficient and effective compositions and methods for treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases by way of restoring or enhancing microbiota functions the present invention provides compositions and methods for treatment and prevention of immune and inflammatory conditions associated with dysbiosis including dysbiosis distal to the gastrointestinal tract.

Disclosed herein are therapeutic compositions containing probiotic non pathogenic bacterial populations and networks thereof for the prevention control and treatment of diseases disorders and conditions in particular immune and inflammatory diseases. In some embodiments the therapeutic compositions contain prebiotics e.g. carbohydrates in conjunction with microbial populations and or networks thereof. These compositions are advantageous in being suitable for safe administration to humans and other mammalian subjects and are efficacious in numerous dysbiotic diseases disorders and conditions such as immune and inflammatory disease.

Table 1 provides a list of Operational Taxonomic Units OTU with taxonomic assignments made to Genus Species and Phylogenetic Clade. Clade membership of bacterial OTUs is based on 16S sequence data. Clades are defined based on the topology of a phylogenetic tree that is constructed from full length 16S sequences using maximum likelihood methods familiar to individuals with ordinary skill in the art of phylogenetics. Clades are constructed to ensure that all OTUs in a given clade are i within a specified number of bootstrap supported nodes from one another and ii within 5 genetic similarity. OTUs that are within the same clade can be distinguished as genetically and phylogenetically distinct from OTUs in a different clade based on 16S V4 sequence data while OTUs falling within the same clade are closely related. OTUs falling within the same clade are evolutionarily closely related and may or may not be distinguishable from one another using 16S V4 sequence data. Members of the same clade due to their evolutionary relatedness play similar functional roles in a microbial ecology such as that found in the human gut. Compositions substituting one species with another from the same clade are likely to have conserved ecological function and therefore are useful in the present invention. All OTUs are denoted as to their putative capacity to form spores and whether they are a Pathogen or Pathobiont see Definitions for description of Pathobiont . NIAID Priority Pathogens are denoted as Category A Category B or Category C and Opportunistic Pathogens are denoted as OP . OTUs that are not pathogenic or for which their ability to exist as a pathogen is unknown are denoted as N . The SEQ ID Number denotes the identifier of the OTU in the Sequence Listing File and Public DB Accession denotes the identifier of the OTU in a public sequence repository. See e.g. WO 2014 121304.

Table 1E provides a list of exemplary bacteria useful in the present invention. These bacteria are preferably down modulated in a subject.

Table 1F provides a list of exemplary bacteria that may be used in the invention. These bacteria are preferably up modulated in a subject.

Table 2C lists species identified as sporulatable using 16s V4 NGS approach. See e.g. WO 2014 121304.

Disclosed herein are therapeutic compositions e.g. pharmaceutical compositions containing bacterial entities e.g. anti inflammatory bacterial cells and optionally containing a prebiotic for the prevention control and treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases disorders and conditions. These compositions are advantageous in being suitable for safe administration to humans and other mammalian subjects and are efficacious in treating or preventing numerous immune and inflammatory diseases and gastrointestinal diseases disorders and conditions associated with a dysbiosis.

The microbes that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract skin lungs vagina and other niches are starting to be understood and appreciated for their roles in human health and disease see e.g. Human Microbiome Project Consortium 2012 NATURE 486 7402 207 14 . Aspects of the invention are based in part on the realization that although autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are often attributed to genetic mutations these conditions are also influenced by microbes. It is also appreciated that because microbes not only interact with the host but with one another the immunomodulatory behavior of microbes can depend on relationships between microbes. For example a microbial network in a given niche may comprise diverse microbes that all accomplish one or more of the same functions or may instead comprise diverse microbes that all individually contribute to accomplish one or more functions. For example microbes in a given niche may influence and or regulate the immunomodulatory behavior of other microbes in the same niche or in a distal niche. In another example microbes in a given niche may compete with one another for nutrients or space.

Microbes may influence the risk progression or treatment efficacy of an autoimmune or inflammatory disease. In certain aspects microbes play a role in the prevention of an autoimmune or inflammatory disease or in the suppression of an innate or adaptive immune response. Microbes may also stimulate an inflammatory immune response to contribute to increase the risk of or worsen the symptoms of an autoimmune or inflammatory disease. Some microbes may be associated with lower disease severity or mortality.

Also disclosed herein are compositions and methods for the prevention and or treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in human subjects.

Microbial agents individual or populations of microbes microbial networks or parts of networks or microbial metabolites are considered to be exogenous to a subject e.g. a human or non human animal a cell tissue organ or other environment of a human or non human animal if said subject or said cell tissue organ or other environment of the subject does not contain detectable levels of the microbial agent.

A microbial agent or population thereof is heterologous or heterologously contained on or in a host environment when e.g. the microbial agent or population is administered or disposed on or in the host or host environment in a number concentration form or other modality that is not found in the host prior to administration of the microbial agent or population or when the microbial agent or population contains an activity or structural component different from a host that does not naturally have the microbial agent within the target environment to which the microbe is administered or thereafter disposed.

 Backbone network ecology or simply backbone network or backbone are compositions of microbes that form a foundational composition that can be built upon or subtracted from to optimize a network ecology or functional network ecology to have specific biological characteristics or to comprise desired functional properties respectively. Microbiome therapeutics can be comprised of these backbone networks ecologies in their entirety or the backbone networks can be modified by the addition or subtraction of R groups to give the network ecology desired characteristics and properties. R groups can be defined in multiple terms including but not limited to individual OTUs individual or multiple OTUs derived from a specific phylogenetic clade or a desired phenotype such as the ability to form spores or functional bacterial compositions that comprise. Backbone networks can comprise a computationally derived network ecology in its entirety or can comprise subsets of the computationally derived network ecology that represent key nodes in the network that contribute to efficacy such as but not limited to a composition of Keystone OTUs. The number of organisms in a human gastrointestinal tract is indicative of the functional redundancy of a healthy gut microbiome ecology see e.g. The Human Microbiome Consortia 2012 . This redundancy makes it highly likely that non obvious subsets of OTUs or functional pathways i.e. backbone networks are critical to maintaining states of health and or catalyzing a shift from a dysbiotic state to one of health. One way of exploiting this redundancy is through the substitution of OTUs that share a given clade see below or by adding members of a clade not found in the backbone network.

 Bacterial composition refers to a consortium of microbes comprising two or more OTUs. Backbone network ecologies functional network ecologies network classes and core ecologies are all types of bacterial compositions. As used herein bacterial composition includes a therapeutic microbial composition a prophylactic microbial composition a spore population a purified spore population or an ethanol treated spore population.

 Bacterial translocation refers to the passage of one or more bacteria across the epithelial layer of any organ of a human or non human animal.

 Network ecology refers to a consortium of clades or OTUs that co occur in some number of subjects. As used herein a network is defined mathematically by a graph delineating how specific nodes i.e. clades or OTUs and edges connections between specific clades or OTUs relate to one another to define the structural ecology of a consortium of clades or OTUs. Any given network ecology will possess inherent phylogenetic diversity and functional properties.

A network ecology can also be defined in terms of its functional capabilities where for example the nodes would be comprised of elements such as but not limited to enzymes clusters of orthologous groups COGS http. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov books NBK21090 or KEGG Orthology Pathways www.genome.jp kegg these networks are referred to as a functional network ecology . Functional network ecologies can be reduced to practice by defining the group of OTUs that together comprise the functions defined by the functional network ecology.

The terms network class core network and network class ecology refer to a group of network ecologies that in general are computationally determined to comprise ecologies with similar phylogenetic and or functional characteristics. A network class therefore contains important biological features defined either phylogenetically or functionally of a group i.e. a cluster of related network ecologies. One representation of a core network ecology is a designed consortium of microbes typically non pathogenic bacteria that represents core features of a set of phylogenetically or functionally related network ecologies seen in many different subjects. In many occurrences a core network while designed as described herein exists as a network ecology observed in one or more subjects. Core network ecologies are useful for reversing or reducing a dysbiosis in subjects where the underlying related network ecology has been disrupted.

 Bacterial translocation refers to the passage of one or more bacteria across the epithelial layer of any organ of a human or non human animal.

 Clade refers to the OTUs or members of a phylogenetic tree that are downstream of a statistically valid node in a phylogenetic tree. The clade comprises a set of terminal leaves in the phylogenetic tree i.e. tips of the tree that are a distinct monophyletic evolutionary unit and that share some extent of sequence similarity. Clades are hierarchical in one embodiment the node in a phylogenetic tree that is selected to define a clade is dependent on the level of resolution suitable for the underlying data used to compute the tree topology.

The colonization of a host organism includes the non transitory residence of a bacterium or other microscopic organism. As used herein reducing colonization of a host subject s gastrointestinal tract or vagina or any other microbiota niche by a pathogenic or non pathogenic bacterium includes a reduction in the residence time of the bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract or vagina as well as a reduction in the number o concentration of the bacterium in the gastrointestinal tract or vagina or adhered to the luminal surface of the gastrointestinal tract. The reduction in colonization can be permanent or occur during a transient period of time. Measuring reductions of adherent pathogens can be demonstrated directly e.g. by determining pathogenic burden in a biopsy sample or reductions may be measured indirectly e.g. by measuring the pathogenic burden in the stool of a mammalian host.

A combination of two or more bacteria includes the physical co existence of the two bacteria either in the same material or product or in physically connected products as well as the temporal co administration or co localization of the two bacteria.

 Cytotoxic activity of bacterium includes the ability of a bacterium kill a cell e.g. a host cell or a bacterial cell . A cytostatic activity of a bacterium includes the ability to inhibit e.g. partially or fully the growth metabolism and or proliferation of a cell e.g. a bacterial cell or a host cell .

 Dysbiosis refers to a state of the microbiota or microbiome of the gut or other body area including mucosal or skin surfaces or any other microbiota niche in which the normal diversity and or function of the ecological network is disrupted. Any disruption from the preferred e.g. ideal. state of the microbiota can be considered a dysbiosis even if such dysbiosis does not result in a detectable decrease in health. This state of dysbiosis may be unhealthy e.g. result in a diseased state it may be unhealthy under only certain conditions or it may prevent a subject from becoming healthier. Dysbiosis may be due to a decrease in diversity of the microbiota population composition the overgrowth of one or more population of pathogens e.g. a population of pathogenic bacteria or pathobionts the presence of and or overgrowth of symbiotic organisms able to cause disease only when certain genetic and or environmental conditions are present in a patient or a shift to an ecological. network that no longer provides a beneficial function to the host and therefore no longer promotes health. A state of dysbiosis may lead to a disease or disorder e.g. a gastrointestinal disease disorder or condition or the state of dysbiosis may lead to a disease or disorder e.g. a gastrointestinal disease disorder or condition only under certain conditions or the state of dysbiosis may prevent a subject from responding to treatment or recovering from a disease or disorder e.g. a gastrointestinal disease disorder or condition .

The term distal generally is used in relation to the gastrointestinal tract specifically the intestinal lumen of a human or other mammal. Thus a distal dysbiosis includes a dysbiosis outside of the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract and a distal microbiota includes a microbiota outside of the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. In specified instances the term distal may be used in relation to the site of administration engraftment or colonization of a composition e.g. a probiotic composition of the invention. For example if a probiotic composition is administered vaginally a distal effect of the composition would occur outside the vagina.

 Gastrointestinal dysbiosis refers to a state of the microbiota or microbiome of the gut in which the normal diversity and or function of the ecological network or niche is disrupted. The term gut as used herein is meant to refer to the entire gastrointestinal or digestive tract also referred to as the alimentary canal and it refers to the system of organs within multi cellular animals which takes in food digests it to extract energy and nutrients and expels the remaining waste. As used herein the term gastrointestinal tract refers to the entire digestive canal from the oral cavity to the rectum. The term gastrointestinal tract includes but is not limited to mouth and proceeds to the esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine rectum and finally the anus.

 Germinant is a material or composition or a physical chemical process capable of inducing the germination of vegetative bacterial cells from dormant spores or the proliferation of vegetative bacterial cells either directly or indirectly in a host organism and or in vitro.

 Inhibition of a pathogen or non pathogen encompasses the inhibition of any desired function or activity of the pathogen or non pathogen by the probiotic e.g. bacterial compositions of the present invention. Demonstrations of inhibition such as a decrease in the growth of a pathogenic bacterial cell population or a reduction in the level of colonization of a pathogenic bacterial species are provided herein and otherwise recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. Inhibition of a pathogenic or non pathogenic bacterial population s growth may include inhibiting an increase in the size of a pathogenic or non pathogenic bacterial cell population and or inhibiting the proliferation or multiplication of a pathogenic or non pathogenic bacterial cell population. Inhibition of colonization of a pathogenic or non pathogenic bacterial species may be demonstrated by measuring and comparing the amount or burden of the bacterial species before and after a treatment. An inhibition or the act of inhibiting includes the total cessation and partial reduction of one or more activities of a pathogen such as growth proliferation colonization and function. As used herein inhibition includes cytostatic and or cytotoxic activities. Inhibition of function includes for example the inhibition of expression of a pathogenic gene product e.g. the genes encoding a toxin and or toxin biosynthetic pathway or the genes encoding a structure required for intracellular invasion e.g. an invasive pilus induced by the bacterial composition.

 Isolated encompasses a bacterium or other entity or substance e.g. a bacterial population or a prebiotic that has been 1 separated from at least some of the components with which it was associated when initially produced whether in nature or in an experimental setting and or 2 produced prepared purified and or manufactured by the hand of man. Isolated bacteria includes for example those bacteria that are cultured even if such cultures are not monocultures. Isolated bacteria may be separated from at least about 10 about 20 about 30 about 40 about 50 about 60 about 70 about 80 about 90 or more of the other components with which they were initially associated. In some embodiments isolated bacteria are more than about 80 about 85 about 90 about 91 about 92 about 93 about 94 about 95 about 96 about 97 about 98 about 99 or more than about 99 pure. As used herein a substance is pure if it is substantially free of other components. The terms purify purifying and purified refer to a bacterium or other material that has been separated from at least some of the components with which it was associated either when initially produced or generated e.g. whether in nature or in an experimental setting or during any time after its initial production. A bacterium or a bacterial population may be considered purified if it is isolated at or after production such as from a material or environment containing the bacterium or bacterial population or by passage through culture. A purified bacterium or bacterial population may contain other materials up to about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 about 20 about 30 about 40 about 50 about 60 about 70 about 80 about 90 or above about 90 and still be considered isolated. In some embodiments purified bacteria and bacterial populations are more than about 80 about 85 about 90 about 91 about 9 about 93 about 94 about 95 about 96 about 97 about 98 about 99 or more than about 99 pure. In the instance of bacterial compositions provided herein the one or more bacterial types present in the composition can be independently purified from one or more other bacteria produced and or present in the material or environment containing the bacterial type. In some embodiments bacterial compositions and the bacterial components thereof are purified from residual habitat products. In some embodiments pharmaceutical compositions e.g. bacterial compositions contain a defined mixture of isolated bacteria. For example in some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition e.g. probiotic composition contains no more than 100 bacterial species. For example in some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition contains no more than 75 bacterial species. In other embodiments the pharmaceutical composition contains no more than 50 bacterial species e.g. no more than 40 bacterial species no more than 30 bacterial species no more than 25 bacterial species no more than 20 bacterial species no more than 15 bacterial species no more than 10 bacterial species etc. In other embodiments the pharmaceutical composition contains no more than 10 bacterial species e.g. 10 bacterial species 9 bacterial species 8 bacterial species 7 bacterial species 6 bacterial species 5 bacterial species 4 bacterial species 3 bacterial species 2 bacterial species 1 bacterial species. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition contains defined quantities of each bacterial species. In an exemplary embodiment the pharmaceutical composition contains isolated bacterial populations that are not isolated from fecal matter.

 Keystone OTU or keystone function refers to one or more OTUs or functional pathways e.g. KEGG or COG pathways that are common to many network ecologies or functional network ecologies and are members of networks that occur in many subjects i.e. are pervasive . Due to the ubiquitous nature of keystone OTUs and their associated functional pathways they are central to the function of network ecologies in healthy subjects and are often missing or at reduced levels in subjects with disease. Keystone OTUs and their associated functions may exist in low moderate or high abundance in subjects. A non keystone OTU or non keystone function refers to an OTU or function that is observed in a network ecology or a functional network ecology that is not observed in a keystone OTU or function.

 Microbiota refers to the community of microorganisms that occur sustainably or transiently in and or on a subject e.g a mammal such as a human including but not limited to eukaryotes e.g. protozoa archaea bacteria and viruses including bacterial viruses i.e. a phage .

 Microbiome refers to the genetic content of the communities of microbes that live in and on the human body both sustainably and transiently including eukaryotes archaea bacteria and viruses including e.g. bacterial viruses i.e. phage wherein genetic content includes genomic DNA RNA such as ribosomal RNA the epigenome plasmids and all other types of genetic information.

 Microbial carriage or simply carriage refers to the population of microbes inhabiting a niche within or on a subject e.g. a human subject . Carriage is often defined in terms of relative abundance. For example OTU1 comprises 60 of the total microbial carriage meaning that OTU1 has a relative abundance of 60 compared to the other OTUs in the sample from which the measurement is made. Carriage is most often based on genomic sequencing data where the relative abundance or carriage of a single OTU or group of OTUs is defined by the number of sequencing reads that are assigned to that OTU s relative to the total number of sequencing reads for the sample.

 Microbial augmentation refers to the establishment or significant increase of a population of microbes that are i absent or undetectable as determined by the use of standard genomic biochemical and or microbiological techniques from the administered therapeutic microbial composition ii absent undetectable or present at low frequencies in the host niche as an example gastrointestinal tract skin anterior nares or vagina before the delivery of the microbial composition and iii are found i.e. detectable after the administration of the microbial composition or significantly increase for instance 2 fold 5 fold 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 or greater than 1 10 in cases where they are present at low frequencies. The microbes that comprise an augmented ecology can be derived from exogenous sources such as food and the environment or grow out from micro niches within the host where they reside at low frequency.

The administration of the therapeutic composition e.g. pharmaceutical composition can induce an environmental shift in the target niche that promotes favorable conditions for the growth of commensal microbes. In the absence of treatment with a therapeutic microbial composition e.g. a pharmaceutical composition comprising a bacterial cell population with or without one or more prebiotics the host can be constantly exposed to these microbes however sustained growth and the positive health effects associated with the stable population of increased levels of the microbes comprising the augmented ecology are not observed.

 Microbial engraftment or simply engraftment refers to the establishment of OTUs comprising a therapeutic microbial composition in a target niche. In one embodiment the OTUs are absent in the treated host prior to treatment. The microbes that comprise the engrafted ecology are found in the therapeutic microbial composition and establish as constituents of the host microbial ecology upon treatment. Engrafted OTUs can establish for a transient period of time or demonstrate long term stability in the microbial ecology that populates the host post treatment with a therapeutic microbial composition. The engrafted ecology can induce an environmental shift in the target niche that promotes favorable conditions for the growth of commensal microbes capable of catalyzing a shift from a dysbiotic ecology to one representative of a healthy state.

 Ecological niche or simply niche refers to the ecological space that an organism or group of organisms e.g. a bacterial population occupies. Niche describes how an organism or population or organisms responds to the distribution of resources physical parameters e.g. host tissue space and competitors e.g. by growing when resources are abundant and or when predators parasites and pathogens are scarce and how it in turn alters those same factors e.g. by limiting access to resources by other organisms acting as a food source for predators and or as a consumer of prey .

 Pathobionts or opportunistic pathogens refers to symbiotic organisms able to cause disease only when certain genetic and or environmental conditions are present in a subject.

 Phylogenetic tree refers to a graphical representation of the evolutionary relationships of one genetic sequence to another that is generated using a defined set of phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms e.g. parsimony maximum likelihood or Bayesian . Nodes in the tree represent distinct ancestral sequences and the confidence of any node is provided by a bootstrap or Bayesian posterior probability which measures branch uncertainty.

As used herein the term minerals is understood to include boron calcium chromium copper iodine iron magnesium manganese molybdenum nickel phosphorus potassium selenium silicon tin vanadium zinc or combinations thereof.

To be free of non comestible products means that a bacterial composition or other material provided herein does not have a substantial amount of a non comestible product e.g. a product or material that is inedible harmful or otherwise undesired in a product suitable for administration e.g. oral administration to a human subject. Non comestible products are often found in preparations of bacteria from the prior art.

 Operational taxonomic units OTU or plural OTUs refer to a terminal leaf in a phylogenetic tree and is defined by a nucleic acid sequence e.g. the entire genome or a specific genetic sequence and all sequences that share sequence identity to this nucleic acid sequence at the level of species. In some embodiments the specific genetic sequence may be the 16S sequence or a portion of the 16S sequence. In other embodiments the entire genomes of two entities are sequenced and compared. In another embodiment select regions such as multilocus sequence tags MLST specific genes or sets of genes may be genetically compared. In 16S embodiments OTUs that share 97 average nucleotide identity across the entire 16S or some variable region of the 16S are considered the same OTU see e.g. Claesson et al. 2010 NUCLEIC ACIDS RES. . 38 e200 Konstantinidis et al. 2006 PHILOS. TRANS. R. SOC. LOND. B. BIOL. SCI. 361 1929 1940 . In embodiments involving the complete genome MLSTs specific genes or sets of genes OTUs that share 95 average nucleotide identity are considered the same OTU see e.g. Achtman and Wagner 2008 NAT. REV. MICROBIOL. 6 431 440 Konstantinidis et al. 2006 . OTUs are frequently defined by comparing sequences between organisms. Generally sequences with less than 95 sequence identity are not considered to form part of the same OTU. OTUs may also be characterized by any combination of nucleotide markers or genes in particular highly conserved genes e.g. house keeping genes or a combination thereof. Such characterization employs e.g. WGS data or a whole genome sequence.

The term phylogenetic diversity refers to the biodiversity present in a given network ecology core network ecology or network class ecology based on the OTUs that comprise the network. Phylogenetic diversity is a relative term meaning that a network ecology core network or network class that is comparatively more phylogenetically diverse than another network contains a greater number of unique species genera and taxonomic families. Uniqueness of a species genera or taxonomic family is generally defined using a phylogenetic tree that represents the genetic diversity all species genera or taxonomic families relative to one another. In another embodiment phylogenetic diversity may be measured using the total branch length or average branch length of a phylogenetic tree.

Phylogenetic diversity may be optimized in a bacterial composition by including a wide range of biodiversity.

There are two RNA subunits in the ribosome termed the small subunit SSU and large subunit LSU the RNA genetic sequences rRNA of these subunits are related to the gene that encodes them rDNA by the genetic code. rDNA genes and their complementary RNA sequences are widely used for determination of the evolutionary relationships amount organisms as they are variable yet sufficiently conserved to allow cross organism molecular comparisons.

Typically 16S rDNA sequence approximately 1542 nucleotides in length of the 30S SSU is used for molecular based taxonomic assignments of prokaryotes and the 18S rDNA sequence approximately 1869 nucleotides in length of 40S SSU is used for eukaryotes. The bacterial 16S rDNA is used in reconstructing the evolutionary relationships and sequence similarity of one bacterial isolate to another using phylogenetic approaches. 16S sequences are used for phylogenetic reconstruction as they are in general highly conserved but contain specific hypervariable regions that harbor sufficient nucleotide diversity to differentiate genera and species of most bacteria.

For example contamination may be reduced by isolating desired constituents through multiple steps of streaking to single colonies on solid media until replicate such as but not limited to two streaks from serial single colonies have shown only a single colony morphology. Alternatively reduction of contamination can be accomplished by multiple rounds of serial dilutions to single desired cells e.g. a dilution of 10or 10 such as through multiple 10 fold serial dilutions. This can further be confirmed by showing that multiple isolated colonies have similar cell shapes and Gram staining behavior. Other methods for confirming adequate purity include genetic analysis e.g. PCR and DNA sequencing serology and antigen analysis enzymatic and metabolic analysis and methods using instrumentation such as flow cytometry with reagents that distinguish desired constituents from contaminants.

In other embodiments pharmaceutical compositions e.g. probiotic compositions containing immunomodulatory bacteria that impact the immune activity of a subject by promoting the differentiation and or expansion of particular subpopulations of immune cells. For example immunomodulatory bacteria can increase or decrease the proportion of Treg cells Th17 cells Th1 cells or Th2 cells in a subject. The increase or decrease in the proportion of immune cell subpopulations may be systemic or it may be localized to a site of action of the probiotic e.g. in the gastrointestinal tract or at a site of distal dysbiosis. In some embodiments immunomodulatory bacteria i.e. anti inflammatory bacterial cells are selected for inclusion in a pharmaceutical composition e.g. a probiotic composition of the invention based on the desired effect of the pharmaceutical composition on the differentiation and or expansion of subpopulations of immune cells in the subject.

In one embodiment a pharmaceutical composition e.g. a probiotic composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria i.e. immunomodulatory bacterial cells that increase the proportion of Treg cells in a subject e.g. by inducing expansion of Treg cells in the subject . In another embodiment a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Treg cells in a subject.

In another embodiment a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Th17 cells in a subject. In one embodiment a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that increase the proportion of Th1 cells in a subject e.g. by inducing expansion of Th1 cells in the subject . In another embodiment a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Th1 cells in a subject. In one embodiment a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that increase the proportion of Th2 cells in a subject e.g. by inducing expansion of Th2 cells in the subject . In another embodiment a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Th2 cells in a subject. The increase or decrease in the proportion of immune cell subpopulations may be systemic or it may be localized to a site of action of the probiotic e.g. in the gastrointestinal tract or at a site of distal dysbiosis.

In one embodiment a pharmaceutical composition e.g. a probiotic composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria capable of modulating the proportion of one or more populations of Treg cells Th17 cells Th1 cells Th2 cells and combinations thereof in a subject. Certain immune cell profiles may be particularly desirable to treat or prevent particular disorders associated with a dysbiosis. For example treatment or prevention of an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder e.g. GVHD can be promoted by increasing the quantity of Treg cells and Th2 cells and decreasing the quantity of Th17 cells and Th1 cells. Accordingly pharmaceutical compositions e.g. probiotic compositions for the treatment or prevention of an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder e.g. GVHD contain immunomodulatory bacteria capable of promoting the differentiation and or expansion of Treg cells and Th2 cells and reducing Th17 and Th1 cells in the subject.

In one embodiment pharmaceutical compositions e.g. a therapeutic probiotic compositions containing a purified population of immunomodulatory microbes e.g. immunomodulatory bacterial cells are provided with or without one or more prebiotics in an amount effective to i treat or prevent dysbiosis e.g. gastrointestinal or distal dysbiosis inflammation or an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder and or ii augment at least one type of microbe e.g. a bacterium not present in the therapeutic composition in a mammalian recipient subject to whom the pharmaceutical composition is administered and or iii engraft at least one type of microbe e.g. an anti inflammatory bacterial cell present in the therapeutic composition but not present in a mammalian subject prior to treatment.

In another embodiment pharmaceutical compositions containing a purified population of immunomodulatory bacteria e.g. anti inflammatory bacterial cells are provided in an amount effective to i augment the microbiota diversity present in the mammalian recipient and or ii treat or prevent dysbiosis e.g. gastrointestinal or distal dysbiosis inflammation or an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder in a mammalian recipient subject to whom the therapeutic composition is administered wherein the purified population of immunomodulatory bacteria is obtained by separating the population from at least one residual habitat product in a fecal material obtained from one or a plurality of mammalian donor subjects. In some embodiments individual bacterial strains can be cultured from fecal material. These strains can then be purified or otherwise isolated and used singly or in combination. In one embodiment the probiotic composition does not contain a fecal extract.

In one embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be used to treat or correct a dysbiosis in a subject. The dysbiosis may be for example a local dysbiosis or a distal dysbiosis. In another embodiment the probiotic compositions described herein may be used to prevent a dysbiosis in a subject at risk for developing a dysbiosis.

In another embodiment pharmaceutical compositions containing a purified population of immunomodulatory bacteria e.g. anti inflammatory bacterial cells are provided in an amount effective to i augment the microbiota diversity present in the mammalian recipient and or ii treat or prevent dysbiosis e.g. gastrointestinal or distal dysbiosis inflammation or an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder in a mammalian recipient subject to whom the therapeutic composition is administered wherein the purified population of immunomodulatory bacteria is obtained by separating the population from a non fecal material source.

In some embodiments a pharmaceutical composition containing a purified population of immunomodulatory bacterial cells e.g. anti inflammatory bacterial cells described above is co administered or co formulated with one or more prebiotics e.g. carbohydrates. In some embodiments a pharmaceutical composition is administered before one or more prebiotics is administered to a subject. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition is administered after one or more prebiotics is administered to a subject. In some embodiments a pharmaceutical composition containing a purified population of immunomodulatory bacterial cells is administered concurrently with one or more prebiotics. In other embodiments a pharmaceutical composition containing a purified population of immunomodulatory bacterial cells is administered sequentially with one or more prebiotics. In some embodiments a purified population of immunomodulatory bacterial cells is administered in a pharmaceutical composition formulated to contain one or more pharmaceutical excipients and optionally one or more prebiotics.

Immunomodulatory bacterial cells e.g. anti inflammatory bacterial cells involved in modulation of the host immune system i may be human commensals ii may be part of an organ s healthy state microbiome ii may be part of a distal organ s healthy state microbiome iv may be exogenous microbes v may be innocuous vi may be pathobionts vii may be pathogens viii may be opportunistic pathogens or ix any combination thereof. In some aspects microbes are not required to be actively proliferating e.g. spores dormant cells cells with reduced metabolic rate or heat killed cells to have an immunomodulatory effect. In certain aspects microbial cell components rather than whole microbial cells may have immunomodulatory effects. Non limiting examples of microbial components are lipids carbohydrates proteins nucleic acids and small molecules.

The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein may optionally further comprise a prebiotic a non microbial immunomodulatory carbohydrates or a microbial immunomodulatory cell component that are effective for the prevention or treatment of an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder such as graft versus host disease GVHD an inflammatory bowel disease IBD including but not limited to ulterative colitis and Crohn s disease multiple sclerosis MS systemic lupus erythematosus SLE type I diabetes rheumatoid arthritis Sj gren s syndrome and Celiac disease or dysbiosis.

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions comprise at least one type of immunomodulatory bacterial cells e.g. at least one type of anti inflammatory bacterial cell and optionally at least one prebiotic e.g. a carbohydrate and optionally further comprise a microbial immunomodulatory cell component or substrate for the production of immunomodulatory metabolites that are effective for the prevention or treatment of an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder. Methods for the prevention and or treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in human subjects are also disclosed herein.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions e.g. probiotic compositions of the invention comprise purified spore populations of anti inflammatory bacterial cells. In one embodiment the purified spore populations can engraft in the host and remain present for 1 day 2 days 3 days 4 days 5 days 6 days 7 days 10 days 14 days 21 days 25 days 30 days 60 days 90 days or longer than 90 days. Additionally the purified spore populations can induce other healthy commensal bacteria found in a healthy gut to engraft in the host that are not present in the purified spore populations or present at lesser levels. Therefore these species are considered to augment the delivered spore populations. In this manner commensal species augmentation of the purified spore population in the recipient s gut leads to a more diverse population of gut microbiota than present initially.

Suitable oligosaccharides and their production methods are further described in Laere K. J. M. Laere K. J. M. Degradation of structurally different non digestible oligosaccharides by intestinal bacteria glycosylhydrolases of Bi. adolescentis. PhD thesis 2000 Wageningen Agricultural University Wageningen The Netherlands the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Transgalactooligosaccharides TOS are for example sold under the trademark Vivinal Borculo Domo Ingredients Netherlands . Indigestible dextrin which may be produced by pyrolysis of corn starch comprises 1 4 and 1 6 glucosidic bonds as are present in the native starch and contains 1 2 and 1 3 linkages and levoglucosan. Due to these structural characteristics indigestible dextrin contains well developed branched particles that are partially hydrolysed by human digestive enzymes. Numerous other commercial sources of indigestible oligosaccharides are readily available and known to skilled persons in the art. For example transgalactooligosaccharide is available from Yakult Honsha Co. Tokyo Japan. Soybean oligosaccharide is available from Calpis Corporation distributed by Ajinomoto U.S.A. Inc. Teaneck N.J.

In a further preferred embodiment the pharmaceutical composition contains a prebiotic mixture of an acid oligosaccharide with a DP between 1 and 5000 prepared from pectin alginate and mixtures thereof and a neutral oligosaccharide selected from the group of fructans fructooligosaccharides indigestible dextrins galactooligosaccharides including transgalacto oligosaccharides xylooligosaccharides arabinooligosaccharides glucooligosaccharides manno oligosaccharides fucooligosaccharides and mixtures thereof.

In certain embodiments the prebiotic mixture comprises xylose. In other embodiments the prebiotic mixture comprises a xylose polymer i.e. xylan . In some embodiments the prebiotic comprises xylose derivatives such as xylitol a sugar alcohol generated by reduction of xylose by catalytic hydrogenation of xylose and also xylose oligomers e.g. xylooligosaccharide . While xylose can be digested by humans via xylosyltransferase activity most xylose ingested by humans is excreted in urine. In contrast some microorganisms are efficient at xylose metabolism or may be selected for enhanced xylose metabolism. Microbial xylose metabolism may occur by at least four pathways including the isomerase pathway the Weimburg pathway the Dahms pathway and for eukaryotic microorganisms the oxido reductase pathway.

The xylose isomerase pathway involves the direct conversion of D xylose into D xylulose by xylose isomerase after which D xylulose is phosphorylated by xylulose kinase to yield D xylolose 5 phosphate an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway.

In the Weimberg pathway D xylose is oxidized to D xylono lactone by a D xylose dehydrogenase. Then D xylose dehydrogenase is hydrolyzed by a lactonase to yield D xylonic acid and xylonate dehydratase activity then yields 2 keto 3 deoxy xylonate. The final steps of the Weimberg pathway are a dehydratase reaction to form 2 keto glutarate semialdehyde and an oxidizing reaction to form 2 ketoglutarate an intermediate of the Krebs cycle.

The Dahms pathway follows the same mechanism as the Weimberg pathway but diverges once it has yielded 2 keto 3 deoxy xylonate. In the Dahms pathway an aldolase splits 2 keto 3 deoxy xylonate into pyruvate and glycolaldehyde.

The xylose oxido reductase pathway also known as the xylose reductase xylitol dehydrogenase pathway begins by the reduction of D xylose to xylitol by xylose reductase followed by the oxidation of xylitol to D xylulose by xylitol dehydrogenase. As in the isomerase pathway the next step in the oxido reductase pathway is the phosphorylation of D xylulose by xylulose kinase to yield D xylolose 5 phosphate.

Xylose is present in foods like fruits and vegetables and other plants such as trees for wood and pulp production. Thus xylose can be obtained in the extracts of such plants. Xylose can be obtained from various plant sources using known processes including acid hydrolysis followed by various types of chromatography. Examples of such methods to produce xylose include those described in Maurelli L. et al. 2013 Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 170 1104 1118 Hooi H. T et al. 2013 Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 170 1602 1613 Zhang H J. et al. 2014 Bioprocess Biosyst. Eng. 37 2425 2436.

Preferably the metabolism of xylose and or the shift in microbiota due to the metabolism of the xylose provided in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention confers a benefit to a host e.g. immunological tolerance. For example in aspects in which the patient is at risk or suffering from GVHD the immunological tolerance may reduce graft versus host activity while maintaining graft versus leukemia activity. In another example in aspects in which the patient suffers from Celiac disease the immunological tolerance prevents an inappropriate immune response to gluten. The xylose may be e.g. i cytotoxic for an autoimmune disease and or inflammatory disease associated associated pathogen or pathobiont ii cytostatic for an autoimmune disease and or inflammatory disease associated pathogen or pathobiont iii capable of decreasing the growth of autoimmune disease and or inflammatory disease associated pathogen or pathobiont iv capable of inhibiting the growth of an autoimmune disease and or inflammatory disease associated pathogen or pathobiont v capable of decreasing the colonization of an autoimmune disease and or inflammatory disease associated pathogen or pathobiont vi capable of inhibiting the colonization of an autoimmune disease and or inflammatory disease associated pathogen or pathobiont vii capable of eliciting an immunomodulatory response in the host that reduces the risk of an autoimmune and or inflammatory disorder viii capable of eliciting an immunomodulatory response in the host that reduces the severity of an autoimmune and or inflammatory disorder ix capable of promoting barrier integrity directly or indirectly through its impact on microbiota or x any combination of i ix .

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form comprises a bacterial population and xylose in an amount effective to promote the growth of select bacteria of the family Clostridiacea including members of the genus or or relatives thereof in a host. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is further effective to promote the proliferation of select bacteria of the family Clostridiacea including members of the genus or or relatives thereof in a host. In certain embodiments the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form comprises a bacterial population and xylose in an amount effective to promote the colonization and or engraftment of select bacteria of the family Clostridiacea including members of the genus or or relatives thereof in a host. In preferred embodiments the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is further capable of altering a dysbiotic state such that the growth proliferation colonization and or engraftment of a host by a pathogen pathobiont disease associated microbe or a combination thereof such that the population of at least one pathogen pathobiont or disease associated microbe is decreased 2 fold 5 fold 10 fold 50 fold 100 fold 200 fold 500 fold 1000 fold 10000 fold or over 10000 fold. In one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is capable of locally or systemically eliminating at least one pathogen pathobiont or disease associated microbe from a host.

In some embodiments the prebiotic comprises a carbohydrate monomer or polymer that has been modified i.e. substituted with other substituents e.g. acetyl group glucuronic acid residue arabinose residue or the like see US Patent Application 20090148573 hereby incorporated by reference . The term modified as used herein refers to a molecule modified from a reference molecule and includes not only artificially produced molecules but also naturally occurring molecules. In preferred embodiments the modification occurs at one or more hydroxyl groups of the reference carbohydrate. In some embodiments the modification occurs at carbon 2 C2 the modification occurs at carbon 6 C6 or a combination thereof.

In some embodiments a carbohydrate a monomer or preferably a polymer is modified with one or more hydrophilic groups. Nonlimiting examples of the hydrophilic groups include an acetyl group a 4 O methyl D glucuronic acid residue an L arabinofuranose residue an L arabinose residue and an a D glucuronic acid residue. In some embodiments the modification is the replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with H CHOH CH or NH.

In some embodiments the composition comprises at least one carbohydrate that elicits an immunomodulatory response. Exemplary immunomodulary carbohydrates include but are not limited to fructo oligosaccharides glycosaminoglycans e.g. heparin sulfate chondroitin sulfate A hyaluronan 0 glycans and carrageenan oligosaccharides and galacto oligosaccharides. Immunomodulatory carbohydrates may be purified from plants or microbes or may be synthetically derived. Immunomodulatory carbohydrates may be effective to for example prevent disease suppress symptoms treat disease or any combination thereof.

In some embodiments immunomodulatory carbohydrates are C type lectin receptor ligands. In preferred embodiments the C type lectin receptor ligands are produced by one or more fungal species. In other embodiments the immunomodulatory carbohydrates are bacterial exopolysaccharides such as but not limited to the exopolysaccharides EPS produced by or . In some aspects immunomodulatory carbohydrates are zwitterionic polysaccharides. In some aspects immunomodulatory carbohydrates modulate toll like receptor 2 TLR2 and or toll like receptor 4 TLR4 responses in a host. For example autoimmune or inflammatory diseases characterized by intestinal inflammation may be prevented by a TLR4 agonist such as but not limited to EPS see e.g. Jones et al. 2014 J. IMMUNOL. 192 4813 4820 . Immunomodulatory carbohydrates may also activate CD4 T cells and or lead to an upregulation of the anti inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 Mazmanian and Kasper 2006 NAT. REV. IMMUNOL. 6 849 858 . Immunomodulatory carbohydrates may be selected for administration to a patient based on the presence abundance distribution modification and or linkages of sugar residues. For example immunomodulatory carbohydrates used in the prevention of intestinal disorders or autoimmune conditions that manifest in the gut non limiting examples being IBD and GVHD may be selected based on i a high abundance of mannose residues ii the presence of terminal mannopyransosyl t Man residues and or 2 6 linked mannopyranosyl residues 2 6 Man iii a ratio of mannose to glucose residues in the approximate range of 8 2 to 9 1 iv the presence of galactose residues v areas of positive charge or vi a combination thereof.

Carbohydrates may be selected according to the fermentation or metabolic preferences of a microbe e.g. an anti inflammatory bacterial cell selected for administration to a mammalian subject. Selection criteria include but are not limited to sugar complexity e.g. monosaccharides including but not limited to glucose versus oligosaccharides or starches as well as by desired end product. Non liming examples include the fermentation products ethanol and carbon dioxide CO e.g. via ethanol fermentation by sp. sp. lactate e.g. via homolactic acid fermentation by sp. sp. sp. sp. and some species lactate ethanol and CO e.g. via heterolactic acid fermentation which includes the phosphoketolase pathway by some species of as well as sp. sp. and sp. butanol acetone COand H via acetone butanol fermentation by some sp. and short chain fatty acids with or without the production of other products see e.g. Muller 2011 Bacterial Fermentation. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences . Examples of fermentation leading to short chain fatty acid production include homoacetic acid fermentation e.g. by Acetobacterium sp. and resulting in acetate propionic acid fermentation e.g. by sp. and resulting in propionate acetate and CO mixed acid fermentation e.g. by sp. and resulting in ethanol lactate acetate succinate formate CO and H butyrate fermentation e.g. by some sp. resulting in butyrate CO and H and 2 3 butanediol fermentation e.g. by sp. resulting in ethanol butanediol lactate formate CO and H . In some embodiments selection of carbohydrates for co formulation of co administration with a type of microbe or types of microbe may be achieved by computational analysis of microbial enzymatic pathways including but not limited to the presence of metabolic fermentation pathway enzymes.

Other prebiotics include molecules capable of selective or semi selective utilization by microbes e.g. bacterial cells of the compositions contained herein. The ability of a microbe to utilize a metabolite of interest is determined by the genomic capacity of that microbe. Public databases have characterized many microbes and automate the annotation of the genome to allow a computational analysis of the metabolites a microbe is potentially able to utilize. Databases such as the Cluster of Orthologous Groups COGs database characterize genomes from a variety of species in this manner and are capable of characterizing newly sequenced genomes as well e.g. see in this fashion Tatusov et al. 2000 NUCL. ACID RES. 28 1 33 36 . Furthermore pathway analysis classifies COGs into different categories with associated one letter codes including J translation L replication recombination and repair K transcription 0 molecular chaperones and related functions M cell wall structure and biogenesis and outer membrane N secretion motility and chemotaxis T signal Transduction P inorganic ion transport and metabolism C energy production and conversion G carbohydrate metabolism and transport E amino acid metabolism and transport F nueclotide metabolism and transport D cell Division and chromosome partitioning R general functional prediction. In preferred embodiments COGs of the categories N M P C G E and F are selected as preferred COGs to both provide enhanced growth on specific substrates and modified behaviors relevant for anti tumor properties.

COGs are selected to be specific or semi enriched in the host or other microbes within a host by searching for specific functions present in the microbe of interest but absent from a large set of other competition organisms. Tissue specific analysis of the host for enzymes expressed within a tissue is performed to identify tissue specific enzymatic activities in the host. Specific functions are absent from at least 90 at least 80 at least 70 at least 60 at least 50 at least 40 at least 30 at least 20 or at least 10 of the other organisms selected from the group of the host the host tissue the disease associated microbiota the host gut microbiota the host niche specific to the engraftment of the microbial composition e.g. GI tract skin .

Once these COGs are identified databases like KEGG are used to link the enzymatic functions to identify the metabolites that are substrates for these selective COGs. Furthermore the selective analysis to generate selective metabolites is repeated on the set of substrate of COGs to validate that the pathways and metabolites are selective to the desired microbial composition.

The microbes described herein may additively or synergistically reduce the number of types of autoimmune disease or inflammatory disease associated pathogens or pathobionts either distally e.g. orally administered microbes reduce the total microbial burden in an organ not in the gastrointestinal tract or intravaginally administered microbes reduce the total microbial burden in an organ that is not the vagina or locally e.g. the intestines or vagina respectively. Distal sites include but are not limited to the liver spleen fallopian tubes and uterus.

Similarly the microbes described herein may additively or synergistically elicit an immunomodulatory response either distally e.g. in which enteral administration of microbes results in altering the immune response at the skin or liver or locally e.g. the enteral administration of microbes results in altering the immune response in the intestines.

In some situations the recipient subject is immunocompromised or immunosuppressed or is at risk of developing an immune or inflammatory disorder.

In embodiments the microbial composition is administered enterically with or without prebiotics. This preferentially includes oral administration or by an oral or nasal tube including nasogastric nasojejunal oral gastric or oral jejunal . In other embodiments administration includes rectal administration including enema suppository or colonoscopy . The pharmaceutical composition may be administered to at least one region of the gastrointestinal tract including the mouth esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine and rectum. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition is administered to all regions of the gastrointestinal tract. The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered orally in the form of medicaments such as powders capsules tablets gels or liquids. The pharmaceutical compositions may also be administered in gel or liquid form by the oral route or through a nasogastric tube or by the rectal route in a gel or liquid form by enema or instillation through a colonoscope or by a suppository. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition of the invention is administered enterically with one ore more prebiotics.

If the composition is administered colonoscopically and optionally if the microbial composition with or without one or more prebiotics is administered by other rectal routes such as an enema or suppository or even if the subject has an oral administration the subject may have a colonic cleansing preparation. The colon cleansing preparation can facilitate proper use of the colonoscope or other administration devices but even when it does not serve a mechanical purpose it can also maximize the proportion of bacteria from the pharmaceutical composition relative to the other organisms previously residing in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject. Any ordinarily acceptable colonic cleansing preparation may be used such as those typically provided when a subject undergoes a colonoscopy.

Pretreatment Protocols. Prior to administration of the pharmaceutical composition with or without one or more prebiotics the subject can optionally have a pretreatment protocol to prepare the gastrointestinal tract or vagina to receive the pharmaceutical composition. In these instances the pretreatment protocol can enhance the ability of the pharmaceutical composition to affect the patient s microbiome.

As one way of preparing the patient for administration of the microbial ecosystem at least one antibiotic can be administered to alter the bacteria in the patient. As another way of preparing the patient for administration of the microbial ecosystem a standard colon cleansing preparation can be administered to the patient to substantially empty the contents of the colon such as used to prepare a patient for a colonscopy. By substantially emptying the contents of the colon this application means removing at least 75 at least 80 at least 90 at least 95 or about 100 of the contents of the ordinary volume of colon contents. Antibiotic treatment can precede the colon cleansing protocol.

If a patient has received an antibiotic for treatment of an infection or if a patient has received an antibiotic as part of a specific pretreatment protocol in one embodiment the antibiotic can be stopped in sufficient time to allow the antibiotic to be substantially reduced in concentration in the gut or vagina before the pharmaceutical composition is administered. In one embodiment the antibiotic can be discontinued 1 2 or 3 days before the administration of the pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment the antibiotic can be discontinued 3 4 5 6 or 7 antibiotic half lives before administration of the pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment the antibiotic can be chosen so the bacterial constituents in the pharmaceutical composition have an MIC50 that is higher than the concentration of the antibiotic in the gut or vagina.

MIC50 of the bacterial constituents in the pharmaceutical composition can be determined by methods well known in the art see e.g. Reller et al. 2009 CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES 49 11 1749 1755 . In such an embodiment the additional time between antibiotic administration and administration of the pharmaceutical composition is not necessary. If the pretreatment protocol is part of treatment of an acute infection the antibiotic can be chosen so that the infection is sensitive to the antibiotic but the bacterial constituents in the pharmaceutical composition are not sensitive to the antibiotic.

Routes of Administration. Compositions can be administered by any route suitable for the delivery of disclosed compositions for treating inhibiting or preventing a dysbiosis or an diseases and disorders associated with a dysbiosis include but are not limited to orally sublingually rectally parentally e.g. intravenous injection i.v. intracranial injection i.e. intramuscular injection i.m. intraperitoneal injection i.p. and subcutaneous injection s.c. and intraosseous infusion i.o. transdermally extracorporeally inhalation topically or the like including topical intranasal administration or administration by inhalant.

In some embodiments the subject is fed a meal within one hour of administration of the pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment the subject is fed a meal concurrently with administration of the pharmaceutical composition.

In some embodiments the therapeutic composition is administered at intervals greater than two days such as once every three four five or six days or every week or less frequently than every week. In other embodiments the preparation is administered intermittently according to a set schedule e.g. once a day once weekly or once monthly or when the subject relapses from the primary illness.

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutical composition is administered enterically. This preferentially includes oral administration or by an oral or nasal tube including nasogastric nasojejunal oral gastric or oral jejunal . In other embodiments administration includes rectal administration including enema suppository or colonoscopy . The pharmaceutical composition can be administered to at least one region of the gastrointestinal tract including the mouth esophagus stomach small intestine large intestine and rectum. In some embodiments it is administered to all regions of the gastrointestinal tract. The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered orally in the form of medicaments such as powders capsules tablets gels or liquids. The bacterial compositions can also be administered in gel or liquid form by the oral route or through a nasogastric tube or by the rectal route in a gel or liquid form by enema or instillation through a colonoscope or by a suppository. In certain embodiments of the above invention the microbial composition is administered enterically with one or more prebiotics.

If the composition is administered colonoscopically and optionally if the composition is administered by other rectal routes such as an enema or suppository or even if the subject has an oral administration the subject can have a colon cleansing preparation. The colon cleansing preparation can facilitate proper use of the colonoscope or other administration devices but even when it does not serve a mechanical purpose it can also maximize the proportion of the bacterial cells in the pharmaceutical composition relative to the other organisms previously residing in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject. For example the colon cleansing preparation may maximize the amount of bacterial entities of the bacterial composition that reach and or engraft in the gastrointestinal tract of the subject.

Dosages and Schedule for Administration. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions are provided in a dosage form. In certain embodiments the dosage form is designed for administration of at least one OTU or combinations thereof disclosed herein wherein the total amount of pharmaceutical composition administered is selected from 0.1 ng to 10 g 10 ng to 1 g 100 ng to 0.1 g 0.1 mg to 500 mg 1 mg to 100 mg or from 10 15 mg.

In another embodiment the preparation can be administered intermittently according to a set schedule e.g. once weekly once monthly or when the patient relapses from the primary illness.

Combination Therapy. The pharmaceutical compositions with or without one or more prebiotics can be administered with other agents in a combination therapy mode including anti microbial agents. Administration can be sequential over a period of hours or days or simultaneous.

In one embodiment the microbial compositions with or without one or more prebiotics are included in combination therapy with one or more anti microbial agents which include anti bacterial agents anti fungal agents anti viral agents and anti parasitic agents.

Anti bacterial agents can include cephalosporin antibiotics cephalexin cefuroxime cefadroxil cefazolin cephalothin cefaclor cefamandole cefoxitin cefprozil and ceftobiprole fluoroquinolone antibiotics cipro levaquin floxin tequin avelox and norflox tetracycline antibiotics tetracycline minocycline oxytetracycline and doxycycline penicillin antibiotics amoxicillin ampicillin penicillin V dicloxacillin carbenicillin vancomycin and methicillin and carbapenem antibiotics ertapenem doripenem imipenem cilastatin and meropenem .

Anti viral agents can include Abacavir Acyclovir Adefovir Amprenavir Atazanavir Cidofovir Darunavir Delavirdine Didanosine Docosanol Efavirenz Elvitegravir Emtricitabine Enfuvirtide Etravirine Famciclovir Foscarnet Fomivirsen Ganciclovir Indinavir Idoxuridine Lamivudine Lopinavir Maraviroc MK 2048 Nelfinavir Nevirapine Penciclovir Raltegravir Rilpivirine Ritonavir Saquinavir Stavudine Tenofovir Trifluridine Valaciclovir Valganciclovir Vidarabine Ibacitabine Amantadine Oseltamivir Rimantidine Tipranavir Zalcitabine Zanamivir and Zidovudine.

Anti fungal agents include but are not limited to polyene antifungals such as natamycin rimocidin filipin nystatin amphotericin B candicin and hamycin imidazole antifungals such as miconazole ketoconazole clotrimazole econazole omoconazole bifonazole butoconazole fenticonazole isoconazole oxiconazole sertaconazole sulconazole and tioconazole triazole antifungals such as fluconazole itraconazole isavuconazole ravuconazole posaconazole voriconazole terconazole and albaconazole thiazole antifungals such as abafungin allylamine antifungals such as terbinafine naftifine and butenafine and echinocandin antifungals such as anidulafungin caspofungin and micafungin. Other compounds that have antifungal properties include but are not limited to polygodial benzoic acid ciclopirox tolnaftate undecylenic acid flucytosine or 5 fluorocytosine griseofulvin and haloprogin.

In one embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions are administered in combination with one or more corticosteroids mesalazine mesalamine sulfasalazine sulfasalazine derivatives immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A mercaptopurine azathiopurine prednisone methotrexate antihistamines glucocorticoids epinephrine theophylline cromolyn sodium anti leukotrienes anti cholinergic drugs for rhinitis anti cholinergic decongestants mast cell stabilizers monoclonal anti IgE antibodies vaccines and combinations thereof.

The pharmaceutical compositions described herein have beneficial effects for the subject locally at the site of administration e.g. in the gastrointestinal tract for compositions administered orally or in the vagina for compositions administered vaginally as previously described. Surprisingly the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may also be used to correct or prevent a dysbiosis at a site distal to the site of administration intended engraftment or intended colonization of a composition e.g. a probiotic composition of the invention. For example if a probiotic composition is administered vaginally a distal effect of the composition would occur outside the vagina. Similarly if a probiotic composition is administered to the skin e.g. through a skin patch transdermal lotion etc. a distal effect of the composition would occur in a niche other than the skin. If a probiotic composition is administered to the lungs e.g. in an inhalable formulation a distal effect of the composition would occur outside the lungs. If a probiotic composition is administered to the ear eye nose etc. a distal effect of the composition would occur at a site other than the site of administration engraftment or colonization of the composition i.e. distal to the ear distal to the eye distal to the nose etc. .

Distal sites include but are not limited to the liver spleen fallopian tubes and uterus. Other distal sites include skin blood and lymph nodes. In other embodiments the distal site is placenta spleen liver uterus blood eyes ears lungs liver pancreas brain embryonic sac or vagina. In another embodiment the distal site is vagina skin lungs brain nose ear eyes conjunctiva mouth circulatory system e.g. blood placenta reproductive tract cardiovascular system and or nervous system. A probiotic composition may have an effect on the microbiota of more than one distal site in a subject. For example in some embodiments a probiotic composition modulates the microbiota of one or more sites distal to the site of administration engraftment or colonization e.g. one or more of placenta spleen liver uterus blood eyes ears lungs liver pancreas brain embryonic sac vagina skin brain nose mouth reproductive tract cardiovascular system and or nervous system. In preferred embodiments the probiotic composition contains a immunomodulatory bacteria e.g. a anti inflammatory bacteria.

Without wishing to be bound by theory the probiotic compositions of the invention may impact sites distal sites in several ways.

Pharmaceutical compositions described herein can correct or treat a distal dysbiosis by correcting the imbalance in microbial diversity that is present at the distal site. Bacteria contained in the pharmaceutical composition can correct the distal dysbiosis directly by translocating to the distal site. Bacteria contained in the pharmaceutical composition can also correct the distal dysbiosis indirectly by promoting translocation of other gut commensals to the distal site or by modifying the microenvironment of the distal site to create conditions that restore a healthy microbiome e.g. by reducing inflammation.

A distal dysbiosis includes disruptions in the normal diversity and or function of the microbial network in a subject at a site other than the gastrointestinal tract which is generally the site of administration of probiotics provided orally. In cases where a probiotic composition is administered vaginally to a subject a distal dysbiosis can include disruptions in the normal diversity and or function of the microbial network in a subject at a site other than the vagina.

In order to characterize a distal dysbiosis provided are methods of detecting quantifying and characterizing 16S 18S and ITS signatures in immune organs such as the lymph nodes spleen etc. Moreover provided are methods of detecting bacterial and fungal components typically associated with one microbiota in a distal site often associating in a physiological or pathological manner with the microbiota of that distal site. For example bacteria normally detected in the GI tract or vagina are detected in distal sites for example the blood.

In one embodiment a bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition engrafts in the gastrointestinal tract of a subject and translocates to a distal site thereby augmenting the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition at the distal site. In one embodiment the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition is not detectably present at the distal site prior to administration of the pharmaceutical composition.

In another embodiment a bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition is augmented in the gastrointestinal tract of a subject without engraftment and translocates to a distal site thereby augmenting the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition at the distal site. In one embodiment the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition is not detectably present at the distal site prior to administration of the pharmaceutical composition.

In another embodiment a bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition modulates the microenvironment of the gut augmenting a second bacterial strain present within the gut microbiota. The second bacterial strain augmented in the gut translocates to a distal site thereby augmenting the second bacterial strain at the distal site. In embodiments the second bacterial strain is not present in the pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition is an immunomodulatory bacteria e.g. an anti inflammatory bacteria. Modulation of the microenvironment of the gut may include for example alteration of cytokines secreted by host cells in and around the gut reducing inflammation in the gut increasing secretion of short chain fatty acids in the gut or altering the proportion of immune cell subpopulations in the gut each of which impacts the gut microbiome. Modulation of the microenvironment of the gut can include increasing or decreasing overall microbial diversity.

In another embodiment a bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition modulates the microenvironment at a distal site in a subject thereby augmenting a second bacterial strain at the distal site. In embodiments the second bacterial strain is not present in the pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments the bacterial strain present in the pharmaceutical composition is an immunomodulatory bacteria e.g. an anti inflammatory bacteria. Immunomodulatory bacteria can modulate the microenvironment at a distal site in a subject by for example reducing systemic inflammation. This can be achieved by altering the profile of cytokine expression by immune cells which circulate throughout the body or altering the proportion of immune cell subpopulations which circulate throughout the body. Bacterial strains present in the pharmaceutical composition can also modulate intestinal permeability e.g. by secretion of short chain fatty acids which impacts the microenvironment of distal sites. In addition or alternatively bacterial strains present in the pharmaceutical composition can increase or decrease overall microbial diversity.

Accordingly the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may additively or synergistically elicit an immunomodulatory response either distally e.g. in which enteral administration of microbes results in altering the immune response at a site outside the gastrointestinal tract such as the skin or liver or locally e.g. the enteral administration of microbes results in altering the immune response in the gastrointestinal tract e.g. in the intestines.

The immune system of a subject and the microbiome of the subject are closely linked and interact systemically. Disruptions to the microbiome both in the gastrointestinal tract and at distal sites can have profound effects throughout the body of the subject. In particular disruptions to the microbiome increase systemic inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction in a subject. Increased inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction negatively impact the health of the subject in many ways by contributing to a wide range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions distal to the gastrointestinal tract. Conversely increased inflammation in a subject leads to disruptions in the subject s microbiome and disruptions to the microbiome lead in turn to further increases in inflammation. Administration of a pharmaceutical composition containing immunomodulatory bacteria can reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and restore intestinal barrier integrity resulting in a reduction in inflammation at sites distal to the gastrointestinal tract and improvement in the symptoms of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders associated with systemic inflammation. Administration of a pharmaceutical composition containing bacterial strains that secrete short chain fatty acids are also capable of reducing inflammation restoring intestinal barrier integrity.

The pharmaceutical compositions and methods described herein can prevent or treat the loss or reduction of barrier function recognized to occur during dysbiosis or in the shift in one or more microbiotal populations that give rise to the dysbiosis. The loss of barrier function results in systemic seeding of bacterial populations resulting in dysbiotic activity and in some events the loss of barrier function results in a local reseeding of the bacterial populations. In both situations the resulting immune activation leads to pathogenic inflammatory and immune responses. In response provided are compositions that are capable of restoring barrier function restoring the normal microbiotal components and reducing e.g. suppressing immune inflammatory response. In some compositions provided are antibiotic agents that remove the existing microflora in a target niche while newly administered or recruited bacteria populate or re populate the target niche. Co administration or co formulation with a carbohydrate may synergistically affect this population repopulation technique.

Disorders associated with a dysbiosis i.e. a gastrointestinal dysbiosis or a distal dysbiosis which increases systemic inflammation and or reduces intestinal barrier integrity include for example autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Crohn s Disease vaginal dysbiosis and transplant disorders such as graft versus host disease. These disorders can be treated by administration e.g. oral administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing immunomodulatory e.g. anti inflammatory bacterial strains.

The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may additively or synergistically reduce the number of types of autoimmune disease or inflammatory disease associated pathogens or pathobionts either distally e.g. orally administered microbes reduce the total microbial burden in an organ not in the gastrointestinal tract or intravaginally administered microbes reduce the total microbial burden in an organ that is not the vagina or locally e.g. the intestines or vagina respectively.

Accordingly in one aspect the invention provides a method of reducing inflammation in a subject comprising administering to the subject a probiotic composition comprising an isolated anti inflammatory bacterial population such that inflammation in the subject is reduced. A systemic reduction in inflammation can modulate the microbiome of niches distal to the site of administration intended engraftment or intended colonization of the bacterial population. The probiotic composition can contain an excipient useful for formulation as a pharmaceutical composition. In instances where the bacterial population includes anaerobic bacteria the excipient can in one embodiment reduce exposure of the bacterial population to oxygen.

In a preferred embodiment administration of the probiotic composition can reduce inflammation at a site distal to the site of administration engraftment or colonization such as for example vagina skin lungs brain nose ear eyes conjunctiva mouth circulatory system e.g. blood placenta embryonic sac reproductive tract cardiovascular system and or nervous system. In one embodiment administration of the probiotic composition can reduce inflammation at a site selected from blood skin vagina liver spleen fallopian tubes uterus or a combination thereof. In one embodiment administration of the probiotic composition modulates the microbiome at a distal site.

The anti inflammatory bacterial population can induce a decrease in secretion of pro inflammatory cytokines and or an increase in secretion of anti inflammatory cytokines by host cells. The anti inflammatory properties of the bacterial population can be determined by methods described herein or known in the art for example by measuring alterations in cytokine secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs exposed to the bacterial population. Anti inflammatory bacteria can be selected for inclusion in the probiotic formulation based on modulation of particular cytokines of interest. For example anti inflammatory bacteria can be selected based on the ability to decrease secretion of one or more pro inflammatory cytokines e.g. IFN IL 12p70 IL 1 IL 6 IL 8 MCP1 MIP1 MIP1 TNF and combinations thereof and or the ability to increase secretion of one or more anti inflammatory cytokines e.g. IL 10 IL 13 IL 4 IL 5 TGF and combinations thereof.

In another aspect the invention provides methods of treating or preventing a distal dysbiosis in a subject by administering to the subject a probiotic composition comprising an isolated bacterial population in an amount sufficient to alter the microbiome at a site distal to the site of administration engraftment or colonization of the bacterial population such that the distal dysbiosis is treated. For example administration of the probiotic composition may modulate a first microbiome at the site of administration engraftment or colonization of the bacterial population causing subsequent modulation of a second microbiome at a site that is distinct from the first microbiome e.g. a distal site.

In one embodiment the invention provides methods of treating or preventing a distal dysbiosis by orally administering a probiotic composition which alters the microbiome at a site distal to the gastrointestinal tract.

In another aspect the invention provides a method of treating or preventing a disorder associated with a distal dysbiosis in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject a probiotic composition comprising an isolated bacterial population in an amount sufficient to alter the microbiome at a site of the distal dysbiosis such that the disorder associated with the distal dysbiosis is treated. Disorders associated with distal dysbiosis including disruptions to the systemic microbiome are described herein and include for example autoimmune or inflammatory disorders such as graft versus host disease GVHD an inflammatory bowel disease IBD ulterative colitis Crohn s disease multiple sclerosis MS systemic lupus erythematosus SLE type I diabetes rheumatoid arthritis Sj gren s syndrome and Celiac disease transplant disorders such as graft versus host disease and vaginal dysbiosis. In one embodiment the disorder associated with distal dysbiosis occurs in the respiratory tract e.g. lung including but not limited to Cystic Fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder COPD .

In one embodiment the probiotic composition contains a species of bacteria that is deficient at the site of the distal dysbiosis. Administration of the probiotic composition can increase the quantity of the deficient species in the distal microbiome. In one embodiment the deficient species is not detectably present at the site of the distal dysbiosis prior to administration of the probiotic composition. In one embodiment the species of bacteria in the probiotic composition translocates to the site of the distal dysbiosis.

In another embodiment the probiotic composition results in augmentation of a species of bacteria not present in the probiotic composition at a distal site. This augmentation can result from for example translocation of a species of bacteria not present in the probiotic composition to the distal site and or modulation of the microenvironment of the distal site in a manner that alters the microbiome.

In preferred embodiments the probiotic composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria e.g. anti inflammatory bacteria.

In another aspect the invention provides a method of reducing intestinal permeability in a subject by administering a probiotic composition comprising an isolated bacterial population wherein administration of the probiotic composition augments a species of bacteria that produces short chain fatty acids such that the intestinal permeability of the subject is reduced. In other embodiments intestinal permeability and disorders associated therewith is improved by administering a probiotic composition containing mucin containing bacteria and or anti inflammatory bacteria.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition contains a single strain of bacteria. In other embodiments the pharmaceutical composition contains two or more strains of bacteria e.g. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 15 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 500 1000 or more strains of bacteria. In other embodiments the pharmaceutical composition contains or is administered in conjunction with a prebiotic as described herein.

Exemplary pharmaceutical compositions useful for treatment of disorders associated with a dysbiosis distal to the site of administration e.g. the gastrointestinal tract contain bacterial strains capable of reducing inflammation in a subject. As described herein such immunomodulatory anti inflammatory bacteria can modulate cytokine expression by host immune cells resulting in an overall increase in secretion of anti inflammatory cytokines and or an overall decrease in secretion of pro inflammatory cytokines systemically reducing inflammation in the subject. In exemplary embodiments pharmaceutical compositions useful for treatment of disorders associated with a distal dysbiosis stimulate secretion of one or more anti inflammatory cytokines by host immune cells such as PBMCs. Anti inflammatory cytokines include but are not limited to IL 10 IL 13 IL 9 IL 4 IL 5 TGF and combinations thereof. In other exemplary embodiments pharmaceutical compositions useful for treatment of disorders associated with a distal dysbiosis inhibit secretion of one or more pro inflammatory cytokines by host immune cells such as PBMCs. Pro inflammatory cytokines include but are not limited to IFN IL 12p70 IL 1 IL 6 IL 8 MCP1 MIP1 MIP1 TNF and combinations thereof. Other exemplary cytokines are known in the art and are described herein. Pharmaceutical compositions containing anti inflammatory bacteria reduce inflammation at the site of administration e.g. in the gastrointestinal tract as well as at distal sites throughout the body of the subject.

Other exemplary pharmaceutical compositions useful for treatment of disorders associated with a dysbiosis distal to the site of administration e.g. the gastrointestinal tract contain bacterial strains capable of altering the proportion of immune subpopulations e.g. T cell subpopulations in the subject.

For example immunomodulatory bacteria can increase or decrease the proportion of Treg cells Th17 cells Th1 cells or Th2 cells in a subject. The increase or decrease in the proportion of immune cell subpopulations may be systemic or it may be localized to a site of action of the pharmaceutical e.g. in the gastrointestinal tract or at the site of a distal dysbiosis. In some embodiments a pharmaceutical composition comprising immunomodulatory bacteria is used for treatment of disorders associated with a dysbiosis distal to the site of administration e.g. the gastrointestinal tract based on the desired effect of the pharmaceutical composition on the differentiation and or expansion of subpopulations of immune cells in the subject.

In one embodiment a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that increase the proportion of Treg cells in a subject. In another embodiment a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Treg cells in a subject. In one embodiment a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that increase the proportion of Th17 cells in a subject.

In another embodiment a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria that decrease the proportion of Th2 cells in a subject.

In one embodiment a pharmaceutical composition contains immunomodulatory bacteria capable of modulating the proportion of one or more of Treg cells Th17 cells Th1 cells and combinations thereof in a subject. Certain immune cell profiles may be particularly desirable to treat or prevent particular disorders associated with a dysbiosis. For example treatment or prevention of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders can be promoted by increasing numbers of Treg cells and Th2 cells and decreasing numbers of Th17 cells and Th1 cells. Accordingly pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders may contain pharmaceuticals capable of promoting Treg cells and Th2 cells and reducing Th17 and Th1 cells.

Distal disorders associated with loss of intestinal barrier function can be treated or improved by administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing bacterial strains that produce short chain fatty acids SCFAs such as for example butyrate acetate propionate or valerate or combinations thereof. Distal disorders associated with loss of intestinal barrier function can be treated or improved by administration of probiotic compositions containing bacterial strains that reduce inflammation as described herein.

In other embodiments the distal dysbiosis is caused by a deficiency in microbes that produce lactic acid. Accordingly in one embodiment the probiotic composition can contain a species of bacteria that produce lactic acid.

The main function of the gastrointestinal GI tract is to digest and absorb nutrients from food. The mucosa of the GI tract forms a selective barrier between the host and the environment of the gut lumen. The mucosa allows transport of nutrients while restricting passage of larger molecules and bacteria. Impaired barrier integrity is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of many disorders including autoimmune diseases including transplant disorders such as graft versus host disease GVHD and neurological disorders. Disruption of the intestinal barrier due to toxins dysbiosis inflammation or other factors is believed to result in the passage and presentation of environmental antigens to the immune system leading to aberrant immune responses. Similarly the leakage of bacterial endotoxin or other toxic metabolites into the circulation can lead to systemic inflammation promoting the development of autoimmunity and neuroinflammation.

Restoration of GI barrier integrity through the administration of selected prebiotics and or probiotics represents an approach to correct a basic defect underlying multiple pathological conditions.

In a first set of experiments intestinal permeability was assessed using serum endotoxin levels as a marker of gut permeability in mice treated with xylose and or antibiotics. Basal levels of intestinal permeability can be measured under disease or normal conditions. Intestinal permeability can be induced in mice through administration of inflammatory stimuli such as cholera toxin 3 oral gavages of 10 g cholera toxin 5 days apart Poly I C 3 intraperioneal injections of 1 mg kg 3 days apart or dextran sulfate 3 dextran sulfate sodium salt in drinking water for 7 days . Quantitation of intestinal permeability was carried out by quantitatively measuring plasma levels of endotoxin originating from gut bacteria using a commercially available chromogenic assay Lonza Rockland Me. . The results of these experiments are shown in .

Quantitation of intestinal permeability can also be conducted using a number of alternative methods reviewed in Bischoff et al 2014 for example by quantifying leakage of fluorescently labeled high molecular weight dextran FITC dextran into the plasma following oral administration oral gavage with 0.6 g kg 4 kDa FITC dextran serum samples collected 4 hours later and read for fluorescence intensity at 521 nm Hsiao et al 2013 . To study the effect of bacterial strains on intestinal permeability mice are gavaged orally with 10 10bacterial cells for an average of 5 administrations typically daily or 2 days apart. Bacteria can be administred as single strains or combinations of strains. The bacteria can be administered alone or in combination with a pre biotic s . The pre biotic can be xylose or xylose containing molecules as a preferred carbon source for anaerobic bacteria. Other prebiotics that can be used include for example those described in Table 4. After administration of bacteria pre biotic intestinal permability is assessed using the preferred method at the desired time point s starting on day 1 post treatment.

As shown in C57BL 6 mice were either left untreated or were treated with xylose at 10 g L in drinking water from day 7 to day 14 ciprofloxacin cipro at 0.25 g L in drinking water from day 7 to day 2 enrofloxacin enro at 0.25 g L in drinking water from day 7 to day 2 xylose cipro or xylose enro. Analysis of serum samples collected on days 0 and 14 showed that basal levels of serum endotoxin are present in normal mice that remained unchanged in untreated mice. Xylose treatment reduced these basal levels over time suggesting an increase in gut barrier integrity even in normal animals. Antibiotic treatment with cipro a broad spectrum quinolone antibiotic or enro an anaerobe sparing antibiotic led to an increase in serum endotoxin levels measured 2 days after a 5 day course likely due to disruption of the microbiota. Serum endotoxin levels returned to baseline over time. As shown in xylose appeared to counteract the increase in serum endotoxin level caused by cipro but not enro. The differential effect of xylose on these 2 antibiotics may relate to its ability to preserve promote expansion of anaerobic bacteria which are killed by cipro but not enro.

The microbiota of mammalian hosts is composed of bacterial species that possess both pro and anti inflammatory properties. In healthy individuals a balance or state of eubiosis is maintained that supports gut barrier integrity immune containment of commensal bacteria and promotion of a tolerogenic environment. Under disease conditions dysbiosis characterized by an imbalance in pro and anti inflammatory bacteria results in local inflammation and compromised gut barrier integrity leading to systemic inflammation and aberrant immune responses. Administration of selected probiotic bacterial strains prebiotics that possess anti inflammatory activity and promote immune tolerance represents an approach to correct a basic defect underlying multiple pathological conditions.

An in vitro system was developed to efficiently test the inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of different human commensal bacteria on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs . Experiments were carried out with 21 bacterial candidates to profile their anti inflammatory properties against human PBMCs. The innate properties of bacteria alone on human PBMCs were tested as well as their ability to counteract the pro inflammatory activity of

Human PBMCs were isolated from fresh blood by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll 1 4 . Freshly isolated PBMCs were plated at 1.5 10cells per ml per well of a 24 well plate in a total volume of 2 mls RPMI 1640 medium 5 human serum and incubated at 37 C. 5 COwith the following 

A composite illustration of the secretion of each of the pro inflammatory and anti inflammatory cytokines described above in the presence of each commensal alone or in combination with EPV8 is graphed relative to the pro inflammatory bacterial strain Epv 8 in . In the context of GVHD IFN IFNg IL 12p70 IL 1 IL 1a IL 6 IL 8 MCP1 MIP1 MIP1a MIP1 MIP1b and TNF TNFa are considered pro inflammatory cytokines. IL 10 IL 13 IL 9 IL 4 and IL 5 are considered anti inflammatory cytokines. IL 17 IL 17A IL 9 and IL 2 have context dependent activity. The results are shown as a percentage of Epv 8 where cytokine levels in the presence of after 24 hours is set at 100 . Each commensal has a unique signature and each one added alone to human PBMCs appeared to be less inflammatory than below 100 for pro inflammatory cytokines except for Epv 5 . When added to PBMCs in combination with most commensals tested except for Epv 5 also counteracted the pro inflammatory activity of below 100 for pro inflammatory cytokines .

Overall the foregoing data indicate that among the bacteria tested EPV3 has a significantly desirable anti inflammatory profile for a Th 1 driven condition such as GVHD while EPV5 has a suboptimal anti inflammatory profile for GVHD. As shown in EPV3 has relatively low intrinsic inflammatory activity compared to EPV 8 and is able to reduce the induction of pro inflammatory cytokines by EPV 8 including IL 6 MCP 1 IL 12p70 and IFN which are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of GVHD. By comparison EPV 5 is similar to EPV 8 in terms of induction of pro inflammatory cytokines and shows little ability to counteract the induction of pro inflammatory cytokines by EPV 8.

Additional bacteria were profiled using this methodology including EPV 6 EPV15 ATCC 29174 EPV 20 product ATCC 27340 EPV 21 ATCC 29236 EPV 22 ATCC BAA 2371 EPV 23 and ATCC27752 EPV 24 . Strains freshly isolated by Epiva from the stool of a normal healthy volunteer were also profiled and included EPV 35 a previously uncultured similar to GQ898099 s S1 5 EPV 47 a previously uncultured similar to SJTU C 14 16 EPV 51 SJTU B 09 77 EPV 52 ELU0087 T13 S NI 000247 EPV 54 WAL 14507 EPV 64 EPV 78 EPV 102 and BlnIX EPV 114 . Results focusing on key pro inflammatory IL 12p70 IFN IP 10 IL 1 RA and anti inflammatory IL 10 IL 4 IL 13 cytokines are shown in . As observed with the initial set of bacterial candidates each isolate displayed a defined signature. Candidates for treatment of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders such as GVHD displayed low induction of pro inflammatory cytokines and or positive induction of anti inflammatory cytokines and had ability to counteract the inflammatory activity of . Bacterial candidates meeting these criteria include for example EPV 35 51 78 and 114.

Taken together these results show that commensals have distinct immunomodulatory properties and display a definable signature in terms of their ability to induce cytokines in human host cells or counteract the pro inflammatory activity of another bacterium . Accordingly bacterial compositions may be selected in order to achieve a desired modulation of pro and anti inflammatory cytokines. For example anti inflammatory bacterial strains may be selected based on their ability to reduce key pro inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma IL 12p70 IP 10 and IL 1RA and or increase anti inflammatory cytokines such as IL 13 IL 10 and IL 4.

In order to determine whether exposure to commensal bacteria may polarize T cells toward a particular phenotype flow cytometry analysis was performed on human PBMCs cultured with various commensal bacteria as described above. The cells recovered from culture were washed in phosphate buffered saline and stained with a cocktail of fluorescently labeled antibodies against specific cell surface protein markers to allow for the detection of Th1 cells CXCR3CCR6 Th2 cells CXCR3CCR6 Th17 cells CXCR3CCR6 and Tregs CD25CD127. Negative control wells contained PBMCs in culture medium alone and positive control wells contained PBMCs LPS 100 ng ml as a known immune stimulus. The commensal bacteria examined included Epv 1 Epv 3 Epv 2 Epv 5 Epv. 8 Epv 20 ATCC 29174 Epv 21 B. product ATCC 27340 Epv 24 ATCC 27752. As shown in exposure of human PBMCs to bacteria did result in a shift in the relative proportion of T cell populations compared to the PBMCs alone control although statistical significance was not achieved in every case. Overall most bacteria tested caused an increase in the proportion of T cells with a regulatory phenotype Tregs with EPV 21 and EPV 24 having the greatest impact and EPV8 causing little or no increase in Tregs. Most bacteria also caused a decrease in the proportion of Th17 cells an increase in Th2 cells and had little or no effect on the proportion of Th1 cells. This type of analysis indicates that commensal bacteria can modulate the proportions of effector T cell types and can be used to select the desired phenotype for a given disease application. For example the optimal T cell profile to address pro inflammatory disorders such as GVHD would consist of Treg Th17 or unchanged Th1 and Th2. This phenotype was induced by many of the bacteria tested.

Modulation of the microbiota to correct a dysbiosis associated with pathological conditions can potentially be achieved through administration of bacteria or bacterial combinations and prebiotic s as a carbon source to promote endogenous expansion of beneficial bacteria. Alternatively prebiotics can be administered in combination with bacteria to promote their growth or create a favorable environment for their growth. Profiling of carbon source usage by bacterial isolates can be used to customize and optimize selection of prebiotics for particular bacterial strains. Profiling of carbon source usage was conducted on 21 anaerobic commensal bacteria Table 3 using 96 well plates from Biolog Hayward Calif. where each well contains a different carbon source for a total of 192 different carbon sources PM01 and PM02A plates . The carbon sources tested are listed in Table 4. The assay was conducted according to manufacturer s instructions. Briefly pre cultured bacteria were suspended in Biolog assay medium at a 750 nm optical density OD of 0.3 0.4 and 100 l of the suspension was transferred to each well of the 96 well PM01 and PM02 assay plates. The plates were then incubated at 37 C. in an anaerobic chamber for 24 hr or longer. The amount of growth on each carbon source was evaluated by measuring the optical density OD of each well at 750 nm. The results are summarized in and indicate that each individual strain displays a unique pattern of carbon source usage. Interestingly different isolates of the same species e.g. and show related albeit distinct patterns. Overall these results indicate that characterization of carbon source usage for profiling of bacterial candidates allows optimal selection of prebiotics. Preferred prebiotics can be selected which increase the growth indicated by an increase in optical density of bacterial species contained in probiotic compositions.

D xylose is a carbon source generally preferred by anaerobic bacteria. Preliminary results in the mouse indicate that it may act to promote gut barrier integrity . It is also used as a carbon source by several bacterial strains that were determined to possess a desirable immunological profile for target indications such as GVHD . A parallel double blind 5 cohort escalation food safety study was conducted to examine D xylose in normal human volunteers. The study was a double blind single center parallel group study designed to evaluate the tolerability and potential microbiome changes induced by ingestion of D xylose at 5 different amounts in healthy adult volunteers enrolled at 1 study center in the United States US .

Subjects were screened for eligibility within 21 days prior to the first planned ingestion of study sweetener on Day 1 Baseline . Within each of 5 cohorts eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a double blinded 6 2 ratio to ingest either D xylose or the GRAS sweetener Splenda control dissolved into 2 to 6 oz of sterile water and ingested TID with meals for a total of 82 ingestions taken over 28 consecutive days. D xylose ingestion amounts ranged from 1 to 15 g TID total daily amount of 3 to 45 g and all subjects randomized to Splenda ingested 1 dissolved commercially available packet TID 3 packets total per day .

Subjects returned to the study center weekly on Days 8 15 22 and 28 for ingestion tolerability and compliance evaluations. Safety was evaluated on a continual basis through adverse events AE monitoring clinical laboratory measurements vital sign monitoring physical examinations electrocardiograms ECGs telephone follow up and electronic subject ingestion diaries. Stool was collected pre ingestion and at pre specified time points and post ingestion samples were evaluated for changes in the gut microbiome compared with Baseline for all subjects. For subjects who consented to further sampling additional stool specimens were used to potentially isolate living bacteria that could be categorized for research and potential commercialization purposes. Serum and urine were collected for measurement of D xylose levels and pharmacokinetic PK assessments and PK pharmacodynamics PD correlations. Telephone follow up was conducted as needed but minimally once per week. The total duration for each participant was up to 60 days including the Screening period Day 21 to 0 the ingestion period Day 1 to 28 and an End of Study EOS follow up visit conducted 7 3 days after the last ingestion of study sweetener.

Safety was evaluated on a continual basis through AE monitoring clinical laboratory measurements vital sign monitoring physical examinations ECGs telephone follow up and electronic subject ingestion diaries.

Stool was collected at pre specified pre and post ingestion time points and post ingestion samples were evaluated for changes in the gut microbiome compared with Baseline. Additional optional specimens were collected to potentially isolate living bacteria that could be categorized for research and potential commercialization purposes.

Blood was collected at pre specified pre and post ingestion time points to evaluate C reactive protein CRP serum cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF interleukin IL 2 IL 6 interferon gamma IFN and IL 10 and T cell markers CD3 CD4 CD8 CD25 and FOXP3. Plasma was also stored and may be tested for biomarkers and or metabolic markers for up to 7 years.

Blood and urine were collected at pre specified pre and post ingestion time points to measure D xylose levels and to characterize the systemic absorption profiles of D xylose.

Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.2 SAS Institute Inc. Cary N.C. USA . The sample size calculations were empiric and based on an estimation of normal healthy volunteer variability in reported symptoms and side effects and not on a statistical method. A weighted randomization scheme was implemented such that more subjects were enrolled at the higher D xylose ingestion amounts to account for potential toxicity related effects that could have resulted in withdrawal and or analysis ineligibility and to enable collection of more data at ingestion amounts for which limited data were available.

AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities MedDRA Version 18.0 Northrup Grumman Corporation Chantilly Va. USA and summarized by cohort. Laboratory vital sign and physical examination data were summarized by cohort using descriptive statistics over time including statistics for changes from Baseline. ECG findings were also summarized by cohort over time as well as using frequency counts and percentages as normal or abnormal with the relevance of abnormalities categorized by clinical significance.

A total of 7 stool samples were expected to be collected for each subject. Evaluation of changes in the gut microbiome were evaluated in stool samples through taxonomic classification relative and statistical differential abundance analyses by cohort and time point an alpha diversity analysis calculated using the Shannon diversity index by cohort and time point a beta diversity analysis using Bray Curtis dissimilarity and Unifrac distance by subject and time point and a principal coordinates analysis using the beta diversity data.

Summary statistics n mean standard deviation median minimum and maximum were presented for serum concentrations of CRP flow cytometry T cell markers CD3 CD4 CD8 CD25 and FOXP3 and cytokines TNF IL 2 IL 6 IFN and IL 10 as per their nominal time points.

Serum D xylose concentrations were summarized by cohort using nominal sample times according to actual amount received using summary statistics n coefficient of variation CV mean standard deviation SD median minimum and maximum . Evidence for the occurrence of steady state was assessed graphically by comparing the time course of either trough or 2 hour post ingestion serum concentrations of D xylose as different levels of D xylose. Accumulation was assessed by comparing the 2 hour post first ingestion serum levels with those observed at Week 2 Day 15 and Week 4 Day 28 .

The total amount of D xylose excreted in urine was analyzed for all subjects over 5 hours post ingestion and pooled for analysis the pooling for analysis reflected the subject mean within a given time of collection e.g. Day 15 and then Day 28 sorted by ingested amount. Urine PK parameters for D xylose levels included Ae cumulative amount of sweetener recovered in urine and percent sweetener amount excreted over a 5 hour period.

Forty eight subjects were randomized to ingest either 1 packet of commercially available Splenda TID n 12 or D xylose TID at the following ingestion amounts n 36 total 

Over the 28 day ingestion period study sweetener ingestion compliance was 90 for all subjects. Two subjects 4.2 discontinued from the study prematurely primary reasons for discontinuation were a protocol violation positive urine drug screen and withdrawal of consent. The proportion of males 47.9 and females 52.1 was balanced and the majority of subjects were White 89.6 and not Hispanic or Latino 77.1 . Subject ages spanned a wide range with a median of 38.3 range 22.5 to 60.5 years for the combined D xylose cohorts and 43.6 range 24.9 to 64.3 years for the Splenda cohort.

D xylose and Splenda were both well tolerated with no new safety concerns identified. One subject required a D xylose reduction from 15 g to 12.5 g TID at the Week 1 Day 8 visit due to AEs of moderate abdominal distension diarrhea and GI pain no other modifications to sweetener ingestion amounts were implemented.

Overall 17 subjects 35.4 experienced at least 1 AE including a higher proportion of subjects who ingested any amount of D xylose 14 subjects 38.9 than Splenda 3 subjects 25.0 . Reported AE rates increased with increasing D xylose ingestion amounts with incidences ranging from 16.7 in subjects who ingested the 2 lowest amounts 1 and 2 g TID to 66.7 in subjects who ingested the highest amount 15 g TID . AEs reported for more than 1 subject in the D xylose cohorts included diarrhea 3 subjects 8.3 and flatulence and GI pain 2 subjects 5.6 each . AEs in the Splenda cohort included abdominal distension flatulence increased blood creatinine infrequent bowel movements and rhinitis. The incidence of AEs was highest during Weeks 1 and 2 Days 2 through 15 regardless of sweetener type or ingestion amount. During this 2 week period 18 subjects overall 37.5 experienced AEs compared with 7 subjects 14.6 overall who experienced AEs either on Day 1 or after Week 2.

All AEs were mild in severity with the exception of moderate AEs reported for 4 subjects 11.1 in the D xylose cohorts. These moderate AEs included abdominal distension concussion post concussion syndrome diarrhea GI pain increased blood bilirubin and neutropenia.

No SAEs severe AEs or subject deaths were reported. One subject in the 8 g TID D xylose cohort experienced non serious moderate AEs of concussion and post concussion syndrome that were noted to have contributed to study discontinuation however this subject s primary reason for discontinuation was withdrawal of consent.

GI related AEs which were of special interest were reported for 7 subjects 19.4 in the D xylose cohorts and 2 subjects 16.7 in the Splenda cohort. GI related events were mild for all but 1 subject in the 15 g TID D xylose cohort who experienced moderate GI related AEs of abdominal distension diarrhea and GI pain that required reduction of the D xylose ingestion amount to 12.5 g TID.

Eleven subjects 22.9 experienced at least 1 AE that was considered by the Investigator to be related to study sweetener including 9 subjects 25.0 in the D xylose cohorts and 2 subjects 16.7 in the Splenda cohort. The incidence of sweetener related AEs appeared to increase with increasing D xylose ingestion amounts. Sweetener related AEs reported for more than 1 subject in the D xylose cohorts included diarrhea 3 subjects 8.3 and flatulence and GI pain 2 subjects 5.6 each . Sweetener related AEs reported in the Splenda cohort were abdominal distension flatulence and infrequent bowel movements.

No fluctuations in clinical laboratory measurements over time were considered to be clinically meaningful. Categorical shifts from Baseline that occurred in 10 of subjects in either the combined D xylose or Splenda cohorts included decreased or increased glucose 27.7 D xylose and 16.7 Splenda and decreased absolute neutrophil count ANC 13.9 and 8.3 these shifts were not associated with sweetener type or ingestion amount.

To assess the effect of D xylose on the gut microbiome this study incorporated an analysis of alpha diversity beta diversity and differentially abundant taxa. These factors were assessed both across cohorts and over time. Regardless of sweetener ingestion amount no apparent significant impact on the intra sample alpha diversity of the gut microbiome was observed and no significant changes in community composition were observed over time on study. Numerous taxa were identified as differentially abundant but these findings may reflect the relatively small sample sizes in each cohort.

Across all D xylose cohorts 8.3 of subjects with normal serum CRP at Baseline experienced at least 1 post ingestion CRP value 2.9 mg L. A substantially higher proportion of subjects in the Splenda cohort 41.7 had normal serum CRP at Baseline and experienced at least 1 post ingestion CRP value 2.9 mg L. None of the post ingestion CRP values for any subject were deemed clinically significant.

Because most individual cytokine data points were below the limit of quantitation BLQ and therefore set to zero cytokine summary statistics were limited and did not indicate any consistent or clinically meaningful changes over time for either sweetener or any D xylose ingestion amount. There was a trend for reduced levels of serum interferon gamma over time in the 2 g and 15 g D xylose cohorts . No consistent or clinically meaningful changes over time in total T cells or any T cell subsets were observed for either sweetener or any D xylose ingestion amount.

Serum D xylose concentrations increased linearly with increasing ingestion amounts. Little to no accumulation of serum D xylose occurred at Day 15 following 1 g to 12.5 g TID ingestion while an approximately 1.9 fold accumulation ratio was observed in the 15 mg TID cohort although variability was high . On Day 28 the accumulation ratio ranged from 1.08 to 1.31 following 1 g to 12.5 g TID ingestion and 1.68 following 15 g TID ingestion although variability was moderate to high in all but the 8 g TID cohort.

In the 1 g TID cohort approximately 40 of the ingested amount of D xylose was recovered in urine within 5 hours post ingestion on Days 1 15 and 28. In the 2 g through 15 g TID cohorts between 23 and 32 of the ingested amount of D xylose was recovered in urine within 5 hours post ingestion on Days 1 15 and 28. The fraction excreted in urine was similar among Days 1 15 and 28.

A review of the time course of serum D xylose concentrations and the corresponding urinary excretion profiles indicated high ingestion compliance.

A total of 344 stool samples were collected in OMNIgene GUT collection kits and shipped to the GenoFIND laboratory for DNA extraction and V3 V4 16S amplicon sequencing. There were no major shifts in the microbiome alpha diversity between the different treatment groups absolute number of OTUs abundance of OTUs or over time on study. There was an overall decrease in the Chao diversity index over time indicator of community richness of singleton doubleton OTUs as shown in . Numerous taxa were identified as differentially abundant but this finding may be attributable to the relatively small sample sizes of each cohort. Similar observations were made in the mouse study e.g. xylose treatment did not cause major shifts in the gut microbiome but showed some differences at the family level. Overall these results suggest that under the conditions tested in normal individuals and normal mice ingestion of xylose exerts subtle changes in the gut microbiome. The impact of xylose on the microbiome under disease conditions remains to be determined.

Taken together the results of this trial show that D xylose is safe and well tolerated and indicate that prebiotic formulations containing xylose may reduce inflammation in a subject resulting in reduction of serum levels of pro inflammatory cytokines.

The trillions of organisms forming the microbiome function as an organ system interconnected throughout the body. The possibility that modification of the microbiome in a given physical location may influence the microbiome at other sites in the body distal augmentation was investigated. Seven week old C57Bl 6 female mice were acclimatized for 7 days prior to the start of the study by daily handling and shuffling between cages. All mice were housed at three mice per cage in individually vented cages Thoren Hazleton Pa. . At day 0 baseline fresh fecal pellets and vaginal lavages with 100 L of sterile double distilled water were collected and immediately frozen at 80 C. for microbiome analysis. After baseline collection mice were given to drink either autoclaved water N 6 or 0.5 mg L of the antibiotic vancomycin in autoclaved water N 6 ad libitum. Water alone is not expected to influence the microbiome and acted as a negative control. Oral vancomycin is poorly absorbed from the gut and its ingestion does not result in significant levels of drug in the body Rao et al 2011 . The impact of oral vancomycin is therefore expected to be limited to the gastrointestinal tract such that microbiome changes elsewhere in the body e.g. vagina would be attributable to distal augmentation. At day 6 fresh fecal pellets and vaginal lavages with 100 L of sterile double distilled water were collected and immediately stored at 80 C. for microbiome analysis.

Isolation and sequencing of microbial DNA from the stool and vaginal samples was performed by DNA Genotek Ottawa ON Canada . The V3 V4 region of the 16S ribosomal subunit was amplified with custom PCR primers and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq to a minimum acceptable read depth of 25 000 sequences per sample. The widely accepted read depth requirement for accurate taxonomic profiling is 15 000 100 000 reads Illumina 2014 . A closed reference taxonomic classification was performed where each sequence was aligned to the SILVA reference database version 123. Sequences were aligned using the UCLUST algorithm included in QIIME version 1.9.1 Caporaso et al. 2010 . A minimum threshold of 97 sequence identity was used to classify sequences according to representative sequences in the database. At 97 sequence identity each OTU represents a genetically unique group of biological organisms. These OTU s were then assigned a curated taxonomic label based on the seven level SILVA taxonomy.

As expected oral vancomycin treatment had a strong impact on the microbiome of the gut. As shown by principal component analysis PCA at the family level the day 0 to day 6 pattern in fecal samples was clearly different in the control vs oral vancomycin group . Interestingly the day 0 to day 6 pattern in the vaginal samples also showed an overall difference between the PBS and oral vancomycin groups even though the vaginal environment is not exposed to vancomycin following oral administration of the antibiotic . In addition some bacterial species were detected at low frequency in vaginal samples of the vancomycin treated group at day 6 median abundance of approximately 0.00002 that were not present at day 0 Table 5 . These results support the concept of distal augmentation whereby modification of the microbiome at one site also has an impact at a distal site s . This finding opens the possibility of modulating the microbiome for example at the level of the gut to effect therapeutic changes in the microbiome at other sites for example the lung.

The following work is done in the presence and absence as a control of one or more selected prebiotic carbohydrates. This assay may be used to test or confirm the ability of a prebiotic bacterium pair to elicit an immunomodulatory response such that the production or release of proinflammatory cytokines decreases and or the production or release of anti inflammatory cytokines increases may be used to evaluate the difference in cytokine response in the presence or absence of a prebiotic mixture and or may be used to evaluate an array of prebiotic candidates. Clostridales bacteria are obtained from the ATCC or purified from a human donor and cultured in brain heart infusion broth at 37 C. The bacteria are harvested by centrifugation 3000 g 15 minutes after 24 hours of stationary growth. To test the effects of spores on human intestinal cells and or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells huPBMC bacteria are first heat killed 95 C. 30 minutes before the centrifugation step. Bacteria or spores are washed three times with lx PBS pH 7.2 Gibco BRL and subsequently diluted to obtain final cell densities of 10and 10colony forming units cfu ml in RPMI 1640 medium Gibco BRL .

Human enterocyte like CaCO 2 cells passage 60 65 are seeded at a density of 2.5 10cells ml on 25 mm cell culture inserts 0.4 m nucleopore size Becton Dickinson . The inserts are placed into six well tissue culture plates Nunc and cultured 18 22 days at 37 C. 10 COin DMEM glutamine high glucose Amimed supplemented with 20 decomplemented fetal calf serum 56 C. 30 minutes Amimed 1 MEM non essential amino acids Gibco BRL 10 m ml gentamycin Gibco BRL and 0.1 penicillin streptomycin 10 000 IU ml 10 000 UG ml Gibco BRL . The cell culture medium is changed every second day until the cells are fully differentiated. Transepithelial electrical resistance TEER is determined continuously in confluent CaCO 2 monolayers using a MultiCell ERS voltmeter ohmmeter or as described in Example 44.

Tissue culture inserts covered with CaCO 2 cell monolayers are washed twice with prewarmed RPMI 1640 medium and transferred to six well tissue culture plates. 2 mL culture medium is added to the apical and basolateral compartments of the transwell cell culture system.

Next the apical surface of CaCO 2 monolayers is challenged by addition of 10or 10cfu ml of Clostridiales bacteria or spores in the absence of gentamicin. After four hours gentamicin is added at 150 g mL to stop bacterial growth and metabolite secretion. CaCO 2 cells are stimulated with the bacteria or spores for 6 36 hours in a 37 C. 10 COincubator. Then the CaCO 2 cells are collected washed once with cold 1 PBS pH 7.2 and lysed in denaturation solution for RNA extraction Micro RNA Isolation Kit Stratagene . Cellular lysates are stored at 20 C. and cell culture supernatants are collected from the apical compartment and frozen at 20 C. The immune response of CaCO 2 cells is monitored by analysis of cytokine gene transcription TNF IL 8 monocyte chemoattracting protein 1 MCP 1 TGF IL 12 IFN IL 4 IL 10 using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR technique and determination of cytokine secretion in cell culture supernatants using an ELISA Haller D Bode C Hammes W P Pfeifer A M A Schiffrin E J Blum S 2000.
