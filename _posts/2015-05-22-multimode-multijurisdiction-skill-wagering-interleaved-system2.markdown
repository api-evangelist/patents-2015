Turning now to the drawings systems and methods for operation of multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved games SWigs are illustrated. In several embodiments a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game is a form of a combined skill and wagering game that integrates both a gambling game that includes a real world operating system RC.OS which manages the gambling game as well as a skill based entertainment game Eg coupled to the RC.OS by a game world operating system GW.OS which manages the configuration of the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game. The Eg executes the skill based components of the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game for user entertainment. In certain embodiments the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game also includes a player interface associated with either or both the gambling game and the entertainment game. A player s play of a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game is an electronic representation of player interactions typically via a player interface and associated with a player profile of the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game.

In operation of a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game a player acts upon various types of elements of the entertainment game in a game world environment. Elements are a limited resource consumed within an entertainment game to advance entertainment game gameplay. In playing the entertainment game using the elements a player can optionally consume and accrue game world credits GWCs within the entertainment game. These credits can be in the form of but are not limited to game world credits experience points or points generally. Wagers can be made in the gambling game as triggered by the player s use of one or more elements of the entertainment game. The wagers are made using real world credits RWCs . The real world credits can be credits in an actual currency or can be credits in a virtual currency which has real world value. Gambling outcomes from the gambling game can cause consumption loss or accrual of RWCs. In addition gambling outcomes in the gambling game can influence elements in the entertainment game such as but not limited to by restoring a consumed element causing the loss of an element restoration or placement of a fixed element. In certain embodiments gambling games can facilitate the wager of GWCs for a randomly generated payout of GWCs or a wager of elements for a randomly generated payout of elements. In particular embodiments an amount of GWCs and or elements used as part of a wager can have a RWC value if cashed out of a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game gameplay session.

Example elements include enabling elements EE which are elements that enable a player s play of the entertainment game and the consumption of which by the player while playing the entertainment game can trigger a wager in a gambling game. Another non limiting example of an element is a reserve enabling element REE which is an element that converts into one or more enabling elements upon occurrence of a release event in skill wagering interleaved game gameplay. Other types of elements include actionable elements AE which are elements that are acted upon to trigger a wager in the gambling game and may or may not be restorable during normal play of the entertainment game. Another type of element is a common enabling element CEE which is an element that may be shared by two or more players and the use of which by any of the players causes a wager to be triggered.

In progressing through entertainment game gameplay elements can be utilized by a player during interactions with a controlled entity CE which is a character entity inanimate object device or other object under control of a player.

Also entertainment game gameplay progress and wager triggers can be dependent upon a game world variable such as but not limited to a required game object RGO which is a specific game object in an entertainment game acted upon for an AE to be completed such as but not limited to a specific key needed to open a door a required environmental condition REC which is a game state present within an entertainment game for an AE to be completed such as but not limited to daylight the presence of which enables a character to walk through woods or a controlled entity characteristic CEC which is a status of the CE within an entertainment game for an AE to be completed such as but not limited to a CE to have full health points before entering battle . Although various gameplay or game world resources such as but not limited to GWCs RWCs and elements as discussed above any gameplay resource can be utilized to advance multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game gameplay as well as form the basis for a trigger of a wager as appropriate to the specification of a specific application in accordance with various embodiments of the invention.

In certain embodiments the Eg accepts input from the player through a set of hand controls and or head gesture and or eye tracking systems and outputs video audio and or other sensory output to a player interface. In many embodiments the Eg can exchange data with and accept control information from the GW.OS . In several embodiments an Eg can be implemented using a casino gaming device such as a cabinet based casino game a personal computer PC a Sony PlayStation a video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment of Tokyo Japan or Microsoft Xbox a video game console developed by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. running a specific entertainment game software program. In numerous embodiments an Eg can be an electromechanical game system of a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game that is an electromechanical skill wagering interleaved game. An electromechanical skill wagering interleaved game executes an electromechanical game for player entertainment. The electromechanical game can be any game that utilizes both mechanical and electrical components where the game operates as a combination of mechanical motions performed by at least one player or the electromechanical game itself. Various electromechanical skill wagering interleaved games are discussed in Patent Cooperation Treaty Application No. PCT US12 58156 filed Sep. 29 2012 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 790 170 issued Jul. 29 2014 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The Eg operates mostly independently from the GW.OS except that via the transfer of game world resources the GW.OS can send certain multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game resources including control parameters to the Eg to affect the execution of the Eg such as but not limited to changing the difficulty level of the game. In various embodiments these entertainment game control parameters can be based on a gambling outcome of a gambling game that was triggered by an element in the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game being acted upon by the player. The Eg can accept this input from the GW.OS make adjustments and continue multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game gameplay all the while running seamlessly from the player s perspective.

Execution of the Eg is mostly skill based except for where the Eg s processes can inject complexities into the game by chance in its normal operation to create unpredictability in the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game. The Eg can also communicate player choices made in the game to the GW.OS included in the game world information such as but not limited to the player s utilization of the elements of the Eg during the player s skillful execution of the Eg . The GW.OS operates in this architecture being interfaced thusly to the Eg to allow the transparent coupling of an multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game to a fair and transparent random chance gambling game providing a seamless perspective to the player that they are playing a typical popular multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game which is skill based .

In several embodiments the RC.OS can accept a trigger to run a gambling game in response to actions taken by the player in the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game as conveyed by the Eg to the GW.OS and as triggered by the GW.OS using trigger logic background to the overall skill wagering interleaved game from the player s perspective but can provide information to the GW.OS to expose the player to certain aspects of the gambling game such as but not limited to odds amount of RWCs in play and amount of RWCs available. In various embodiments the RC.OS can accept modifications in the amount of RWCs wagered on each individual gambling attempt or the number of gambling games per minute the RC.OS can execute entrance into a bonus round and other factors all the while these factors can take a different form than that of a typical slot machine. An example of a varying wager amount that the player can choose can include but is not limited to gameplay using a more difficult Eg level. These choices can increase or decrease the amount wagered per individual gambling game in the same manner that a standard slot machine player can decide to wager more or fewer credits for each pull of the handle. In several embodiments the RC.OS can communicate a number of factors back and forth to the GW.OS via an interface such that an increase decrease in a wagered amount can be related to the player s decision making as to their player profile in the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game. In this manner a player can be in control of a per game wager amount with the choice mapping to a parameter or component that is applicable to the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game experience.

In some embodiments a game world control layer provides an interface between the game engine and the GW.OS . The game world control layer resides on the Eg .

In many embodiments the game world control layer is a separate dynamically linked library that may be separate from but called by the game engine at runtime. In some embodiments the game world control layer is a separate service that is invoked on the Eg and interfaces to the game engine .

In many embodiments a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game integrates a video game style gambling machine where the gambling game including an RC.OS and RWCs is not player skill based while at the same time allows players to use their skills to earn club points which a casino operator can translate to rewards tournament opportunities and prizes for the players. The actual exchange of monetary funds earned or lost directly from gambling against a game of chance in a gambling game such as a slot machine is preserved. At the same time a rich environment of rewards to stimulate gamers can be established with the entertainment game. In several embodiments the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game can leverage popular titles with gamers and provides a sea change environment for casinos to attract players with games that are more akin to the type of entertainment that a younger generation desires. In various embodiments players can apply their skill towards building and banking GWCs that in turn can be used to win tournaments and various prizes as a function of their gamer prowess. Numerous embodiments minimize the underlying changes applied to the aforementioned entertainment software for the skill wagering interleaved game to operate within a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game construct. Therefore a plethora of complex game titles and environments can be rapidly and inexpensively to deployed in a gambling environment.

In certain embodiments multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved games also allow players to gain entry into subsequent competitions through the accumulation of GWCs as a function of the user s demonstrated skill at the game. These competitions can pit individual players or groups of players against one another and or against the operator of a gambling game such as but not limited to a casino to win prizes based upon a combination of chance and skill. These competitions can be either asynchronous events whereby players participate at a time and or place of their choosing or they can be synchronized events whereby players participate at a specific time and or venue.

In many embodiments one or more players can be engaged in playing a skill based multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game executed by the Eg . A multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game can include an entertainment game that includes head to head play between a single player and the computer between two or more players against one another or multiple players playing against the computer and or each other as well as a process by which a player can bet on the outcome of a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game. The multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game can also be a game where the player is not playing against the computer or any other player such as in games where the player is effectively playing against himself or herself.

In accordance with some embodiments the use of the GW.OS RC.OS and Eg allows for the separation of control of a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game between different devices. For example the Eg may be hosted by a device that is separate from any devices that host the RC.OS and or GW.OS. Through separation of control of the functions of the GW.OS RC.OS and Eg the RC.OS may be isolated from the player s device thus preventing player interference with the RC.OS and the gambling game. In addition as the Eg is responsible for providing the entertainment game multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved games may provide for complex entertainment games for the player as the Eg need not include the tightly regulated components of the RC.OS thus providing for more freedom in Eg design. Also separation of control allows a GW.OS to provide complex wager initiation rules that would not be possible if the either the Eg or the RC.OS were to be in control of the wager initiation.

In accordance with various embodiments a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game allows for interleaving of continuous wagering within an entertainment game. For example instead of wagering once and then playing an entertainment game to completion or playing an entertainment game to completion and then placing a wager a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game allows a gaming system or device to be provided to a player where the gaming system or device provides a complex and interesting entertainment game with wagering incorporated throughout the entertainment game.

In various embodiments a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game provides for feedback into the entertainment game of additional entertainment game resources that are made available in the Eg for the use of the player as the result of wagering outcomes. The additional entertainment game resources may enable portions of the entertainment game that were not available to the player without the resources.

In many embodiments a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game provides the ability to use the gambling hybrid game in more than one jurisdiction as the Eg is a component separate from the GW.OS and RC.OS. For example the Eg may be operated as either a pure entertainment game or as a gambling game depending on the type of characteristics of the RC.OS that the Eg is coupled to.

In some embodiments a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game provides for display of an entertainment game on a player s device that the player is using to interact with the entertainment game as well as providing a separate display of a state of a gambling game on a separate gambling game display. The separate gambling game display may be on the player s device within the same physical display device as the entertainment game on a separate device from the entertainment game having a separate physical screen or on a separate physical display device separate from the entertainment game on the player s device.

During operation the game engine reads and writes game resources stored on a data store of the Eg host. The game resources include game objects having graphics and or control logic used to implement game world objects of the Eg . In various embodiments the game resources may also include but are not limited to video files that are used to generate cut scenes for the Eg audio files used to generate music sound effects etc. within the Eg configuration files used to configure the features of the Eg scripts or other types of control code used to implement various game play features of the Eg and graphics resources such as textures objects etc. that are used by the game engine to render objects displayed in Eg .

In operation components of the game engine read portions of the game state and generate the player presentation for the player which is presented to the player using the player interface . The player perceives the presentation and provides player inputs using the HIDs . The corresponding player inputs are received as player actions or inputs by various components of the game engine . The game engine translates the player actions into interactions with the virtual objects of the game world stored in the game state. Components of the game engine use the player interactions with the virtual objects of the entertainment game and the entertainment game state to update the game state and update the presentation presented to the user. The process loops in a game loop continuously while the player plays the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game.

The Eg includes one or more interfaces between an Eg and other components of a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game such as a GW.OS . The Eg and the other multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game components communicate with each other using the interfaces such as by passing various types of data and sending and receiving messages status information commands and the like. In certain embodiments the Eg and GW.OS exchange game world resources and game world GW information . In some embodiments the communications include requests by the GW.OS that the Eg update the game state using information provided by the GW.OS . Another embodiment of a communication is requesting by the GW.OS that the Eg update one or more game resources using information provided by the GW.OS . In another embodiment communication is provided by the Eg of all or a portion of the game state. In some embodiments the Eg may also provide one or more of the game resources to the GW.OS . In some embodiments the communication includes player actions that the Eg communicates to the GW.OS . The player actions may be low level player interactions with the player interface such as manipulation of an HID or may be high level interactions with objects as determined by the entertainment game. The player actions may also include resultant actions such as modifications to the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game state or game resources resulting from the player s actions taken in the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game. In some embodiments player actions include but are not limited to actions taken by entities such as non payer characters NPC of the entertainment game that act on behalf of or under the control of the player.

In some embodiments the Eg includes a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game player interface used to communicate multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game data to and from the player. The multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game data includes but is not limited to information used by the player to configure gambling game RWC wagers and information about the gambling game RWC wagers such as RWC balances and RWC amounts wagered.

In various embodiments an RC.OS may use an RNG that is an external system connected to the RC.OS by local area network LAN or a wide area network WAN such as the Internet. In some embodiments the external RNG is a central deterministic system such as a regulated and controlled random numbered ball selection device or some other system which provides random or pseudo random numbers to one or a plurality of connected RC.OSs.

In numerous embodiments the method of interfacing an RC.OS to other systems devices or to an external RNG may be the Internet but it should be noted that nothing would preclude using a different interface than the Internet in certain embodiments such as a LAN a USB interface or some other method by which two electronic devices could communicate with each other.

In numerous embodiments signaling occurs between various types of an RC.OS and an external system such as GW.OS . In some of these embodiments the RC.OS operates to manage wagering events and to provide random or pseudo random numbers from an RNG. The external system requesting wagering support instructs the RC.OS as to the pay table to use followed by the amount of RWC to wager. Next the external system signals the RC.OS to trigger a wager followed by the RC.OS informing the external system as to the outcome of the wager the amount of RWC won and lastly the amount of RWC in the player s account in the credit repository.

In various embodiments a second communication exchange between various types of RC.OSs and an external system relates to the external system using an RNG result support from the RC.OS. In this exchange the external system requests an RNG result from the RC.OS and the RC.OS returns an RNG result as a function of the RC.OS s internal RNG or from an RNG external to the RC.OS to which the RC.OS is connected.

In some embodiments communication exchange between various types of an RC.OS and an external system relate to the external system wanting support on coupling an RNG result to a particular one of the pay tables contained in the RC.OS . In such an exchange the external system instructs the RC.OS as to the pay table to use and then requests a result whereby the RNG result would be coupled to the requested pay table and this result would be returned to the external system. In such an exchange no actual RWC wager is conducted but might be useful in coupling certain non RWC wagering entertainment game behaviors and propositions to the same final resultant wagering return which is understood for the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game to conduct wagering.

In numerous embodiments some or all of the various commands and responses illustrated could be combined into one or more communication packets.

It should be understood that there may be many embodiments of an RC.OS which could be possible including forms where many modules and components of the RC.OS are located in various servers and locations so the foregoing is not meant to be exhaustive or all inclusive but rather provide information on various embodiments of an RC.OS .

In certain embodiments the sequence of events in the timing diagram of can be reflected in an entertainment game of a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game. For example a player can take an action such as selecting a number to be placed in a section of a Sudoku board. The Eg can provide a signal to the GW.OS of the player action such as but not limited to signaling the GW.OS as to the player s choice of the symbol the position on the Sudoku puzzle board that the symbol is played and whether or not the symbol as played was a correct symbol in terms of eventually solving the Sudoku puzzle. The GW.OS can process the information concerning the placement of the symbol and signal to the Eg to consume a symbol EE with each placement. The entertainment game then will consume the number EE based upon the placement of the symbol. The GW.OS can also signal the RC.OS that 3 credits of RWC are to be wagered to match the placement of the symbol as EE that is consumed on a particular pay table table Ln RC . The RC.OS can consume the 3 credits for the wager and execute the specified wager. In executing the wager the RC.OS can determine that the player hits a jackpot of 6 credits and allocate the 6 credits of RWC to the credit meter. The RC.OS can also inform the GW.OS that 6 credits of RWC net were won as a payout from the wager. The GW.OS can signal the Eg to add 2 additional symbols EE to the symbol of symbols available to a player based upon the gambling game payout. The Eg can then add 2 symbols EE to the number of symbol placements available to a player in the skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game. The GW.OS can receive an update from the Eg as to the total amount of EE associated with the player. The GW.OS can log the new player score GWC in the game as a function of the successful placement of the symbol based on the update and signal to the Eg to add 2 extra points of GWC to the player s score.

In many embodiments a player can bet on whether or not the player will beat another player. These bets can be made for example on the final outcome of the game and or the state of the game along various intermediary points such as but not limited to the score at the end of a period of time of a multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game session and or on various measures associated with the game. Players can bet against one another or engage the computer in a head to head competition in the context of their skill level in the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game in question. As such players can have a handicap associated with their player profile that describes their skill which can be their professed skill in certain embodiments and which is used by a GW.OS such as a local GW.OS or a GW.OS that receives services from remote servers to offer appropriate bets around the final and or intermediate outcomes of the multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved game entertainment game and or to condition sponsored gameplay as a function of player skill and or to select players across one or more multi mode multi jurisdiction skill wagering interleaved games to participate in head to head games and or tournaments.

Many embodiments enable the maximization of the number of players able to compete competitively by enabling handicapping of players by utilizing a skill normalization module that handicaps players to even the skill level of players competing against each other. Handicapping enables players of varying performance potential to compete competitively regardless of absolute skill level such as but not limited to where a player whose skill level identifies the player as a beginner can compete in head to head or tournament play against a highly skilled player with meaningful results.
