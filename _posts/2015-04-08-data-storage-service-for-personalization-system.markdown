Various embodiments according to the present disclosure may provide for windowing of business information on one or more of geographical temporal demographical and or social business networking bases. Certain embodiments may provide an easy way for consumers to find and discover the best local merchants. Certain embodiments may allow consumers to see which local merchants are popular and trusted around them. Searching by a consumer may become more relevant and personalized to the consumer s history and business interests. Certain embodiments may provide one or more ways in which a user may organize the user s business relationship information and may automatically manage update and maintain relationship information in order to make the user s life a lot easier. Various embodiments may allow consumers to create and curate business information collections add custom content to collections get updates from the businesses of interest see friends recommendations and see what businesses are trending in the consumer s local area s of interest.

A user s personalized business information may be retained in with a local graph of merchants of interest to the user. Certain embodiments may allow for generating a local graph of merchants organizing the local graph augmenting the local graph updating the local graph exposing the local graph to the user and or sharing of the local graph with one or more third parties which may include one or more other users. Certain embodiments may allow saving of listings information into one or more collections and certain embodiments may automatically organize a user s listings into collections. By saving of listing information for later use a user may readily retrieve listing information for businesses of interest. Certain embodiments may allow a user to retrieve the user s personalized business information from any suitable network connected computing device so that the information is accessible to the user wherever the user may be.

In some embodiments organization of business information into collections may be based on default criteria and or user specified criteria. As some potential non limiting examples of collections there may be a home collection a garden collection a pet collection a family collection a health collection a kid s collection a collection customized to a specific project etc. A collection may allow for retrieval of listings at any time.

Business listing information associated with a collection may be automatically updated by the information handling system such that when listing information is retrieved from a collection the listing information may be updated information. Thus a collection allows for the maintenance of listing information of interest to provide a user with the most up to date listing information for the businesses that matter to the user. And thus if a provider associated with a collection has moved or changed phone numbers the user will not be left with obsolete information as the user would otherwise be if such information was recorded into an address book because the change may be captured so that the collection would be automatically updated with the new information.

Certain embodiments may provide an automated workflow to gauge a user s interests. The automated workflow may include a series of questions presented to the user the answers to which as provided by user selections may indicate user interests. A user s interests may be used as one or more bases for prompting the user according to various embodiments disclosed herein.

Certain embodiments may provide the option for a user to create a custom collection. For example a user could create a custom collection for a kitchen remodeling project. Providers that are helping and or could potentially help the user with the project could be associated with the collection with notes on them indicia of whether the user likes particular providers or not which providers have been contacted information obtained from providers which providers have been selected etc.

A collection may allow for addition of notes by a user to a listing or a group of listings in the collection. Some embodiments could provide a preference indication feature and or a rating feature for a user to rate a provider. The preference indication feature could include a user selectable option allowing a user to indicate a preference for a provider in any suitable manner. The rating feature could include a user selectable option presenting ratings for selection in any suitable manner.

Thus a user can record notes about what might be interesting to the user. For example the user may note having talked to so and so and may generally keep track of various things related to one or more businesses of interest. For example a user may be planning a project say a kitchen remodeling project and may wish to keep track of various aspects related to the project such as impressions progress schedules ideas interactions quotes deals and so forth so that it is all in one place.

Certain embodiments may provide a user with reminders about various aspects of a collection such as deals and offers schedule reminders how long it is been since the user interacted with a given business whether the user needs to check in with a given business and or the like. Certain embodiments may help a user track interactions with businesses. Where the user has been and or has not been recently may be tracked for example. For example the user s last interaction whether it be a visit or otherwise with a given restaurant could be tracked and logged with the business information for the restaurant in a particular collection. Such aspects could be managed for the user. As another example a user s interaction with one or more dentists could be managed such as the user s last cleaning when the user was last searching for dentists etc. and based on such information reminders and or suggestions such as other possible dentists of interest for example highly rated dentists in an area of interest to the user that the user may not have considered and which may have special offers could be presented.

Certain embodiments may provide the option for a user to allow one or more collaborators to have access to a collection. A collaborator could be another user in some embodiments. An enlist option could be presented to the user to allow the user to enlist another user as a collaborator. A collaborator could have a viewing access and in some embodiments editing access and or access to add content such that the collaborator may add notes photos preference indicia ratings indicia etc. Some embodiments may allow the user to determine a level of access granted to a collaborator. Certain embodiments may provide the option for a user to share a collection with a third party. Accordingly the various embodiments directed to information sharing may facilitate organization and engagement with a local business community.

Certain embodiments may provide significant value to businesses through enabling a direct but low maintenance relationships with consumers. Significant value to businesses may also be provided via a business platform that exposes market and consumer insights. Certain embodiments may provide businesses with visibility into their consumers and may provide an easy way to communicate and market to their customers for example by marketing events pushing offers to customers driving awareness of new products and services responding to inquiries etc. Embodiments may provide multiple customer touch points which in turn may allow for better metrics and targeting.

Certain embodiments may provide business specific recommendations to users. Certain embodiments may provide for harvesting of consumer data. The consumer data may be analyzed with respect to individual users. One or more categories for the individual users may be determined based on the analysis and certain embodiments may facilitate the provisioning of business recommendations pertinent to the one or more categories to the individual users. The recommendations could be based at least in part on aggregated recommendations of other users. Information about recommendations of other users could be gathered analyzed and classified according to any suitable bases. For example aggregated recommendations could be classified according to user types. Analysis of information about an identified user could entail comparing the user information to information about other users e.g. to determine user similarities in order to recommend businesses e.g. others favorite or otherwise preferred businesses for the identified user to review. The system may then send indications to the identified user of subscribers regarding options corresponding to the rated content.

In a set of embodiments recommendations could be based at least in part on demographic information. The demographic information could include information about income level education level lifestyle age family household home ownership etc. Recommendations could be based at least in part on any suitable consumer specific information. For example such consumer specific information could include information on whether the consumer is proximate to life milestones such as a graduation a new job a wedding childbirth purchasing a home etc. Accordingly certain embodiments may use cluster based consumer data and or user targeted consumer data.

In a set of embodiments one or more collaborative filtering algorithms may be employed to define similarities between businesses based at least in part on consumer data. One or more indexes may be created based on similarities between businesses. With respect to a particular user the user may be identified based on user identification information and or device identification information for a device that may be associated with a user. Information related to the user and or specific to the user may be gathered and analyzed in view of the one or more indexes to match the user with a set of one or more recommendations.

The aggregated recommendation information could be anonymized in some embodiments so that one or more specific recommendations are offered to an individual user without revealing identities of other users from whom the one or more specific recommendations are derived. Though anonymized a specific recommendation could be offered with a general characterization of the other users. As one example out of many possibilities a recommendation for a dog owner in Glendale Calif. could indicate that other dog owners in Glendale have a preference for a particular veterinarian.

In some embodiments aggregated recommendation information may not be anonymized. Certain users of the platform may have public recommendation information. Real estate agents for example may curate a collection of local service providers relevant to those who have bought or in the process of buying a house in a particular area such as recommended inspectors handymen and the like and may wish to have such recommendations public. Accordingly recommendations may not necessarily be anonymized.

In some embodiments the recommendations may include a customized collection of advertising information for businesses. The customized collection may be automatically generated by the system for an individual user based on the analysis. The customized collection may be presented to the user as a curated collection with user selectable options that allow the user to select and or de select recommended businesses for retention in association with the user. For example the user may select one or more recommended businesses for additions to a new or existing collection of the user. As another example the user may select a recommended collection for addition as a new collection or for addition to an existing collection.

A data storage system or service is provided to store and access data that is generated by the personalized information orchestration system also referred to as personalization system described herein. The data storage service can be configured to support storing retrieving or querying and updating of data such as user information personalized content such as personalized business information and collection information statistics information related to users collections businesses and the like. The data model design of the data storage system may be configured to optimize performance associated with specific features or use cases of the personalized system such as following and or sharing of collections. Additionally the data storage system may be configured to detect and provide user notifications of triggered events.

Some embodiments may use other types of gateways such as gateways for SMS. Thus the disclosure is not limited to the examples or combinations illustrated.

Certain embodiments may provide for associating listing information location information and prefixes for the listings of provider information. One or more indexes for the associated provider information location information and prefixes may be built updated and maintained in some embodiments. In some embodiments one or more inverted indexes may be implemented. The one or more inverted indexes may store mapping for the associated provider information location information and prefixes . The one or more inverted indexes may allow for faster information retrieval with search engine s according certain embodiments.

In some embodiments particular words may be stored in indexes . In some embodiments each word may be linked to one or more documents collections files fields database structure elements or other forms of listing information that contain those words. In some embodiments one or more inverted lists for each n gram corresponding to the words may be created and may be associated with the words. For example consider the string of Max Bar Grill which can be decomposed into 2 gram sets such as ma ax x b . . . where stands for a space into 3 gram sets such as max ax x b . . . and or into other n grams sets. In some embodiments the decomposition may include word level decomposition. Using the same example string of Max Bar Grill various n gram sets could include max bar grill max bar bar grill max grill bar grill . . . for example.

An inverted list for a given n gram may include any and or all instances of strings from a plurality of strings that contain the n gram. In some embodiments a list may include identifiers of strings in lieu of actual strings for mapping to actual strings. This may improve efficiency. The string identifiers could be unique identifiers.

In some embodiments the indexes may allow for approximate string matching at least partially based on decomposition of strings such as into n grams or words and building inverted lists based on the decompositions. In some embodiments inverted lists may be based on tokens or other identifiers associated with the n grams or words. In some embodiments similarity of strings may be measured in terms of similarity of the respective n grams words and or identifiers. In some embodiments the indexes may include a multiplicity of possible variations for various strings. For example the example string of Max Bar Grill can have multiple corresponding strings at the word level such as mac s bar grill mack s bar grill mac s bar n grill max bar n grill macs bar grill maxbar grill maxbargrill etc. Thus misspellings and spelling variations may be anticipated. Stemming may be used to allow for variations such as sport bar instead of sports bar. Including misspellings and spelling variations may allow for the capture of the relevant information. The same example string of Max Bar Grill can have multiple corresponding strings at the character level for various n gram sets in some embodiments. Accordingly the indexes may allow for prefix matching that is not too strict and more generally the indexes may allow for fuzzy search engine capabilities.

Various embodiments may employ various similarity measures that may be tailored to facilitate linking to the indexes and or retrieval of documents and or listing information retained in any other suitable form collection file field database structure element etc. For example TF IDF term frequency inverse document frequency may be used to assess the significance of a particular word n gram with respect to a particular document and or with respect to particular strings. The IDF for each n gram in one or more strings such as strings within a database dataset or table within a database may be determined. The IDF of a token or string is the inverse of the total number of times that this token or string appears in a data collection such as a database. In some embodiments an IDF may indicate a weight for weighted similarity measures.

In some embodiments the search engine may employ similarity measures between multiple strings to allow for fuzzy searching. The search engine may process one or more characters corresponding to user input of a search string and parse the search string into sets of n grams compared the search string with index information. For example the characters of an incomplete user entered search string could be macs b . The characters could be processed and decomposed into n grams similar to the examples given above. The sets of characters could be compared to index entries to assess similarity using any suitable algorithm. Some embodiments may identify intersections between multiple sets and assigned a similarity score based on the extent of n gram intersections between the search string and index entries with a greater extent of an intersection of common characters indicating a greater degree of potential similarity between corresponding sets. For example the search string macs b may be identified as a having a high extent of intersection with one or more index entries for Max Bar Grill which may include the variant macs bar grill. 

In some embodiments the string length may be taken into account as a qualification for similar measures in order to allow for anticipatory predictive auto suggestion features discussed herein. In other words the shorter length of the incomplete search string macs b with respect to the longer length of the index entries for Max Bar Grill may be accounted for when assessing similarity. The disparity of lengths may not prevent identification of similarity. Hence the high extent of intersection with n grams of similar length and ordering associated with the n grams of the first portion s of Max Bar Grill may be identified even though the incomplete search string macs b may not have a high extent of intersection with subsequent portion s of Max Bar Grill. However comparable string lengths may also be considered in assigning greater similarity scores. For example the incomplete search string macs b may have high similarity with index entries for Max Bar Grill but also with index entries for Mac s Bar. In such instances the aspect of comparable lengths of the search string and Mac s Bar may be recognized as indicating even greater similarity and thus the similarity score between the two may be higher than the similarity score between the search string and Max Bar Grill. 

In some embodiments a similar order of the intersecting sets may be taken as an additional indication of similarity. For example a user entered search string with grill macs may have a certain extent of character intersection with index entries corresponding to one entity Max Bar Grill and may have a certain extent of characters section with index entries corresponding to another entity Grill Max however the orders of the intersecting sets may be recognized as being different with respect to these example cases. The ordering of n grams of the search string grill macs has a greater correspondence to the ordering of n grams of Grill Max than it does with respect to Max Bar Grill. Accordingly the search string grill macs may be accorded a greater similarity score with respect to Grill Max and a lesser similarity score with respect to Max Bar Grill. 

The above examples consider a entity name however various embodiments may employ the same methods with respect to other types of listing information. For example category and or keyword strings can be decomposed in similar manner. Furthermore entity names may be associated with various categories and or keywords. For example in some embodiments sets corresponding to a given entity may include associated categories and or keywords. Shingles of words associated with listings service areas and popular queries may be stored. In some embodiments sets corresponding to a given entity may be linked to other sets of categories and or keywords for example via pointers and or other look up tables. It should be understood that any suitable relational database approach may be used to associate the various sets and or members thereof.

As addressed above certain embodiments may provide a spellchecker service that is geo sensitive. For example for a search in the area of Monrovia Calif. the geo aware spellchecker A may recognize that an entry of Plummer should not be corrected to Plumber. To facilitate the geo sensitive spellchecking words corresponding to listings and variations of the words may be stored and linked to corresponding location information. The linking may be provided by way of the one or more indexes with the word variations and locations being stored in inverted index es in some embodiments. Accordingly with the word variations the indexes may store corrections for misspelled search strings in order to account for spelling variations. However not all corrections make sense for a particular area as in the example given above. To address that reality the indexes may be configured such that the linked location information allows for spellchecking tailored to a location of interest. The geo aware spellchecker A may determine whether one or more corrections or an original query makes more sense in a particular area. Based on that determination corrections which do not make sense in that area may be filtered out. Accordingly the accuracy of spelling corrections may be improved and false positives may be minimized.

The geo aware spellchecker A may receive the search string and may identify one or more potential corrections for the search string. The geo aware spellchecker A may look up the search string and the one or more potential corrections in the index es comparing the search string and the one or more potential corrections to listing information for the identified location. If the search string is identified as a possibility for the particular location then that may be an indication that the search string should not be corrected. If however the search string is not identified as a possibility for the particular location then that may be an indication that the search string should be corrected. In some embodiments a decision tree may be employed to check the search string first then the most likely applicable potential correction then the next most likely applicable potential correction and so on until a positive indication is found in the index es . In some embodiments the geo aware spellchecker A may identify one or more potential corrections for the search string first in a geo oblivious manner and then analyze the potential corrections for applicability to an identified location. In some embodiments the geo aware spellchecker A may only identify a limited set of one or more potential corrections for the search string that are applicable to an identified location.

Certain embodiments may provide a clustering based approach to facilitate the geo sensitive spellchecking. Words corresponding to listings and variations of the words may be stored and linked to corresponding location information where the location information may include location identifiers such as latitude and longitude coordinates for the listings. For example entity names may be stored with coordinates for the entities. Then clusters may be formed based on the location information. For example when displayed on a map entities with a given entity name such as a chain of restaurants may have multiple locations. Using any suitable clustering algorithm one or more boundaries may be drawn or otherwise defined to surround one or more clusters of the entities.

The corresponding clusters of data may be used for verification of a search string and one or more potential corrections for the search string. The geo aware spellchecker A may receive the search string and may identify one or more potential corrections for the search string. The geo aware spellchecker A may look up the search string and the one or more potential corrections in the clustered data comparing the search string and the one or more potential corrections to listing information in the cluster that corresponds to the identified location. Stated otherwise the geo aware spellchecker A may check if a word and or n gram is found in the cluster. If the search string is identified as a possibility for the particular location then that may be an indication that the search string should not be corrected. If however the search string is not identified as a possibility for the particular location then that may be an indication that the search string should be corrected. In some embodiments a decision tree may be employed with the cluster as discussed above.

As addressed above certain embodiments may provide an autosuggestion service that is geo sensitive. The autosuggestion service may provide type ahead suggestions that are geographically relevant. As a user types a search query the user may be presented with the type ahead suggestions that are relevant to user s current geography and or another geography of interest. Though reference is made herein to type ahead suggestions and in some embodiments one or more suggestions could appear in the query field as a type ahead suggestion the term type ahead suggestion could include other manners of presentation such as over at least a portion of the query field or beside the query field so that a user may accept a suggestion via selection of a space key selection of an enter key or any other suitable manner of selection. In some embodiments the search engine may configured with the geo aware autosuggester B to effect a geo aware autosuggest search engine. In some embodiments the search engine may include the geo aware autosuggester B. In some embodiments the search engine may not include but may be configured to work in conjunction with the geo aware autosuggester B. In various embodiments the geo aware autosuggester B may be integral with or independent of the search engine . In various embodiments a geo aware autosuggester B could be implemented separately or without the spellchecking module A. In some embodiments the geo aware spellchecking module A could be configured as a geo aware autosuggester B such that autosuggestion features are an extension of spellchecking features.

The geo aware autosuggester B could receive a series of search string characters and perform a lookup with the reception of each character or set of multiple characters. The lookup could be performed with one or more indexes . In some embodiments one or more filters could be used in conjunction with the one or more indexes . To facilitate the geo aware autosuggestion words corresponding to suggestions listings and variations of the words in some embodiments may be stored and linked to corresponding location information. For example suggestions listings corresponding sets of words and or n grams may be linked to location information in the indexes .

The autosuggestion service may provide suggestions that are relevant to a geographical area s of interest. The suggestions may correspond to listings that in close proximity to an area of interest as providing suggestions that are too far away from the area of interest may negatively impact the user experience. In providing suggestions the autosuggestion service may allow for a quick response time so that suggestions are provided between key presses of a user. By way of example the autosuggestion service may provide suggestions on the order of milliseconds or tens of millisecond in response to each character input. Given such constraints it may be advantageous to divide geographical areas into multiple smaller areas. A code may be assigned to each small area and that area code may be assigned to the suggestions relevant to that area.

Accordingly the location information may include location identifiers. Linked information may be distinguished segregated and or categorized based on location in any suitable manner with any suitable location identifiers being used to link information to corresponding areas. In various embodiments the location could have any suitable level of specificity e.g. including a county a municipality zip code school district entity directory service area and or the like. For example a zip code a collection of zip codes one or more listing service directory codes which may correspond to particular telephone directory service areas which service areas could be defined by zip code s and or the like may be used as a basis for linking information to a location.

For example information with respect to a particular entity may be analyzed in order to identify one or more entity attributes. The matching engine can receive entity information identify attributes of the entity based at least in part on the entity information and match the entity to one or more categories based on category information retained in a repository. The entity may be matched to one or more categories that each represent classifications of entity sharing common attributes. In some embodiments one or more taxonomies that map particular profile information to particular categories may be used in correlating entity profile information with one or more categories. The entity could be classified according to products and or services that the entity provides. The entity could be classified according to location for example a market that the entity serves and or a physical site of the entity. The entity could be linked to location identifier s such as a directory code s relevant to the entity listing of the suggestion geo coordinates corresponding to the entity e.g. latitude and longitude and or the like.

As another example the matching engine may be or include a classification engine configured to classify each of a plurality of end users into at least one category of a set of categories that represent classifications of end users based at least in part on one or more sets of attributes defined for classifying various end users.

In some embodiments the matching engine may be configured to match the user to one or more entities based at least in part on correlating categories. The matching could in some embodiments be based at least partially on comparing user attributes categories with entity attributes categories. For example they may be matched according to preferences certain biographical information demographic information interests location information etc.

Any suitable correlation process may be employed. A scoring system could be correlated to the category scheme in some embodiments such that certain scores correspond to matches of certain categories. Some embodiments may score a match with a numerical expression for example a match score with higher scores being assigned to higher correlations of user attributes categories with entity attributes categories. A high correlation may be identified using any suitable qualification scheme e.g. a score threshold a score ranking etc. .

The approval disapproval indicators could be those associated with the user s profile and or profiles of friends associates connections of the user.

In some embodiments the gathering of indicia of interest may support the generation of user profiles and could be used to refine user profiles. In some embodiments user profiles may be transferred from the application to the information handling system . In other embodiments only information related to the profiles may be transferred to the backend system . The information handling system may have profiles for businesses. As indicated by block one or more collections may be created based on the gathered indicia of interest. As indicated by block the gathered indicia of interest may be correlated to interest categories collections. In some embodiments the business profiles may include or be linked to one or more taxonomies that map particular businesses business categories particular interests interest categories and or particular questions for presentation to users.

As indicated by block options for customization of collections may be presented to the user. As indicated by block one or more collections specific that questions may be presented to the user for identification of collection specific businesses of interest. User selectable options corresponding to interest categories may be presented for user selection. For example options corresponding to categories such as my kids my home my pets etc. may be presented to the user. The user selectable options may allow the user to drill down into particular interest categories. For example once a user taps into an individual collection one or more questions may be presented to the user relating to the individual collection to help user set up that collection. Referring to for example say a user taps the individual collection relates to the user s category of my home. The user may be presented with a collection specific graphical user interface as illustrated by which shows a screenshot which may be a partial screenshot for a personalized collection utility that may be used in implementations of certain embodiments of the present disclosure.

As indicated by one potential question presented the user could be Who s your plumber The question could be presented with options for a number of actual plumber names plumber business names and or other plumber listings for the user to select. The options presented with the question could be identified based on gathered indicia of businesses of interest to the user and or options near the location of the user such as the nearest three or so plumbers. Though not depicted the nearby options could be indicated on a map presented to the user with the interface . A text entry field could allow the user to enter an indication of a plumber in response to the question. Along with such questions a user selectable option to skip a given question or a series of questions may be presented. Referring again to one or more businesses of interest may be associated with one or more collections based on user responses to the collection specific questions as indicated by block .

In some embodiments information harvested regarding a user may be used to infer potential businesses of interest to the user as indicated by block . And such potential businesses of interest may be suggested to the user as indicated by block . For example if interest data indicates that a user has a pet local businesses related to pets and or that otherwise would only be of interest if one has a pet could be identified suggested as potential businesses of interest. Similarly if interest data indicates that a user is a parent businesses that would only be of interest to parents could be identified suggested as potential businesses of interest. As indicated by block business information corresponding to businesses potential businesses of interest may be organized into collections as discussed herein.

As indicated by block an end user may identify confirm business information of interest. In some cases a user may be performing a search with the application. illustrates a graphical user interface for searching for business information in accordance with certain embodiments of the present disclosure. shows a screenshot which may be a partial screenshot of an interface that may be displayed via a mobile application. In some embodiments a webpage could implement a same or similar interface. Responsive to a search request by an end user a set of businesses may be selected by the system as corresponding to the user s search criteria including location. The set of businesses may be compiled and presented to the consumer with as search results . Along with each search result a user selectable option may be presented to the user so that upon user selection e.g. a single click a particular business may be added to the user s collections. Thus in the example case a specific business may already be identified by the system prior to being presented to the user. In some cases however a specific business may need to be confirmed by the user for example when a suggestion has been identified based on gathered indicia of interest and a potential business of interest is presented to the user.

As indicated by block in some embodiments the business information of interest may be correlated to a specific business if necessary. For example when the business information of interest is not specific is ambiguous and or corresponds to multiple businesses a specific business may need to be identified based on the business information. The business information of interest could include one or more of gathered indicia of interest responses to questions presented to the user and or interest categories.

As indicated by block business specific information may be associated with a particular collection. In some embodiments the association may be according to a collection specified by the user as indicated by block . In some embodiments a user selectable option may be presented to the user upon identification of a business of interest. For example after a user selects an option such as option a prompt could be presented to the user to indicate to which of the user s collections the particular business should be linked. In some embodiments a user selectable option could be presented for the particular business to be automatically correlated and linked with the appropriate collection. In some embodiments the automatic correlation and linking of the particular business with the appropriate collection could be by default such that the user need not be prompted. Accordingly as indicated by block the business identifier or other business specific information may be automatically correlated with a germane collection. In some embodiments the user may be notified of the automatic correlation and as indicated by block a user selectable option may be presented to customize the association with the particular collection in some embodiments.

As indicated by block additional information pertinent to the specific business may be linked to the collection for presentation to the user. illustrates a graphical user interface for specific business information saved or savable in a collection in accordance with certain embodiments of the present disclosure. shows a screenshot which may be a partial screenshot of an interface that may be displayed via a mobile application. Business listing information may be linked to the collection. The business listing information may include address information directions ratings information map information business details user reviews coupons etc. An indicator may indicate that the specific business is saved in a collection or could be a selectable option to add the listing information for the specific business in a collection.

Referring again to as indicated by block business specific information associated with a collection may be updated based on information from the information handling system . Business listing information associated with a collection may be automatically updated by the information handling system such that when listing information is retrieved from a collection the listing information may be updated information. Thus a collection allows for the maintenance of listing information of interest to provide a user with the most up to date listing information for the businesses that matter to the user. And thus if a provider associated with a collection has moved or changed phone numbers the user will not be left with obsolete information as the user would otherwise be if such information was recorded into an address book because the change may be captured so that the collection would be automatically updated with the new information.

Interest data may include any suitable information that may be captured via an interest data capture process to indicate infer and or determine interest categories and or businesses of interest. As discussed herein certain embodiments may use a client application installed on the user s computing device to facilitate data capture. In some embodiments the client application may qualify captured data in part or in whole and or send captured data to the information handling system for qualification.

Having interest data the information handling system and or the application may implement a qualification process. Some embodiments may qualify an interest according to a graduated scale. Any suitable scale may be used in various embodiments. In some embodiments a scale could entail a categorization scheme with any suitable categories. In some embodiments a taxonomy scoring system could be correlated to the category scheme such that certain scores may correspond to certain categories so that based on a given set of interest data a high correlation score to a particular category may indicate the category is more appropriate. Some embodiments may score with a numerical expression. Accordingly a taxonomy score may indicate which categories are more most likely to be appropriate for a user thus providing a quantitative estimate of a user interest. By way of example without limitation a scale could include a range of scores from 0 to 100 or from 0 to 1 000 with the high end of the scale indicating greater probability. Some embodiments may use methods of statistical analysis to derive a score. Various embodiments may determine a score based on any one or more suitable quantifiers.

Some embodiments may employ a decision tree checklist workflow and or the like to capture various aspects of interest data and assess those aspects to infer interest qualification. Such a decision tree checklist and or workflow may incorporate any one or combination of the depicted aspects and or similar aspects in any desired order according to various embodiments. Interest data can be consolidated and processed to yield a taxonomy score .

Certain embodiments may provide for keyword processing of gathered interest data such as any data related to indicia of interest discussed herein. In some embodiments an impression engine which could be included in the engine s could perform keyword identification. The call impression engine could be configured to recognize evidence of interest potential. Taxonomy scores may be based at least in part on keywords gathered.

The impression engine may identify keywords as distinctive markings and could compile the keywords for the purposes of characterization from the perspective of interest potential. The keywords could be correlated with keyword criteria to characterize the data from the perspective of interest potential and to generate correlation results that can be taken into account with scoring . In some embodiments the correlation results can be taken into account in conjunction with other indicia which could correspond to any one or combination of the other indicia of interest potential discussed herein such as location information and or the like. As discussed herein various embodiments may employ any one or combination of methods of capturing location information including but not limited to gathering location information via any one or combination of the user s computing device such as the device GPS capabilities access points third parties receiving explicit location information with one or more search requests inferring location information from one or more search requests and or the like.

The end user interface may present user identification information that may retain in the one or more repositories . In various embodiments user identification information may include for example the user s name alias one or more images associated with the user such as images uploaded by the user more or less generic images selected by default and or images pulled from other data sources such as the user s linked online social media account s and or the like.

The end user interface may be presented responsive to a request for user s personalized business information transmitted from the end user computing device such as a login request. The system may access the user s personalized business information retained in the one or more repositories . In some embodiments certain personalized business information may be retained locally on the end user computing and the local information may be synchronized updated based on the information retained in the one or more repositories . In other embodiments personalized business information may be freshly transmitted in whole or in part from the system to the end user computing device.

The user s personalized business information may be provided in according with the user s curation information. The personalized curation information may include geo relevant graph information specific to the user. The geo relevant graph information may include collection information that specifies one or more collection characteristics. The collection characteristics may include any suitable parameters defining aspects of the user s collections including one or more of collection themes associated business categories information about location s of interest to the user businesses windows mapped to the collections arrangement information specifying a visual arrangement of collections to presented to user custom content added and or modified by the user and or other users such as notes images graphical customizations editorial customizations etc. privacy attributes and or any other collection characteristics described herein.

The geo relevant graph information may include window information that specifies one or more window characteristics. The window characteristics may include any suitable parameters defining aspects of the windowed information provided to the user including one or more of specific businesses mapped to a given window geo specific criteria for the specific businesses custom content added and or modified by the user and or other users such as notes images graphical customizations editorial customizations etc. privacy attributes and or any other window characteristics described herein.

In some embodiments the system may access a set of business information retained in the one or more repositories the set of business information being related to businesses specified by the geo relevant graph information. The system may window the set of business information to at least partially form one or more windowed sets of information. The windowing could include one or more of identifying selecting processing compiling arranging and or providing any pertinent business information for a particular business of interest described herein.

For example in various embodiments the windowing could include using geo specific criteria to furnish information for a particular business location e.g. one out of multiple location options say for a business chain or other business that has multiple sites a particular provider and or contact e.g. one out of multiple provider and or contact options for a particular business and or the like. The windowing could include selecting only particular information items that pertain to a particular window. In some cases a user could modify the type of content desired for a particular business and particular information items could be furnished accordingly. The windowing could include checking the set of business information for updated information such as changes in contact information location information review information and or any other pertinent information .

In some embodiments the windowing could include gathering user generated content pertaining to a particular business discussed further herein. In some cases user generated content was previously provided by the end user and retained by the system . In some cases user generated content was previously gathered pushed and or pulled from data sources and retained by the system . In some cases user generated content is actively gathered pushed and or pulled from data sources on an as needed basis to freshly provide the content with the windowed set of information and or to update check content previously retained and that is to be provided with the windowed set of information.

In some embodiments windowed sets of information may be formed and retained by the system in anticipation of a request to provide the information to the user. In some embodiments windowed sets of information may be formed responsive to a request. In some embodiments previously formed windowed sets of information may be updated responsive to a request. In various embodiments window information components may be compiled prior to transmission to an end user computing device and or may be transmitted separately.

In the example depicted the end user interface may present the user s current collections the curation of which is facilitated by the platform. The user s current collections may be indicated in any suitable manner including with images color coding alphanumeric indicia and or the like. A sorting feature may allow for presentation of one or more user selectable options to sort the collections in any suitable manner including according to activity e.g. activity by the user a collaborator a business business information updating via the system review activity activity by other users registered with the orchestration service and or other users interacting about the particular businesses via online social media services and or the like latest updates latest additions of businesses to a collection alphabetically according to collection name number of businesses associated with a collection collaborative non collaborative characteristic public non public characteristic and or the like.

In some embodiments like the example depicted numbers of businesses associated with each collection may be indicated. For example twenty one businesses are indicated as associated with the collaborative collection directed to the Santa Monica Restaurant theme in the collaborator section and in the collection section with indication of the Santa Monica Restaurant collection . And generally with presentation of collections whether collaborative or not numbers of businesses associated with each collection may be indicated as in the depicted example e.g. the Car collection is textually indicated as having seven associated businesses or in any other suitable manner.

One or more user selectable options may be available to the user to designate whether a collection is public or private. A private designation could be a default in some embodiments. If a collection is designated as public the collection could be viewable searchable to other users. In some embodiments collections may be graphically distinguished in any suitable manner based on being public or private. The example depicted portrays illustrative graphical private collection indicators and public collection indicators . A collection could also be designate as viewable searchable to a select group of other users. For example the select group could include other users individually selected by the user other users who are also friends associates via an online social business networking service other users who associated with a certain affinity group and or the like.

The end user interface may include one or more social panes . The one or more social panes could include a collaborator section for embodiments that provide the option for the user to allow one or more collaborators to have access to one or more collections. For example a husband and wife may both curate a Kitchen Remodel collection like the depicted example in view of their kitchen remodeling project. As another example a user may collaborate with another in planning a trip say a tour of the West Coast visiting whiskey bars along the way. To that end the tourists could curate a West Coast Whiskey Bars collection like the depicted example. Accordingly the collaborator section could include information about one or more collaborators that have access to one or more collections of the user.

The end user interface may be configured to indicate not only collaborators but also the particular collaborative collections. In the example depicted Angela M. is indicated in the collaborator section as a collaborator with Ricardo on a kitchen remodel collection and a Santa Monica Restaurant collection. Collaborative collections may be graphically distinguished from non collaborative collections. For example a graphical indicator corresponding to the Santa Monica Restaurant collection may indicate the collaborative nature of the collection. However collections may be distinguished in any suitable manner including with images color coding alphanumeric indicia and or the like.

One or more user selectable options may be provided to navigate to a collaborative or non collaborative collection. For example the user may tap or click into one of the collaborative collections that is designated as being collaborative. shows a screenshot which may be a partial screenshot of the end user interface that may be displayed after navigating drilling down into a collaborative collection . The example depicts a Kitchen Remodel collection relating to a remodeling project. The collection may include one or more curated information windows each corresponding to a business.

Each information window may present any suitable listing information for the respective business. In some embodiments the listing information may be retained on the backend system and provided to the user portal on demand. In some embodiments the listing information may be retained on the user device and updated by the backend system on any suitable basis including for example based on one or more of user login user access of particular collections launch of the application a batch process a real time update when new information is available and or the like. In some embodiments an information window may include advertisements from a business images associated with a business options for video audio from a business for presentation to the user a video audio textual chat option to connect with a business a select to call option to connect with a business and or the like. An information window may include a directions feature configured to provide directions and or mapping information consequent to user selection. The information may be provided in conjunction with a mapping application resident on the device and or network facilitated.

An information window may include a notes feature configured to allow the user to make and retain notes related to the provider such as notes on the providers indicia of whether the user likes particular providers or not which providers have been contacted information obtained from providers which providers have been selected etc. Any suitable content could be added in accordance with various embodiments. A user could add photos for example. Say a user has a photo of a desired kitchen design that the user wants to mimic for the user s kitchen remodel the user could upload the photo to a kitchen remodel collection. In some embodiments a user could import a photo from another account of the user say a photo sharing repository account an online networking services account etc. The user could link to the other account as described herein and a data collection utility provided by the orchestration account may be configured to port the photo s to the user s collection window.

As another example photos of one or more of a service need a completed service a service in progress receipt s warranties invoices and or the like could be uploaded to the orchestration account. Each photo may be time stamped by the system and retained in the one or more repositories for later access and retrieval by the user. Accordingly the platform may provide a way to have a filing system directed to services a record system for the user. As described herein a vendor could be a collaborator or could be otherwise enabled to view certain collections windows of the user. In this manner certain embodiments may provide an additional means to facilitate ongoing engagement with local vendors.

An information window may include a share feature configured to share an information window with others in one or more ways. For example the share feature may include one or more user selectable options to propagate the information window to another collection in some embodiments. Say for example that the user decides a particular business is appropriate for another collection of the user the user can add the corresponding information window to the other collection via the share feature .

As another example the share feature may include one or more user selectable options to share the information window with another user of the online orchestration service in some embodiments. In some embodiments entire collections can be shared. The end user interface may include one or more collection share options configured to allow sharing of collection information in any suitable manner.

A window and or collection could be shared with another user of the online orchestration service for example via a notification to an account associated with another user. Responsive to a share selection the platform may send a notification to an account associated with another user. The notification could be provided via the other user s account. By way of example the end user interface may include notification features that allow a user to be apprised of new notifications received as directed to the user and allow the user to view the notification s upon user selection of one or more notification options. Thus in the example depicted the user Ricardo could receive a notification which could be a result of another user sharing an information window and or collection .

In various embodiments the shared information could be at least partially viewed and or incorporated into user s account with viewing of the notification with viewing a message corresponding to the notification and or with selection of one or more user selectable options provided consequent to the notification . The presentation of shared information could be by way of summary information that summarizes and or characterizes information from relating to the shared collection. For example summary information about the shared information could be generated and included for viewing with viewing of the notification and or a message corresponding to the notification . In some embodiments the shared information could be viewed at least in part with selection of one or more user selectable options provided with the notification and or a message corresponding to the notification . In some embodiments one or more user selectable options may be provided for incorporating the corresponding collection information window into a collection of the user.

The share feature may include one or more user selectable options to share the information window and or collection with others via any suitable means of notification. For example text messages voice notifications push notifications e mails social business networking services account postings messages alerts with the application and or other any suitable means could be employed to allow for the presentation of collection window information. In some embodiments the user s orchestration account could be linked e.g. via API to one or more other accounts of the user say an email account for example. The end user interface may include linked account features that may allow for notifications of any communications received via the other account and or may provide one or more user selectable options to launch and or otherwise access the other account.

The user s orchestration account could link to any suitable account of the user including an account associated with online social business networking services and or any other suitable data source . And thus a posting about the business could be made in association with the user s account and or another s account responsive to the user selection of the share option. In some cases the user may be prompted to login to the user s social business networking media account to make the posting. In some cases previously provided authentication information stored by the system may be used so that logging in is not necessary to make the posting in the other account. The share feature may be configured to facilitate the setup of the information sharing whether it be a networking services account posting an email a text message or otherwise and present the communication setup for previewing and dispatch by the user. A link or other user selectable option could be shared to allow for the viewing incorporation of further collection information. In some embodiments users who are not yet registered with the service could be invited to do so in conjunction with a collection sharing communication.

In some embodiments a snapshot of a collection or a single window could be shared. The snapshot could take any suitable form include an image a text file and or the like. A share feature could present an option to send a snapshot and consequent to user selection could convert a collection window to a snapshot form and proceed with communication in a manner discussed above.

For example one or more user selectable options may be provided to navigate to a public profile accessible via the orchestration platform. shows a screenshot which may be a partial screenshot of a public profile that may be displayed after selection of a link made available with posting . The example depicts Ricardo s public Kitchen Remodel Collection . The collection having been designated as public could be a landing page viewable for example as a result of a user selection of a link from a posting .

In some embodiments one or more user selectable options may be presented depending on the viewer. For example login registration options may be provided. For a registered user a follow option may be provided to enable the user to follow Ricardo s collection. After the user opts to follow the collection update notifications may be sent to the user based on subsequent actions taken with respect to the collection such as collection curation annotation augmentation and or any modification of interest taken.

For a registered user a copy option may be provided to enable the user to copy the collection to the user s set of collections. Once copied over to the user s collection set the copy could become the user s collection. The user may then use and modify the collection as desired.

Referring again to in some embodiments user feedback from the social business networking services may be captured by the system . For example information about user approval disapproval indicators which may be in form of likes dislikes thumbs up thumbs down star scale ratings number scale ratings and or the like could be captured. Captured user feedback could be processed and reflected back through the orchestration services platform. Thus a certain collection and or business may have accumulated user feedback from other for a and such feedback could be indicated via the user s collection s and or information window s in any suitable manner.

Referring again to the interface may indicate user feedback data in any suitable manner. For example an information window may include one or more user review indicators . Similar review features could be provided on a collection basis in addition or alternative to an individual business basis. The one or more user review indicators may include composite and or segregated review information garnered from reviews via the listing service of the platform online social business networking service s the orchestration service and or any suitable data source s . In various embodiments the system may actively monitor gather push and or pull user feedback data from such sources in any suitable way. As a particular example of gathering user feedback on businesses in many cases businesses associated with the system may have individual business pages setup for public viewing interfacing via a one or more online social business networking services and or other data sources . In some cases the system may facilitate setup of such business pages for the businesses. User feedback data from such sources may be monitored gathered and or pulled by the system .

When presented via the interface the source of composite review information could be distinguished. For example review information coming from the listing service could be so indicated review information coming from social media could be so indicated etc. Moreover the types of review information could be differentiated. For example say user feedback from one social media site includes feedback in the form of like indications an information window could indicate the number of likes that the business received via that social media site over any time period s of interest e.g. the past year six months month week day hour etc. . Thus certain embodiments may provide for temporal windowing may allow a user to see businesses trending in the user s neighborhood city and or other local area.

The example depicts the collection configured as having one collaborator as indicated by . A collaborator could be another user of the online orchestration service in some embodiments. In some embodiments users who are not yet registered with the service could be invited to do so in conjunction with an invitation from a registered user to be a collaborator. One or more user selectable options could be presented via the end user interface to allow the user to enlist collaborators who may be registered users or who may not be registered. Responsive to enlist option selection the platform may send a notification to an account associated with an invitee. In some embodiments where an invitee is a registered user the notification could be provided via the invitee s accounts. The end user interface may include notification features that allow a user to be apprised of new notifications received as directed to the user and allow the user to view the notification s upon user selection of one or more notification options. Thus in the example depicted the user Ricardo could receive an invitation via a notification . However any suitable means of notification may be employed. For example text voice e mail alerts with the application and or the like could be sent. In some embodiments the user s orchestration account could be linked e.g. via API to another account of the user say an email account for example. The end user interface may include linked account features that may allow for notifications of any communications which communications are not limited to collaboration and registration invitations received via the other account and or may provide one or more user selectable options to launch and or otherwise access the other account. A notification could include a link or other communication reference referring back to the platform prompting the invitee to respond. For example the notification could provide a link for users to register and or login to the platform to respond. In some embodiments the invitee may respond via the same medium in which the notification was sent e.g. text voice e mail etc. and the system may process the response extracting requested information.

Some embodiments may allow the user to determine a level of access granted to a collaborator. In some embodiments the access could be read only access. Thus the user could specify that one or more other users may only be allowed to view a certain collection. In addition to viewing access the level of access could include write access. A collaborator could have editing access and or access to add content such that the collaborator may add notes photos preference indicia ratings indicia additional business selections information etc. Accordingly any changes that one collaborator makes to a collection may be reflected in the collection as viewed by one or more other collaborators.

A collaborator could be a service provider associated with one or more of the businesses designated in the collaborative collection. For example a user might want a general contractor to be a collaborator on a project which general contractor could be associated with a designated business or could be independent. Accordingly such collaborators could help coordinate a project or otherwise provide input on a project. And more generally beyond the example of a general contractor any desired business provider could be a collaborator and be enabled to provide input.

Referring again to the one or more social panes could include a friends section for embodiments that provide for interaction between the orchestration service and one or more online social media services e.g. via API . A user may have the option to associate the user s orchestration account with one or more social business networking services. One or more user selectable options and workflows may be provided for the user to provide necessary authentication information for the user s other networking account s and to associate the other networking account s . In some embodiments the system may retain the authentication information and link to the data sources to coordinate interface with the other accounts gather information from the user s particular account s and provide information for presentation via the end user interface . Consequent to such association the friends section could identify friends and or others that are linked to the user via social business networking services. Additional information such as whether certain friends associates are logged in to the orchestration service and or social business networking services could be presented via the friends section . Those friends associates that have orchestration accounts could be distinguished from those that do not in any suitable manner.

In some embodiments one or more user selectable options may be provided to navigate to another user s account. The friend indicators in the friends section could in include such options for example. In addition or alternative a search interface could be provided to search for other user accounts. shows a screenshot which may be a partial screenshot of the end user interface that may be displayed after navigating to another user s public collections for example by selecting an option from the social panes . The example depicts public collections of another user Jason. Accordingly only those collections which have been designated as public would be viewable.

Referring again to the one or more social panes could include a collection following section . The collection following section may identify public collections that the user has selected to follow. Additional information such as update information or any other suitable information pertaining to the followed public collections could be indicated as well. Update notifications could be general or could be specific indicating for example that business information has changed new telephone number new reviews new ratings a change in ratings of the business by third party organizations a change in business profiles webpages etc. 

The user may be presented with options to search for public collections of others. The search could be geo aware such that public collections associated with the user s general vicinity could be searched. The option to search another vicinity of interest to the user could also be provided so that the user may indicate a different vicinity of interest. In some embodiments options to input a trip by starting point endpoint route and or otherwise may be provided so that the user could search for collections relevant to the trip. For example a user may be interested in a tour of California wineries and may so indicate in order to search for collections pertaining thereto. Public collections could be selected for presentation to the user based at least in part on one or more of business location s in relation to a location of interest to the user relevance of a business to an identified interest of the user how many users are following the collections positively trending collections with respect to a particular time period s which trending could be based on collection additions collection followings ratings and or any suitable basis activity in the collections ratings of the collections and or the like. Certain public collections could be selected for presentation to the user as suggestions though the user may not have actively searched for the public collections. Having found a public collection of interest one or more user selectable options may be presented to the user to peruse share incorporate into the user s collection s selectively or in whole and or follow the collection.

In some embodiments interest data user preferences curation characteristics collection characteristics demographic characteristics business characteristics profile types characteristics and or the like that correspond to particular end users could be characterized by the system and retained as user specific profiles associated with various criteria e.g. keyword criteria taxonomy criteria categorization criteria etc. that allow for correlation of multiple end users based on end user characteristics. The system could anonymize any of such information and could provide anonymous depictions of user preferences and profile types to help personalize the experience for a given end user and help find businesses that other users like the given end user enjoyed. User selectable options for user specific profile types criteria and or any suitable characterization of other users could be presented via the search interface to allow for searching. For example a user could search for other users that have interest in pets children or any suitable interest category and be presented with anonymized search results for the user to see what businesses are of interest to those other users. A user could refine a search by demographic characteristics location characteristics interest data user preferences curation characteristics collection characteristics business characteristics profile types characteristics and or the like. In some embodiments the system may automatically search on behalf of the user without user selection and present search results as suggestions to the user. The search results could anonymously indicate any suitable characterization of the other users.

In some embodiments certain public collections could be selected for presentation to the user with the search results . In some embodiments the collection could be selected as suggestions though the user may not have actively searched for the public collections. One or more user selectable options may be presented to the user to peruse share incorporate into the user s collection s selectively or in whole and or follow the collection.

In some embodiments with respect to particular business listing in the search results an indicator may indicate whether a particular business listing is in a collection by other users and may further indicate a number of users who have added the particular business listing to a collection. Such information indicated by the collection addition indicators may lend a measure of credibility and trustworthiness to a business an addition to one s collection indicates a willingness desire to engage with a business.

Some embodiments may provide a map view of search results. The map view could indicate search results depicted in a vicinity of a reference location that corresponds to the location of interest. Collection addition indicators could be positioned on the map view to indication business locations corresponding to the search results. The collection addition indicators may each indicate a number of users who have added a particular business listing to a collection. In some embodiments the collection addition indicators may correspond to a set of the most relevant search results and relatively less relevant search results could be indicated by different collection addition indicators . The indicators and could be graphically distinguished in any suitable manner including with images shape differentiation color differentiation alphanumeric indicia and or the like. One or more of the indicators and could correspond to user selection options that allow a user to view further details and or adding businesses to collections consequent to selection of a particular indicator. In some embodiments the map view and or a similar map interface may be provided to allow for interactive searching and adjustment in order to find businesses of interest for addition to collections.

In some embodiments one or more user selectable options may be provided for refining location criteria for the collection addition indicia. For example a user may be able to indicate a range such as a radius of X miles from specified location of interest. In some embodiments a user could indicate an area of interest with any suitable parameters e.g. including one or more counties municipalities zip codes distances from reference points etc. In some embodiments a user selectable map interface may be presented enabling user to define an area by selecting one or more points on the map interface. For example predefined service areas such as zip codes and or the like could be presented on the map for selection. The map interface could allow a user to define a perimeter of a service e.g. by drawing on the map with a line drawing tool cursor finger stylus contact with a touch interface selection of perimeter boundaries such as roads rivers etc. Hence collection addition indicia may be location specific and refined to any suitable degree of granularity to provide enhanced relevance.

A user logged in to the orchestration platform could have a linked social business networking services account. And in some embodiments with respect to a particular business listing in the search results an indicator may indicate whether a particular business listing has been added by others who are friends associates connections of the user via an online social business networking service other users who associated with a certain affinity group and or the like. Thus certain embodiments may surface user generated content from social graphs in order add a trust factor for consideration of particular businesses if applicable. The network specific addition indicators may be differentiated from more general collection addition indicators in some embodiments in order to add trustworthiness differentiation as an addition of a business to personal collection by social media friends may be considered as an endorsement and may further allow reaching out to the others for further information if desired.

User selectable options may be presented to the user with search results to allow a drill down to more specific information for a particular business. shows a screenshot which may be a partial screenshot of a search interface with business specific information that may be displayed responsive to user selection in accordance with certain embodiments of the present disclosure. With respect to a particular business the business specific information may include any one or combination of information items and or features described herein. A user selectable option may be presented to the user so that upon user selection e.g. a single click a particular business may be added to the user s collections. A collection addition indicator may indicate whether a particular business listing is in a collection by other users and may further indicate a number of users who have added the particular business listing to a collection. A network specific indicator may indicate whether a particular business listing has been added by others who are friends associates of the user via an online social business networking service other users who associated with a certain affinity group and or the like. In some embodiments the network specific indicator may include images of the friends associates scraped from the social business networking service.

The business specific information may include a friends associates review window that surfaces review content by the user s friends associates gathered from one or more online social business networking services. The system may actively monitor gather push and or pull review content from one or more online social business networking services in any suitable way. In some embodiments like the example depicted the review window may surface individual review content that is content from an individual friend associate of the user. The review content may include any one or combination of reviewer identification information ratings review comments preference indicia date information and or the like. The review content may be gathered from business pages associated with the one or more online social business networking services in some cases. In some embodiments review content may be gathered from business websites with the reviewers being correlated to the user as being related via the online social business networking services.

The targeted advertising window may allow for presentation of advertising offers that are targeted to the user. The targeted advertising window may allow for a business to have an option of deciding to which consumer to send offer information and or which offer information to send. With some embodiments a targeted advertising option may be made available to businesses that have been added to a collection of the user. In some embodiments the targeted advertising could be customized to the consumer by the business. Thus a business could develop and or maintain a relationship with the user after the collection addition by pushing a special offer to the user. For example say a particular business has been added to a collection but no further engagement between the consumer and the business has ensued. Noting this the business may wish to have the option to direct one or more offers to the consumer in order to incentivize further engagement. Similarly say a particular business has been added to a collection and has done business with the consumer the business may wish to have the option to follow up with the consumer with directed offers to maintain and or develop the relationship with the consumer. Perhaps the business has not had contact with the consumer in a while noting this the business may wish to send a special offer to the consumer. The targeted advertising information could include one or more of an electronic coupon which could correspond to a savable and or printable discount coupon advertising information promotion information offer information business card information any suitable business related information and or the like. In various embodiments in addition or alternative to the targeted advertising window an advertiser may have any one or combination of options for presenting offers including via email text messaging a mobile app a website linked online social business networking service s regular mail push notifications telephonic notification etc.

In some embodiments the end user interface may include one or more selected business windows . The selected business windows may present certain business information windows for businesses that the user has not already added to a collection. With some embodiments as in the example depicted business information may be selected for presentation as the most popular businesses based on total collection additions. Business windows could be selected for presentation based at least in part on one or more of business location s in relation to a location of interest to the user relevance of a business to an identified interest of the user a number of collection additions by other users with respect to particular businesses a number of collection additions by other users who are related to the user via online social businesses networking service s trending of such collection additions with respect to a particular time period s ratings of businesses and or the like. The selected business windows may include collection addition indicators as described herein. Along with each selected business window a user selectable option may be presented to the user so that upon user selection e.g. a single click a particular business may be added to the user s collections. In some embodiments the selected business windows may be selected regardless of what has already been added to the user s collections and whether a particular business has been added to the user s collections could be graphically indicated in any suitable manner e.g. though not depicted as such an indicator for a business already in the user s collections could be different than an indicator for a business not already added .

In some embodiments the end user interface may include one or more selected coupon windows . In some embodiments the selected coupon windows may present certain coupon information for businesses near a location of interest to the user. In some embodiments the system could select the coupon information by actively monitoring location of interest data of the user and correlating that data to coupon information retained by the system . In some embodiments coupon information could be correlated to businesses already added to the user s collections in order to apprise the user of pertinent offers relating to those businesses of interest. In some embodiments the system could monitor location of interest data for the user and notify businesses already added to the user s collections of an opportunity to direct coupon information to the user. Responsive to the notification a business could provide coupon information to the system for presentation to the user. In some embodiments the system may gather push and or pull coupon information from businesses business websites and or any suitable data source in any suitable way and then provide pertinent coupon information to users via one or more selected coupon windows . The selected coupon window could be configured to provide an electronic coupon that could be savable and or printable. Along with each selected coupon window a user selectable option may be presented to the user so that upon user selection e.g. a single click the coupon may be saved in association with the user s account. If the corresponding business is already added to the user s collections the coupon information could be retained and accessible in association with the corresponding business in the appropriate collection. In some embodiments if the corresponding business is not already added to the user s collections selection of the option could also add the corresponding business to the user s collections in conjunction with retaining the coupon information for later access in association with the corresponding business.

In some embodiments the end user interface may include an activity reporter . The activity reporter could include one or more widgets in some embodiments. The activity reporter may be configured to a report activity about the orchestration platform as the activity is occurring in real time and or at a high speed. The activity reporter may report any suitable information regarding any suitable activity such as collection additions new users joining the orchestration service new reviews new businesses joining the service new followings of public collections etc.

In some embodiments the end user interface may include an editorial section that may surface editorial content. As in the example depicted the editorial section could expose promotional editorial material that incorporates links to a public collection. The public collection could correspond to a collection associated with a celebrity and could be tied to one or more endorsements. The public collection could be made available for public viewing following sharing and or copying.

As indicated by collection certain collection may not be created by and users but may be created and curated by staff of the orchestration service in some embodiments. In conjunction with such staff curated collections feedback from the crowd community may be solicited. For example incentives may be provided so that users provide feedback on certain collections corresponding to geographical area and business category. In some cases users may be enticed to add businesses to such a collection. Those that bubble to the top of such a collection e.g. in terms of ratings additions shares copies and or the like may be given greater visibility in the collection and or otherwise via the orchestration service features.

In some embodiments celebrity collections may be available for public viewing following sharing and or copying. In some embodiments particular businesses which may include individual or groups of service providers may have collections tailored for clients. For example a real estate agent may curate a collection of local vendors tailored for sharing with clients that have bought or in the process of buying a house in a particular area. Such a collection could include recommended vendors that could be of use to such clients such as an inspector a handyman a pool service utility providers lawn care service housecleaning service etc. Additionally the real estate agent may want to have multiple collections tailored to various categories of clients clients in certain metropolitan areas neighborhoods income classes etc.

In some embodiments the system may track instances of collection sharing in order to track referrals. Say for example a real estate agent shares a collection with a client and the client contacts a merchant via the shared collection for example via a communication reference provided via the collection which reference could be a click to call reference click to message reference click to email reference click to chat reference and or the like. The application and or system could monitor for such communications made via the collection. The system being notified of such communications may retain tracking information which could be used as a basis for rewarding the real estate agent for the referral. In some embodiments for example an account of the real estate agent could be automatically credited with a referral reward in any suitable form for the lead that was delivered. Beyond the example of a provider having an incentive to provide referrals the end user could similarly be incentivized to give referrals by sharing of collection window information. Such incentives may be based on end user qualification scoring and monetization discussed herein.

In some embodiments a network specific indicator may indicate whether a particular collection has been added by others who are friends associates of the user via an online social business networking service other users who associated with a certain affinity group and or the like. The network specific indicator may identify one or more of the friends associates. In some embodiments the end user interfaces may provide collection specific detail information copy options and or follow options as described herein. The end user interfaces may provide one or more collection share options configured to allow sharing of collection information in any suitable manner as described herein. For example as indicated in a collection could be shared via social business networking services account postings and the collection share options may facilitate that. In some embodiments the collection share options may include user selectable options to restrict the posting to a certain audience. Additionally the user selectable options may provide the option to geographically restrict the posting to an audience associated with a certain geographical area. The system may for example only make the posting to those friends associates who have associated locations as indicated by a social business networking service within a particular vicinity corresponding to the user specified location.

In some embodiments the dashboard may expose purchase consideration data about users who have added the particular merchant to their collections. A purchase consideration metrics feature may be configured to present access to details regarding any suitable aspects of consumer data capture and consumer qualification. depicts a functional block diagram of certain aspects of end user qualification in accordance with certain embodiments of the present disclosure. Various embodiments may employ any one or combination of various methods of qualifying end users. In some embodiments an end user may be simply identified as one having or not having made a purchase engaged services and or otherwise conducted business. In some embodiments providers may be charged by the orchestration or other service based at least in part on such an identification.

Captured data may be used to qualify and users. End user data may include any suitable information that may be captured to indicate infer and or determine which end users are likely to bring in business and or actually have brought in business. An end user s interactions with the orchestration platform can be broken down and assessed based on any one or combination of various factors such as for example duration of various directed interactions locations of the end user relative to business locations demographic information of the end user collection window development by the end user content added by the end user communications with merchants keyword analysis user generated content and or communications and or the like. Based on such indicia an end user can be qualified.

Some embodiments may employ a decision tree checklist workflow and or the like to capture various aspects of consumer qualification data and assess those aspects to infer consumer qualification. Such a decision tree checklist and or workflow may incorporate any one or combination of the depicted aspects and or similar aspects in any desired order according to various embodiments. End user qualification data can be consolidated and processed to yield an end user qualification score. Any one or combination of types of end user data may be captured analyzed and qualified.

The system may receive and process data regarding an end user in implementing the end user data capture process . In some embodiments the system may analyze any information received from an end user which information may be associated with the end user account and retained by the system to provision orchestration service features to the end user. As discussed herein certain embodiments may use a client application installed on the end user computing device to facilitate data capture. The end user data capture process may include any one or combination of various embodiments as discussed herein that gather information.

Having end user data the system may implement a lead qualification process . The system may be configured to qualify end users in whole or in part. Though certain aspects of end user qualification are depicted as being performed by the system the processes for qualifying end users may in some embodiments be performed in whole or in part by a client application installed on the end user computing device and or the provider computing device .

Some embodiments may qualify an end user according to a graduated scale. Any suitable scale may be used in various embodiments. In some embodiments a scale could entail a categorization scheme with any suitable categories. For example as depicted in categories such as very high high medium and low could be used to segment end users by purchase consideration.

Referring again to in some embodiments a scale could entail an end user scoring system . The end user scoring system could be correlated to the category scheme in some embodiments such that certain scores correspond to certain categories. Some embodiments may score an end user with a numerical expression for example an end user score. An end user score may be an assessment of an end user s potential to engage a merchant and conduct business. Accordingly an end user score may indicate which end users are more likely than others to bring in business thus providing a quantitative estimate of the probability that a given end user will provide business. By way of example without limitation a scale could include a range of end user scores from 0 to 100 or from 0 to 1 000 with the high end of the scale indicating greater probability. Some embodiments may use methods of statistical analysis to derive an end user score. Various embodiments may determine an end user score based on any one or more suitable quantifiers.

In some embodiments the system may implement an end user data logging process which gleans data pertinent to qualification from end user data associated with the end user account. The system may generate and maintain an end user qualification profile that may include any suitable qualification information corresponding to a particular end user. As indicated by block any suitable end user qualification information of interest may be surfaced for example by way of the merchant dashboard . For example information about end users that have added a particular provider to collections could be compiled analyzed formatted and or otherwise processed to window any analytics of interest.

In some embodiments the system may implement business rules to take action based at least in part on the end user qualification. The provider advertising with the orchestration listing service could be charged based on the end user qualification in some embodiments. The account management billing module s could implement a code system by which a provider is charged based on the end user qualification. For example a provider could be charged differently based on whether end users are more or less qualified. The charging process could be a performance based system where charges based on an addition of a provider to an end user collection and or based on end user actions taken with respect to the particular provider thereafter.

In some embodiments the charges could be based on end user score. Charges could be proportional to end user score in some embodiments. Charges could be applied contingent on one or more thresholds. For example a minimum threshold could be employed where an end user score not meeting the minimum threshold could result in no charge. An end user score above the minimum threshold could result in a charge. The charge could be based on one or more score bands for example one or more score bands above the minimum threshold. By way of example an end user score above a 50 minimum threshold could be correlated to quartile bands. A discounted charge could be applied based on an end user score correlated to a 50 75 band. A full charge could be applied based on an end user score correlated to the 75 100 band. Some embodiments could implement a proportional charge such as an end user score correlated to 75 could result in a charge of 75 or some other proportion of the full charge.

As indicated by block in some embodiments location information may be captured to provide an indication of the end user s location. As discussed herein various embodiments may employ any one or combination of methods of capturing location information including but not limited to gathering location information via any one or combination of the end user orchestration platform profile the communication device such as the device GPS capabilities access points third party data sources determining the area code associated with the device differentiating between whether a caller uses a landline or wireless network receiving explicit location information with one or more search requests inferring location information from one or more search requests and or the like. Gathering of location information may be facilitated by the application of the end user device sending tracking information to the system . In some embodiments gathering of location information may be performed before an end user places a call for example via the mobile application. Various location quantifiers could be assigned to a user based on the business of interest. For example with some businesses proximate location of an end user is important say for a plumber for example. With other businesses proximate location of an end user may not be so important or the fact that an end user travels frequently may be more important some businesses for example businesses which tailor to travelers. As an example a number of points could be assigned to the end user based on an identification of the importance of proximity to the business category of interest and the location information gathered for the end user.

In some embodiments as indicated by block an end user s interaction on the orchestration platform may be captured as data of interest. For example as indicated by blocks and in some embodiments end user interaction with the mobile application and or website provided by the system may be captured. As indicated by block the user interaction may involve one or more searches. A user for example may spend significant time searching for businesses relating to a certain category. As indicated by block the amount of time and or the number of searches may be taken into account as an indicator of relatively greater interest. The time spent searching a particular category of service providers and or the number of searches could be correlated to an increased indicator of interest in any suitable manner. Merely by way of example a number of points could be assigned to an end user based on the time spent searching and or the number of searches. Various interest quantifiers could be assigned to an end user based on search time in a proportionate manner. For example a number of points could be assigned for every minute of search time. Various interest quantifiers could be assigned to an end user based on the user meeting any one or combination of various thresholds of search time. As an example a number of points could be assigned after the end user accrues 5 minutes of search time.

As indicated by block in some embodiments a search pattern may be taken into account as lead data of interest. The search focus or non focus may be considered. Certain embodiments could differentiate between searches to detect a pattern of searches corresponding to a given category of searches. For example an end user might spend 5 minutes of searching viewing results linking to provider websites reading reviews etc. all related to a particular category of service providers say plumbers in a particular geographic area. Such search time could be distinguished from non focused searching such as searching related to various categories which might not be related. In such cases no additional points or a lower number points may be assigned.

As indicated by block in some embodiments end user curation may be taken into account as end user data of interest. End user curation may be assessed in terms of curation time . For example time spent arranging and customizing a collection and or information window maybe taken as a higher level of interest and be assigned points accordingly. Time spent accessing editing and or augmenting a collection and or information window may be taken as an indication of interest and be assigned points accordingly. End user curation may be assessed in terms of curation instances . For example instances if arranging customizing editing and or augmenting a collection and or information window may be gauged to determine interest. End user curation may be assessed in terms of user added content . User added notes and or reviews for example could be assigned certain points with more extensive notes reviews being assigned a greater amount of points. As another example instances of user added photos and or images may be assigned points accordingly. User added photos and or images that correspond to receipts invoices warranties etc. may be identified as evidence that the end user has transacted business with a merchant thus evincing a greater level of interest. Other user added content that could be assessed may include any other suitable user added content discussed herein including ratings indicia preference indicia etc.

As indicated by block in some embodiments an end user s interaction with one or more other merchants via the orchestration platform could be assessed and assigned points accordingly. For example if a user adds a merchant as a collaborator or otherwise allows a merchant to view a collection then that situation may be taken as an indicator of a high level of interest. As another example if a user communicates with a merchant via the platform e.g. via a type of click to contact link chat window email text and or like means that is facilitated by the orchestration platform and or links thereto that likewise can be taken as an indicator of interest. An end user s interaction with one or more other merchants could be assessed based on instances repeated engagements with specific merchants frequency of interaction with merchants of a certain business type e.g. duration of interaction type of interaction and or the like.

As indicated by block in some embodiments an end user s collection window share activity could be assessed and assigned points accordingly. Instances of sharing could be assessed based on numbers of occurrences form of sharing the size of the audience to whom the information shared the platform to which the information shared feedback on shares by others e.g. in the form of preference indicia reviews re shares etc. and or like. As indicated by block in some embodiments an end user s collaborator activity could also be assessed with instances numbers of collaborators being taken into account.

As indicated by block in some embodiments an end user s public collection share activity could be assessed and assigned points accordingly. Instances of collection publicizing could be assessed based on numbers of occurrences numbers of followers instances of copying feedback on public collections by others e.g. in the form of preference indicia reviews etc. and or like.

With regard to any of these bases for qualification or similar bases scoring or otherwise assigning significance to such bases may be implemented to any suitable level of granularity. For example with respect to feedback on shares type of feedback and extent of feedback can be differentiated and accorded various levels of significance. As a specific example a simple indication that a friend connection of the end user likes something that the end user shared on a social business network may be accorded less significance than a re share and or comment by a friend connection. Similarly not all comments need be treated the same. In some abundance keyword analysis such as described herein may be used to assess the significance of comments made by friends connections.

Accordingly various embodiments according to the present disclosure may provide for windowing end user analytics that can provide market insights to providers. Moreover various embodiments may qualify end user aspects of the orchestration platform so that expansion collaboration sharing and or other use of the orchestration platform may be monetized e.g. based on end user qualification analytics . Such monetization can be used to incentivize sharing marketing efforts endorsement efforts and or other use of the orchestration platform. And the incentive position may take the form of a reward system be it monetary or otherwise.

Referring again to the purchase consideration data about end users who have added the particular merchant to their collections could be presented based on the end user qualification information analytics. The purchase consideration data could correspond to any time period s . Additionally the purchase consideration data could compare to past data. The past data could also be presented however like in the example depicted differential information such as percentage increases decreases could be presented. In addition to segmented analytics information about multiple end users any suitable information about individual end users such as a qualification score underlying qualification data and or the like could be viewable for example responsive to user selection of one or more user selectable options.

Other end user analytics that could also be presented may include purchase information . For example the purchase information may take into account purchases made by respective end users. A last purchase of each respective end user may be taken into account and a user distribution of numbers of end users who have made last purchases over any suitable time period of interest may be presented like in the example indicated. In various embodiments the purchases considered could be purchases made with the particular merchant with other competitor merchants that end users have added to a collection and that are in the same business category of the merchant and or with other collection added merchants generally.

The dashboard may provide one or more user selectable time options. A time period selection feature may be configured to allow for selection of a time period for which to view certain performance metrics. Past performance current performance and projected options may be provided. Past performance could show performance metrics for past week month billing period three months six months year etc. Current performance could show real time performance in the context of recent activity such as the last hour day week etc. Projected performance could show extrapolation of past and or current performance data into future such as any coming time period. Projected performance could be based on any suitable factor including aggregate performance of competitors in the market publisher platform performance market data for a particular location and or the like.

Other end user analytics that could also be presented may include reach information . The reach information may include information about the number of users reached. The reach information could indicate one or more of users reached by a particular merchant by merchants corresponding to a particular category e.g. a service category a product category any suitable business category etc. by merchants corresponding to a particular locale and or the like. Such reach information could be graphically differentiated along any suitable lines. The reach information could be refined to expose reach information for any suitable time period which time period could be user selectable. The reach information could be differentiated based on specific platforms used. For example users reached via the orchestration platform could be distinguished from users reached via social network connections. The reach information could include any share activity described herein. The reach information could reflect users who have specifically added a particular merchant to a collection. The reach information could also reflect users who have visited a particular merchant website contacted a particular merchant and or otherwise linked to a particular merchant via the orchestration platform. Any one or combination of reach information items could be qualified according to any suitable bases e.g. demographic information visit number value of customer potential value of customer quality of leads social network connections customer score etc. And such qualification could be graphically presented distinguished in any suitable manner.

Other end user analytics that could also be presented may include share activity information . Any suitable share information may be gathered analyzed and windowed. The share activity could correspond to sharing of window information for a particular merchant which could correspond to sharing based on an individual window and or sharing based on a collection that includes window information for the particular merchant. The share activity could correspond to sharing between users of the orchestration platform. The share activity could correspond to sharing by a user of the orchestration platform to a non user via any one or combination of the various means described herein. In the example depicted the share activity information may correspond to sharing via one or more social networks.

The share activity information may be segmented by geography like in the depicted example. While the example depicts segmentation by state any suitable geographic segmentation may be employed in various embodiments including neighborhood city metro area county and or the like. In some embodiments one or more user selectable options may be provided for user specified geos of interest to analyze data corresponding to the user specified geos. For example a user may be able to indicate a range such as a radius of X miles from specified location of interest. In some embodiments a user could indicate an area of interest with any suitable parameters e.g. including one or more counties municipalities zip codes distances from reference points etc. In some embodiments a user selectable map interface may be presented. Some embodiments may enable a merchant user to define an area by selecting one or more points on the map interface . For example any predefined service areas such as zip codes and or the like could be presented on the map for selection. The map interface could allow a user to define a perimeter of a service e.g. by drawing on the map with a line drawing tool cursor finger stylus contact with a touch interface selection of perimeter boundaries such as roads rivers etc. Hence share indicia may be location specific and windowed in any suitable degree of granularity to provide enhanced relevance.

In the example depicted user selectable options may be presented for selecting share activity information by state. Consequent to user selection geo specific information may be presented. The geo specific information may include any suitable details regarding the share activity. The share activity details may include one or more of platforms to which shares were directed locations associated with the sharing end user dates on which the shares occurred times at which the shares occurred distinctions as to whether the shares were individual business shares or collection shares information on re shares specifics as to collections shared which may include one or more of comments received ratings received approval disapproval indicia received re shares be a particular platforms etc. and or the like. The share information presented with the merchant dashboard may be presented in any suitable manner. User selectable options may be provided for exporting converting the share information in whole or in part and to any desired format including spreadsheets and other commonly used document formats.

One or more user selectable options which may include workflows may be provided via the offer manager to allow a merchant to create and or designate certain offer information. In some embodiments one or more templates may be provided for selection and or input of desire details. Various coupon templates could be provided by the system and presented to allow a choice of one or more templates. The various coupon template options could differ in terms of style content form and or the like. A coupon template could include fields for entry of information by the merchant. For example the merchant may have an option to designate a service and or product offer discount information start date expiration date terms and conditions and or any suitable information to facilitate offer information provisioning. In some embodiments the system may at least partially populate a template with merchant information based at least in part on listing information and or previous offer information already retained for a specific merchant. For example a template could be pre populated with merchant information such as business name business location and or the like. In cases where there are multiple options for a given advertiser say multiple locations multiple goods services and or the like the system could identify those options and facilitate user selectable options for the merchant to designate.

In some embodiments a merchant may upload information for use in offer provisioning and the offer manager could be configured to provide user selectable options to facilitate such uploading. A merchant could upload any suitable offer information in any suitable form in various embodiments. For example a merchant could upload an electronic coupon images and or other graphical video data audio data and or the like. Such uploaded data could correspond to any suitable advertising content.

In some embodiments a merchant may be provided with options to designate certain business rules for offer information provisioning. Such business rules could specify one or more temporal conditions such that provisioning may depend on one or both of temporal condition s and trigger events. Temporal conditions could include one or more of time parameters day parameters date parameters location parameters and or the like that could be conditions for offer provisioning. Business rules specifying time parameters could include e.g. rules for handling provisioning in view of a time of day when a trigger event occurs. Business rules specifying day parameters could include e.g. rules for handling provisioning in view of a day of the week when a trigger event occurs. Business rules specifying date parameters e.g. could include rules for handling provisioning in view of a date on which a trigger event occurs. Any suitable interface features including input fields telephone dialer inputs IVR inputs and or user selectable clock calendar and or like GUI components could be provided to facilitate advertiser specification of business rules in various embodiments.

Business rules specifying location parameters could include e.g. rules for handling provisioning in view of a location identified for an end user. Accordingly with an advertiser profile a merchant may be able to indicate specific areas for which particular offer provisioning to be targeted. In various embodiments a target area could be specified in any suitable manner including for example by one or more counties municipalities zip codes distances from reference points etc. In some embodiments a user selectable map interface may be presented as described herein.

Business rules specifying trigger event s could include e.g. rules for handling provisioning in view of any one or combination of events associated with an end user s orchestration account. For example trigger events could include one or more of an end user adding a business to a collection a forming of a new collection around a theme an addition of collaborator e.g. adding a merchant as a collaborator otherwise allowing a merchant to have access to a collection window a sharing of a collection and or business window with another orchestration service user a sharing of a collection and or business window with a linked account e.g. email text message online social business networking services one or more of which could be differentiated with distinct rules for handling sharing with distinct accounts a copying following of a collection making a collection window public adding content to a collection window a time period since a last activity with respect to a business window an end user s search relevant to a merchant not already added to the end user s collection an end user s search relevant to a merchant already added to the end user s collection a search for other merchants e.g. a search relevant to a business already added to a collection of an end user which search could potentially turn up competitors and or the like. In some embodiments one or more trigger events could include location parameters to allow for provisioning in view of a location identified for an end user.

Business rules specifying a form of provisioning could include e.g. rules for provisioning offer information via one or more of text messages voice notifications push notifications e mails social business networking services account postings messages alerts with the application and or other any suitable means. The offer manager may be configured to present an offer that a merchant has set up for previewing . In some embodiments the system may subsequently use any one or combination of merchant specific business rules to identify appropriate offer information options for one or more of a particular end user trigger event and or conditions. In some embodiments the system may be configured to automatically provide offer information to an end user based on the merchant specific business rules on behalf of the particular merchant without further merchant intervention. In some embodiments the system may be configured to present automatically identified offer information i.e. identified based on the merchant specific business rules for merchant selection so that the merchant may have the choice as to whether to dispatch the offer information.

In some embodiments the system can select pertinent offer information for transmission select a delivery manner form and or transmit pertinent offer information responsive to a trigger event based at least in part on the advertiser profile. In some embodiments the system may be configured to provide one or more offer information options to a merchant based on the merchant specific business rules . Accordingly the system can filter various offer information provisioning options with the merchant specific business rules and present an appropriate subset of those options to a merchant for merchant selection.

In some embodiments the offer manager may include a dashboard summary configured to present information and user selectable options for offers retained by the system for the merchant. The dashboard summary may present information such as offer creation date offer identification information specific form of provisioning offer status offer expiration and or any other appropriate offer information. In some embodiments the offer manager may be configured to present offer suggestions. The offer suggestions could prompt the merchant to create offers that the merchant has not already created. For example offer manager may identify potential trigger events related to the merchant e.g. an end user adding the merchant to a collection and may query the merchant to whether create an offer in view of the potential trigger events.

Accordingly certain embodiments may provide a merchant with a way to communicate with end users that are not only potential customers but also potential promoters of the merchant. Certain embodiments may allow a merchant to market events product offerings and or service offerings to end users.

Teachings of the present disclosure may be implemented in a variety of configurations. As such the order of the steps comprising the method and other methods disclosed herein may be shuffled in any suitable manner and may depend on the implementation chosen. Moreover while the following steps and those of other methods disclosed herein may be separated for the sake of description it should be understood that certain steps may be performed simultaneously or substantially simultaneously.

As indicated by block end user data may be gathered. The end user data gathering may include capturing interest data as indicated by block . The capturing of interest data may include any one or combination of interest data capturing features disclosed herein.

The end user data gathering may further include capturing demographic data as indicated by block . The capturing of demographic data for particular end users could be a part of interest data capturing. Any suitable demographic information could be harvested in various embodiments for example information about income level education level lifestyle age family household home ownership etc. In some instances demographic data could be provided by an end user as part of profile setup and or development with the platform. Demographic data could be inferred from interest data and or collection information in some embodiments. For example a user who has a collection directed to children or who has added a particular child directed business to a collection e.g. a pediatric dentist could be taken as an indication that the user has or is otherwise associated with one or more children. In some embodiments demographic data could be harvested from accounts that a user has linked with the system. In some embodiments demographic data could be gathered from one or more third party data sources .

The end user data gathering may further include capturing other consumer specific data as indicated by block . Any suitable consumer specific information could be harvested in order to allow for characterization of a particular user. For example such consumer specific information could include information on whether the consumer is proximate to life milestones such as a graduation a new job a wedding childbirth purchasing a home etc. Consumer specific information could include particular purchases or buying habits of the consumer in some embodiments. Consumer specific information could be inferred from interest data and or collection information in some embodiments. In various embodiments demographic data could be harvested from accounts that a user has linked with the system and or gathered from one or more third party data sources .

As indicated by block particular end users may be qualified based at least in part on the end user data gathered. The consumer data may be analyzed with respect to individual users. One or more engines may be configured to classify end users into one or more categories. In some embodiments the engines may include a classifying engine to classify end users into one or more categories. In some embodiments the orchestration engine may be or include a classifying engine. A classifying engine may classify each of a plurality of end users into at least one category of a set of categories that represent classifications of end users based at least in part on one or more sets of attributes defined for classifying various end users.

The end user qualification may include any one or combination of qualification features disclosed herein. As indicated by block an end user may be classified into one or more categories based at least in part on the end user data. Any suitable categories may be employed for characterization of end users. By way of example and users may be categorized according to interests demographics consumer habits life stages milestones and or the like to any suitable degree of granularity.

As indicated by block information relating to business recommendations may be gathered. Such information may include information pertinent to end users having indicated a preference for particular businesses. Preference indicia may include users having indicated a preference for particular businesses ratings for particular businesses and or the like. Business recommendation information may be aggregated from the platform. For example such information could include instances of businesses being added to collections being shared being copied being rated and or the like.

In addition or alternative business recommendation may be aggregated from outside the platform. Some embodiments may identify business recommendation information based on user indications of preference such as positive rating business an indication of liking the business friending or otherwise linking to a business sharing business information with others etc. that the user has made via webpages and or social media. Business recommendation information could be identified by approval disapproval indicators which may be in form of likes dislikes thumbs up thumbs down star scale ratings number scale ratings fan indications affinity group association messages to businesses and or the like. The approval disapproval indicators could be those associated with the user s profile and or profiles of friends associates connections of the user.

Information relating to business recommendations may further include location information pertinent to the businesses and or users associated therewith. Information relating to business recommendations may further include the date and or time information associated with the pertinent activities e.g. additions to collections shares likes etc. . The information may include any suitable information pertaining to explicit and or implicit indicia of preference for businesses interest in businesses ratings of businesses and or like such as the examples disclosed herein.

As indicated by block information relating to business recommendations may be qualified. As indicated by block businesses may be classified into one or more categories based at least in part on the information relating to business recommendations. Information about recommendations could be gathered analyzed and classified according to any suitable bases.

As indicated by block one or more indexes may be created based at least in part on similarities between businesses. The one or more indexes may link businesses based on the classifications and associated recommendation specific information. By way of example the one or more indexes may associate businesses based at least in part on any one or combination of the following.

Information with respect to a particular business may be analyzed in order to identify one or more business attributes. In some embodiments the system may include a matching engine that can receive business information identify attributes of the business based at least in part on the business information and match the business to one or more categories based on category information retained in a repository. The business may be matched to one or more categories that each represent classifications of business sharing common attributes. In some embodiments one or more taxonomies that map particular profile information to particular categories may be used in correlating business profile information with one or more categories. The business could be classified according to products and or services that the business provides. The business could be classified according to location for example a market that the business serves and or a physical site of the business. The business could be linked to location identifier s such as a directory code s relevant to the business listing of the suggestion geo coordinates corresponding to the business e.g. latitude and longitude and or the like.

The indicia of preference for each business may be quantified and qualified according to the form of preference indicia e.g. additions to collections shares likes etc. . The various forms could be qualified differently to assess varying degrees of preference. For example sharing a business that a user has added to a collection could indicate a greater degree of preference than simply adding the business to the collection. Likewise a user actually communicating and or engaging with the business may indicate a greater degree of preference than simply adding the business to the collection.

Aggregated recommendations may be classified according to user types categories. In a set of embodiments one or more collaborative filtering algorithms may be employed to define similarities between businesses based at least in part on demographic and or consumer data. Businesses may be classified according to demographic data for particular end users that have indicated preferences for the businesses. For example types of users that predominantly recommend certain businesses may be identified based at least in part on income level education level lifestyle age family household home ownership etc. Types of users that predominantly recommend certain businesses may be identified based at least in part on user proximity to life milestones such as a graduation a new job a wedding childbirth purchasing a home etc. and or particular purchases or buying habits.

Information about user identifications associated with preference indicia with respect to businesses may be retained. For example information about multiple relationships between user identifications may be retained. Such relationships could include relationships of users of the orchestration platform of a social network of a business network of an affinity group and or the like. Accordingly various embodiments aggregate recommended businesses and user identifications of people that recommend businesses in any one or combination of forums. The relationship information could include relationship graphs about relationships between user identifications via the orchestration platform and or other forums. For example the relationship information could indicate which users are related as collaborators on the platform which users are related based on followings via the platform which users are related as friends or connections via the platform and or the other forums which users are related as indirect connections through intermediate users which users are members of affinity groups etc. Mapping of related user identifications may be retained to facilitate identification of multiple user identifications associated with a particular user. For example a user of the orchestration platform may have one user identification for logging into the platform and a different user notification for logging into a linked account.

In some embodiments one or more of the data repositories and or indexes may be updated periodically. Updating may occur at any suitable time. Updating may capture one or more of listing name changes new business openings business closings preference data changes and or the like.

Certain embodiments may ensure or improve data integrity based on assessing frequencies for particular preferences over time. For example preference distribution can change over time. There can be seasonal distribution changes weekly distribution changes and daily distribution changes. Analyzing the distributions may identify popular changes over a particular time period such as the last 60 or 90 days. For example analyzing the distributions may identify how many preferences are indicated for a particular business in a particular area how many businesses correspond to a particular user types in a particular area how the changes impact the collaborative filtering analysis and or the like.

Information related to the user and or specific to the user may be gathered and analyzed in view of the one or more indexes to match the user with a set of one or more recommendations. Analysis of information about an identified user could entail comparing the user information to information about other users e.g. to determine user similarities in order to recommend businesses e.g. others favorite or otherwise preferred businesses for the identified user to review.

In some embodiments the one or more engines e.g. a recommendation engine discussed further herein which may include a matching engine may be configured to match the user to one or more businesses based at least in part on correlating categories. The matching could in some embodiments be based at least partially on comparing user attributes categories with business attributes categories. For example they may be matched according to preferences certain biographical information demographic information interests location information etc.

Any suitable correlation process may be employed. A scoring system could be correlated to the category scheme in some embodiments such that certain scores correspond to matches of certain categories. Some embodiments may score a match with a numerical expression for example a match score with higher scores being assigned to higher correlations of user attributes categories with business attributes categories. A high correlation may be identified using any suitable qualification scheme e.g. a score threshold a score ranking etc. .

As indicated by block one or more recommendations for the user may be generated as to at least one business from the set of one or more businesses. The one or more engines for example may be configured to assess matches of the user and one or more businesses. A recommendation could be based on the highest correlation between the user and a business. As part of generating the recommendation descriptive content indicative of a business may be selected as indicated by block . As indicated by block the descriptive content may be transmitted to a computing device and or account associated with the user.

As indicated by block one or more user selectable options to indicate an interest in the recommended business may be presented for selection by the user. Options could be provided for a user to add the recommended business. Descriptive content indicative of the recommended business may be provided with one or more user selectable options and or may be revealed with user selection of an option. Options could also be provided to allow the user to indicate disinterest in the recommendation and or further recommendations.

In some embodiments descriptive content could be anonymized so that one or more specific recommendations are offered to an individual user without revealing identities of other users from whom the one or more specific recommendations are derived. Though anonymized a specific recommendation could be offered with a general characterization of the other users. As one example out of many possibilities a recommendation for a dog owner in Glendale Calif. could indicate that other dog owners in Glendale have a preference for a particular veterinarian.

In some embodiments descriptive content may not be anonymized. Certain users of the platform may have public recommendation information. Real estate agents for example may curate a collection of local service providers relevant to those who have bought or in the process of buying a house in a particular area such as recommended inspectors handymen and the like and may wish to have such recommendations public. Accordingly recommendations may not necessarily be anonymized.

In some embodiments the recommendation may include a customized collection of advertising information for businesses. The customized collection may be automatically generated by the system for an individual user based on the analysis. The customized collection may be presented to the user as a curated collection with user selectable options that allow the user to select and or de select recommended businesses for retention in association with the user. For example the user may select one or more recommended businesses for additions to a new or existing collection of the user. As another example the user may select a recommended collection for addition as a new collection or for addition to an existing collection.

As indicated by block end user actions may be monitored consequent to the recommendation being provided. Any one or combination of actions and determinations may be correlated to indicia of greater or lesser interest in any suitable manner e.g. based on a scoring scheme . As indicated by block an indication disinterest of user interest by the user responsive to the recommendation may be processed. The user adding the recommended business to a collection may be taken as an indication of user interest. Alternatively the user may indicate disinterest in the recommendation and or further recommendations by selecting the appropriate option.

As indicated by block the end user responses to recommendations could be monitored for implicit indicia of user interest. For example it may be determined whether the user ignores the recommendation for a particular period of time. If the user has not taken action with respect to the recommendation after a threshold of time such inaction may be taken as an indication of disinterest.

As another example it may be determined whether the user ultimately removes the recommended business from a collection after having added the business. This may be deeded as an indication of disinterest in the business. Other examples may include monitoring for indications that the user engages with the business e.g. through communication links provided by the platform develops notes regarding the business enlist collaborators for a collection including the business and or shares the business information with others which actions may be taken as indications of interest in the business.

As indicated by block profile information associated with the user may be adjusted based at least in part on the monitoring. For example the profile information may be updated in view of positive responses to the recommendation e.g. adding the recommended business to a collection engaging with the business sharing the business information etc. . Thus in certain instances additional recommendations can be made for the user periodically or at any suitable frequency taking into account the addition of the business to the user s collection as indicated by block .

The profile information could be updated in view of negative responses to the recommendation. The system can disable the recommendation features based on the explicit rejection of the recommendation feature by the user. Instances of the user indicating disinterest in particular recommended businesses may be considered for future recommendations to adjust to the user preferences.

The system could also take into account implicit negative responses. For example repeated instances of the user ignoring a certain number of recommendations may be taken as a lack of interest in recommendations generally and the generation of further recommendations could be halted indefinitely or for certain period of time so as not to provide unwanted features to the user of the platform. A threshold number of ignored recommendations over a certain period of time without the user having taken any action on any recommendation could be employed to determine when to halt the recommendation provisioning process with respect to the particular user.

One or more engines may be configured to provide a recommendation engine . The recommendation engine may analyze end user information for a first end user and aggregated classified business information to identify a set of one or more businesses. The recommendation engine may generate one or more recommendations which may correspond to block of .

Certain embodiments may identify recommendations based at least partially on similarities of characteristics of a first end user and characteristics of other users from whom the business information has been derived. Any suitable algorithm for assessing similarity may be employed. Some embodiments may identify intersections between multiple sets of characteristics. Having set intersections identified the intersections may be compared. A greater extent of an intersection may be an indication of a greater degree of similarity between the users. In some embodiments the sets may be ranked according to the extent of the intersections. Any one or combination of the following aspects of end user information and aggregated classified business information may be used by the recommendation engine generate recommendations.

In some embodiments end user location information may be processed. The location information may correspond to location information for the user previously retained in conjunction with the platform as an area of interest for the user such location information having been identified by the user and or derived from user selections made with the platform. In some embodiments the location information may include location information gathered by the system via the end user computing device . Thus the user s location may be updated for example as the user travels to various locations. While the user may generally be associated with a specific locale certain embodiments may provide recommendations that are directed to a different location to which the user travels. The recommendation engine may use the end user location information with location filtering to identify location relevant business recommendations. Recommendations could be scored based on proximity to a relevant location of interest of the user.

In some embodiments end user platform interaction may be processed by the recommendation engine . This may correspond to the data capture and analysis of user interaction further described herein. The end user platform interaction may include information on end user collections and end user interest information . For example the current state of one or more of the user s collections could be analyzed as input to determine businesses already associated with the collections similarities with businesses not currently associated with the collections similarities with other users and or the like.

Further the end user interest information described further herein may likewise be used as input to determine matching businesses and users. The end user collections and end user interest information may be used by the recommendation engine in conjunction with collection filtering which could include one or more collaborative filtering algorithms and or indexes to determine similarities between the first end user and other users and their business preferences. For example say a set of collection interest information for the first end user includes five characteristics recommendation engine may determine that a threshold number of other users sharing those five characteristics have indicated a preference for a particular business in the relevant location that the first end user has not already included in a collection. Recommendations could be scored based at least in part on the extent of common characteristics shared by the first end user and the other users.

In the case that it is determined that the user travels to a new location that is different from a location with which the user is generally associated it may be further determined whether businesses in the user s current collections have additional business sites in the new location. For example a user may have a business already in the user s collection that is a part of a chain of businesses that includes an additional site in the user s current location. In some embodiments an identification of the additional site in the new location may trump other recommendations such that the additional site may be selected as a top recommendation for the particular user. In other embodiments the additional site may not automatically trump other recommendations but may be scored perhaps relatively highly along with other recommendation possibilities. In some embodiments the additional site is a recommendation possibility may be further qualified based on other criteria such as frequency of user visits to the business in the previous location e.g. a chain business may be scored highly if the user frequently visited the business in the previous location .

In some embodiments end user relationship information may be processed by the recommendation engine . The recommendation engine may select businesses based at least in part on the end user relationship information and relationship filtering . Recommendations could be selected based at least in part on a number of recommendations derived from users within a certain degree of closeness to the first end user in one or more relationship graphs about relationships between user identifications via the orchestration platform and or other forums. Recommendations could be scored based at least in part on the relationships between the first end user and the other users with various embodiments differentiating degrees of closeness and or forums.

In some cases only the most relevant relationships to the first end user are used as a basis for selecting recommendations. For example associated user identifications within a predetermined maximum degree of closeness between the user identifications of the recommending users and the first end user may be considered for selecting recommendations. Closeness may be based on the number of independent relationships between two users. For example two users may be directly related though a friendship connection and may be considered to have a closer relationship when they are also members of the same group as compared to two users that do not share a common group. Furthermore two users that share multiple common groups and have friendships or connections on multiple forums networks may be considered to be closer than those that have fewer connections.

In some embodiments end user demographic information may be processed by the recommendation engine to select businesses based at least in part on demographic filtering . The recommendation engine may determine a correspondence of demographic information of the first end user and other users associated with recommendations. Such determinations may be made based at least in part on any suitable demographic information such as for example information about income level education level lifestyle age family household home ownership etc. By way of example the recommendation engine may determine based at least in part on demographic information that the first end user fits the profile of a relatively young single male that is a recent college graduate living in an upscale downtown apartment and may identify recommendations of other users that fit that profile at least to a certain extent. Recommendations could be scored based at least in part on the extent of common demographic characteristics shared by the first end user and the other users.

In some embodiments end user consumer information may be processed by the recommendation engine to select businesses based at least in part on buying habit filtering . The recommendation engine may determine a correspondence of buying habit information of the first end user and other users associated with recommendations. By way of example the recommendation engine may determine based at least in part on the buying habit information that the first end user matches a category corresponding to a cutting edge technology consumer that tends to adopt the latest technology with regard to wireless devices for communication and home control and may identify recommendations of other users of that consumer type. Recommendations could be scored based at least in part on the extent of common consumer characteristics shared by the first end user and the other users.

In some embodiments end user life milestone information may be processed by the recommendation engine to select businesses based at least in part on life milestone filtering . The recommendation engine may determine a correspondence of life milestones of the first end user and other users associated with recommendations. For example imminent and or recent college graduates may be matched in order to identify recommendations based at least in part on the similarity. Recommendations could be scored based at least in part on the extent of common milestone characteristics shared by the first end user and the other users.

In some embodiments the recommendation engine may use time filtering to take into account relevant time factors with recommendations. For example certain recommendations may be more relevant to particular seasons or times during the year. Proximity to certain holidays for example may be relevant to certain businesses. In certain embodiments a time decay factor may be implemented in order to qualify the relevance of recommendations based on how recent the preferences were indicated. For example a time decay factor may be used with time based recommendations e.g. based on season holiday user actions etc. so that more recent preferences may be given more weight than less recent preferences.

Correspondence between the end user information and aggregated classified business information may be scored in certain embodiments. For example weights may be assigned to intersecting sets of characteristics and the weights may be taken into account with an overall relevance score. Any suitable criteria may be used to identify and assign a weight and any one or combination of the weights may be summed or otherwise used at least as a partial basis for deriving an overall relevance score. Any suitable scale may be used for the scoring. The recommendation engine may use one or more blending algorithms to select businesses from a rich set of recommendations based at least in part on the scoring.

In some cases only recommendations with a predetermined minimum number of associated user identifications may be considered for selection. In some cases only recommendations having a minimum number of user recommendations overall and having a minimum number of recommendations from recommending users within a maximum degree of closeness to the first end user may be considered for selection.

In some embodiments the recommendation engine may rank recommendations according to popularity of the recommendations e.g. numbers of users indicating the preferences and or similarity between the first end user and recommenders. In some embodiments having identified pertinent recommendations based on user similarities subsets of recommendations may be selected based at least in part on popularity of the recommendations. In some embodiments recommendations may first be selected based at least in part on popularity of the recommendations and then subsets of recommendations may be selected based at least in part on user similarities. Various embodiments may balance popularity of recommendations and similarity of recommenders to the first end user in various ways with various embodiments placing greater weight on one of those two considerations or equal weight on both.

Accordingly in some embodiments the engines e.g. the orchestration engine may be configured to facilitate individual selections by end users of businesses to retain information corresponding to the businesses. The engines may process indicia of selections made by each end user the indicia being received via a network. The engines may retain collections of business information in one or more repositories. In some embodiments the engines e.g. the orchestration engine which may include a classifying engine may be configured to classify each end user into at least one category of a set of categories that represent classifications of end users based at least in part on one or more sets of attributes defined for classifying various end users.

In some embodiments the engines e.g. the recommendation engine which may include a matching engine may be configured to process first information enabling unique identification of a first end user process second information about a first location corresponding to the first end user and match the first end user to a first category from the set of categories. The engines may identify a first set of collection information associated with a first set of end users that correspond to the first category and the first location determine a recommendation for the first end user based at least in part on the first set of collection information the first category and the first location cause indication of the recommendation to a first end user computing device and facilitate selection of the first business to retain information corresponding to the first business in association with the first end user. In some embodiments the engines e.g. the recommendation engine which may include a harvesting engine may be configured to gather data about the first end user from one or more data sources and analyze the data about the first end user to determine a first set of one or more attributes of the first end user. The matching the first end user to the first category may be based at least in part on determining that the first set of one or more attributes of the first end user correspond to the first category and the first set of end users that correspond to the first category may share the first set of one or more attributes in common with the first end user. In some embodiments the engines e.g. the recommendation engine which may include a ranking engine may be configured to rank a set of businesses associated with the first set of collection information based at least in part on a first metric where the determining the recommendation for the first end user comprises selecting the first business based at least in part on the ranking.

As indicated by block one or more businesses may be identified based at least in part on the end user information and the recommendation information . As indicated by block one or more advertising profiles corresponding to the one or more businesses may be retrieved and processed. With an advertising profile a merchant may have previously indicated specific offer information such as coupons for provisioning to end users of the orchestration platform based on one or more trigger events. Advertising profiles may be defined via the offer manager in some embodiments.

As indicated by block one or more business rules may be identified based at least in part on the one or more advertising profiles. As previously described an advertising profile may include certain business rules for offer information provisioning. The business rules could specify trigger event s that could include e.g. rules for handling provisioning in view of any one or combination of events associated with an end user s orchestration account. In some embodiments one or more trigger events could include location parameters to allow for provisioning in view of a location identified for an end user. The business rules could specify location parameters could include e.g. rules for handling provisioning in view of a location identified for an end user. The business rules could specify one or more temporal conditions such that provisioning may depend on one or both of temporal condition s and trigger events.

In various embodiments the business rules could specify any one or combination of user type aspects of the recommendation information such as demographic criteria and or buying habit criteria. As indicated by block in some embodiments it may be determined whether the business rules specify user type criteria. In the case that the business rules do specify such criteria it may be determined whether the first end user satisfies the criteria as indicated by block .

However in the case that the business rules do not specify such criteria the criteria could be system inferred in some embodiments as indicated by block . The criteria could be inferred based at least in part on the aggregated and classified recommendation information . For example recommendation information for a given advertiser may be determined to correspond to certain demographic and or buying habit criteria as previously described. Even though an advertiser did not specify user type criteria the system may determine a high correlation between users recommending the business and certain user type characteristics. Thus as the inferred criteria may be based on recommender that share similarities with the first end user the system could assume that the inferred criteria are satisfied as to the first end user. Accordingly an advertiser may target consumers based on specific user type criteria or the platform may identify specific user type criteria for the advertiser as a potential target.

As indicated by block it may be determined whether the conditions specified by the business rules are satisfied. As indicated by block it may be determined whether the business rules specify conditions for provisioning offer information to users that have not already added the respective business to a collection. If the business rules do specify such conditions the system may automatically provide offer information to an end user based on the merchant specific business rules on behalf of the particular merchant without further merchant intervention. The flow may transition to block of where descriptive content that is selected for the recommendation may include the offer information that an advertiser has specified and the descriptive content may be transmitted to the first end user in accordance with the business rules specifying a form of provisioning .

However if the business rules do not specify such conditions the system may be configured to present automatically identified offer information i.e. identified based on the merchant specific business rules and the recommendation analysis for merchant selection so that the merchant may have the choice as to whether to dispatch the offer information as indicated by block . In addition to the identified offer information any suitable descriptive information pertaining to the recommendation analysis may be provided. For example the merchant may be notified that the first end user matches certain categories that correspond to the merchants offer other users that have recommended the merchant and or the like. Accordingly the platform may provide recommendations to merchants as to particular users to whom the merchants may wish to send offer information.

User selectable options could be presented in any suitable manner. For example user selectable options may be presented with any one or combination of the user interfaces and or user interface features disclosed herein and the like. As indicated by block one or more user selections and a user query may be processed.

As indicated by block a specific business may be identified based at least in part on the query in some embodiments where the query and or selections explicitly indicate a particular business. Certain embodiments may provide features to allow a user of the platform to ask other users of the platform about a business that the other users have added to their collections. A user could identify a particular business via a search interface a suggestion a public collection a shared window and or the like.

As indicated by block in some embodiments one or more business categories may be identified based at least in part on the query. Certain embodiments may provide features to allow a user of the platform to ask other users of the platform about a business category and or something related relatable to a business category. For example a user may enter question and the platform may parse the words of the question and relate the keywords of the question to one or more business categories. Thus embodiments disclosed herein with respect to processing interest data and correlating keywords of the interest data to business categories may also be applied to correlating user queries to one or more business categories.

As indicated by block a set of users may be identified as a potential audience for queries. In some embodiments the set of users may be identified based at least in part on one or more user selections that may indicate a desired audience. The set of users could be restricted to users of the platform in some cases.

However certain embodiments may provide features to allow for queries to be directed not only to other platform users but also to users of one or more networking forms such as a social and or business network. A query could for example be directed to other users related to the querying user via a social graph. The querying user may be able to select one or more desired audiences with some embodiments.

As indicated by block in some embodiments a subset of the users may be identified based at least in part on user qualification. Any suitable user qualification such as any one or combination of the user qualification aspects disclosed herein may be used in various embodiments. Users could be selected on the basis of interaction with the business and or business category. For example the subset of users may be selected based at least in part on the users having added the business and or a business in the particular business category to collections.

In a set of embodiments the platform may identify a set of users as a potential audience for queries based at least in part on an assessment of the likelihoods that the users will reply to queries. Users could be selected based at least in part on user interaction with the platform. Users could be selected based at least in part on whether the users have engaged the business and or business in a particular business category.

Having end user data the system may implement an end user qualification process . Some embodiments may qualify an end user according to a graduated scale. Any suitable scale may be used in various embodiments. In some embodiments a scale could entail a categorization scheme with any suitable categories to characterize likelihood of responsiveness and or response quality and could correspond to very high high medium and low likelihood segments. A scale could entail an end user scoring system as disclosed herein with an end user score corresponding to an assessment of an end user s potential to respond to queries.

The criteria for qualifying consumers may take into account the extent of end user interaction. A greater extent of interaction could increase a ranking assigned to a particular user. The user interaction considered may include one or more of interaction directed to the merchant the business area of the merchant and or other merchants related to the merchant s business area. The criteria for qualifying consumers may take into account the extent of user interaction with a collection and or information window associated with the merchant the business area of the merchant and or other merchants related to the merchant s business area. The qualification of a particular consumer may also be weighted as a result of keywords being used in communication and or commentary associated with a collection and or window related to the merchant e.g. the keywords may indicate a user ready to buy engage services and or otherwise conduct business. The qualification of a particular consumer may be weighted more heavily as a result of indicia that the consumer made a purchase engaged services and or otherwise conducted business.

In various embodiments any one or combination of location information an end user s interaction on the orchestration platform which could also include interaction with networks such as business social networks through or otherwise associated with the platform end user curation may be taken into account as end user data of interest which may be assessed in terms of curation time curation instances user added content etc. an end user s interaction with the business and or businesses corresponding to the query an end user s collection window share activity which may be assessed in terms of numbers of occurrences form of sharing size of audience feedback on shares etc. an end user s public collection share activity an end user s previous responses to queries e.g. instances response query ratio etc. the recency of the end user s activities which may be assessed in view of certain time period thresholds and or the like could be assessed and assigned points accordingly with greater points being assigned with greater correspondence to the business and or business category being queried about. One or more the top ranked categories of users may be used to select users as query recipients and flow may transition back to block of . The selection could be iteratively expanded if sufficient responses are not received with certain time thresholds.

With respect to block users could be selected based at least in part on explicit and or implicit indicia of preference for the particular business and or category via the platform and or other networks. Users could be selected based at least in part on user type. For example users having similarities with the querying user may be identified and selected. The user selection could include any one or combination of the features disclosed herein with respect to the recommendation generation as applied to facilitate identifying pertinent recipients for a particular end user s queries with the end result being an audience selection rather than a recommended business.

Referring again to as indicated by block the query may be conveyed to the identified users. In various embodiments the query may be conveyed via any one or combination of notification means such as those disclosed herein. For example social business networking services account postings messages platform account notifications pop ups and or other alerts with the platform application text messages voice notifications push notifications e mails and or other any suitable means could be employed to allow for the presentation of query information.

As indicated by block the end user actions may be monitored. Responses to the query may be harvested as indicated by block . As indicated by block in some embodiments non responsiveness to the query may likewise be monitored. The harvesting responses could be provided by way of user selectable options provided via the platform account and or the social business network services API calls crawling pull and or push user feedback in any suitable way and or the like.

As indicated by block responses to the query may be conveyed to the querying user in any suitable manner. For example the responses may be conveyed via any suitable interface of a platform application such as a dedicated query results page an activity feed pop ups or any other suitable notification means. In some embodiments the responses may be quantified according to any user metrics and such information may be presented to the querying user. For example responses coming from platform users may be quantified responses from social network users may be quantified etc. Furthermore descriptive information about the users the selection criteria and or the like may be presented to the querying user.

According to an aspect of the present invention a data storage system may be provided that supports the storage and or retrieval of user generated content. The data storage system may be implemented as part of the interaction infrastructure discussed in . In particular the data storage system may implement as a part of master data management layer shown in . In an embodiment data storage services provided by the data storage system may be invoked by other components of the interaction infrastructure such as information handling engines shown in . For instance the data storage system may be configured support functionalities of information orchestration engines discussed in .

The data storage system can include a storage interface layer comprising one or more interface servers . The interface servers can be configured to implement individually or collectively an interface between the data storage system and the data users . The interface may include an application programming interface API that enables a data user to programmatically interface with the various features components and capabilities of the data storage system. Such APIs may be part of a user interface that may include graphical user interfaces GUIs Web based interfaces or services programmatic interfaces such as application programming interfaces APIs and or sets of remote procedure calls RPCs corresponding to interface elements messaging interfaces in which the interface elements correspond to messages of a communication protocol and or suitable combinations thereof. A data user may request the performance of any of service provided by the data storage system by sending API requests to the interface layer of the data storage system. Similarly the data storage system may provide responses to the API requests. Such requests and responses may be submitted over any suitable communications protocol such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP File Transfer Protocol FTP and the like in any suitable format such as REpresentational State Transfer REST Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP and the like. In some embodiments the interface layer may be implemented as a part of the application services management layer and or a part of the master data management layer of . In some embodiments the interface layer may be implemented at least partially by the application services system of by the data management system of or both.

The data storage system can include a plurality of storage entities used to store data. The interface layer may be configured to interact with the storage entities to fulfill requests from data users . Such interactions may include storing and retrieving of data objects. As used herein a storage entity can include any entity configured to store data and may include a storage device e.g. solid state drive hard disk drive tape drive storage node datacenter or the like. In an embodiment the storage entities may be implemented as a part of the master data management layer of and or implemented at least partially by the data management system of . For instance the storage entities can include the data management servers and or data stores discussed in .

A storage node may include a storage server controlling a collection of storage devices. A datacenter may comprise a collection of storage nodes . Such storage entities may be physical virtual or any abstraction thereof e.g. instances of distributed storage and or computing systems and may be organized into any topology including hierarchical or tiered topologies such as a ring an array or a cluster. The storage entities may communicate with each other for example using a storage area network SAN . The storage entities may be controlled by instructions or control messages provided by storage servers interface servers and or any other suitable control devices. Communications between components within the data storage system and or between external entities and the data storage system may be provided by any suitable messaging protocol such as RabbitMQ provided by Pivotal Software.

The hardware and or software configuration and characteristics of the data storage system may depend on various requirements related to performance scalability reliability flexibility complexity functionality and the like. Specifically the data storage system may be configured to provide high storage capacity high throughput load balancing data redundancy fault tolerance and or the like. Such hardware and or software characteristics of the data storage system may be predetermined e.g. by a system administrator and or dynamically configurable e.g. by an automated process . In some embodiment the data storage system can implement one or more types of database management systems such as a NoSQL database management system a relational database management system RDBMs or any other suitable database management systems. Under certain situations NoSQL databases may offer better performance e.g. faster retrieval and or update than relational databases. NoSQL database management systems can be modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. For instance data in a NoSQL database may be modeled using columns documents key value pairs graphs and the like. Examples of column based NoSQL data stores include Accumulo Cassandra or HBase provided by Apache Software Foundation and Big Table provided by Google. Examples of document oriented data stores include Elasticsearch provided by Elasticsearch BV Lotus Notes provided by IBM and MongoDB provided by MongoDB Inc. Examples of key value based data stores include DynamoDB provided by Amazon.com and FoundationDB. Examples of graph based data stores include Allegro provided by Franz Inc. and InfiniteGraph provided by Objectivity Inc.

The Cassandra data store with high throughput may be used to as the primary storage for user related and or user generated data. The Elasticsearch data store with efficient search capabilities may be used to store searchable documents and or data. For example data stored in the Elasticsearch may include collection and or business information that will be search by collection specific and or business specific attributes such as geographical location type or category name keywords description and the like. In other embodiments the data storage system may implement only one type of data store e.g. Cassandra or more than two types of data stores depending on the specific requirements.

The number type and configuration of the storage entities may be configured to satisfy certain system or business requirements. The numbers of storage nodes and or data centers per data center may determine or be determined by a data redundancy scheme such as error correction code. For instance an exemplary data storage system may have two datacenters each with eight storage nodes. The data centers may be replica of each other to provide redundancy. The storage nodes may be used to redundantly store encoded portions e.g. shards of data objects according to a predetermined redundancy scheme. In some embodiments the storage nodes may be configured to provide relatively higher storage capacity and less processing resources e.g. CPU memory than the interface servers which are typically configured to handle data user requests with a high throughput.

In an embodiment the data storage system may provide a multi tenant or multi customer environment where each tenant or customer may store retrieve delete or otherwise manage data in a data storage space allocated to the customer. For instance the storage entities of the data storage system may be partitioned so as to implement multi tenancy.

According to an aspect of the present invention the data storage system may be configured to maintain the same data in different databases or database tables with different characteristics so as to optimize the retrieval of data. Depending on the characteristics of specific queries different database tables may be queried to fulfil different queries on the same underlying data. The specific data model design e.g. database tables and columns may depend on the specific types of database stores e.g. NoSQL or relational database and or the specific business requirement e.g. types of queries or use cases .

In some embodiments the data model designs may be used to overcome restrictions imposed by an underlying database management system. For example such a restriction may specify that a query cannot be performed using a secondary key without using a primary key or using a tertiary key without the primary and secondary keys. Another exemplary restriction may specify that an IN query using multiple values may be performed only on a primary key and not a secondary key when the SELECT include a collection column e.g. including a list set or map . Yet another restriction may forbid an IN query on both a primary key and a second key.

Alternatively or additionally the data model design may be used to optimize specific use cases or to implement certain features of the orchestration platform also referred to as personalization system or service . Examples of such use cases are provided after the discussion of the database tables below.

According to an aspect of the present invention database tables for storing user collection information can be provided. illustrates exemplary database tables and used to store collection information in accordance with embodiments. The database tables and as well as other database tables discussed herein may be implemented by one or more storage entities discussed herein e.g. storage devices storage nodes datacenters .

A collection may be originally created by or for a specific user. Each collection associated with a particular user may be uniquely identified e.g. by a local collection id among all the collections for that user. Local collection ids may or may not be unique across different users. For instance the local collection id for the collection c1 of user u1 e.g. c1 or Food may be identical to the local collection id for the collection c1 of user u2. A collection may also be identified uniquely among all the collections across all users by a global collection id. A collection may include zero one or more business listings. An owner or editor e.g. a user with write access of a collection can edit a collection. Such edit of collections may include adding removing or updating business listings and the associated business attributes within the collection and or adding removing or updating collection specific attributes such as keywords access control settings and the like. A user may also have read only access to a collection such that the user can view but not edit content of the collection. Examples of users with read only access can include users that follow public and or featured collections or users with read only access to privately shared collections.

A collection may be created by or created for a first user but shared with or followed by a second user. In such cases the second user may have access to the collections of the first user. Such access may include read and or write access. For instance the second user may follow a collection e.g. public or featured of a first user and has read only access to such a followed collection. As another example the first user may share one of his her collection with the second user e.g. privately . When granting access to the shared collection the first user may determine whether to grant the second user read only or read write access to the shared collection. For instance as illustrated in the user u1 may follow the collection c1 of the user u2 or the user u2 may share his her collection c1 with the user u1. The followed or shared collection c1 of the user u2 may appear to u1 as a shortcut to the collection c2 .

In an embodiment when a user follows or access a shared collection data associated with the followed or shared collection is copied and associated with the user. Subsequent update to the followed or shared collection would require update to the copied collection. A drawback of this approach is that when a collection is followed by or shared with a large number of users the large number updates that need to be performed on many copies of the collection when the original collection is updated resulting in significant performance overhead. To mitigate this problem a link to the original collection may be created for a follower or a user receiving a shared collection a sharee when the collection is followed or shared for instead of a copy of the original collection with all the associated collection data. When the followed or shared collection is updated the followers and sharees of the collection can follow the links to access the updated collection without having to update copies of the collection. The latter approach is illustrated in .

As illustrated the database tables and can be used to store collection data associated with users. Each of the tables may include a plurality of entries also known as rows or records and each entry can have a plurality of values respectively corresponding to a plurality of fields or attribute names. Each field may be implemented as one or more database columns. Each column may be used to store a single value or a collection of values such as a list a set or a map e.g. comprising key value pairs .

The collections table can be configured to store the association between users and their corresponding collections. Each entry also referred to as record or row of the collections table can represent a collection for a particular user which may be an original collection or a link to a followed or shared collection. Each entry of the collections table can include a user id field a local collection id field and a data link field . The user id field can be used to store user identification information of the user that uniquely identifies a user of the system. The user id field may be implemented by a corresponding database column. The local collection id field can be used to store information that uniquely identifies the collection within all collections for that user. The local collection id field can be implemented by a corresponding database column. As discussed above local collection ids may not be unique across multiple users. That is different users may have collections that have the same local collection ids. The data link field can be used to store either collection data associated with the particular collection when the user is the owner of the collection or linking information that may be used to identify a shared or followed collection. For instance the linking information may include information for identifying a corresponding entry in the collections by id table discussed below. The data link field can be implemented by one or more database columns.

The collections by id table can be configured to store collection data associated with global collection ids. Each entry record or row of the collections table can represent a globally unique collection with corresponding collection data rather than a link to a shared or followed collection. Thus there is one entry for each globally unique collection in the system. For example even if a collection is shared with or followed by other users there is still only one entry corresponding to that collection in the collections by id table whereas there would be 101 entries in the collections table including one entry corresponding to the original collection and 100 entries corresponding to the links to the original collection . The collections by id table can include a global collection id field and a data field . The global collection id field can be used to store information that globally identifies the collection among all collections of all users. In some embodiments the global collection id field may include a global unique identifier GUID or a combination of information. The global collection id field may be implemented by a corresponding database column. In an example the global collection id can be based on a combination of all or portions of a user id a local collection id and or a timestamp. In some other examples the global collection id may be based alternatively or additionally on other identifying information such as location information. The timestamp may represent a time when the collection is created or any other suitable time. In various embodiments combining the various pieces of information to form a global collection id may include concatenating interweaving encoding e.g. with a hash function or otherwise processing the various pieces of information. The data field of the collections by id table can be used to store collection data associated with the particular collection. The data field can be implemented by one or more database columns. The data field of the collections by id table may be similar to the data link field field of the collections table except that the data field does not contain any linking information. More details of the data field are provided in .

Although the collections table and collections by id table contains similar if not identical information each table may be used to optimize database performance for different use cases. For example the collections table can be used to facilitate fast retrieval and or update of collection information given a user id and a local collection id thus optimizing the use case where a user views and or updates his her own collections. The primary key of the collections table can include the user id field and the secondary key can include the local collection id field . On the other hand the collections by id table can be used to facilitate fast retrieval and or update of collection information given a global collection id such as when a user searches for public or featured collections. The primary key of the collections by id table can include the global collection id field .

Columns in the collection data link columns may be used to store various types of information such as linking information and or data information. The linking columns may include one or more columns for storing information that can be used to identify a linked or original collection entry stored in another table e.g. collections by id table of . The linking columns may include a global collection id column an original user id column and an original collection id column that are used to store respectively the global collection identifier of the linked or original collection e.g. comprising user id local collection id and timestamp the original user id of the linked or original collection and the original local collection id of the linked or original collection. For instance the collection entry in the collections table of corresponding to the linking collection c2 of u1 may have u2c1201504010930 for its global collection id field i.e. a combination of user id u2 local collection id c1 and a timestamp 201504010930 u2 for its original user id field and c1 for its original local collection id field as shown in the table immediately below.

A data portion of the data link columns may include one or more columns for storing non linking data related to collections. The data portion may include a business portion and a collection portions . The business portion can include a plurality of columns for storing information about businesses included in a given collection. Such business related columns can include a business ids column used to store a set of identifiers of businesses that have been added to the collection. A business locations column can be used to store a map that maps a business id to a corresponding geographic location identifier for each of the businesses included in the collection. Similarly a business descriptions column can be used to store a map that maps a business id to a corresponding description for each of the businesses included in the collection. A business images column can be used to store a map that maps a business id to a corresponding image identifier e.g. file name identifier and or file path for each of the businesses included in the collection. A business orders column can be used to store a map that maps a business id to a corresponding order or ranking for each of the businesses included in the collection. A user may be allowed to modify orders or rankings of the businesses in a collection and the resulting order or ranking may be recorded in this column. An added by user column can be used to store a map that maps a business id to a corresponding user id of a user that added the business to the collection for each of the businesses included in the collection. Exemplary values for the business related fields are provided in the table immediately below.

The collection portion of the data link columns can include a plurality of columns for storing general information about a given collection. Such collected related columns can include a followers column used to store a set of user ids of the followers of a given collection. In an embodiment the set of user ids for the followers may be used to provide notifications of updates to the collection to the followers. A permissions column can be used to store a map that maps a user id to a corresponding access right indicator e.g. r for read only access and w for write access for each user with whom the collection is shared with e.g. a sharee . A keywords column can be used to store a set of keywords associated with the collection. The keywords can be used to support keyword search of collections. A role column can be used to store an indicator indicating a type of a given collection. In some embodiments the role indicator associated with an entry in the collections table may be used to indicate whether the corresponding entry corresponds to an owned collection or a link to a followed or shared collection. If the latter then another lookup may be required to retrieve collection data associated with the followed or shared collection. In an example the role indicator may indicate whether a given collection is an owned collection a following collection that links to a followed collection a link to a privately shared read only collection or a link to a privately shared write access collection with values o f sr and sw respectively or any other suitable representation. Exemplary values for the collection related fields are provided in the table immediately below.

In various embodiments some of the columns or fields may be applicable only to specific types of collections or under certain circumstances while others may be applicable to all types of collections. For instance the followers field of a collection may include values only when the collection is followed by some other users. The permissions field may include values when the collection is shared with some other users. In some embodiments the followers field is only applicable to a public or featured collection whereas the permissions field is only applicable to a privately shared collection. In some other embodiments where a public collection can also be specifically shared the followers field and the permissions field may both be applicable. On the other hand the role field may be applicable to all types of collections.

Still referring to the collection data columns may be part of the data field of the collections by id table of . In some embodiments the collection data columns of the collections by id table may be similar to the data link columns discussed above when the latter contains collection data rather than linking information. For instance the collection data columns can include a business portion and a collection portion similar to the business portion and collection portion of the data link columns of a collections table. The data field of the collections by id table of may or may not include a role indicator field since all entries in the collections by id table correspond to owned collections.

According to an aspect of the present invention database tables for storing business listings can be provided. In an embodiment information related to business listings can be stored in at least two database tables a listings table and a listings by id table. The listings table can be configured to store the association between users and the business listings in their respective collections as well as collections that a listing belongs to. For instance the listings table can have a user id column a business id column and a collection ids column that are configured to store respectively a user identifier of a user a business identifier of a business included in a collection of the user and a set of collection identifiers of all collections of the user that include the business. The listings table may be optimized for the retrieval of listing information based primarily on the user id. For instance the listings table may have the user id column as a primary key and the business id column as a secondary key. An exemplary listings table is provided immediately below. The exemplary listings table illustrate the scenario where a first user u1 has collections c1 and c2. The collection c1 includes businesses b1 and b2 whereas the collection c2 only includes business b1. A second user u2 has a collection c1 that includes the business b2. As illustrated a business listing can be included in different collections for the same user or in collections for different users.

The listings by id table can be configured to store identical or similar information as the listings table discussed above. The listings by id table can have a business id column a user id column and a collection ids column that are configured to store respectively a business identifier of a business included in a collection of a user a user identifier of the user and a set of collection identifiers of all collections of the user that include the business. The listings by id table may be optimized for the retrieval of listing information based primarily on the business id. For instance the listings by id table may have the business id column as a primary key and the user id column as a secondary key. An exemplary listing by id table is provided immediately below.

Although the listings table and listings by id table contains similar if not identical information each table may be utilized to optimize database performance under different use cases. For example the listings table can be used to facilitate fast retrieval of collections associated with a given user and business thus optimizing the use case where a user views collections associated with his her own businesses. On the other hand the listings by id table can be used to support efficient implementation of a business indicator functionality discussed below.

Various use cases or features related to the orchestration platform also referred to as personalization system or service are discussed below as supported by the above database tables are discussed above. The personalization system or service may allow users to create search edit follow and or share collections and well as adding and removing business listings to the collections. Data generated or used as part of the personalization system or service e.g. collections and business listings may be stored by and rendered available by the data storage system e.g. via an API . In some embodiments data and or services provided by the data storage system may be used by the personalization system to generate recommendations to end uses as discussed in and or to facilitate user directed queries and responses as discussed in .

In an embodiment the personalization system or service can be configured to indicate to a user whether each of a list of businesses is included in one or more collections that belong to the user. The list of businesses may include search results recommended businesses businesses in another user s collection advertisements or any combination thereof. An indicator may be displayed alongside each business in the list and graphically distinguished in any suitable manner including with images shape differentiation color differentiation alphanumeric indicia and or the like. The indicator may correspond to one or more user selection options that allow a user to view further details associated with the business and or removing or adding the business to a collection of the user. The indicator may also display a list of the one or more collections of the user in which the particular business is included. Alternatively such a collections list may be displayed upon a user selection of the indicator.

To implement the above discussed business indicator functionality one approach is to attempt using the listings table discussed above to select each entry that has a user id that is the same as the current user s id and a business id that falls within the list of businesses such as using the following exemplary query assuming an exemplary list contain five business listings 

However such a query may not be permitted due to certain restrictions imposed by the underlying database management system. For example an exemplary restriction may specify that an IN query using multiple values may be performed only on a primary key and not a secondary key when the SELECT includes a collection column e.g. including a list set or map . Here the collection ids column is a collection column containing a set of collection ids and the business id column is a secondary key of the listings table hence the above IN query using the secondary key would not be permitted under the restriction. If the listings table is used individual queries such as those below would have to be made for each of the business in the list rather than the efficient single IN query above resulting in performance overhead. When the list of business is long the performance impact can be significant.

A better approach would be to use the listings by id table discussed above which contain the same data as the listings table but with the business id column as the primary key and user id column as the secondary key. As such a single IN query can be used below that complies with the restriction on IN queries discussed above instead of multiple queries.

By providing and using the listings by id table instead of the listings table the functionality of indicating whether businesses in a given list of businesses belong to a given user can be supported efficiently while addressing restrictions of the underlying database.

In an embodiment the personalization system or service can be configured to support searching of collections. A user may be allowed to perform a search of public and or featured collections based on one or more collection attributes such as geographical location name description keyword and the like. Details about the search results e.g. collections may be displayed. In an exemplary implementation the search results may be returned in two steps. In the first step collection information may be searched based on the user specified attributes to return a list of collection identifiers of the search results. For this step a first database optimized for attribute based search may be queried using the user specified attributes. An example of such a first database may include a document oriented NoSql database e.g. Elasticsearch . The resulting collection identifiers may be used in a second step to query a second database optimized for retrieval of collection information based on collection identifiers. An example of such a second database may include a column based NoSql database e.g. Cassandra . In an embodiment the first database is used to store a subset of information that is stored in the second database. The subset of information may include searchable collection attributes associated with collection identifiers. Complete details of collections including searchable attributes and other information may be stored in the second database. Storing only a subset of collection information in the first database allows the attribute search to be performed more quickly and efficiently. In an alternative embodiment one single database may be used to implement both steps. One approach for implementing the above steps is to query the collections table e.g. discussed in using local collection ids. However since local collection ids may not be unique across different users the results of the query to the collections table may need to be additionally disambiguated among the users resulting in extra work and slower performance. A more efficient approach is to use global collection identifiers that uniquely identify collections even across different users in the first and second steps above. That is the first step would return a list of global collection ids corresponding to the search results and the list of global collection ids can be used to query the collections by id table efficiently to obtain the associated collection information. Furthermore another reason for using the collections by id table instead of the collections table may be to get around certain restriction imposed by the underlying database management system. Such restriction may specify that a query may not be done using a secondary key without the primary key. Since the collections table has user id as the primary key and collection id as the secondary key a query may not be performed on the table using only the secondary key collection id without using the primary key user id according to the restriction. On the other hand the collections by id table has global collection id as the primary key and so can be queried using that a global collection id only to obtain the desired results without violating the restriction. By providing and using the collections by id table instead of the collections table the functionality of collection search can be supported efficiently while addressing restrictions of the underlying database.

In an embodiment the personalization system or service can be configured to support following of collection s . In particular a user may be allowed to follow a public and or featured collection of another user e.g. by selecting a user control associated with the collection . One approach for implementing following a collection is to copy the data associated with the followed collection into a new collection associated with the user. However such an approach would require updating the user s copy of the followed collection whenever the followed collection is updated. If a popular collection is followed by thousands of users updating thousands of copies of the collection can undesirable with respect to performance. A preferred approach is to create a link or shortcut to instead of making a copy of the followed collection for each follower. For example as discussed in an entry can be created in the collections table with a link to the corresponding followed collection entry in the collections by id table . The following entry may include the global collection id of the original followed collection the user id and local collection id of the original followed collection and a role to indicating whether following entry is a following entry or an owned or original collection.

During a lookup of the collections table if an entry in the collections table represents a followed or shared collection e.g. as determined based on the role field of the entry being f or s then another lookup using the global collection id may be used to query the collections by id table to retrieve the details of the corresponding followed collection. If the entry in the collections table represents an owned or original collection e.g. as determined based on the role field of the entry being o then the details of the collection as stored in the collections table can be returned without further lookup.

In some embodiments identity of the followers for a given public and or featured collection may be stored for example in a followers field or column of a followed collection. The information about followers may be useful for implementing user notification of trigger events associated with the followed collection such as updating attributes of the collection e.g. geographic location keywords description adding a business to the collection removing a business from the collection copying following of the collection a search performed on the followed collection or a business contained therein and or the like. Notification may be provided to some or all of the followers associated with a followed collection according to the notification preferences associated with the followers. For instance the notification preferences may specify the types of trigger events a user would like to be notified of and or the types of trigger events that the user prefer not to receive notification for. A follower that has turned off notification may not receive any notification regarding the followed collection. The notification preferences may also specify the delivery related preferences such as user preferred delivery methods e.g. email text message online social business networking services telephone call user preferred delivery addresses e.g. email address phone number preferred time e.g. evenings and or frequency e.g. hourly daily weekly of delivery and the like. The notification preferences may be user configurable e.g. via a user interface and or system provided.

In an embodiment the personalization system or service can be configured to support the sharing of collections with specific users. These shared collections can be read only R or write access W collaboration . Similar to the requirement discussed above with respect to followed collections it can be undesirable to create multiple copies of the same collection whenever the collection is shared due to performance concerns. Rather sharees of collections may have dummy entries in the collections table that link to the original collection that is shared such as discussed in connection with . The role field of a sharee s dummy entry e.g. role column of can indicate the type of the sharee collection e.g. rs for read only share and ws for write share . Based on the role field access control may be implemented accordingly to allow or forbid read write operations by users with respect to the shared collection.

Additionally and or alternatively access control to shared collections may be implemented by a map of share permissions that is maintained for a shared collection e.g. as shown by the permissions column and . As an example if user shared the collection with users u1 and u2 with read only permission and with u3 with write access the following map of share permissions may be stored 

Such share permissions may enable the determination of whether an update to a collection entry should be allowed. For instance a request for update may be made to a collection with collection id by a user with user id. The collection id and user id may be used to retrieve a entry from the collections table. If the entry is a link to a shared collection e.g. as determined by the role column then permissions column of the link entry or the linked entry may be examined to determine the access right of the given user.

Updates by multiple users to a collaboration collection a shared collection with write access may be tracked with a map between businesses in the collection and users that added the businesses. Such a map can be stored for example in the added by user column of the collections table and or the added by user column of the collections by id table. In some embodiments an audit trail of a collaboration collection may be provided based on such a map.

In an embodiment the personalization system or service can be configured to allow editors e.g. owners or a sharees with write access of a collection to set an order for the businesses contained within the collection. The order map may be used to map businesses within a collection to an order or sequence number. Such an order map may be stored for example in the order column and or order column discussed in . In some embodiments certain validation rules may be used to ensure the validity of a user provided order and or to automatically order the businesses. Additionally the personalization system or service may allow users to provide or update other attributes associated with businesses added in a collection such as location information description images keywords rating and the like. Such business attributes may be stored for example in corresponding columns in the business portion of a collection record e.g. the business portions and of .

In an embodiment the personalization system or service can be configured to support recording and or reporting of statistics related users collections businesses and or any other suitable entities of the personalization system. The statistics may be provided to other components of the personalization system such as the information handling engines discussed in and or external users devices or processes. For example the statistics e.g. use statistics existing business listings collections associated a user may be analyzed to gauge a user s preferences interests or habits so as to generation recommendations for users as discussed elsewhere in the disclosure. The recommendations may be generated in combination with other user specific information such as demographic information geographic location information and the like. The recommendations may include recommended business listings recommended collections recommended search terms and the like. In some embodiments the recording and or reporting of the statistics may be performed in real time or nearly real time. For instance the statistics may be made available in real time via an API or graphical user interface. In some other embodiments the recording and or reporting of the statistics may be performed periodically. For instance the statistics may be provided to users using any suitable communication methods e.g. email text messaging phone calls on a periodic basis. In some embodiments audit trails that show recent events or actions may be provided. For instance a user may view on a user interface of the personalization system one or more recent businesses that the user has recently added one or more searches that the user has performed one or more collections that the user has created followed shared.

In some embodiments duplicate statistics within a predefined period of time may be filtered and or removed. For instance if a user performs an identical action e.g. performing the same search at different times e.g. 5 times within a relatively short period of time e.g. 30 seconds then only one occurrence of the action may be recorded and or provided as part of the statistics data. The removal of the duplicate actions or events may facilitate identification of distinct actions and or events. In some other embodiments all occurrences of relevant actions and or events are recorded regardless and or reported regardless of duplicates.

For a collection the collection related statistics may include a total number the collection is viewed by users a total number of updates to the collection a total number of search hits for the collection a total number of followers of the collection and the like. For a business the business related statistics may include a total number of users who have the business in their collections a total number of collections that have the business and the like. For a user the user related statistics may include a total number of collections e.g. with a breakdown of owned followed and privately shared collections for the user a total number of businesses in the collections of the user a number of followers for the user e.g. for some or all of the collections associated with a user a number of users with which the user has shared collections with a number of users from which the user has received shared collections a total number of coupons for the user a total number of notes or comments for businesses e.g. within or outside of the user s collections that are provided by the user bookmarks made by the user for collections and or businesses ratings and or reviews submitted by the user e.g. for businesses and or collections and the like. In some cases operations performed by one user may affect statistics for another user. For instance if a user u1 shares a collection with a user u2 updates to the shared collection e.g. addition or removal of business from the collection can affect the statistics for both the user u1 and the user u2. The user related statistics may also include statistics about a user s interaction with a user interface provided by the personalization system such as searches performed by the user e.g. including searches for collections and or businesses collections and or businesses selected by the user calls or emails sent to businesses through an interface of the personalization system and the like.

The process can include receiving a request to retrieve collection data of a collection. In an example the request may be transmitted from a data user and received by an interface server of a data storage system as discussed in connection with . The request may include a user identifier user id that uniquely identifies a respective a user of the personalization system and a local collection identifier collection id that uniquely identifies a respective collection from collections associated with the respective user. In some cases the user may include a currently logged in or active user of the system.

In response to receiving the request to retrieve collection data a first entry from a database table can be retrieved based at least in part on the request. In particular the first database table can include a collections table such as the collections table discussed in . The collections table can include a plurality of entries each of the entries including at least a user identifier that uniquely identifies a respective user of the system a local collection identifier that uniquely identifies a respective collection from collections associated with the respective user and a role indicator that indicates whether the respective collection is owned by the respective user or followed by the respective user. Each entry of the collections table can represent an owned collection or a collection that is followed by or shared with the respective user. Retrieving the first entry from the first table based on the request may include retrieving the first entry by querying the first table with the user id and the local collection id that are included in the request.

The retrieved first entry can include a role indicator that indicates the collection type. For instance the role indicator may indicate whether the entry corresponds to an owned collection e.g. when the role indicator is o or any other suitable value or a followed collection e.g. when the role indicator is f or any other suitable value . Additionally the role indicator may also be used to indicate whether the entry corresponds to a shared collection e.g. when the role indicator is s or any other suitable value . In some embodiments the role indicator may be used to indicate access rights associated with the collection such as a read only shared collection e.g. when the role indicator is rs or any other suitable value or a write access editable shared collection e.g. when the role indicator is ws or any other suitable value . When the role indicator indicates that the entry corresponds to an owned collection it means the collection is originally created by the user with the user id of the entry owned by the user and or editable by the user. When the role indicator indicates that the entry corresponds to a followed collection it means the collection is originally created by a different user but followed by the user associated with the first entry. When the role indicator indicates that the entry corresponds to a shared collection it means the collection is originally created by a different user than the user of the entry but shared with the user associated with the first entry. For example the role indicators for the entries and of the collections table would be o for owned collections whereas the role indicators for the entries of the collections table may be f rs or ws depending on whether the corresponding collection c2 of user u1 represents a followed or shared collection.

Based at least in part on the role indicator of the first entry it can be determined whether the corresponding collection is an owned collection. If it is determined that the collection represented by the first entry is an owned collection e.g. when the role indicator is o then the first entry may be provided in whole or in part in a response to the first request. As discussed above an entry representing an owned collection typically includes detailed collection data such as data about businesses in the collection e.g. business ids locations descriptions images order numbers and collection attribute information e.g. keywords and the like.

Otherwise if it is determined that the collection represented by the first entry is not an owned collection e.g. when the role indicator not o then it means that the first entry corresponds to a shared or followed collection and contains a link to the underlying collection rather than the collection data itself. In this case a second entry may be retrieved from a second data based at least in part on the first entry. In particular the second database table can include a collections by id table such as the collections by id table discussed in . The collections by id table can include a plurality of entries each of the entries including at least a global collection identifier that uniquely identifies a respective collection from the plurality of collections associated with the plurality of users. When the first entry represents a non owned collection e.g. a followed collection or a shared collection the first entry includes linking information to the actual owned collection in the collections by id table rather than detailed collection data such as data about businesses in the collection. Linking information may include or be used to generate a global collection id or other identifying information of the underlying collection entry in the collections by id table that contain the detailed collection data e.g. of a followed or shared collection . In an embodiment each entry of the collections by id table can represent only owned collections. Retrieving the second entry from the second table based on the first entry may include retrieving the second entry by the linking information e.g. global collections id that is included in the first entry. The retrieved second entry may be provided in whole or in part in a response to the first request. By storing linking information in the collections table instead of actual collection data of a linked collection e.g. followed collection or shared collection multiple updates can be avoided when the underlying collection is updated. Additionally storing similar data in different tables with different data model designs e.g. different primary and or secondary keys allows the data storage system to provide optimized solutions to different use cases in a flexible manner.

The process can include receiving a request to update collection data of a collection. In an example the request may be transmitted from a data user and received by an interface server discussed in connection with . The request may be include a user identifier user id that uniquely identifies a respective a user of the personalization system and a local collection identifier collection id that uniquely identifies a respective collection from collections associated with the respective user. The request may also include updated data for the collection. Furthermore the request may also include identity e.g. user id of the user requesting the update. The requesting user may or may not be the same as the user associated with the collection to be updated.

In response to receiving the request to retrieve collection data a first entry from a database table can be retrieved based at least in part on the request similar to the step of the process discussed above in connection of .

The update may be validated to ensure that the update is permissible given the requesting user s access right. In some embodiments the validation can be based at least in part on the role indicator of the first entry e.g. a role field of . For instance the role indicator may indicate whether the collection corresponding to the first entry is a first entry is a read only shared collection e.g. the role indicator is rs or whether it is a write access shared collection e.g. the role indicator is ws . If the requesting user is the same as the user associated with the first entry then access right of the requesting user is the same as indicated by the role indicator. As another example if the role indicator indicates that the collection corresponding to the first entry is a followed collection instead of an owned collection then the collection may not be updatable by users other than the owner. Additionally or alternatively the validation may be based at least in part on a map of shared permissions associated with the first entry the map of share permissions mapping one or more user identifiers with corresponding one or more permission indicators e.g. r for read only access and w for write access the one or more user identifiers corresponding to one or more users that share the respective collection. The requesting user s id may be used to look up the share permissions map to determine the requesting user s access right with respect to the collection. The permissions map may be used for example when the requesting user is not the same as the user associated with the first entry and the role indicator associated with the first entry cannot be used to identify the access right of the requesting user. The update by the requesting user is allowable if the access right is write access. The update by the requesting user may not be allowable if the access right is read only access.

If the validation fails e.g. the requesting user does not have the required access right to the collection then the collection is not updated and an error message or log may be provided. Otherwise if the validation succeeds e.g. the requesting user has the required access right to the collection then the collection is updated. Based on the first entry it may be determined whether the first entry corresponds to an owned collection in a manner similar to the step of process in . If it is determined that the first entry corresponds to an owned collection then the first entry may be updated according to the update request. For example updated values in the update request may be stored in corresponding fields of the first entry. Otherwise if it is determined that the first entry does not correspond to an owned collection e.g. the collection is a shared or followed collection then a second entry from a second table may be identified based at least in part on the first entry for example in a manner similar to step of the process in . For instance the first entry may include linking information to the actual owned collection in the collections by id table rather than detailed collection data such as data about businesses in the collection. Linking information may include or be used to generate a global collection id or other identifying information of the entry in the collections by id table that contain the detailed collection data of a followed or shared collection. Once the second entry is identified the second entry may be updated according the update request.

In some embodiments the validation step may be performed immediately before the update operations in steps and or . For instance validation based on a role indicator and or a map of share permissions of the second entry after the second entry has been identified .

In various embodiments updating a collection can include updating any of the fields associated with the collection. For instance when a business is added to a collection the business ids field of a collection may be updated to include the newly added business. Additionally in some embodiments the added by user field of the collection e.g. the added by user fields and or of may be updated to include the user that added the new business to the collection.

Once the collection has been updated it may be determined whether update notifications need to be provided and if so to which users. In some embodiments the determination may be based at least in part on a followers field of the updated collection. The determination may be based on a followers field associated with the first entry of the first table e.g. field of or a followers field associated with the second entry of the second table e.g. field of . A followers field can include a set of followers that have followed the collection. Update notifications may be provided to some or all of the followers of the collection depending on the system setting and or user preferences. For instance the system setting and or user preferences may specify the types of update that would trigger notifications to some or all of the followers. The followers may also turn on off notifications for certain types of events. The process may end if it is determined that no notifications need to be sent.

The data storage system may be similar to the data storage system discussed in . For instance data storage system can include an interface layer implemented by one or more interface servers . The interface layer may be configured to communicate with a plurality of storage entities used to store data such as one or more storage nodes and datacenters . The interface layer may also be configured to communicate with a plurality of external and or internal devices or processes via the API provided by the interface layer .

In an embodiment a user may be allowed to define trigger events for example via a user interface provided by the personalization system. The trigger events may be associated with trigger conditions and trigger actions. The trigger conditions may specify when the trigger actions should occur. The trigger conditions may be related to data operations e.g. read write events and or changes to data values e.g. when a data value reaches exceeds or falls below a threshold value . The trigger actions may specify the types of actions that may occur when the trigger conditions are satisfied. For instance the trigger actions may specify that one or more users should be notified of the triggered events. The users may be allowed to specify preferences with respect to notifications such as the types of trigger events to be notified and or the types of trigger events not to be notified of preferred methods for the delivery of notifications e.g. postal mail email text message phone call website web service recipient information for the delivery e.g. email address or phone number of the intended user the time and or frequency of delivery of notifications and the like. Such trigger event and user preference information may be stored in the one or more storage entities of the data storage system . In some embodiments aspects of the user notification feature may be system defined and or user configurable. For instances the trigger conditions trigger actions users to notify notification timing and the like may be provided by default and or configurable by user.

The interface layer may be configured to create event messages when a trigger event is triggered. The event message may include details about the triggered event such as the time when the event is triggered the type of data e.g. business or collection the type of data operation e.g. read write the duration of the data operation the identity of a user or process that performed or requested the data operation e.g. a user that added a business to a collection relevant data values e.g. old and or updated data values and the like. The event message can include a user or a set of users that need to receive notifications about the triggered event and or information regarding the delivery of the notifications. In an embodiment an event message is generated for each user that needs to be notified. In another embodiment one event message may be generated for a group of users that need to be notified.

Data used to generate the event messages such as details about a triggered event user or users to be notified information regarding the delivery of the notifications and the like may be stored in the storage entities e.g. storage nodes storage devices and or otherwise made available to the interface layer . For example details about a triggered event may be recorded automatically in database tables or provided to directly the interface layer. A set of users to be notified for a given event e.g. followers may be stored with the data object e.g. collection for which a trigger is defined. User preferences regarding notifications may also be stored in database tables configuration files or the like that are accessible to the interface layer .

As an example when a business is added to a collection an event message may be created for each of the followers of the collection if any. The event message may include a time when the business was added attributes of the business e.g. name and geographic location attributes of the collection e.g. name and owner identifying information e.g. username of a user that added the business to the collection and the like. The event message for each of the followers may also information about the intended receiver of the notification such as preferred method s of delivery of notifications e.g. postal mail email text message phone call website web service recipient information for the delivery e.g. email address or phone number of the intended user the time and or frequency of delivery of notifications and the like. In some cases user preferences e.g. specifying whether a user would like to turn on or off notification for certain types of events may be used to determine whether and or how to generate an event message for the given user.

The event messages may be inserted into an outgoing message queue or queue based data structure. The outgoing message queue may be implemented by a file or data store as part of the data storage system or by an external device or process. The communication between the interface layer and the outgoing message queue may be implemented using any suitable messaging protocol such as RabbitMQ.

A notification engine may be configured to retrieve event messages from the outgoing message queue process the event messages e.g. to extract the intended user and or delivery mechanism and cause notification messages to be provided to the intended users using the intended delivery mechanisms based on the event messages. The notification engine may or may not be part of the personalization system discussed herein. In an example the notification engine may include or be included in an information handling engine discussed in .

In some embodiments the notification engine may also be configured to generate result messages indicating a status of the delivery of notifications and insert the result messages into the incoming message queue . The result messages may indicate whether the corresponding notifications have been delivered successfully. The interface layer may be configured to retrieve resulting messages from incoming message queue and store the results persistently e.g. in one or more data storage nodes .

In some embodiments the notification feature discussed above may be combined with any other functionality of the interaction infrastructure discussed herein. As an example the notification feature may be combined with the recommendation feature discussed in connection with . In particular recommendations as generated by the recommendation engine may be provided as user notifications to end users according to user specified preferences and or system settings for example using the message queue mechanism described above. As another example the notification feature may be combined with the user directed querying feature discussed in connection with . For instance queries directed to users and or responses received from users may be provided as user notifications to end users according to user specified preferences and or system settings.
