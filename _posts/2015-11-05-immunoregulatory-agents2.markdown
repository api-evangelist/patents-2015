This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 62 075 671 filed Nov. 5 2014 and 62 098 022 filed Dec. 30 2014 respectively the entire content of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase IDO also known as IDO1 is an IFN target gene that plays a role in immunomodulation. IDO is an oxidoreductase and one of two enzymes that catalyze the first and rate limiting step in the conversion of tryptophan to N formyl kynurenine. It exists as a 41 kD monomer that is found in several cell populations including immune cells endothelial cells and fibroblasts. IDO is relatively well conserved between species with mouse and human sharing 63 sequence identity at the amino acid level. Data derived from its crystal structure and site directed mutagenesis show that both substrate binding and the relationship between the substrate and iron bound dioxygenase are necessary for activity. A homolog to IDO IDO2 has been identified that shares 44 amino acid sequence homology with IDO but its function is largely distinct from that of IDO. See e.g. Serafini P et al. 16 1 53 65 February 2006 and Ball H. J. et al. 396 1 203 213 July 2007 .

IDO plays a major role in immune regulation and its immunosuppressive function manifests in several manners. Importantly IDO regulates immunity at the T cell level and a nexus exists between IDO and cytokine production. In addition tumors frequently manipulate immune function by upregulation of IDO. Thus modulation of IDO can have a therapeutic impact on a number of diseases disorders and conditions.

A pathophysiological link exists between IDO and cancer. Disruption of immune homeostasis is intimately involved with tumor growth and progression and the production of IDO in the tumor microenvironment appears to aid in tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover increased levels of IDO activity are associated with a variety of different tumors Brandacher G. et al. 12 4 1144 1151 Feb. 15 2006 .

Treatment of cancer commonly entails surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The standard treatment regimens show highly variable degrees of long term success because of the ability of tumor cells to essentially escape by regenerating primary tumor growth and often more importantly seeding distant metastasis. Recent advances in the treatment of cancer and cancer related diseases disorders and conditions comprise the use of combination therapy incorporating immunotherapy with more traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Under most scenarios immunotherapy is associated with less toxicity than traditional chemotherapy because it utilizes the patient s own immune system to identify and eliminate tumor cells.

In addition to cancer IDO has been implicated in among other conditions immunosuppression chronic infections and autoimmune diseases or disorders e.g. rheumatoid arthritis . Thus suppression of tryptophan degradation by inhibition of IDO activity has tremendous therapeutic value. Moreover inhibitors of IDO can be used to enhance T cell activation when the T cells are suppressed by pregnancy malignancy or a virus e.g. HIV . Although their roles are not as well defined IDO inhibitors may also find use in the treatment of patients with neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or disorders e.g. depression .

Small molecule inhibitors of IDO have been developed to treat or prevent IDO related diseases. For example the IDO inhibitors 1 methyl DL tryptophan p 3 benzofuranyl DL alanine p 3 benzo b thienyl DL alanine and 6 nitro L tryptophan have been used to modulate T cell mediated immunity by altering local extracellular concentrations of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites WO 99 29310 . Compounds having IDO inhibitory activity are further reported in WO 2004 094409.

In view of the role played by indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase in a diverse array of diseases disorders and conditions and the limitations e.g. efficacy of current IDO inhibitors new IDO modulators and compositions and methods associated therewith are needed.

The present invention relates to compounds that modulate the oxidoreductase enzyme indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase IDO and compositions e.g. pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds. Such compounds including methods of their synthesis and compositions are described in detail below.

Immune dysregulation is intimately associated with tumor evasion of the host immune system resulting in tumor growth and progression. Traditional treatment approaches comprising chemotherapy and radiotherapy are generally difficult for the patient to tolerate and become less effective as tumors evolve to survive such treatments. By utilizing the patient s own immune system to identify and eliminate tumor cells immunotherapy has the benefit of reduced toxicity. As upregulation of the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2 3 dioxygenase comprises one mechanism manipulated by tumors to promote growth agents e.g. small molecule compounds that inhibit enzyme activity present a promising avenue for prophylaxis and or treatment.

Small molecules include but are not limited to inorganic molecules organic molecules organic molecules containing an inorganic component molecules comprising a radioactive atom and synthetic molecules. Therapeutically a small molecule may be more permeable to cells less susceptible to degradation and less likely to elicit an immune response than large molecules.

As used herein the terms IDO inhibitor IDO blocker and terms similar thereto refer to agents capable of inhibiting the activity of IDO thereby reversing IDO mediated immunosuppression. An IDO inhibitor may be a competitive noncompetitive or irreversible IDO inhibitor. A competitive IDO inhibitor is a compound that reversibly inhibits IDO enzyme activity at the catalytic site a noncompetitive IDO Inhibitor is a compound that reversibly inhibits IDO enzyme activity at a non catalytic site and an irreversible IDO inhibitor is a compound that irreversibly eliminates IDO enzyme activity by forming a covalent bond or other stable means of inhibiting enzyme function with the enzyme. A number of IDO inhibitors are commercially available e.g. 5 Br 4 Cl indoxyl 1 3 diacetate and 1 methyl DL tryptophan 1 MT both available from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. and may be used as for example tool or reference compounds

The term ligand refers to for example a peptide a polypeptide a membrane associated or membrane bound molecule or a complex thereof that can act as an agonist or antagonist of a receptor. A ligand encompasses natural and synthetic ligands e.g. cytokines cytokine variants analogs muteins and binding compositions derived from antibodies as well as small molecules.

Moreover the term includes a membrane bound ligand that has been changed by e.g. chemical or recombinant methods to a soluble version of the membrane bound ligand. A ligand or receptor may be entirely intracellular that is it may reside in the cytosol nucleus or some other intracellular compartment. The complex of a ligand and receptor is termed a ligand receptor complex .

The terms inhibitors and antagonists or activators and agonists refer to inhibitory or activating molecules respectively for example for the activation of e.g. a ligand receptor cofactor gene cell tissue or organ. Inhibitors are molecules that decrease block prevent delay activation inactivate desensitize or down regulate e.g. a gene protein ligand receptor or cell. Activators are molecules that increase activate facilitate enhance activation sensitize or up regulate e.g. a gene protein ligand receptor or cell. An inhibitor may also be defined as a molecule that reduces blocks or inactivates a constitutive activity. An agonist is a molecule that interacts with a target to cause or promote an increase in the activation of the target. An antagonist is a molecule that opposes the action s of an agonist. An antagonist prevents reduces inhibits or neutralizes the activity of an agonist and an antagonist can also prevent inhibit or reduce constitutive activity of a target e.g. a target receptor even where there is no identified agonist.

The terms modulate modulation and the like refer to the ability of a molecule e.g. an activator or an inhibitor to increase or decrease the function or activity of IDO either directly or indirectly. A modulator may act alone or it may use a cofactor e.g. a protein metal ion or small molecule. Examples of modulators include small molecule compounds and other bioorganic molecules. Numerous libraries of small molecule compounds e.g. combinatorial libraries are commercially available and can serve as a starting point for identifying a modulator. The skilled artisan is able to develop one or more assays e.g. biochemical or cell based assays in which such compound libraries can be screened in order to identify one or more compounds having the desired properties thereafter the skilled medicinal chemist is able to optimize such one or more compounds by for example synthesizing and evaluating analogs and derivatives thereof. Synthetic and or molecular modeling studies can also be utilized in the identification of an Activator.

The activity of a molecule may describe or refer to the binding of the molecule to a ligand or to a receptor to catalytic activity to the ability to stimulate gene expression or cell signaling differentiation or maturation to antigenic activity to the modulation of activities of other molecules and the like. The term proliferative activity encompasses an activity that promotes that is necessary for or that is specifically associated with for example normal cell division as well as cancer tumors dysplasia cell transformation metastasis and angiogenesis.

As used herein comparable comparable activity activity comparable to comparable effect effect comparable to and the like are relative terms that can be viewed quantitatively and or qualitatively. The meaning of the terms is frequently dependent on the context in which they are used. By way of example two agents that both activate a receptor can be viewed as having a comparable effect from a qualitative perspective but the two agents can be viewed as lacking a comparable effect from a quantitative perspective if one agent is only able to achieve 20 of the activity of the other agent as determined in an art accepted assay e.g. a dose response assay or in an art accepted animal model. When comparing one result to another result e.g. one result to a reference standard comparable frequently though not always means that one result deviates from a reference standard by less than 35 by less than 30 by less than 25 by less than 20 by less than 15 by less than 10 by less than 7 by less than 5 by less than 4 by less than 3 by less than 2 or by less than 1 . In particular embodiments one result is comparable to a reference standard if it deviates by less than 15 by less than 10 or by less than 5 from the reference standard. By way of example but not limitation the activity or effect may refer to efficacy stability solubility or immunogenicity.

 Substantially pure indicates that a component makes up greater than about 50 of the total content of the composition and typically greater than about 60 of the total polypeptide content. More typically substantially pure refers to compositions in which at least 75 at least 85 at least 90 or more of the total composition is the component of interest. In some cases the polypeptide will make up greater than about 90 or greater than about 95 of the total content of the composition.

The terms specifically binds or selectively binds when referring to a ligand receptor antibody antigen or other binding pair indicates a binding reaction which is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus under designated conditions a specified ligand binds to a particular receptor and does not bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. The antibody or binding composition derived from the antigen binding site of an antibody of the contemplated method binds to its antigen or a variant or mutein thereof with an affinity that is at least two fold greater at least ten times greater at least 20 times greater or at least 100 times greater than the affinity with any other antibody or binding composition derived therefrom. In a particular embodiment the antibody will have an affinity that is greater than about 10liters mol as determined by e.g. Scatchard analysis Munsen et al. 1980 Analyt. Biochem. 107 220 239 .

The term response for example of a cell tissue organ or organism encompasses a change in biochemical or physiological behavior e.g. concentration density adhesion or migration within a biological compartment rate of gene expression or state of differentiation where the change is correlated with activation stimulation or treatment or with internal mechanisms such as genetic programming. In certain contexts the terms activation stimulation and the like refer to cell activation as regulated by internal mechanisms as well as by external or environmental factors whereas the terms inhibition down regulation and the like refer to the opposite effects.

The terms polypeptide peptide and protein used interchangeably herein refer to a polymeric form of amino acids of any length which can include genetically coded and non genetically coded amino acids chemically or biochemically modified or derivatized amino acids and polypeptides having modified polypeptide backbones. The terms include fusion proteins including but not limited to fusion proteins with a heterologous amino acid sequence fusion proteins with heterologous and homologous leader sequences with or without N terminus methionine residues immunologically tagged proteins and the like.

As used herein the terms variants and homologs are used interchangeably to refer to amino acid or DNA sequences that are similar to reference amino acid or nucleic acid sequences respectively. The term encompasses naturally occurring variants and non naturally occurring variants. Naturally occurring variants include homologs polypeptides and nucleic acids that differ in amino acid or nucleotide sequence respectively from one species to another and allelic variants polypeptides and nucleic acids that differ in amino acid or nucleotide sequence respectively from one individual to another within a species . Thus variants and homologs encompass naturally occurring DNA sequences and proteins encoded thereby and their isoforms as well as splice variants of a protein or gene. The terms also encompass nucleic acid sequences that vary in one or more bases from a naturally occurring DNA sequence but still translate into an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the naturally occurring protein due to degeneracy of the genetic code. Non naturally occurring variants and homologs include polypeptides and nucleic acids that comprise a change in amino acid or nucleotide sequence respectively where the change in sequence is artificially introduced e.g. muteins for example the change is generated in the laboratory by human intervention hand of man . Therefore non naturally occurring variants and homologs may also refer to those that differ from the naturally occurring sequences by one or more conservative substitutions and or tags and or conjugates.

The term muteins as used herein refers broadly to mutated recombinant proteins. These proteins usually carry single or multiple amino acid substitutions and are frequently derived from cloned genes that have been subjected to site directed or random mutagenesis or from completely synthetic genes.

The terms DNA nucleic acid nucleic acid molecule polynucleotide and the like are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides or analogs thereof. Non limiting examples of polynucleotides include linear and circular nucleic acids messenger RNA mRNA complementary DNA cDNA recombinant polynucleotides vectors probes primers and the like.

As previously alluded to IDO is an immune regulatory enzyme that is normally expressed in tumor cells and in activated immune cells. IDO is one of several immune response checkpoints that are involved in tumor immune escape thus IDO inhibitors disrupt mechanisms by which tumors evade the body s normal immune system.

IDO down regulates the immune response mediated through oxidation of tryptophan. This results in inhibition of T cell activation and induction of T cell apoptosis creating an environment in which tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are rendered functionally inactive or are no longer able to attack a subject s cancer cells. Therefore therapeutic agents aimed at suppression of tryptophan degradation by inhibiting IDO activity are desirable. Inhibitors of IDO can be used to activate T cells and therefore enhance T cell activation when the T cells are suppressed by pregnancy malignancy or a virus such as HIV. Inhibition of IDO may also be an important treatment strategy for patients with neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or disorders such as depression. The compounds compositions and methods herein help meet the current need for IDO modulators.

The expression of IDO is modulated by a complex array of signals thus implicating a number of different mechanisms of actions. For example IDO may be induced by inhibition of DNA methyl transferases or histone deacetylases. The NF B signaling pathway has also been implicated in IDO function. Inhibiting NF kB activity blocks IDO expression and produces robust anti tumor responses that are both T cell and IDO dependent alternatively NF B activation which may be effected by various factors such as interferon R1 R2 signaling and toll like receptor activation induces IDO gene expression.

Other mechanisms are involved with modulation of IDO function. By way of example inhibitors of reactive oxidative species ROS may effect stabilization of IDO IDO levels may be modulated by inhibition or activation of pathways that are both downstream and upstream of IDO and activation of interferon can activate an autocrine induction of IDO.

Studies indicate that the IDO pathway is active in many cancers both within tumor cells as a direct defense against T cell attack and also within antigen presenting cells APCs in tumor draining lymph nodes resulting in peripheral tolerance to tumor associated antigens TAAs . Cancers may use the IDO pathway to facilitate survival growth invasion and metastasis of malignant cells expressing TAAs that might otherwise be recognized and attacked by the immune system.

As alluded to herein tryptophan catabolism in tumor tissue by the rate limiting enzyme IDO provides an opportunity for the use of IDO inhibitors as a therapeutic alternative to or an additive with conventional chemotherapy. However certain cancers are capable of catabolizing tryptophan but are largely IDO negative. Recent studies indicate that the alternative enzymatic pathway of tryptophan catabolism involving tryptophan 2 3 dioxygenase TDO is also relevant in cancer. TDO which is considered responsible for regulating systemic tryptophan levels in the liver is constitutively expressed in some cancers and is also capable of suppressing antitumor immune responses See e.g. Platten M. et al. 72 21 5435 5440 Nov. 1 2012 .

IDO is expressed in a wide variety of human tumors and tumor cell lines as well as in host APCs which correlates with a worse clinical prognosis. Therefore inhibition of IDO may improve survival in cancer patients with IDO mediated immunosuppression. In comparison TDO is expressed in a wide variety of human tumors and tumor cell lines and expression of TDO is evident in advanced human glioblastomas. The identification of tumors expressing high levels of IDO or TDO may allow more selective inhibition of the tryptophan regulated immunosuppressive pathways. Alternatively compounds inhibiting both IDO and TDO could provide the greatest coverage to prevent tumor escape by compensatory expression of the other tryptophan degrading enzyme. Therefore the use of dual IDO TDO inhibitors or combinations of IDO and TDO specific inhibitors may prove to be a superior treatment alternative in immunotherapy of cancer to block immunosuppression mediated by tryptophan metabolism.

Although a precise understanding of the underlying mechanism of action by which the compounds of the present invention effect their activity is not required to practice the invention the compounds or a subset thereof are believed to inhibit IDO function. Alternatively the compounds or a subset thereof may inhibit TDO function. The compounds or a subset thereof may also have inhibitory activity on both IDO and TDO function. Although the compounds of the invention are generally referred to herein as IDO inhibitors it is to be understood that the term IDO inhibitors encompasses compounds that act individually through inhibition of TDO or IDO and or compounds that act through inhibition of both IDO and TDO.

The present invention is drawn in part to the identification of inhibitors of IDO with at least one property or characteristic that is of therapeutic relevance. Candidate inhibitors may be identified by using for example an art accepted assay or model examples of which are described herein.

After identification candidate inhibitors can be further evaluated by using techniques that provide data regarding characteristics of the inhibitors e.g. pharmacokinetic parameters means of determining solubility or stability . Comparisons of the candidate inhibitors to a reference standard which may the best of class of current inhibitors are indicative of the potential viability of such candidates.

The invention contemplates reducing tolerance to a tumor cell or cancer cell antigen e.g. by modulating activity of a regulatory T cell and or a CD8 T cell see e.g. Ramirez Montagut et al. 22 3180 3187 2003 and Sawaya et al. 349 1501 1509 2003 . In particular embodiments the tumor or cancer is colon cancer ovarian cancer breast cancer melanoma lung cancer glioblastoma or leukemia. The use of the term s cancer related diseases disorders and conditions is meant to refer broadly to conditions that are associated directly or indirectly with cancer and includes e.g. angiogenesis and precancerous conditions such as dysplasia.

In some embodiments the present invention provides methods for treating a proliferative condition cancer tumor or precancerous condition with an IDO inhibitor and at least one additional therapeutic or diagnostic agent examples of which are set forth elsewhere herein.

Immune and Inflammatory related Disorders. As used herein terms such as immune disease immune condition immune disorder inflammatory disease inflammatory condition inflammatory disorder and the like are meant to broadly encompass any immune or inflammatory related condition e.g. pathological inflammation and autoimmune diseases . Such conditions frequently are inextricably intertwined with other diseases disorders and conditions. By way of example an immune condition may refer to proliferative conditions such as cancer tumors and angiogenesis including infections acute and chronic tumors and cancers that resist eradication by the immune system.

A non limiting list of immune and inflammatory related diseases disorders and conditions which may be treated or prevented with the compounds and compositions of the present invention include arthritis e.g. rheumatoid arthritis kidney failure lupus asthma psoriasis colitis pancreatitis allergies fibrosis surgical complications e.g. where inflammatory cytokines prevent healing anemia and fibromyalgia.

Among other immune related disorders it is contemplated that inhibition of IDO function may also play a role in immunologic tolerance and prevention of fetal rejection in utero.

In some embodiments an IDO inhibitor described herein can be combined with an immunosuppressive agent to reduce the number of immune effector cells.

Some of the aforementioned diseases disorders and conditions for which an IDO inhibitor may be particularly efficacious due to for example limitations of current therapies are described in more detail hereafter.

Rheumatoid Arthritis RA which is generally characterized by chronic inflammation in the membrane lining the synovium of the joints affects approximately 1 of the U.S. population 2.1 million people . Further understanding of the role of cytokines including TNF and IL 1 in the inflammatory process has enabled the development and introduction of a new class of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs DMARDs . Agents some of which overlap with treatment modalities for RA include ENBREL etanercept REMICADE infliximab HUMIRA adalimumab and KINERET anakinra . Though some of these agents relieve symptoms inhibit progression of structural damage and improve physical function in particular patient populations there is still a need for alternative agents with improved efficacy complementary mechanisms of action and fewer less severe adverse effects.

Psoriasis a constellation of common immune mediated chronic skin diseases affects more than 4.5 million people in the U.S. of which 1.5 million are considered to have a moderate to severe form of the disease. Moreover over 10 of patients with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis which damages the bone and connective tissue around the joints. An improved understanding of the underlying physiology of psoriasis has resulted in the introduction of agents that for example target the activity of T lymphocytes and cytokines responsible for the inflammatory nature of the disease. Such agents include the TNF inhibitors also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis RA including ENBREL etanercept REMICADE infliximab and HUMIRA adalimumab and T cell inhibitors such as AMEVIVE alefacept and RAPTIVA efalizumab . Though several of these agents are effective to some extent in certain patient populations none have been shown to effectively treat all patients.

Subjects suffering from multiple sclerosis MS a seriously debilitating autoimmune disease comprising multiple areas of inflammation and scarring of the myelin in the brain and spinal cord may be particularly helped by the IDO inhibitors described herein as current treatments only alleviate symptoms or delay the progression of disability.

Similarly the IDO inhibitors may be particularly advantageous for subjects afflicted with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer s disease AD a brain disorder that seriously impairs patients thought memory and language processes and Parkinson s disease PD a progressive disorder of the CNS characterized by for example abnormal movement rigidity and tremor. These disorders are progressive and debilitating and no curative agents are available.

The present invention contemplates the use of the inhibitors of IDO function described herein in combination with additional immune checkpoint inhibitors.

The tremendous number of genetic and epigenetic alterations that are characteristic of all cancers provides a diverse set of antigens that the immune system can use to distinguish tumor cells from their normal counterparts. In the case of T cells the ultimate amplitude e.g. levels of cytokine production or proliferation and quality e.g. the type of immune response generated such as the pattern of cytokine production of the response which is initiated through antigen recognition by the T cell receptor TCR is regulated by a balance between co stimulatory and inhibitory signals immune checkpoints . Under normal physiological conditions immune checkpoints are crucial for the prevention of autoimmunity i.e. the maintenance of self tolerance and also for the protection of tissues from damage when the immune system is responding to pathogenic infection. The expression of immune checkpoint proteins can be dysregulated by tumors as an important immune resistance mechanism.

T cells have been the major focus of efforts to therapeutically manipulate endogenous antitumor immunity because of i their capacity for the selective recognition of peptides derived from proteins in all cellular compartments ii their capacity to directly recognize and kill antigen expressing cells by CD8 effector T cells also known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTLs and iii their ability to orchestrate diverse immune responses by CD4 helper T cells which integrate adaptive and innate effector mechanisms. In the clinical setting the blockade of immune checkpoints which results in the amplification of antigen specific T cell responses has shown to be a promising approach in human cancer therapeutics.

T cell mediated immunity includes multiple sequential steps each of which is regulated by counterbalancing stimulatory and inhibitory signals in order to optimize the response. While nearly all inhibitory signals in the immune response ultimately modulate intracellular signaling pathways many are initiated through membrane receptors the ligands of which are either membrane bound or soluble cytokines . While co stimulatory and inhibitory receptors and ligands that regulate T cell activation are frequently not over expressed in cancers relative to normal tissues inhibitory ligands and receptors that regulate T cell effector functions in tissues are commonly overexpressed on tumor cells or on non transformed cells associated with the tumor microenvironment. The functions of the soluble and membrane bound receptor ligand immune checkpoints can be modulated using agonist antibodies for co stimulatory pathways or antagonist antibodies for inhibitory pathways . Thus in contrast to most antibodies currently approved for cancer therapy antibodies that block immune checkpoints do not target tumor cells directly but rather target lymphocyte receptors or their ligands in order to enhance endogenous antitumor activity. See Pardoll April 2012 Nature Rev. Cancer 12 252 64 .

Examples of immune checkpoints ligands and receptors some of which are selectively upregulated in various types of tumor cells that are candidates for blockade include PD1 programmed cell death protein 1 PDL1 PD1 ligand BTLA B and T lymphocyte attenuator CTLA4 cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 TIM3 T cell membrane protein 3 LAG3 lymphocyte activation gene 3 A2aR adenosine A2a receptor A2aR and Killer Inhibitory Receptors which can be divided into two classes based on their structural features i killer cell immunoglobulin like receptors KIRs and ii C type lectin receptors members of the type 11 transmembrane receptor family . Other less well defined immune checkpoints have been described in the literature including both receptors e.g. the 2B4 also known as CD244 receptor and ligands e.g. certain B7 family inhibitory ligands such B7 H3 also known as CD276 and B7 H4 also known as B7 S1 B7x and VCTN1 . See Pardoll April 2012 Nature Rev. Cancer 12 252 64 .

The present invention contemplates the use of the inhibitors of IDO function described herein in combination with inhibitors of the aforementioned immune checkpoint receptors and ligands as well as yet to be described immune checkpoint receptors and ligands. Certain modulators of immune checkpoints are currently available whereas others are in late stage development. To illustrate when it was approved for the treatment of melanoma in 2011 the fully humanized CTLA4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab YERVOY Bristol Myers Squibb became the first immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval in the US. Fusion proteins comprising CTLA4 and an antibody CTLA4 Ig abatcept ORENCIA Bristol Myers Squibb have been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other fusion proteins have been shown to be effective in renal transplantation patients that are sensitized to Epstein Barr Virus. PD1 antibodies are also available for the treatment of cancer including for example nivolumab Bristol Myers Squibb and pembroluzimab Merck and anti PDL1 antibodies are also being evaluated e.g. MPDL3280A Roche . Nivolumab Opdivo has shown promise in patients with melanoma lung and kidney cancer as well as multiple other malignancies.

The present invention encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable salts acids or derivatives of any of the above.

Embodiments of the present invention contemplate the use of the IDO inhibitors described herein in combination with agents useful in the treatment or prevention of bacterial disorders. Antibacterial agents can be classified in various manners including based on mechanism of action based on chemical structure and based on spectrum of activity. Examples of antibacterial agents include those that target the bacterial cell wall e.g. cephalosporins and penicillins or the cell membrane e.g. polymyxins or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes e.g. sulfonamides rifamycins and quinolines . Most antibacterial agents that target protein synthesis e.g. tetracyclines and macrolides are bacteriostatic whereas agents such as the aminoglycoside are bactericidal. Another means of categorizing antibacterial agents is based on their target specificity narrow spectrum agents target specific types of bacteria e.g. Gram positive bacteria such as while broad spectrum agents have activity against a broader range of bacteria. The skilled artisan is aware of types of anti bacterial agents that are appropriate for use in specific bacterial infections.

The present invention encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable salts acids or derivatives of the agents and members of the classes of agents set forth above.

The IDO inhibitors of the present invention may be administered to a subject in an amount that is dependent upon for example the goal of administration e.g. the degree of resolution desired the age weight sex and health and physical condition of the subject to which the formulation is being administered the route of administration and the nature of the disease disorder condition or symptom thereof. The dosing regimen may also take into consideration the existence nature and extent of any adverse effects associated with the agent s being administered. Effective dosage amounts and dosage regimens can readily be determined from for example safety and dose escalation trials in vivo studies e.g. animal models and other methods known to the skilled artisan.

In general dosing parameters dictate that the dosage amount be less than an amount that could be irreversibly toxic to the subject the maximum tolerated dose MTD and not less than an amount required to produce a measurable effect on the subject. Such amounts are determined by for example the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters associated with ADME taking into consideration the route of administration and other factors.

An effective dose ED is the dose or amount of an agent that produces a therapeutic response or desired effect in some fraction of the subjects taking it. The median effective dose or ED50 of an agent is the dose or amount of an agent that produces a therapeutic response or desired effect in 50 of the population to which it is administered. Although the ED50 is commonly used as a measure of reasonable expectance of an agent s effect it is not necessarily the dose that a clinician might deem appropriate taking into consideration all relevant factors. Thus in some situations the effective amount is more than the calculated ED50 in other situations the effective amount is less than the calculated ED50 and in still other situations the effective amount is the same as the calculated ED50.

In addition an effective dose of the IDO inhibitors of the present invention may be an amount that when administered in one or more doses to a subject produces a desired result relative to a healthy subject. For example for a subject experiencing a particular disorder an effective dose may be one that improves a diagnostic parameter measure marker and the like of that disorder by at least about 5 at least about 10 at least about 20 at least about 25 at least about 30 at least about 40 at least about 50 at least about 60 at least about 70 at least about 80 at least about 90 or more than 90 where 100 is defined as the diagnostic parameter measure marker and the like exhibited by a normal subject.

In certain embodiments the dosage of the desired IDO inhibitor is contained in a unit dosage form . The phrase unit dosage form refers to physically discrete units each unit containing a predetermined amount of the IDO inhibitor either alone or in combination with one or more additional agents sufficient to produce the desired effect. It will be appreciated that the parameters of a unit dosage form will depend on the particular agent and the effect to be achieved.

An IDO enzyme assay and cellular production of kynurenine KYN is described in Sarkar S. A. et al. 56 72 79 2007 . Briefly all chemicals can be purchased from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. unless specified otherwise. Groups of 1 000 human islets can be cultured for 24 h in 1 mL medium with cytokines recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 800 g and sonicated in 150 L PBS containing a protease inhibitor cocktail Set 2 Calbiochem EMD Biosciences San Diego Calif. . The sonicate can be centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 g and the supernatant can be assayed in triplicate by incubating a 40 l sample with an equal volume of 100 mmol L potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 containing 40 mmol L ascorbic acid neutralized to pH 7.0 100 mol L methylene blue 200 g mL catalase and 400 mol 1 L Trp for 30 min at 37 C. The assay can be terminated by the addition of 16 L 30 w v trichloroacetic acid TCA and further incubated at 60 C. for 15 min to hydrolyze N formylkynurenine to KYN. The mixture can then be centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min and KYN can be quantified by mixing equal volume of supernatant with 2 w v Ehrlich s reagent in glacial acetic acid in 96 well microtiter plate and reading the absorbance at 480 nm using L KYN as standard. Protein in the islet samples can be quantified by Bio Rad Protein assay at 595 nm. For the detection of L KYN in the islet culture supernatants proteins can be precipitated with 5 w v TCA and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 15 min and determination of KYN in the supernatant with Ehrlich s reagent can be determined as described above. IL 4 10 g mL 500 2 000 units mL and 1 methyl Trp 1 MT 40 mol L can be added to the incubation media as indicated. This assay can also form the basis of a cell based assay and may be quantified via LCMS MS as an alternative to UV Vis detection.

Western Blot Analyses. Groups of 1 000 1 200 islets incubated for 24 h in Miami medium in the presence of cytokines can be harvested and sonicated in PBS as above and 50 g protein samples can be electrophoresed on 10 SDS PAGE gels. COST cells 0.6 10cells 60 mm3 petri dish transfected with human IDO plasmid 3 g or empty vector cells can be used as positive and negative controls respectively. Proteins can be transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidine fluoride membranes by semidry method and blocked for 1 h with 5 w v nonfat dry milk in Tris buffered saline and 0.1 Tween and then incubated overnight with anti human mouse IDO antibody 1 500 Chemicon Temecula Calif. phospho STATp91 and STATp91 1 500 Zymed San Francisco Calif. . Immunoreactive proteins can be visualized with ECL PLUS Western blotting detection reagent Amersham BioSciences Buckinghamshire U.K. after incubation for 1 h with anti mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody Jackson Immunolabs West Grove Pa. .

Immunohistochemical Detection of IDO. Islets can be fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde in PBS Invitrogen for 1 h immobilized in molten 10 porcine skin gelatin blocks 37 C. and embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound. Immunofluorescent staining on islet tissue can be performed on 7 m sections that were stained with antibodies raised against pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 PDX1 and IDO. Antigen retrieval can be performed in a water bath for 30 min in a buffer containing 10 mmol 1 Tris and 1 mmol 1 EDTA pH 9.0 at 97 C. The sections can be blocked for 1 h with 5 normal goat serum in PBS. The tissues can then be reacted with mouse monoclonal anti human IDO antibody 1 20 Chemicon and goat polyclonal anti human PDX1 antibody 1 2 000 which may be requested from Dr. Chris Wright School of Medicine Vanderbilt Tenn. overnight at room temperature in a humid chamber. Secondary antibodies anti goat labeled with Cy3 and anti mouse labeled with Cy2 can be purchased from Jackson Immunolabs and can be used at a concentration of 1 200. The nuclei can be stained with Hoechst 33258 Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. . Images can be acquired by Intelligent Imaging System software from an Olympus 1X81 inverted motorized microscope equipped with Olympus DSU spinning disk confocal and Hamamatsu ORCA IIER monochromatic CCD camera.

Alternative means for evaluating the IDO inhibitors of the present invention are described in WO 2010 0233166 and are summarized hereafter.

Biochemical Assay. cDNA clones for both human and mouse IDO have been isolated and verified by sequencing and are commercially available. In order to prepare IDO for biochemical studies C terminal His tagged IDO protein can be produced in using the IPTG inducible pET5a vector system and isolated over a nickel column. The yield of the partially purified protein can be verified by gel electrophoresis and the concentration estimated by comparison to protein standards. To assay IDO enzymatic activity a 96 well plate spectrophotometric assay for kynurenine production can be run following published procedures see e.g. Littlejohn T. K. et al. 19 22 29 2000 . To screen for IDO inhibitory activity compounds can be evaluated at a single concentration of for example 200 M against 50 ng of IDO enzyme in 100 L reaction volumes with tryptophan added at increasing concentrations at for example 0 2 20 and 200 M. Kynurenine production can be measured at 1 hour.

Cell based Assay. COS 1 cells can be transiently transfected with a CMV promoter driven plasmid expressing IDO cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 Invitrogen as recommended by the manufacturer. A companion set of cells can be transiently transfected with TDO expressing plasmid. Forty eight hours post transfection the cells can be apportioned into a 96 well format at 6 10cells per well. The following day the wells can be washed and new media phenol red free containing 20 g mL tryptophan can be added together with inhibitor. The reaction can be stopped at 5 hours and the supernatant removed and spectrophotometrically assayed for kynurenine as previously described for the enzyme assay. To obtain initial confirmation of IDO activity compounds can be evaluated at a single concentration of for example 100 M. More extensive dose escalation profiles can be collected for select compounds.

Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation. A pharmacodynamic assay can be based on measuring serum levels of both kynurenine and tryptophan and calculating the kynurenine tryptophan ratio provides an estimate of IDO activity that is independent of baseline tryptophan levels. Serum tryptophan and kynurenine levels can be determined by HPLC analysis and serum compound levels can optionally also be determined in the same HPLC run.

Compounds can be initially evaluated by challenging mice with LPS and then subsequently administering a bolus dose of compound at the time that the serum kynurenine level plateaus. As the kynurenine pool is rapidly turned over with a half life in serum of less than 10 minutes pre existing kynurenine is not expected to unduly mask the impact that an IDO inhibitor has on kynurenine production. Each experiment can include non LPS exposed mice to determine baseline kynurenine levels against which to compare the other mice and a set of LPS exposed mice dosed with vehicle alone to provide a positive control for IDO activation . Each compound can initially be evaluated in mice at a single high i.p. bolus dose in the range of at least 100 mg kg. Blood can be collected at defined time intervals for example 50 L sample at 5 15 30 min. 1 2 4 6 8 and 24 hr. following compound administration for HPLC analysis of kynurenine and tryptophan levels pharmacodynamic analysis as well as for the level of compound pharmacokinetic analysis . From the pharmacokinetic data the peak serum concentration of compound achieved can be determined as well as the estimated rate of clearance. By comparing the level of compound in serum relative to the kynurenine tryptophan ratio at various time points the effective ICfor IDO inhibition in vivo can be roughly estimated. Compounds exhibiting efficacy can be evaluated to determine a maximum dose that achieves 100 IDO inhibition at the peak concentration.

Referring to Scheme I treatment of the cyclohexanone II under standard Homer Wadsworth Emmons conditions with the phosphonate III will afford the corresponding unsaturated ester. Catalytic hydrogenation with for instance Pd C and hydrogen gas and subsequent ketal hydrolysis under acidic conditions gives the appended cycloalkanone of general structure IV. Treatment of compound IV with triflic anhydride and an organic base such as 2 6 lutidine will afford a vinyl triflate of general structure V. Coupling of V with arylboronic acids or esters E B OR preferably under the conditions of Suzuki see Kotha S. et al. 58 9633 9695 2002 affords cycloalkenes of general structure VI. Typically this reaction is performed by heating the halide and the boronic acid or ester to from about 90 to about 98 C. with a base such as aqueous tribasic sodium or potassium phosphate or sodium or potassium carbonate in a solvent such as dioxane DMF THF or NMP using a catalyst such as tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium or ClPd dppf . Many variations on this reaction involving the use of different temperatures solvents bases anhydrous conditions catalysts boronate derivatives and halide surrogates such as triflates are known to those skilled in the art of organic medicinal chemistry. Mild conditions have been reported for the coupling of sensitive boronic acid derivatives. See Kinzel T. et al. 132 40 14073 14075 2010 . Saturation of the olefin in VII can be accomplished by treatment with Pd C in an atmosphere of hydrogen to give a compound of general structure VII as a mixture of cis and trans isomers about the carbocycle. Further substitution of the ester can be accomplished by treatment with a strong base such as LDA or LiHMDS followed by addition of an electrophile R X where X is Br or I to afford compounds of general structure VIII after basic hydrolysis with a base such as LiOH.

Evan s chiral auxiliaries are well known to one skilled in the art. Selective alkylation of XXI is afforded by treatment with a strong base such as NaHMDS and an electrophile R X to give a compound of general structure XXII with high diastereoselectivity for the incorporation of R. Hydrolysis of the imide XXII can be accomplished by standard methods such as a strong base and hydrogen peroxide See Evans et al. 28 6141 6144 1987 to give a compound of general structure XXIII. The acid XXIII can converted to a compound of general structure I by methods already described herein.

In Scheme 6 a ketone of general structure XXIV which can be prepared by the methods described in Schemes 1 and 3 can be treated under strongly reducing conditions with a borohydride such as sodium borohydride to give an alcohol of general structure XXV.
