The present invention solves the above stated needs. Once an image is captured digitally a search of the image determines whether symbolic content is included in the image. If so the symbol is decoded and communication is opened with the proper database usually using the Internet wherein the best match for the symbol is returned. In some instances a symbol may be detected but non ambiguous identification is not possible. In that case and when a symbolic image can not be detected the image is decomposed through identification algorithms where unique characteristics of the image are determined. These characteristics are then used to provide the best match or matches in the data base the best determination being assisted by the partial symbolic information if that is available.

Therefore the present invention provides technology and processes that can accommodate linking objects and images to information via a network such as the Internet which requires no modification to the linked object. Traditional methods for linking objects to digital information including applying a barcode radio or optical transceiver or transmitter or some other means of identification to the object or modifying the image or object so as to encode detectable information in it are not required because the image or object can be identified solely by its visual appearance. The users or devices may even interact with objects by linking to them. For example a user may link to a vending machine by pointing and clicking on it. His device would be connected over the Internet to the company that owns the vending machine. The company would in turn establish a connection to the vending machine and thus the user would have a communication channel established with the vending machine and could interact with it.

The decomposition algorithms of the present invention allow fast and reliable detection and recognition of images and or objects based on their visual appearance in an image no matter whether shadows reflections partial obscuration and variations in viewing geometry are present. As stated above the present invention also can detect decode and identify images and objects based on traditional symbols which may appear on the object such as alphanumeric characters barcodes or 2 dimensional matrix codes.

When a particular object is identified the position and orientation of an object with respect to the user at the time the image was captured can be determined based on the appearance of the object in an image. This can be the location and or identity of people scanned by multiple cameras in a security system a passive locator system more accurate than GPS or usable in areas where GPS signals cannot be received the location of specific vehicles without requiring a transmission from the vehicle and many other uses.

When the present invention is incorporated into a mobile device such as a portable telephone the user of the device can link to images and objects in his or her environment by pointing the device at the object of interest then pointing and clicking to capture an image. Thereafter the device transmits the image to another computer Server wherein the image is analyzed and the object or image of interest is detected and recognized. Then the network address of information corresponding to that object is transmitted from the Server back to the mobile device allowing the mobile device to access information using the network address so that only a portion of the information concerning the object need be stored in the systems database.

Some or all of the image processing including image object detection and or decoding of symbols detected in the image may be distributed arbitrarily between the mobile Client device and the Server. In other words some processing may be performed in the Client device and some in the Server without specification of which particular processing is performed in each or all processing may be performed on one platform or the other or the platforms may be combined so that there is only one platform. The image processing can be implemented in a parallel computing manner thus facilitating scaling of the system with respect to database size and input traffic loading.

Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a system and process for identifying digitally captured images without requiring modification to the object.

Another object is to provide communication means with operative devices without requiring a public connection therewith.

These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art after considering the following detailed specification together with the accompanying drawings wherein 

The present invention includes a novel process whereby information such as Internet content is presented to a user based solely on a remotely acquired image of a physical object. Although coded information can be included in the remotely acquired image it is not required since no additional information about a physical object other than its image needs to be encoded in the linked object. There is no need for any additional code or device radio optical or otherwise to be embedded in or affixed to the object. Image linked objects can be located and identified within user acquired imagery solely by means of digital image processing with the address of pertinent information being returned to the device used to acquire the image and perform the link. This process is robust against digital image noise and corruption as can result from lossy image compression decompression perspective error rotation translation scale differences illumination variations caused by different lighting sources and partial obscuration of the target that results from shadowing reflection or blockage.

Many different variations on machine vision target location and identification exist in the current art. However they all tend to provide optimal solutions for an arbitrarily restricted search space. At the heart of the present invention is a high speed image matching engine that returns unambiguous matches to target objects contained in a wide variety of potential input images. This unique approach to image matching takes advantage of the fact that at least some portion of the target object will be found in the user acquired image. The parallel image comparison processes embodied in the present search technique are when taken together unique to the process. Further additional refinement of the process with the inclusion of more and or different decomposition parameterization functions utilized within the overall structure of the search loops is not restricted. The detailed process is described in the following. shows the overall processing flow and steps. These steps are described in further detail in the following sections.

For image capture the User utilizes a computer mobile telephone personal digital assistant or other similar device equipped with an image sensor such as a CCD or CMOS digital camera . The User aligns the sensor of the image capture device with the object of interest. The linking process is then initiated by suitable means including the User pressing a button on the device or sensor by the software in the device automatically recognizing that an image is to be acquired by User voice command or by any other appropriate means. The device captures a digital image of the scene at which it is pointed. This image is represented as three separate 2 D matrices of pixels corresponding to the raw RGB Red Green Blue representation of the input image. For the purposes of standardizing the analytical processes in this embodiment if the device supplies an image in other than RGB format a transformation to RGB is accomplished. These analyses could be carried out in any standard color format should the need arise.

If the server is physically separate from the device then user acquired images are transmitted from the device to the Image Processor Server using a conventional digital network or wireless network means. If the image has been compressed e.g. via lossy JPEG DCT in a manner that introduces compression artifacts into the reconstructed image these artifacts may be partially removed by for example applying a conventional despeckle filter to the reconstructed image prior to additional processing.

The Image Type Determination is accomplished with a discriminator algorithm which operates on the input image and determines whether the input image contains recognizable symbols such as barcodes matrix codes or alphanumeric characters. If such symbols are found the image is sent to the Decode Symbol process. Depending on the confidence level with which the discriminator algorithm finds the symbols the image also may or alternatively contain an object of interest and may therefore also or alternatively be sent to the Object Image branch of the process flow. For example if an input image contains both a barcode and an object depending on the clarity with which the barcode is detected the image may be analyzed by both the Object Image and Symbolic Image branches and that branch which has the highest success in identification will be used to identify and link from the object.

The image is analyzed to determine the location size and nature of the symbols in the Decode Symbol . The symbols are analyzed according to their type and their content information is extracted. For example barcodes and alphanumeric characters will result in numerical and or text information.

For object images the present invention performs a decomposition in the Input Image Decomposition of a high resolution input image into several different types of quantifiable salient parameters. This allows for multiple independent convergent search processes of the database to occur in parallel which greatly improves image match speed and match robustness in the Database Matching . The Best Match from either the Decode Symbol or the image Database Matching or both is then determined. If a specific URL or other online address is associated with the image then an URL Lookup is performed and the Internet address is returned by the URL Return .

Each of the above steps is explained in further detail below. For Radiometric Correction the input image typically is transformed to an 8 bit per color plane RGB representation. The RGB image is radiometrically normalized in all three channels. This normalization is accomplished by linear gain and offset transformations that result in the pixel values within each color channel spanning a full 8 bit dynamic range possible discrete values . An 8 bit dynamic range is adequate but of course as optical capture devices produce higher resolution images and computers get faster and memory gets cheaper higher bit dynamic ranges such as 16 bit 32 bit or more may be used.

For Segmentation the radiometrically normalized RGB image is analyzed for segments or regions of similar color i.e. near equal pixel values for red green and blue. These segments are defined by their boundaries which consist of sets of x y point pairs. A map of segment boundaries is produced which is maintained separately from the RGB input image and is formatted as an x y binary image map of the same aspect ratio as the RGB image.

For Segment Group Generation the segments are grouped into all possible combinations. These groups are known as segment groups and represent all possible potential images or objects of interest in the input image. The segment groups are sorted based on the order in which they will be evaluated. Various evaluation order schemes are possible. The particular embodiment explained herein utilizes the following center out scheme The first segment group comprises only the segment that includes the center of the image. The next segment group comprises the previous segment plus the segment which is the largest in number of pixels and which is adjacent to touching the previous segment group. Additional segments are added using the segment criteria above until no segments remain. Each step in which a new segment is added creates a new and unique segment group.

For Bounding Box Generation the elliptical major axis of the segment group under consideration the major axis of an ellipse just large enough to contain the entire segment group is computed. Then a rectangle is constructed within the image coordinate system with long sides parallel to the elliptical major axis of a size just large enough to completely contain every pixel in the segment group.

For Geometric Normalization a copy of the input image is modified such that all pixels not included in the segment group under consideration are set to mid level gray. The result is then resampled and mapped into a standard aspect output test image space such that the corners of the bounding box are mapped into the corners of the output test image. The standard aspect is the same size and aspect ratio as the Reference images used to create the database.

For Wavelet Decomposition a grayscale representation of the full color image is produced from the geometrically normalized image that resulted from the Geometric Normalization step. The following procedure is used to derive the grayscale representation. Reduce the three color planes into one grayscale image by proportionately adding each R G and B pixel of the standard corrected color image using the following formula 0.34 0.55 0.44 

then round to nearest integer value. Truncate at 0 and 255 if necessary. The resulting matrix L is a standard grayscale image. This grayscale representation is at the same spatial resolution as the full color image with an 8 bit dynamic range. A multi resolution Wavelet Decomposition of the grayscale image is performed yielding wavelet coefficients for several scale factors. The Wavelet coefficients at various scales are ranked according to their weight within the image.

For Color Cube Decomposition an image segmentation is performed see Segmentation above on the RGB image that results from Geometric Normalization. Then the RGB image is transformed to a normalized Intensity In phase and Quadrature phase color image YIQ . The segment map is used to identify the principal color regions of the image since each segment boundary encloses pixels of similar color. The average Y I and Q values of each segment and their individual component standard deviations are computed. The following set of parameters result representing the colors color variation and size for each segment 

The parameters comprise a representation of the color intensity and variation in each segment. When taken together for all segments in a segment group these parameters comprise points or more accurately regions if the standard deviations are taken into account in a three dimensional color space and describe the intensity and variation of color in the segment group.

For Shape Decomposition the map resulting from the segmentation performed in the Color Cube Generation step is used and the segment group is evaluated to extract the group outer edge boundary the total area enclosed by the boundary and its area centroid. Additionally the net ellipticity semi major axis divided by semi minor axis of the closest fit ellipse to the group is determined.

For Low Resolution Grayscale Image Generation the full resolution grayscale representation of the image that was derived in the Wavelet Generation step is now subsampled by a factor in both x and y directions. For the example of this embodiment a 3 1 subsampling is assumed. The subsampled image is produced by weighted averaging of pixels within each 3 3 cell. The result is contrast binned by reducing the number of discrete values assignable to each pixel based upon substituting a binned average value for all pixels that fall within a discrete TBD number of brightness bins.

The above discussion of the particular decomposition methods incorporated into this embodiment are not intended to indicate that more or alternate decomposition methods may not also be employed within the context of this invention.

This loop considers each combination of segment groups in the input image in the order in which they were sorted in the Segment Group Generation step. Each segment group as it is considered is a candidate for the object of interest in the image and it is compared against database objects using various tests.

One favored implementation of many possible for the order in which the segment groups are considered within this loop is the center out approach mentioned previously in the Segment Group Generation section. This scheme considers segment groups in a sequence that represents the addition of adjacent segments to the group starting at the center of the image. In this scheme each new group that is considered comprises the previous group plus one additional adjacent image segment. The new group is compared against the database. If the new group results in a higher database matching score than the previous group then new group is retained. If the new group has a lower matching score then the previous group then it is discarded and the loop starts again. If a particular segment group results in a match score which is extremely high then this is considered to be an exact match and no further searching is warranted in this case the current group and matching database group are selected as the match and this loop is exited.

This loop considers each object in the database for comparison against the current input segment group.

This loop considers each view of the current database object for comparison against the current input segment group. The database contains for each object multiple views from different viewing angles.

This loop considers each combination of segment groups in the current view of the database object. These segment groups were created in the same manner as the input image segment groups.

V. Identify those database segment groups with an area approximately equal to that of the input segment group within TBD limits and calculate an area matching score for each of these matches. 

VI. Within the set of matches identified in the previous step identify those database segment groups with an ellipticity approximately equal to that of the input segment group within TBD limits and calculate an ellipticity position matching score for each of these matches. 

Within the set of matches identified in the previous step identify those database segment groups with a centroid position approximately equal to that of the input segment group within TBD limits and calculate a centroid position matching score for each of these matches. 

VIII. Within the set of matches identified in the previous step identify those database segment groups with an outline shape approximately equal to that of the input segment group within TBD limits and calculate an outline matching score for each of these matches. This is done by comparing the two outlines and analytically determining the extent to which they match.

Note this algorithm need not necessarily be performed in the order of Steps to . It could alternatively proceed as follows 

IX. Low resolution normalized contrast binned grayscale image of pixels within segment group bounding box with pixels outside of the segment group set to a standard background color.

Given a series of concentric rectangular tiers of pixels within the low resolution images compare the input image pixel values to those of all database images. Calculate a matching score for each comparison and identify those database images with matching scores within TBD limits as follows 

Successively compare the wavelet coefficients of the input segment group image and each database segment group image starting with the lowest order coefficients and progressing to the highest order coefficients. For each comparison compute a matching score. For each new coefficient only consider those database groups that had matching scores at the previous next lower order coefficient within TBD limits.

The four Object Image comparisons Shape Comparison Grayscale Comparison Wavelet Comparison Color Cube Comparison each return a normalized matching score. These are independent assessments of the match of salient features of the input image to database images. To minimize the effect of uncertainties in any single comparison process and to thus minimize the likelihood of returning a false match the following root sum of squares relationship is used to combine the results of the individual comparisons into a combined match score for an image CurrentMatch SQRT where Ws are TBD parameter weighting coefficients and Ms are the individual match scores of the four different comparisons.

The unique database search methodology and subsequent object match scoring criteria are novel aspects of the present invention that deserve special attention. Each decomposition of the Reference image and Input image regions represent an independent characterization of salient characteristics of the image. The Wavelet Decomposition Color Cube Decomposition Shape Decomposition and evaluation of a sub sampled low resolution Grayscale representation of an input image all produce sets of parameters that describe the image in independent ways. Once all four of these processes are completed on the image to be tested the parameters provided by each characterization are compared to the results of identical characterizations of the Reference images which have been previously calculated and stored in the database. These comparisons or searches are carried out in parallel. The result of each search is a numerical score that is a weighted measure of the number of salient characteristics that match i.e. that are statistically equivalent . Near equivalencies are also noted and are counted in the cumulative score but at a significantly reduced weighting.

One novel aspect of the database search methodology in the present invention is that not only are these independent searches carried out in parallel but also all but the low resolution grayscale compares are convergent. By convergent it is meant that input image parameters are searched sequentially over increasingly smaller subsets of the entire database. The parameter carrying greatest weight from the input image is compared first to find statistical matches and near matches in all database records. A normalized interim score e.g. scaled value from zero to one where one is perfect match and zero is no match is computed based on the results of this comparison. The next heaviest weighted parameter from the input image characterization is then searched on only those database records having initial interim scores above a minimum acceptable threshold value. This results in an incremental score that is incorporated into the interim score in a cumulative fashion. Then subsequent compares of increasingly lesser weighted parameters are assessed only on those database records that have cumulative interim scores above the same minimum acceptable threshold value in the previous accumulated set of tests.

This search technique results in quick completion of robust matches and establishes limits on the domain of database elements that will be compared in a subsequent combined match calculation and therefore speeds up the process. The convergent nature of the search in these comparisons yields a ranked subset of the entire database.

The result of each of these database comparisons is a ranking of the match quality of each image as a function of decomposition search technique. Only those images with final cumulative scores above the acceptable match threshold will be assessed in the next step a Combined Match Score evaluation.

Four database comparison processes Shape Comparison Grayscale Comparison Wavelet Comparison and Color Cube Comparison are performed. These processes may occur sequentially but generally are preferably performed in parallel on a parallel computing platform. Each comparison technique searches the entire image database and returns those images that provide the best matches for the particular algorithm along with the matching scores for these images. These comparison algorithms are performed on segment groups with each input image segment group being compared to each segment group for each database image.

Preferably parallel processing is used to divide tasks between multiple CPUs Central Processing Units and or computers. The overall algorithm may be divided in several ways such as 

Actual implementations can be some combination of the above techniques that optimizes the process on the available hardware.

Another technique employed to maximize speed is data indexing. This technique involves using a priori knowledge of where data resides to only search in those parts of the database that contain potential matches. Various forms of indexing may be used such as hash tables data compartmentalization i.e. data within certain value ranges are stored in certain locations data sorting and database table indexing. An example of such techniques is in the Shape Comparison algorithm see below if a database is to be searched for an entry with an Area with a value of A the algorithm would know which database entries or data areas have this approximate value and would not need to search the entire database.

Another technique employed is as follows. shows a simplified configuration of the invention. Boxes with solid lines represent processes software physical objects or devices. Boxes with dashed lines represent information. The process begins with an object of interest the target object . In the case of consumer applications the target object could be for example beverage can a music CD box a DVD video box a magazine advertisement a poster a theatre a store a building a car or any other object that user is interested in or wishes to interact with. In security applications the target object could be for example a person passport or driver s license etc. In industrial applications the target object could be for example a part in a machine a part on an assembly line a box in a warehouse or a spacecraft in orbit etc.

The terminal is a computing device that has an image capture device such as digital camera a video camera or any other device that an convert a physical object into a digital representation of the object. The imagery can be a single image a series of images or a continuous video stream. For simplicity of explanation this document describes the digital imagery generally in terms of a single image however the invention and this system can use all of the imagery types described above.

After the camera captures the digital imagery of the target object image preprocessing software converts the digital imagery into image data for transmission to and analysis by an identification server . Typically a network connection is provided capable of providing communications with the identification server . Image data is data extracted or converted from the original imagery of the target object and has information content appropriate for identification of the target object by the object recognition which may be software or hardware. Image data can take many forms depending on the particular embodiment of the invention. Examples of image data are 

Key image information such as spectral and or spatial frequency components e.g. wavelet components of the raw imagery from camera and

The particular form of the image data and the particular operations performed in image preprocessing depend on 

In general there is a tradeoff between the network connection speed between terminal and identification server and the processing power of terminal . The results all of the above tradeoffs will define the nature of image preprocessing and image data for a specific embodiment. For example image preprocessing could be image compression and image data compressed imagery or image preprocessing could be wavelet analysis and image data could be wavelet coefficients.

The image data is sent from the terminal to the identification server . The identification server receives the image data and passes it to the object recognition .

The identification server is a set of functions that usually will exist on computing platform separate from the terminal but could exist on the same computing platform. If the identification server exists on a separate computing device such as a computer in a data center then the transmission of the image components to the identification server is accomplished via a network or combination of networks such a cellular telephone network wireless Internet Internet and wire line network. If the identification server exists on the same computing device as the terminal then the transmission consists simply of a transfer of data from one software component or process to another.

Placing the identification server on a computing platform separate from the terminal enables the use of powerful computing resources for the object recognition and database functions thus providing the power of these computing resources to the terminal via network connection. For example an embodiment that identifies objects out of a database of millions of known objects would be facilitated by the large storage memory capacity and processing power available in a data center it may not be feasible to have such computing power and storage in a mobile device. Whether the terminal and the identification server are on the same computing platform or separate ones is an architectural decision that depends on system response time number of database records image recognition algorithm computing power and storage available in terminal etc. and this decision must be made for each embodiment of the invention. Based on current technology in most embodiments these functions will be on separate computing platforms.

The overall function of the identification server is to determine and provide the target object information corresponding to the target object based on the image data .

3. Provide the target object information that corresponds to the target object . The target object information usually depending on the embodiment includes an information address corresponding to the target object .

The object recognition detects and decodes symbols such as barcodes or text in the input image. This is accomplished via algorithms software and or hardware components suited for this task. Such components are commercially available The HALCON software package from MVTec is an example . The object recognition also detects and recognizes images of the target object or portions thereof. This is accomplished by analyzing the image data and comparing the results to other data representing images of a plurality of known objects stored in the database and recognizing the target object if a representation of target object is stored in the database .

In some embodiments the terminal includes software such as a web browser the browser that receives an information address connects to that information address via a network or networks such as the Internet and exchanges information with another computing device at that information address. In consumer applications the terminal may be a portable cellular telephone or Personal Digital Assistant equipped with a camera and wireless Internet connection. In security and industrial applications the terminal may be a similar portable hand held device or may be fixed in location and or orientation and may have either a wireless or wire line network connection.

Other object recognition techniques also exist and include methods that store 3 dimensional models rather than 2 dimensional images of objects in a database and correlate input images with these models of the target object is performed by an object recognition technique of which many are available commercially and in the prior art. Such object recognition techniques usually consist of comparing a new input image to a plurality of known images and detecting correspondences between the new input image and one of more of the known images. The known images are views of known objects from a plurality of viewing angles and thus allow recognition of 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional objects in arbitrary orientations relative to the camera .

There are various options for the object recognition technique and the particular processes performed within the object recognition and the database depend on this choice. The choice depends on the nature requirements and architecture of the particular embodiment of the invention. However most embodiments will usually share most of the following desired attributes of the image recognition technique 

Capable of discriminating the target object from any foreground or background objects or image information i.e. be robust with respect to changes in background 

Scalable able to identify objects from a large database of known objects with short response time and

Capable of recognizing individual human faces from a database containing data representing a large plurality of human faces.

All of these attributes do not apply to all embodiments. For example consumer linking embodiments generally do not require determination of position and orientation of the target object while a spacecraft target position and orientation determination system generally would not be required to identify human faces or a large number of different objects.

It is usually desirable that the database be scalable to enable identification of the target object from a very large plurality for example millions of known objects in the database . The algorithms software and computing hardware must be designed to function together to quickly perform such a search. An example software technique for performing such searching quickly is to use a metric distance comparison technique for comparing the image data to data stored in the database along with database clustering and multiresolution distance comparisons. This technique is described in Fast Exhaustive Multi Resolution Search Algorithm Based on Clustering for Efficient Image Retrieval by Song Kim and Ra 2000.

In addition to such software techniques a parallel processing computing architecture may be employed to achieve fast searching of large databases. Parallel processing is particularly important in cases where a non metric distance is used in object recognition because techniques such database clustering and multiresolution search may not be possible and thus the complete database must be searched by partitioning the database across multiple CPUs.

As described above the object recognition can also detect identifying marks on the target object . For example the target object may include an identifying number or a barcode. This information can be decoded and used to identify or help identify the target object in the database . This information also can be passed on as part of the target object information . If the information is included as part of the target object information then it can be used by the terminal or content server to identify the specific target object out of many such objects that have similar appearance and differ only in the identifying marks. This technique is useful for example in cases where the target object is an active device with a network connection such as a vending machine and the content server establishes communication with the target object . A combination with a Global Positioning System can also be used to identify like objects by their location.

The object recognition may be implemented in hardware software or a combination of both. Examples of each category are presented below.

Hardware object recognition implementations include optical correlators optimized computing platforms and custom hardware.

Optical correlators detect objects in images very rapidly by in effect performing image correlation calculations with light. Examples of optical correlators are 

Hybrid Digital Optical Correlator from the School of Engineering and Information Technology University of Sussex UK and

Optimized computing platforms are hardware computing systems usually on a single board that are optimized to perform image processing and recognition algorithms very quickly. These platforms must be programmed with the object recognition algorithm of choice. Examples of optimized computing platforms are 

Image recognition calculations can also be implemented directly in custom hardware in forms such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits ASICs Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs and Digital Signal Processors DSPs .

There are many object and image recognition software applications available commercially and many algorithms published in the literature. Examples of commercially available image object recognition software packages include 

Some of the above recognition systems include 3 dimensional object recognition capability while others perform 2 dimensional image recognition. The latter type are used to perform 3 dimensional object recognition by comparing input images to a plurality of 2 dimensional views of objects from a plurality of viewing angles.

Examples of object recognition algorithms in the literature and intended for implementation in software are 

SEEMORE Combining Color Shape and Texture Histogramming in a Neurally Inspired Approach to Visual Object Recognition Mel 1996 

Part of the current invention is the following object recognition algorithm specifically designed to be used as the object recognition and to some extent the database . This algorithm is robust with respect to occlusions reflections shadows background foreground clutter object deformation and breaking and is scalable to large databases. The task of the algorithm is to find an object or portion thereof in an input image given a database of multiple objects with multiple views from different angles of each object.

This algorithm uses the concept of a Local Image Descriptor LID to summarize the information in a local region of an image. A LID is a circular subset or cutout of a portion of an image. There are various formulations for LIDs two examples are 

The area within the LID is divided into range and angle bins. The average color in each range angle bin is calculated from the pixel values therein.

The area within the LID is divided into range bins. The color histogram values within each range bin are calculated from the pixel values therein. For each range bin a measure of the variation of color with angle is calculated as for example the sum of the changes in average color between adjacent small angular slices of a range bin.

A LID in the input image is compared to a LID in a database image by a comparison technique such the L1 Distance L2 Distance Unfolded Distance Earth Mover Distance or cross correlation. Small distances indicate a good match between the portions of the images underlying the LIDS. By iteratively changing the position and size of the LIDs in the input and database images the algorithm converges on the best match between circular regions in the 2 images.

Limiting the comparisons to subsets circular LIDs of the images enables the algorithm to discriminate an object from the background. Only LIDs that fall on the object as opposed to the background yield good matches with database images. This technique also enable matching of partially occluded objects a LID that falls on the visible part of an occluded object will match to a LID in the corresponding location in the database image of the object.

The iteration technique used to find the best match is simulated annealing although genetic search steepest descent or other similar techniques appropriate for multivariable optimization can also be used individually or in combination with simulated annealing. Simulated annealing is modeled after the concept of a molten substance cooling and solidifying into a solid. The algorithm starts at a given temperature and then the temperature is gradually reduced with time. At each time step the values of the search variables are perturbed from the their previous values to a create a new child generation of LIDs. The perturbations are calculated statistically and their magnitudes are functions of the temperature. As the temperature decreases the perturbations decrease in size. The child LIDs in the input and database images are then compared. If the match is better than that obtained with the previous parent generation then a statistical decision is made regarding to whether to accept or reject the child LIDs as the current best match. This is a statistical decision that is a function of both the match distance and the temperature. The probability of child acceptance increases with temperature and decreases with match distance. Thus good matches small match distance are more likely to be accepted but poor matches can also be accepted occasionally. The latter case is more likely to occur early in the process when the temperature is high. Statistical acceptance of poor matches is included to allow the algorithm to jump out of local minima.

When LID Formulation 1 is used the rotation angle of the LID need not necessarily be a simulated annealing search parameter. Faster convergence can be obtained by performing a simple step wise search on rotation to find the best orientation within the tolerance of the step size within each simulated annealing time step.

LID x stretch and LID y stretch are measures of stretch distortion applied to the LID circle and measure the distortion of the circle into an oval. This is included to provide robustness to differences in orientation and curvature between the input and database images.

The use of multiple simultaneous LIDs provides additional robustness to occlusions shadows reflections rotations deformations and object breaking. The best matches for multiple input image LIDS are sought throughout the database images. The input image LIDS are restricted to remain at certain minimum separation distances from each other. The minimum distance between any 2 LIDs centers is a function of the LID radii. The input image LIDS converge and settle on the regions of the input image having the best correspondence to any regions of any database images. Thus the LIDs behave in the manner of marbles rolling towards the lowest spot on a surface e.g. the bottom of a bowl but being held apart by their radius although LIDS generally have minimum separation distances that are less than their radii .

In cases where the object in the input image appears deformed or curved relative to the known configuration in which it appears in the database multiple input image LIDS will match to different database images. Each input image LID will match to that database image which shows the underlying portion of the object as it most closely resembles the input image. If the input image object is bent e.g. a curved poster then one part will match to one database orientation and another part will match to a different orientation.

In the case where the input image object appears to be broken into multiple pieces either due to occlusion or to physical breakage use of multiple LIDs again provides robust matching individual LIDs settle on portions of the input image object as they match to corresponding portions of the object in various views in the database.

Robustness with respect to shadows and reflections is provided by LIDs simply not detecting good matches on these input image regions. They are in effect accommodated in the same manner as occlusions.

Robustness with respect to curvature and bending is accommodated by multiple techniques. First use of multiple LIDs provides such robustness as described above. Secondly curvature and bending robustness is inherently provided to some extent within each LID by use of LID range bin sizes that increase with distance from the LID center e.g. logarithmic spacing . Given matching points in an input image and database image deformation of the input image object away from the plane tangent at the matching point increases with distance from the matching point. The larger bin sizes of the outer bins in both range and angle reduce this sensitivity because they are less sensitive to image shifts.

Robustness with respect to lighting color temperature variations is provided by normalization of each color channel within each LID.

Fast performance particular with large databases can be obtained through several techniques as follows 

1. Use of LID Formulation 2 can reduce the amount of search by virtue of being rotationally invariant although this comes at the cost of some robustness due to loss of image information.

2. If a metric distance e.g. L1 L2 or Unfolded is used for LID comparison then database clustering based on the triangle inequality can be used to rule out large portions of the database from searching. Since database LIDs are created during the execution of the algorithm the run time database LIDs are not clustered. Rather during preparation of the database sample LIDs are created from the database images by sampling the search parameters throughout their valid ranges. From this data bounding clusters can be created for each image and for portions of images. With this information the search algorithm can rule out portions of the search parameter space.

3. If a metric distance is used then progressive multiresolution search can be used. This technique saves time by comparing data first at low resolution and only proceeds with successive higher resolution comparison on candidates with correlations better than the current best match. A discussion of this technique along with database clustering can be found in Fast Exhaustive Multi Resolution Search Algorithm Based on Clustering for Efficient Image Retrieval by Song et al 2000.

4. The parameter search space and number of LIDs can be limited. Bounds can be placed for example on the sizes of LIDs depending on the expected sizes of input image objects relative to those in the database. A small number of LIDs even 1 can be used at the expense of some robustness.

5. LIDs can be fixed in the database images. This eliminates iterative searching on database LID parameters at the expense of some robustness.

6. The x stretch and y stretch search parameters can be eliminated although there is a trade off between these search parameters and the number of database images. These parameters increase the ability to match between images of the same object in different orientations. Elimination of these parameters may require more database images with closer angular spacing depending on the particular embodiment.

This technique is similar to that described by Betke Makris in Fast Object Recognition in Noisy Images Using Simulated Annealing 1994 with the following important distinctions 

The current algorithm is robust with respect to occlusion. This is made possible by varying size and position of LIDs in database images during the search process in order to match non occluded portions of database images.

The current algorithm can identify 3 dimensional objects by containing views of objects from many orientations in the database.

In addition to containing image information the database also contains address information. After the target object has been identified the database is searched to find information corresponding to the target object . This information can be an information address such as an Internet URL. The identification server then sends this information in the form of the target object information to the terminal . Depending on the particular embodiment of the invention the target object information may include but not be limited to one or more of the following items of information pertaining to the target object 

Information decoded from and or referenced by symbols e.g. information coded in a barcode or a URL referenced by such a barcode and

Thus the identification server determines the identity and or various attributes of the target object from the image data .

The target object information is sent to the terminal . This information usually flows via the same communication path used to send the image data from the terminal to the identification server but this is not necessarily the case. This method of this flow information depends on the particular embodiment of the invention.

The terminal receives the target object information . The terminal then performs some action or actions based on the target object information . This action or actions may include but not be limited to
