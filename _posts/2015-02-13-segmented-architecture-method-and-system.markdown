title: Segmented architecture method and system
abstract: A method and system for segmented architecture for managing access to electronic documents having private data and public data is disclosed herein. A request for an electronic document is sent to a segmentation server, and the request becomes two queries: one for the public or non-confidential data of the electronic document and one for the private or confidential data of the electronic document. The segmentation server determines if the request is made over a private network or a public network to determine whether private data should be sent in response to the request.

Having briefly described the present invention the above and further objects features and advantages thereof will be recognized by those skilled in the pertinent art from the following detailed description of the invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

As shown in an individual is within an office of an enterprise at a computer accessing documents. The individual requests an electronic document . The request is sent to a patron server and becomes two queries one for the public or non confidential data of the electronic document and one for the private or confidential data of the electronic document . The segmentation server determines if the request was made over a private network of the enterprise or if the request was made over public network. The public data which is preferably a subset of the electronic document is sent to the computer since it is public data and non confidential. For the segmentation server determines that the request was sent over a private network and the patron server delivers the private data of the electronic document as shown in . In this example the public information is the project data while the private information is the budget data and salary data of the electronic document .

As shown in an individual is within an Internet caf a public forum. This is an unsecured site. The individual sends a request for an electronic document . The request is sent to a segmentation server and becomes two queries one for the public or non confidential data of the electronic document and one for the private or confidential data of the electronic document. The segmentation server determines if the request was made over a private network of the enterprise or if the request was made over public network. The public data which is preferably a subset of the electronic document is sent to the computer since it is public data and non confidential. For the segmentation server determines that the request was from a public network so only public data is transmitted to the individual as shown in . The segmentation server may also send a message informing the individual that the request for the full electronic document was denied. In this example the public information is the project data

An embodiment of a method for managing access to private information in an electronic document consisting of both private information and public information is shown in . A request for an electric document e document is sent from a request site at block . The data within the e document is both public and private data the private data having a first privacy level for an enterprise. The request is preferably sent to a patron server. The request becomes two queries one for the public or non confidential data of the electronic document and one for the private or confidential data of the electronic document. At block the privacy distribution level is determined for the request site. The privacy level assignment controls accessibility to private and or highly confidential information contained within an e document. The determination is preferably made at a patron server. The patron server determines if the request was made over a private network of the enterprise or if the request was made over public network. The public data which is preferably a subset of the electronic document is sent to the data capable communication device since it is public data and non confidential. At block the patron server determines that the request was sent over a private network preferably the request is made from within the enterprise since the data accessible at a first privacy level is qualified to be accessible at the privacy distribution level of the request site. At block the e document containing both public and private data is generated at the request site since the request was sent over a private network within the enterprise and the data is accessible at the first privacy level for the enterprise.

Another embodiment of a method for managing access to private information in an electronic document consisting of both private information and public information is shown in . A request for an e document is sent from a request site at block . The data within the e document is both public and private data the private data having a first privacy level for an enterprise. The request is preferably sent to a patron server. The request becomes two queries one for the public or non confidential data of the electronic document and one for the private or confidential data of the electronic document. At block the privacy distribution level is determined for the request site. The determination is preferably made at a patron server. The patron server determines if the request was made over a private network of the enterprise or if the request was made over public network. The public data which is preferably a subset of the electronic document is sent to the data capable communication device since it is public data and non confidential. Then at block the data accessible at a first privacy level is determined not to be accessible at the privacy distribution level of a request site since the request was sent over a public network. At block since the privacy levels did not correspond as the request site did not have the appropriate privacy level assignment the e document generated on the data capable communication device at the request site only contains publicly accessible data.

One way of determining if a request is made over a private or public network is to analyze an IP address transmitted with the request. If the IP address is recognized as being an IP address of the enterprise then the segmentation server determines that request is made over a private network. If the IP address is not recognized as being an IP address of the enterprise then the segmentation server determines that request is made over a public network.

The request for the electronic document is sent to the patron server which accesses a database containing the electronic document . Preferably the request is sent as two different requests one for the public data of the electronic document and if applicable one for the private data of the electronic document.

The public data which is preferably a subset of the electronic document is sent to the data capable communication device since the public data is public data and non confidential. If the segmentation server determines that the request was sent over a private network preferably the request is made from within the enterprise then the private data of the electronic document is retrieved from the database since the data accessible at a first privacy level is qualified to be accessible at the privacy distribution level of the request site. The electronic document containing both public and private data is sent to the segmentation server and then generated on the client device since the request was sent over a private network within the enterprise and the data is accessible at the first privacy level for the enterprise.

From the foregoing it is believed that those skilled in the pertinent art will recognize the meritorious advancement of this invention and will readily understand that while the present invention has been described in association with a preferred embodiment thereof and other embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings numerous changes modification and substitutions of equivalents may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention which is intended to be unlimited by the foregoing except as may appear in the following appended claim. Therefore the embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined in the following appended claims.
