In C RAN the cooperation among cells is important because it can greatly help to reduce ICI. C RAN may require integrated packet scheduling and ICI solutions to optimise the benefits of the system architecture shown in .

In order to solve the problem of ICI in a LTE system the present disclosure provides a method involving allocating resources to users in adjacent cells of a cell cluster utilising a resource restriction strategy based on allocation priorities assigned to each cell. The solution comprises the following steps a classifying users in each of adjacent cells in a cellular communication network into cell edge users and cell centre users b determining allocation priorities for each of the adjacent cells and c allocating resources to the users in each of the adjacent cells based on the allocation priorities except that resources allocated to cell edge users in one of the adjacent cells are restricted from use by other adjacent cells having lower allocation priorities.

The method may be applied to any C RAN network. Under practical conditions the method reduces or eliminates ICI whilst also providing good and fair packet scheduling within each cell of a cell cluster. The method may be explained with reference to a cluster comprising C cells with centralized control in which all available radio resource blocks RBs are used at least once e.g. C 3 cells during a configured allocation period interval. The cluster of 3 cells shown in is merely an example but not intended as limiting on the method of the disclosure. Persons skilled in the art will readily appreciate and understand that the number of cells in each cluster is set by a planning and optimization team within a mobile network operator.

Step a may be carried out based on reference signal strengths of each of the users as follows. For each user in a cell the eNodeB with the greatest pilot signal is the serving cell. For each transmit time interval TTI or a configured window interval period P users in a cell cluster are divided into CC users or CE users based on signal to interference noise ratio SINR reported by the users. For example if the pilot signal or SINR of a serving cell reported by a user A is greater than pilot signal strengths or SINR of other cells by a threshold amount delta which can be set by the mobile network operator or according to an algorithm the cell coordination scheduler of the base station server may consider the user A as a CC user. On the other hand if the pilot signal or SINR of a serving cell reported by a user B is not greater than pilot signal strengths or SINR of other cells by the threshold amount delta the cell coordination scheduler of the base station server may consider the user B as a CE user.

In an alternative example when another user C respectively receives 2 or more pilot signals from 2 or more cells with nearly equal signal strength the cell coordination scheduler of the base station server may consider this user C as a CE user.

As shown in the eNodeBs in the cluster of 3 cells are communicatively connected to the base station server and are also centrally controlled by the base station server . is an exemplary schematic illustrating radio resource blocks respectively allocated to CE UEs in cells C C C in the cluster . There are 50 radio resource blocks RB RB . . . RB in a configured bandwidth for example 100 MHz. The base station clients and are deployed respectively at antenna locations A A and A in and base station clients and correspond to BBUs which are all managed by the same cell coordination scheduler . For example the BBUs connected to the base station clients and may first receive channel quality metrics such as Channel Quality Indicator CQI and Reference Signal Receive Power RSRP of all UEs from the base station clients and then report all channel quality metrics of all UEs in the cluster to the cell coordination scheduler .

The resource allocation to users in adjacent cells utilising a restriction strategy based on allocation priorities assigned to each cell shown in is explained below with reference to the cluster shown in . It is assumed that step a noted above has been executed previously. The determination of CC UEs and CE UEs in each cell in the cluster may be performed with a configured window interval period P longer than a resource allocation period.

After performance of step a the base station server can allocate RBs to CC UE s and CE UE s in each cell of the cluster consecutively. In operation the BBU corresponding to the cells C C C can allocate resource blocks to CC UEs and CE UEs in cells C C C consecutively during the resource allocation period. In an alternative embodiment the cell coordination scheduler of the base station server may allocate resource blocks to CC UEs and CE UEs in cells C C C simultaneously during the resource allocation period.

The cell coordination scheduler or the BBU corresponding to the cells C C and C may perform steps b and c together as explained below. First the cell coordination scheduler or the relevant BBU determines allocation priorities for each of the adjacent cells. In the allocation priority is C has a highest allocation priority followed by C and C. The relevant BBU or the cell coordination scheduler then allocates RBs to the highest allocation priority cell C. Radio resource blocks RB corresponding to label C shown in are the resource blocks allocated to the CE UEs in the cell C. The cell C has a lower allocation priority than that of cell C but higher than that of cell C. Therefore when the resource blocks are allocated to the CE UEs in the cell C the resource blocks allocated to the cell C are restricted resource blocks. In other words the CE UEs in the cell C will not be allocated with the resource blocks already allocated to the CE UEs in the cell C. Similarly when the resource blocks are allocated to the CE UEs in the cell C the resource blocks allocated to the cells C and C are restricted resource blocks. The resource blocks allocated to the cell C are the ones with sectioned pattern such as radio resource block RB. Therefore the CE UEs in the cell C will not be allocated with the resource blocks already allocated to the cells C and C. Finally in the present resource allocation period the CE UEs in the cell C are allocated with radio resource blocks with checked patterns such as radio resource block RB.

After steps b and c the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU changes the allocation priorities of cells C C C in the cluster . The change may be for example rotating the allocation priority ranks of cells C C C in the cluster . In an alternative embodiment the change may be performed along with a resource allocation algorithm such that the UE with metrics corresponding to a longer waiting period or more urgent downlink data transmission can be assigned a higher allocation priority.

The base station server can be considered as a Digital Unit DU or a DU cloud which controls all cells within a cluster. The base station server collects feedback report information from users UEs and decides how to allocate radio resources to each UE. Resource block RB in the present disclosure is the same as PRB Physical RB or a pair of RB . In all embodiments of the present disclosure CC UEs in each cell may use radio resource block already allocated to CE UE in other cells.

The cell coordination scheduler or the BBU corresponding to cells in a cluster may allocate the RBs to CC UEs and CE UEs according to a packet scheduling algorithm which performs an intra cell resource allocation for example Max rate MR Proportional Fair PF Modified Largest Weighted Delay First M LWDF Algorithm Exponential Rule Algorithm EXP Quality Driven Scheduling Q DS Algorithm Robust and QoS Driven Scheduling RQ DS .

For example a PF algorithm can be modified as an intra cell radio resource algorithm C for allocating RBs to CC users and CE users in each cell of a cluster according to the following mathematical expressions 1 2 3 4 5 

In the mathematical expressions 1 5 shown above the parameter i refers to user i the parameter j refers to jth RB t is the priority of user i on RB j at time t r t is the instantaneous data rate of user i on RB j at time t R t is the average throughput of user i at time t tis a time constant rtot t 1 is the total data rate being used to transmit packets to user i at time t 1 l t 1 is the indicator function of the event that packets of user i are selected for transmission on RB j at time t 1 RBis the maximum available number of RBs for CC users and RBis the maximum available number of RBs for CE users. In the present disclosure t of the mathematical expression 1 can be used for calculating metrics of a UE according to its reported channel state information.

In addition to the aforementioned PF algorithm proposed for the major step b on allocating radio resource to CC users and CE users in each cell in the cluster by the cell coordination scheduler there is proposed another Algorithm C for wireless communication system conforming 3GPP LTE Advanced standard. The Algorithm C is an additional algorithm that is better suited to a 3GPP LTE Advanced communication system when there are multiple component carriers or carrier aggregation is supported in the system.

The Algorithm C can be used as an intra cell radio resource algorithm for scheduling packet allocate radio resource blocks similar to Optimized Cross Component Carrier M LWDF algorithm. The algorithm C can be used by the cell coordination scheduler to allocate RBs to all UEs in a cell cells in the cluster at the same time. This Algorithm C can support real time RT and non RT services as well as support 3GPP LTE Advanced system or wireless communication system with multiple component carriers.

The base station server is used as a centralized scheduler in the Algorithm C and the cell coordination scheduler can control the whole bandwidth of all component carriers and compute the metrics of all users UEs in each cell in the cluster using the mathematical expressions 6 7 8 below and then make the decision for packet scheduling resource allocation.

In the mathematical expressions 6 7 W t is the Head of Line HOL packet delay of user i at time t is the delay threshold of user i before the first HOL packet of user i is transmitted in downlink denotes the maximum probability for HOL packet delay of user i to exceed the delay threshold of user i Nis the number of CCs on which packet can be transmitted to the user i in downlink r t is the instantaneous achievable data rate of user i on the kth component carrier at the jRB Ris total average data rate of user i in all CCs as defined in following 

In the mathematical expression 7 can be regarded as service dependant buffer delay threshold of the user i can be regarded as service dependant packet loss rate threshold of user i. As such Win the mathematical expression 6 can be regarded as quality of service QoS requirement of bearer for user i. Also the resultant parameter Min the mathematical expression 6 includes the above mentioned QoS requirement of bearer for the user UE i and the priority of the user UE i on radio resource block j at time t. Therefore the resultant parameter Mcan be used in calculating metrics of an active user UE i according channel state information fed back from the active UE i the amount of data waiting to be transmitted to each active UE i and a head of line packet delay of the active UE i.

In the mathematical expression 8 r t is the total instantaneous data rate in all assigned RBs in all CCs of the user i in previous time slot that had been transmitted. Also in the mathematical expression 7 may represent urgency of a packet transmission to the user i related to QoS. The delay threshold may represent how much more time the packet for the user i has to wait before transmission in downlink.

When the Algorithm C is applied in a wireless communication system with only a single carrier then the parameter k in previous expression 6 can be omitted.

In order to meet stringent QoS requirements of some traffic types for example voice over Internet Protocol VoIP packets and packets for re transmission due to hybrid automatic repeat request HARQ can be assigned with higher priority rank in the intra cell resource allocation process. For example in order to meet time sensitive requirement of VoIP a pre configured percentage of CC RBs can be allocated to CC users using VoIP only. On the other hand for VoIP users located in CE region of each cell the VoIP packets can be allocated with RBs before other traffic types of other users in CE area of that cell.

The following paragraphs provide a detailed description of inter cell radio resource allocation and intra cell radio resource allocation in accordance with . In it is assumed that cells C C and C are managed by the BBU of the base station server . In the illustrative example below it is also assumed that the allocation priority rank in the cluster has been determined as C C C by the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU for the present allocation period or the present TTI. Therefore the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU performs i the intra cell resource allocation for cell C then ii performs intra cell resource allocation for cell C having regard to resource restrictions determined at step i and finally iii performs intra cell resource allocation for cell C having regard to resource restrictions determined at steps i and ii for the present TTI.

There are 2 active UEs in the cell C in the present resource allocation period or the present TTI. The active UEs refer to UEs to which there are downlink data waiting to be transmitted. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there may be other UEs in the service coverage area of the cell C but they are not active UEs. The cell coordination scheduler or the BBU performs step c as an intra cell resource allocation for the cell C during the present TTI. The cell coordination scheduler or the BBU firstly determines UE and UE in a scheduling list for the cell C. Then the coordination scheduler or the BBU calculates metrics of UEs for each RB from RB to RB by for example using the expressions 6 8 . For example the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines RB allocation for UE and UE in the cell C in accordance with several factors for example the amount of downlink data to be transmitted respectively to UE and UE the channel condition information or channel state information CSI fed back respectively by the UE and UE and the amount of data able to be transmitted on each RB.

Detailed operations are provided below for step i the intra cell RB allocation in the cell C. It is assumed that at the present TTI there are 750 megabytes MB downlink data waiting in buffer memory at the base station server to be transmitted to the UE and 800 MB downlink data to be transmitted to UE. The coordination scheduler or the BBU may determine that each RB is capable to transmit 500 MB to a particular UE in cell C. According to CSI fed back respectively from UE and UE the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines RB not suitable for downlink transmission to UE and UE at the present TTI but determines to allocate RB to UE RB to UE RB to UE and RB to UE. For example the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines the metrics of UE on RB calculated according to the mathematical expressions 6 8 greater than that of UE on RB so the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to allocate RB to UE at the present TTI. Similarly the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines the metrics of UE on RB calculated according to the expressions 6 8 greater than that of UE on RB so the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to allocate RB to UE at the present TTI. The same determination principle applies to RB allocation of RB to UE and RB to UE. When all downlink data waiting to be transmitted to all UEs in the current serving cell C has been allocated the required amount of RBs the coordination scheduler or the BBU stops allocating RBs in the current serving cell C and continues inter cell RB allocation. Since UE is CE UE the region RR represents restricted RBs for other cells in the cluster which had been allocated to UE for the present TTI.

After the RB allocation is determined for the cell C the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU performs step ii . That is performance of the intra cell RB allocation in cell C having regard to RB restriction determined at step i . The cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines that UE UE in the cell C are active UEs for the present TTI and thus list UE UE in the scheduling list for the present TTI. Then the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU calculates metrics of UE UE on each RB from RB to RB by for example using the mathematical expressions 6 8 in accordance with several factors for example the amount of downlink data to be transmitted respectively to UE UE the channel condition information or channel state information CSI fed back respectively by the UE UE and the amount of data able to be transmitted on each RB.

Detailed operations are provided below for step ii the intra cell RB allocation in cell C with RB restrictions. It is assumed that at the present TTI there are 1 500 MB downlink data waiting in buffer memory at the base station server to be transmitted to the UE and 900 MB downlink data to be transmitted to UE. UE is CE UE so it is blocked from using restricted RBs determined at the step i . UE is CC UE so it can re use any RB previously allocated to UE or UE at step i . The coordination scheduler or the BBU may determine that each RB is capable to transmit 500 MB to a particular UE in the cell C. According to CSI fed back respectively from UE and UE the coordination scheduler or the BBU calculates metrics of UE UE on each RB from RB to RB.

For example the coordination scheduler or the BBU then determines RB not suitable for downlink transmission to UE UE in the cell C at the present TTI but determines metrics of UE on RB as the highest. Since UE is CC UE UE can be allocated with RB. For example the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines the metrics of UE on RB calculated according to the expressions 6 8 greater than that of UE on RB but UE is CE UE and the RB is a restricted RB. In this case the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to discard UE on the restricted RB but allocate RB to UE at the present TTI. Similarly the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines the metrics of UE on RB calculated according to the expressions 6 8 greater than that of UE on RB and RB so the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to allocate RB and RB to UE at the present TTI. The same determination principle applies to RB allocation of RB to UE. When all downlink data waiting to be transmitted to all UEs in the current serving cell C has been allocated the required amount of RBs the coordination scheduler or the BBU stops allocating RBs in the current serving cell C and continues inter cell RB allocation. Since UE is CE UE the region RR represents restricted RBs for other cells in the configured cluster which had been allocated to UE for the present TTI.

After the RB allocation is determined for the cells C and C the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU performs step iii . That is intra cell resource allocation for cell C having regard to resource restriction determined at steps i and ii . The cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines that UE UE UE are active UEs for the present TTI and thus list UE UE and UE in the scheduling list for the present TTI. Then the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU calculates metrics of UE. UE on each RB from RB to RB by for example using the mathematical expressions 6 8 in accordance with several factors for example the amount of downlink data to be transmitted respectively to UE UE and UE the channel condition information or channel state information CSI fed back respectively by the UE UE and UE and the amount of data able to be transmitted on each RB.

Detailed operations are provided below for step iii the intra cell RB allocation in cell C with RB restrictions. It is assumed that at the present TTI there are 450 MB downlink data waiting in buffer memory at the base station server to be transmitted to the UE 600 MB downlink data to be transmitted to UE and 250 MB downlink data to be transmitted to UE. UE is CE UE so it will be blocked from using the restricted RBs determined at steps i and ii . UE and UE are CC UEs so they can re use any RB previously allocated to UEs at the step i and ii . The coordination scheduler or the BBU may determine each RB is capable to transmit 500 MB to a particular UE in cell C. According to CSI fed back respectively from UE. UE UE the coordination scheduler or the BBU calculates metrics of UE UE UE on each RB from RB to RB.

For example the coordination scheduler or the BBU then determines metrics of UE on RB as the highest. Since UE is CC UE UE can still be allocated with RB. After this intra cell allocation of RB to UE the downlink data requirement of UE is satisfied so the coordination scheduler or the BBU removes UE from the scheduling list. The coordination scheduler or the BBU then determines the metrics of UE on RB calculated according to the expressions 6 8 greater than that of UE on RB but UE is CE UE and the RB is restricted RB to CE UE in the cell C. In this case the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to discard UE on the restricted RB but allocate RB to UE at the present TTI. Similarly the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines the metrics of UE on RB calculated according to the expressions 6 8 greater than that of UE on RB so the coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to allocate RB to UE at the present TTI. The same determination principle applies to RB allocation of RB to UE. When all of downlink data waiting to be transmitted to all UEs in current serving cell C have been allocated required amount of RBs the coordination scheduler or the BBU stops allocating RB in the current serving cell C and the inter cell RB allocation is also completed for the current TTI.

In step S of the coordination scheduler or the BBU of the base station server determines each UE in each cell in a cluster to be a CE UE or a CC UE according to its reported reference signal strength. The coordination scheduler or the BBU is connected to RHUs respectively at Cell 1 Cell 2 and Cell 3. The cluster shown in consists of 3 sectors respectively belonging to Cell 1 Cell 2 and Cell 3. The BBU corresponds to RHUs at Cell 1 Cell 2 and Cell 3. Additionally the coordination scheduler or the BBU is responsible for intra cell resource allocation in Cell 1 Cell 2 and Cell 3 and is also responsible for inter cell resource allocation for the 3 sector cluster.

For each user in a cell the eNodeB with the greatest pilot signal is the serving cell. For example when the pilot signal or SINR of a serving cell reported by a UE A is greater than pilot signal strengths or SINR of other cells by the threshold amount delta pre configured by the mobile network operator or according to an algorithm the cell coordination scheduler of the base station server determines this UE A to be a CC UE. On the other hand when the pilot signal or SINR of a serving cell reported by a UE B is not greater than pilot signal strengths or SINR of other cells by the threshold amount delta the cell coordination scheduler of the base station server determines this UE B to be a CE UE.

In an alternative example when another UE C respectively receives 2 or more pilot signals from 2 or more cells of nearly equal signal strength the cell coordination scheduler of the base station server can determine this UE C to be a CE UE.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU allocates radio resource blocks to CC UE s and CE UE s in each cell of the cluster and also restricts radio resource blocks allocated to CE UE s in a cell K from being used by cells with allocation priorities lower than that of the cell K and continues the same procedure of radio resource allocation and radio resource block restriction for all other cells in the cell cluster. For example the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines in advance that the allocation priority rank of cells in the 3 sector cluster is Cell 1 Cell 2 Cell 3. Then the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU performs 1 1 the intra cell radio resource block allocation for Cell 1 for the present allocation period T then 1 2 performs intra cell radio resource block allocation for Cell 2 with radio resource block restriction determined at the step 1 1 for the present resource allocation period T and finally performs intra cell radio resource block allocation for Cell 3 with radio resource block restriction determined at the steps 1 1 and 1 2 for the present resource allocation period T. The detailed operations of steps 1 1 1 2 1 3 are similar to those in above mentioned steps i ii and iii .

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU changes the allocation priority of cells in the cluster for the next resource allocation period T 1 after the present resource allocation period T. The basic unit of the resource allocation period can be for example a TTI. The change of resource allocation priority of cells in the cluster may be for example a randomly selected b selected by round robin or c configured by another algorithm to improve the fairness of resource allocation to UEs in different cells of the cell cluster.

In step S in the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU of the base station server allocates radio resource blocks in a cell with allocation priority rank K according to a list of restricted radio resource blocks to CE UE in the cluster. The list of restricted radio resource blocks is initially empty when the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU performs inter cell radio resource allocation in a cell with the highest allocation priority.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU updates the list of restricted radio resource blocks to CE UEs in the cell cluster according to allocated resource blocks to CE UEs in the cell with allocation priority K. The updated list of restricted radio resource blocks to CE UEs in the cell cluster will be applied to the intra cell radio resource allocation of cell s with resource allocation priority rank lower than K.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU decrements the value of K by one unit. Then in step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether the value of K is equal to 0. When the value of K is equal to 0 then it is determined that all cells in the cluster have been allocated resource blocks for the present resource allocation period T. When the value of K is not equal to 0 then the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU repeats the previous two procedures steps S and S for other cells having resource allocation priority lower than K in the cell cluster until all cells in the cluster are allocated with radio resource blocks for the present resource allocation period T.

In step S of the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU of the base station server calculates metrics for all active UEs in a scheduling list in a current cell for a radio resource block L and updates a list of UEs for the radio resource block L according to their calculated metrics.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether the radio resource block L is in a list of restricted resource blocks for the cell cluster. When the present cell is the cell with the highest allocation priority the list of restricted resource blocks is an empty set. When it is determined that the radio resource block L is a restricted resource block for the cell cluster step S is executed after step S. When it is determined that the radio resource block L is not the restricted resource block for the cell cluster step S is executed after step S.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to allocate the radio resource block L to the UE with greatest calculated metrics.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether the UE with the greatest calculated metrics is a CE UE. When it is determined that the UE with the greatest calculated metrics is a CE UE step S is executed after step S. When it is determined that the UE with the greatest calculated metrics is a CC UE step S is executed after the step S. That is when it is determined that the radio resource block L is not in the restricted resource block for the cell cluster or the UE with the greatest calculated metrics is a CC UE the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to allocate the radio resource block L to the UE.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether the UE just allocated with the radio resource block L is a CE UE. When it is determined that the UE just allocated with the radio resource block L is a CE UE then step S is executed after the step S otherwise step S is executed after step S.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to discard the UE with the greatest calculated metrics from the list of UEs for the radio resource block L. Step S is executed after the step S.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to update add the radio resource block L to the list of restricted resource blocks for the cell cluster for the present allocation period T.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to update the amount of data to be transmitted to the UE which is just allocated with the radio resource block L. Since the radio resource block L is just allocated to the UE the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU decreases the amount of data waiting to be transmitted to the UE by the amount of data which can be transmitted on the radio resource block L.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU checks whether there is any UE with more data to be transmitted to the UE and discards the UE from the scheduling list in the current cell when there is no more data to be transmitted to the UE. In step S when the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines a UE in the scheduling list in the current cell no longer needs to receive downlink data the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU can discard the UE from the scheduling list of UEs of the current cell. The step S is an optional step.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether any UE remains in the list of UEs for the radio resource block L. When it is determined that there is at least one UE left in the list of UEs for the radio resource block L step S is executed after step S. When it is determined that there are no more UEs left in the list of UEs for the radio resource block L the step S is executed after step S.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU updates the value of L by incrementing the value of L by one unit. In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether the updated value of L is equal to Lmax which refers to the maximum number of radio resource blocks available for the current cell. When it is determined that the updated value of L is not equal to Lmax it means that there is still at least one radio resource block in the present cell has not been considered in the intra cell radio resource allocation. In this case step S is executed after step S. On the other hand when it is determined that the updated value of L is equal to Lmax then the intra cell radio resource allocation in the present cell is completed. Then the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU continues to perform an intra cell radio resource allocation in the next cell of the cluster or a first cell in the cluster for the next allocation period T.

In step S of the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU of the base station server determines each UE in each cell in a cell cluster to be a CE UE or a CC UE according to its reported reference signal strength. The cell coordination scheduler or the BBU is connected to RHUs respectively at Cell A Cell B Cell C. The configured cluster shown in consists of 9 sectors respectively belong to Cell A Cell B Cell C. The BBU corresponds to RHUs at cells Cell A Cell B Cell C. Additionally the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU is responsible for intra cell resource allocation in cells Cell A. Cell B. Cell C. and also inter cell resource allocation for the configured 9 sector cluster.

For example when the pilot signal or SINR of a serving cell reported by a UE A is greater than pilot signal strengths or SINR of other cells by the threshold amount delta pre configured by the mobile network operator or according to an algorithm the cell coordination scheduler of the base station server may consider this UE A as a CC UE. On the other hand when the pilot signal or SINR of a serving cell reported by a UE B is not greater than pilot signal strengths or SINR of other cells by the threshold amount delta the cell coordination scheduler of the base station server may consider this UE B as a CE UE. For another example when another UE C respectively receive 2 or more pilot signals from 2 or more cells with nearly equal signal strength the cell coordination scheduler of the base station server may consider this UE C as a CE UE.

In step S the coordination scheduler or the BBU assigns allocation priorities to Cell A Cell Band Cell C and also assigns resource allocation priorities to sectors in each cell during a priority allocation period G. For example the resource priority allocation period G can be 50 TTI and the allocation period T can be 1 TTI. The cell priority ranks and sector priority ranks at priority allocation period G may be similar to those shown in Table I below. In the second exemplary embodiment it is proposed to maintain two levels of allocation priority at a cell level and a cluster level. Then it is efficient and organized for the coordination scheduler or the BBU to conduct intra cell radio resource allocation for most sectors when neighbouring sector s UEs have been assigned with restricted radio resource. There is no restricted radio resource when the intra cell radio resource allocation is conducted on the sector with the highest cell allocation priority in the cell with the highest sector allocation priority for example the sector A 1 in the cell Cell A during the priority allocation period G.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU allocates radio resource blocks to CC UE s and CE UE s in each cell of the cluster and also updates a list of lists of restricted radio resource blocks for interfering sectors cells of cell K. Then the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU continues the same radio resource blocks allocation and radio resource restriction procedure for all other sectors and all other cells in the cluster. That means a sector J with higher resource allocation priority rank will be allocated with radio resource block prior to the radio resource block allocation to a sector Q with lower allocation priority rank. Then the radio resource block assigned to the CE UE in the sector J with higher resource allocation priority rank will be added into a list of restricted radio resource block for the sector Q which is considered by the coordination scheduler or the BBU as an interfering sector of the sector J.

For example the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines in advance that the cell allocation priority in the configured 9 sector cluster during the priority allocation period G is Cell A Cell B Cell C. Also in this example the sector allocation priority ranks in the cell Cell A is A 1 A 2 A 3. Then the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU performs an intra cell radio resource block allocation for sector A 1 of the cell Cell A for the present allocation period T and allocates a radio resource block L to a CE UE U1. The cell coordination scheduler or the BBU also determines that the sector B 3 of the cell Cell B and the sector C 2 of the cell Cell C are interfering sectors to the CE UE U1 and thus updates the radio resource block L in lists of restricted radio resource block respectively for the sector B 3 and the sector C 2. When the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU performs intra cell radio resource allocation with radio resource restriction in the sector B 3 and the sector C 2 both a CE UE U 2 in the sector B 3 or a CE UE U 3 in the sector C 2 are restricted from being allocated the radio resource block L as it is recorded in the lists of restricted radio resource blocks respectively of the sector B 3 and the sector C 2. However any CC UE in the interfering sectors such as the sector C 2 and the sector B 3 is not blocked from being allocated the radio resource block L.

Similar procedures will be executed consecutively for all sectors in the cluster such that the intra cell radio resource allocation with restricted radio resource blocks procedure is performed one sector after another until UEs in all sectors in the cluster have been allocated resources. For example during the priority allocation period G the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU firstly performs the intra cell radio resource allocation with radio resource blocks restriction procedure in the cell Cell A which has the cell allocation priority of 1 . The intra cell radio resource allocation with radio resource blocks restriction procedures are performed consecutively on the sectors A 1 A 2 and A 3 which respectively have sector allocation priority rank of 1 2 and 3 in the cell Cell A. Then the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU continues to perform the intra cell radio resource allocation with radio resource blocks restriction procedure in the cell Cell B and Cell C consecutively for the same priority allocation period G. Therefore the sequence of performing intra cell radio resource allocation with radio resource blocks restriction is sector A 1 sector A 2 sector A 3 sector B 1 sector B 2 sector B 3 sector C 1 sector C 2 sector C 3.

Differences between the first exemplary embodiment and the second exemplary embodiment are there is a global list of restricted radio resource blocks maintained in the cluster in the first exemplary embodiment there will be a separate list of restricted radio resource blocks maintained for each sector in the second exemplary embodiment only interfering sector will have its list of restricted radio resource blocks updated in the second exemplary embodiment.

In step S the coordination scheduler or the BBU changes the cell allocation priorities of cells and the sector allocation priorities of sectors in each cell in the cluster for the next resource allocation period T 1 after the present resource allocation period T until the present priority allocation period G expires. The basic unit of the allocation period can be for example a TTI. The change of the allocation priority ranks of cells in the cluster can be for example a randomly selected b selected by round robin or c configured by another algorithm to improve the fairness of resource allocation to UEs in different cells of the configured cluster. The resource priority allocation period T can be for example 50 TTIs.

In step S in the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU of the base station server allocates radio resource blocks in a sector with sector allocation priority S in a cell with cell allocation priority K according to the sector s own list of restricted radio resource blocks to CE UE in the configured cluster. The list of restricted radio resource blocks for each sector and each cell is initially empty when the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU starts allocating radio resource blocks to UEs in a cell with the highest allocation priority rank. If the cell allocated priority K has the highest priority then there is no list of restricted radio resource blocks for the sector with the highest sector allocation priority in cell K.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU updates the lists of restricted radio resource blocks to CE UEs for the interferer sectors in the configured cluster according to allocated resource blocks to CE UEs in the sector with the sector allocation priority rank S in the cell with cell allocation priority rank K. Interferer sectors in the configured cluster cannot be the cells with allocation priority rank higher than K.

Steps S and S are inner loop determinations of sectors in . In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU decrements the value of S by one unit. Then in step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether the value of S is equal to 0. When the value of S is equal to 0 then it is determined that all sectors in the current cell with the cell allocation priority K have been allocated resources for the present allocation period T. When the value of S is not equal to 0 then the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU repeats the previous two procedures steps S and S for other sectors with allocation priority lower than S in the present cell with the cell allocation priority rank K until all sectors in the present cell with the cell allocation priority K are allocated with radio resource blocks for the present allocation period T.

Steps S and S are outer loop determinations of cells in . In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU decrements the value of K by one unit. Then in step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether the value of K is equal to 0. When the value of K is equal to 0 then it is determined that all cells in the cluster have been allocated resources for the present allocation period T. When the value of K is not equal to 0 then the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU repeats the previous procedures steps S to S for other cells with allocation priority less than K in the configured cluster until all cells in the cluster have been allocated with radio resource blocks for the present allocation period.

In step S of the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU of the base station server calculates metrics for all active UEs in a scheduling list in a sector in a current cell for a radio resource block L and updates a list of UEs for the radio resource block L according to their calculated metrics.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether the radio resource block L is in the current sector s own list of restricted resource block for the cell cluster. When the current sector in the current cell under the intra cell radio resource allocation with radio resource blocks restriction procedure is the sector with the highest sector allocation priority in a cell with highest cell allocation priority the sector s own list of restricted resource block is an empty set. When it is determined that the radio resource block L is a restricted resource block for the current sector in the current cell step S is executed after the step S. When it is determined that the radio resource block L is not a restricted resource block for the current sector in the current cell step S is executed after the step S.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to allocate the radio resource block L to a UE with greatest metrics calculated in the step S in the list of UEs at the current sector.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether the UE with the greatest calculated metrics is a CE UE. When it is determined that the UE with the greatest calculated metrics is a CE UE step S is executed after the step S. When it is determined that the UE with the greatest calculated metrics is a CC UE step S is executed after the step S. That is when it is determined that the radio resource block L is not in the restricted resource block for the configured cluster or the UE with the greatest calculated metrics is a CC UE the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to allocate the radio resource block L to the UE.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether the UE which has just been allocated with the radio resource block L is a CE UE. When it is determined that the UE just allocated with the radio resource block L is a CE UE then step S is executed after the step S otherwise step S is executed after the step S.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to discard the UE with the greatest calculated metrics from the list of UEs for the radio resource block L. Step S is executed after the step S.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to update the radio resource block L to a list of lists of restricted resource block for interferer sectors in the configured cluster for the present allocation period. The method for determining which sector is an interferer sector for the current sector depends upon the reported reference signal strengths of the current cell and the neighbouring cell of a CE UE in the current cell. For example the reported reference signal strength refers to pilot signal strength or reference signal strength detected by each UE. When the reference signal strength or SINR of a serving cell reported by a CE UE C is not greater than pilot signal strengths or SINR of a neighbouring cell by a threshold amount sigma which can be set by the mobile network operator or according to an algorithm the coordination scheduler or the BBU of the base station server determines a sector closest to the current sector in the neighbouring cell as an interferer sector for the CE UE C. The configured threshold amount sigma may be 1 dB 5 dB or 10 dB for example. Additionally in the step S when the CE UE C is allocated with the radio resource block L the radio resource block L is added by the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU into the interferer sector s own list of restricted radio resource blocks.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines to update the amount of data to be transmitted to the UE which is just allocated with the radio resource block L. Since the radio resource block L is just allocated to the UE the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU decreases the amount of data waiting to be transmitted to the UE by the amount of data which can be transmitted on the radio resource block L.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU checks whether there is any UE with more data to be transmitted to the UE and discards the UE from the scheduling list in the current sector when there is no more data to be transmitted to the UE. In the step S when the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines a UE in the scheduling list in the current sector no longer needs to receive downlink data the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU can discard the UE from the scheduling list of UEs of the current sector. The step S is an optional step.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether any UE left in the scheduling list of UEs for the radio resource block L. When it is determined that there is at least one UE left in the scheduling list of UEs for the radio resource block L the step S is executed after the step S. When it is determined that there is no more UE left in the scheduling list of UEs for the radio resource block L the step S is executed after the step S.

In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU updates the value of L by incrementing the value of L by one unit. In step S the cell coordination scheduler or the BBU determines whether the updated value of L is equal to Lmax which refers to the maximum number of radio resource blocks configured for the current sector. When it is determined that the updated value of L is not equal to Lmax there is still at least one radio resource block in the current sector which has not been allocated resources then step S is executed after the step S. On the other hand when it is determined that the updated value of L is equal to Lmax the intra cell radio resource allocation in the current sector is completed. The cell coordination scheduler or the BBU continues to perform an intra cell radio resource allocation in the next sector or a first cell in the cluster for the next allocation period.

In a large scale implementation when the number of cells controlled by the base station server is large the number of cells can be divided into several clusters as needed for ICI coordination. When there are multiple clusters in the wireless communication system each cluster can share information with other clusters to avoid ICI. The concept of the solution for multi cluster ICI coordination can be explained below.

Apart from the base station server maintaining a list of restricted radio resource blocks for each sector or each cell or the cluster the cell coordination scheduler of the base station server can also maintain a list of neighbouring and interfering cells for each cell or each sector in the cluster. Also the cell coordination scheduler can maintain a list of neighbouring cells of nearby clusters for each cluster in the wireless communication system. For example in a Cluster A Cell 3 and 4 are neighbors of Cluster B Cells 4 5 6 are neighbors with Cluster C. After the proposed method of allocating radio resource with restricted radio resource blocks is performed according to the steps of the first or the second exemplary embodiment the information about radio resource blocks allocated to CE UEs for Cell 3 and 4 will be transmitted to the cluster scheduler cell coordination scheduler responsible for radio resource allocation in Cluster B.

According to the cluster priority or the cell priority a cluster with lower cluster allocation priority will compare its radio resource block allocations with cells of the neighboring cluster. When there is a conflict on radio resource block allocation the cell coordination scheduler can determine that the cluster with lower priority withdraws the allocation of the conflicted CE radio resource blocks. For example. Cluster A has higher cluster allocation priority than Cluster B. When the Cluster B has Cells 6 and 7 neighboring with Cluster A and if a same radio resource block was assigned in these two cells the radio resource block allocation of the CE UE in the Cluster B will be withheld. As a result the interference around the border of clusters is avoided.

Table III illustrates the performance gain obtained using centralised resource allocation based on C RAN in the 3 sector cluster and the resource restriction strategy explained in the first exemplary embodiment above. The simulation environment consists of three cells with base stations at respective sites and the 3 sector refers to the region where 3 sectors from Cell 1 Cell 2 and Cell 3 are neighbouring next to each other respectively See . The parameter in Table III refers to the pre configured threshold amount delta between CC users and CE users. The simulation clearly demonstrates CE UE throughput improvement from C RAN or centralized allocation of CE RBs to CE UEs in the cluster. The simulation indicates that as increases the CE region in each cell is also increased CE UE throughput improvement and total throughput improvement are obtained as compared to when C RAN is not utilised. Since this simulation only involves a 3 sector cluster different numbers of UEs such as 20 UEs 60 UEs and 100 UEs are simulated in the pre configured environment and the corresponding test results are shown in Table III.

Table IV illustrates the performance gain obtained using centralised resource allocation based on C RAN in the 9 sector cluster in the cluster of three cells and the resource restriction strategy explained in the first exemplary embodiment above. The simulation environment consists of 3 cells with base stations at respective sites and the 9 sector refers to the region with a total of 9 neighbouring sectors respectively from Cells 1 2 and 3. The parameter in Table IV refers to the pre configured threshold amount delta between CC users and CE users. The simulation clearly demonstrates CE UE throughput improvement from C RAN or centralized allocation of CE RBs to CE UEs in the cluster. The simulation indicates that as increases the CE region in each cell is also increased CE UE throughput improvement and total throughput improvement are obtained as compared to when C RAN is not utilised. The simulation of 9 sector in the configured cluster is performed only with a number of 20 UEs in the pre configured environment and the corresponding test results are shown in Table IV.

By executing the methods for packet scheduling resource allocation shown in preceding first and second exemplary embodiments for the C RAN of the LTE network the inter cell interference in each cluster may be reduced drastically compared to the one without application of C RAN or the proposed packet scheduling resource allocation with ICI avoidance with radio resource blocks restriction in the LTE network.
