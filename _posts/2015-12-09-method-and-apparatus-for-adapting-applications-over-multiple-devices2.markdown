In response to the detected request to swap the processor can present at the display of the computing device the virtual peripheral controller adapted for presentation at the computing device.

One embodiment of the present disclosure includes a computer readable storage medium comprising computer instructions which when executed by a processor causes the processor to present at a mobile communication device a first graphical user interface corresponding to a virtual peripheral controller for capturing user navigation and control inputs. The processor can also capture a detected stimulation of the virtual peripheral controller at the mobile communication device. The processor can further transmit the detected stimulation from the mobile communication device to cause an update in a second graphical user interface depicting a game space presented at a computing device. The gaming application can generate the game space. The second graphical user interface can be updated responsive to the gaming application processing the detected stimulation. The processor can further receive an adaptation of the second graphical user interface from the gaming application responsive to a request to swap the presentation of the game space from the computing device to the mobile communication device.

One embodiment of the present disclosure includes a method including presenting at a display of a computer device a first graphical user interface depicting a game space of a gaming application operating at the computer device. The method can include receiving at the computer device a detected stimulation from a mobile communication device. The detected stimulation can be associated with a second graphical user interface depicting a virtual peripheral controller presented at the mobile communication device for capturing user navigation and control inputs to the gaming application from the mobile communication device. The method can further include detecting a request to swap between the computer device and the mobile communication device presentations of the first graphical user interface depicting the game space and the second graphical user interface depicting the virtual peripheral controller. The method can also include presenting at the display of the computer device an adaptation of the second graphical user interface depicting virtual peripheral controller responsive to the detected request to swap.

The AMS application can be applied to a method and an apparatus for a distributed computing system. In one embodiment the AMS application can operate at any device or at any combination of devices across a distributed system to allow user access to a software application running at any device in the distributed system. The AMS application can operate at a computer device a mobile device and or a server device to facilitate distributed access to a software application. In one embodiment the AMS application can support a host peripheral architecture where a host computing device processes software such as a gaming application while a peripheral computing device acts as a virtual gaming controller device. The peripheral computing device can capture user inputs to a virtual gaming controller device and transmit to the host device stimulations associated with the captured inputs. In one embodiment the AMS application at the host computing device can process received peripheral computing device stimulation inputs and make processed information available to a software application such as a gaming application that is running on the operating system of the host computing device. The host computing device can thereby use the peripheral device as a virtual peripheral device.

In one embodiment the host computing device can present a first graphical user interface on a display of the host computing device. For example the first graphical user interface can be a graphics image of a game space including features characters informational displays and or controls associated with the gaming application. In one embodiment the host device can be a first computer device such as a desktop computer laptop computer smart pad device smart pod device or a mobile phone device.

In one embodiment the peripheral computing device can present a virtual peripheral controller. The virtual peripheral controller can be another graphical user interface that can include graphical renditions of physical features informational displays and user inputs that allow a user to interact with virtual peripheral controller to provide navigational and control input to the software application. For example the peripheral computing device can display on a touch screen a graphical rendition of a virtual gaming console controller. The peripheral computing device can emulate the look feel and functionality of a traditional physical controller or can create a virtual controller that presents new functional or aesthetic features or can combine both concepts into the virtual controller. The peripheral computing device can monitor user interactions with the touch screen display with other physical inputs to the peripheral computing device and or combinations of virtual and physical inputs. As the user interacts with and selects these inputs the peripheral computing device can capture the inputs and transmit the captured inputs or stimulations stimuli to the host computing device for processing as described above. In one embodiment the peripheral device can be a second computer device such as a desktop computer laptop computer smart pad device smart pod device or a mobile phone device.

In one embodiment the host device s AMS application can detect a request to swap the host and peripheral functions between the devices. In other words if the host function was initially on a first computing device and the peripheral function was on a second computing device then a swap would involve moving the host function to the second computing device while moving the peripheral function to the first computing device. In one embodiment if a swap request is detected the original host computing device can transmit a stream of the first graphical user interface to the peripheral computing device. The peripheral computing device can present the streamed graphics on a display associated with the peripheral computing device. For example if the peripheral computing device is a mobile phone device the streamed graphics representing the graphical user interface for the gaming application can be displayed on a touch screen built into the phone. In this embodiment the gaming application continues to execute on the host computing device but is displayed on the peripheral computing device.

In one embodiment the host computing device can transmit to the peripheral computing device data and or operating parameters corresponding to a present state of the gaming application at the point the swap request was received. For example the host computing device can respond to the swap request by storing the present state of the game as for example would occur if a player executed a save state command during game play. The host computer device can transmit to the peripheral device all the necessary data for initializing the game to the saved state. In one embodiment the peripheral computing device can then execute the software application locally on the peripheral computing device using the initialization information.

In one embodiment the host computing device can present the virtual peripheral controller at a display of the host computing device. The virtual peripheral controller can be identical to that formerly presented at the peripheral computing device or can be adapted to the host computing device. In one embodiment the peripheral computing device can transmit a user profile and or virtual peripheral controller profile to the host computing device so that user settings or other customizations of the virtual peripheral controller can be transferred to the host computing device during the swap.

In the present context an accessory can represent any type of device which can be communicatively coupled to the computing device and which can control aspects of the OS and or a software application operating in the computing device. An accessory can represent for example a keyboard a gaming pad a mouse a gaming console controller a joystick a microphone or a headset with a microphone just to mention a few. An accessory can also represent for example gaming goggles or apparel with sensors. An accessory can also represent a virtual peripheral controller presented by a mobile communication device .

The keyboard and gaming pad represent accessories of a similar category since their operational parameters are alike. A mouse on the other hand represents an accessory having disparate operational parameters from the keyboard or gaming pad. For instance the operational parameters of a keyboard generally consist of alphanumeric keys control keys e.g. Shift Alt Ctrl and function keys while the operational parameters of a mouse consist of navigation data generated by a tracking device such as a laser sensor buttons to invoke GUI selections and settings thereof e.g. counts or dots per inch acceleration scroll speed jitter control line straightening control and so on . Such distinctions can be used to identify disparate categories of accessories. The joysticks game controllers or any other input devices represent additional categories of accessories supported by the AMS.

In one embodiment the AMS application can detect a virtual peripheral controller operating from a mobile communication device . For example a mobile communication device can be communicatively coupled to a host computing device that is executing the AMS application. For example the coupling can be through a wireless link such as Wi Fi Bluetooth or a cellular link. In this embodiment a graphical user interface presented by the mobile communication device can depict user input elements corresponding to a peripheral controller such as a virtual gaming console controller a virtual gaming pad or a virtual joystick. For example the graphical user interface can depict joystick and button elements consistent with a gaming console controller. As the user interacts with the virtual peripheral controller on the mobile communication device user inputs can be captured and converted into stimuli by the mobile communication device . The stimuli can be output from the mobile communication device to the AMS application on the host computing device over the communications link. The AMS application can process the received stimuli as it does stimuli for other accessory devices as described below. For example the AMS application executed by the host computing device can record macro actions corresponding to stimuli from a virtual peripheral controller at a mobile communication device . The AMS application can pass stimuli or stimuli substitutes captured from the virtual peripheral controller at a mobile communication device to an operating system of the host computing device for use by a software application running at the host computing device.

In one embodiment the AMS client application software can be downloaded to the mobile communication device presenting the virtual peripheral controller. For example an AMS application at a host computing device can detect a mobile communication device with a virtual peripheral controller that is connected to the host computing device. As the user interacts with the virtual peripheral controller at the mobile communication device user inputs can be captured and converted into stimuli by the mobile communication device. The stimuli can be output from the mobile communication device to the host computing device and its AMS application over the communications link. The host AMS application can process the received stimuli as it does stimuli for other accessory devices. The host AMS application can then compare a received stimulation from the mobile communication device against substitute stimuli and or recorded macros. The host AMS can similarly store and later compare the received stimulations against alternative actions that a user has configured in the user profile. The host AMS application can thereby send to the operating system of the host computing device default actions associated with the received stimulation alternative or substitute stimulations associated with the received stimulation or substitute macros of several gaming actions that are associated as a group with the received stimulation. The gaming action s that the host AMS application sends to the operating system can then be used by the software gaming application running at host computing device.

In step the AMS application presents a GUI such as depicted in with operationally distinct accessories such as a tablet and mobile communication device . The GUI presents the accessories in a scrollable section . One or more accessories can be selected by a user with a common mouse pointer. In this illustration the tablet and mobile communication device were selected with a mouse pointer for customization. Upon selecting the tablet and mobile communication device in section the AMS application can present the tablet and mobile communication device in split windows respectively to help the user during the customization process.

In step the AMS application can be programmed to detect a user selection of a particular software application such as a game. This step can be the result of the user entering in a Quick Search field the name of a gaming application e.g. World of Warcraft . Upon identifying a gaming application the AMS application can retrieve in step from a remote or local database gaming application actions which can be presented in a scrollable section of the GUI represented as Actions . The actions can be tactical actions communication actions menu actions and movement actions or any other types of actions which can be used to invoke and manage features of the gaming application.

The actions presented descriptively in section of the GUI can represent a sequence of accessory input functions which a user can stimulate by button depressions navigation or speech. For example depressing the left button on the mouse can represent the tactical action Reload while the simultaneous keyboard depressions Ctrl A can represent the tactical action Melee Attack . For ease of use the Actions section of the GUI is presented descriptively rather than by a description of the input function s of a particular accessory.

Any one of the Actions can be associated with one or more input functions of the accessories by way of a simple drag and drop action. For instance a user can select a Melee Attack by placing a mouse pointer over an iconic symbol associated with this action. Upon doing so the symbol can be highlighted to indicate to the user that the icon is selectable. At this point the user can select the icon by holding the left mouse button and drag the symbol to any of the input functions e.g. buttons of the tablet or a virtual peripheral controller of the mobile communication device .

In one embodiment a user can drag a Melee Attack symbol to a button of the virtual peripheral controller thereby causing an association between the selection of the button and the gaming action of a Melee Attack. When the button of the virtual peripheral controller presented by the mobile communication device is selected during normal operation the AMS application can detect the selection as a trigger to generate the key sequence Ctrl A which is understood by the gaming application as request for a Melee Attack. The gaming application receives from the AMS application by way of an operating system the Ctrl A sequence as if it had been generated by a Qwerty keyboard.

With this in mind attention is directed to step where the AMS application can respond to a user selection of a profile. A profile can be a device profile or master profile invoked by selecting GUI button or each of which can identify the association of actions with input functions of one or more accessories. If a profile selection is detected in step the AMS application can retrieve macro s and or prior associations of actions with the accessories as defined by the profile in step . The actions and or macros defined in the profile can also be presented in step by the AMS application in the actions column of the GUI to modify or create new associations.

In step the AMS application can also respond to a user selection to create a macro. A macro in the present context can represent a subset of actions that can be presented in the Actions column . Any command which can be recorded by the AMS application can be used to define a macro. A command can represent a sequence of input functions of an accessory identification of a software application to be initiated by an operating system OS or any other recordable stimulus to initiate control or manipulate software applications. For instance a macro can represent a user entering the identity of a software application e.g. instant messaging tool team chat tool such as Skype to be initiated by an OS. A macro can also represent recordable speech delivered by a microphone singly or in combination with a headset for detection by another software application through speech recognition or for delivery of the recorded speech to other parties. In yet another embodiment a macro can represent recordable navigation of an accessory such as a mouse or joystick recordable selections of buttons on a keyboard a mouse a mouse pad a pair of gaming goggles or a gaming accessory and so on. In another embodiment macros can be combinations of the above illustrations. Macros can be created from the GUI by selecting a Record Macro button . The macro can be given a name and category in user defined fields and . Macros can similarly be associated with input functions of a virtual peripheral controller presented by the mobile communication device .

Upon selecting the Record Macro button a macro can be generated by selection of input functions on an accessory e.g. Ctrl A speech etc. and or by manual entry in field e.g. typing the name and location of a software application to be initiated by an OS . Once the macro is created it can be tested by selecting button which can repeat the sequence specified in field . The clone button can be selected to replicate the macro sequence if desired. Fields can also present timing characteristics of the stimulation sequence in the macro with the ability to customize such timing.

Once the macro has been fully defined selection of button records the macro in step . The recording step can be combined with a step for adding the macro to the associable items Actions column thereby providing the user the means to associate the macro with input functions of the accessories of windows and .

In step the AMS application can respond to drag and drop associations between actions and input functions of the tablet or mobile communication device . If an association is detected the AMS application can proceed to step where it can determine if a profile has been identified in step to record the association s detected. If a profile has been identified the associations are recorded in said profile in step . If a profile was not been identified in step the AMS application can create a profile in step for recording the detected associations. In the same step the user can name the newly created profile as desired. The newly created profile can also be associated with one or more gaming software applications in step for future reference.

The GUI presented by the AMS application can have other functions. For example the GUI can provide options for layout of the accessory selected button how the keyboard is illuminated when associations between input functions and actions are made button and configuration options for the accessory button . Configuration options can include operational settings of a mouse such as Dots per Inch or Counts per Inch and so on. The AMS application can adapt the GUI to present more than one functional perspective. For instance by selecting button the AMS application can adapt the GUI to present a means to create macros and associate actions to accessory input functions as depicted in . Selecting button can cause the AMS application to adapt the GUI to present statistics in relation to the usage of accessories as depicted in . Although depicts a keyboard the GUI of can also be adapted to present color coded statistics for the tablet and or mobile communication device . Selecting button can cause the AMS application to adapt the GUI to present promotional offers and software updates.

It should be noted that the steps of method in whole or in part can be repeated until a desirable pattern of associations of actions to input functions of the selected accessories has been accomplished. It would be apparent to an artisan with ordinary skill in the art that there can be numerous other approaches to accomplish similar results. These undisclosed approaches are contemplated by the present disclosure.

In step the AMS application can receive instructions describing all or a portion of the input functions of the unknown accessory. These instructions can come from a user who defines each input function individually or responds to inquiries provided by the AMS application. The AMS application can for example make an assumption as to a keyboard layout and highlight each key with a proposed function which the user can verify or modify. Once the AMS application has been provided instructions in step the AMS application can create an accessory identity in step which can be defined by the user. In steps and the AMS application can associate and record the accessory instructions with the identity for future recognition of the accessory. In step the AMS application can present a depiction of the new accessory with its identity along with the other selectable accessories in section .

Method can provide a means for universal detection and identification of any accessory which can be used to control or manage software applications operating in a computing device.

Once one or more stimulations have been detected in step the AMS application can proceed to step to determine if action s have been associated with the detected stimulation s . If for example the stimulations detected correspond to keyboard and mouse button depressions the AMS application can determine if actions have been associated and recorded for such stimulations. If these stimulations trigger one or more actions the AMS application can proceed to step where it retrieves the stimulation definition of these actions for each accessory reporting a stimulation event. In step the AMS application can substitute the detected stimulations with the stimulations defined by the action.

To illustrate this substitution suppose for example that the detected stimulation was Ctrl A simultaneously depressed on a keyboard. Suppose further that an action associated with this stimulus consists of a macro that combines mouse clicks with a navigation of the mouse e.g. moving the mouse quickly in a forward motion for a given distance and a request to invoke an instant messaging IM session with a particular individual using Skype or some other common IM tool. In step the AMS application would substitute Ctrl A for stimulations consisting of the mouse clicks navigation and a request for an IM application. The substitute stimulations would then be reported in step to an operating system OS .

In step the OS can determine whether to pass the substitute stimulations to an active software application in operation e.g. a gaming application and or to invoke another software application. The active software application can be operating from the same computer system from which the OS and the AMS application operate or can be operating at a remote system such as an on line server or family of servers e.g. World of Warcraft awaiting stimulation data from the computer system. In this illustration the macro comprises both stimulation feedback for the active software application and a request to initiate an IM session. Accordingly the OS conveys in step the mouse stimulation signals to the active software application e.g. gaming application and in a near simultaneous fashion invokes the IM session in step with a specific individual or organization .

Referring back to step the illustrations above cover a scenario in which the AMS application has detected an association of actions to accessory stimuli. If however the AMS application does not detect such an association then the detected stimulus or stimuli supplied by one or more accessories is transmitted to the OS in step . For example it may be that a stimulation based on the depressions of Ctrl A has no particular association to an action having substitute stimuli. In this case the AMS application passes this stimulation to the OS with no substitute stimulations. In step the OS can determine if this stimulation invokes a new software application in step or is conveyed to the previously initiated software application. All of the above described steps can be performed for example on physical accessories coupled to the computer device executing the AMS application on physical accessories coupled to mobile communication devices that are coupled to the computer device executing the AMS application and or virtual peripheral controllers at mobile communication devices that are coupled to the computer device executing the AMS application.

Contemporaneous to the embodiments described above the AMS application can also record in step statistics relating to the detected accessory stimulations. A portion of the AMS application can operate as a background process which performs statistical analysis on the stimulations detected. By selecting button in the AMS application can provide an updated GUI which illustrates the usage of input functions of one or more accessories for which stimulations were detected in step . A keyboard accessory is shown in . In this illustration certain keys references on the keyboard are color coded to illustrate the frequency of usage of these keys.

A color scale defines the frequency of usage of the input functions of the keyboard. The first end of the scale navy blue represents a single detected depression while an opposite end of the scale bright red represents detected depressions. Based on this scale the AMS application maps by color in step stimulations of the keyboard. For example the key grouping depict a color coding with the highest detectable usage while the F7 key reference indicates the fewest depressions. Keys having zero depressions are not color coded to readily identify the color mapping of keys which were used at least once.

The AMS application provides additional functions in a playback panel of the GUI which can help a user understand how the color coded keys were used during an active software application such as a video game. In this section of the GUI the AMS application can present the user with a playback control function which the user can select to replay pause forward or rewind the usage of these keys. When usage playback is selected the user can for instance see the color coded keys highlighted in real time with a temporary white border to visualize how the keys were selected. A time clock provides the user the elapsed time of the playback sequence. Button allows the user to retrieve statistics from other sessions while button provides the user a means to save statistics from a given session.

The GUI of could have been shown as a split screen with all accessories which generated one or more detected stimulations e.g. keyboard mouse microphone tablet GUI and or mobile communication device GUI each providing statistical symbolic results as described above for the keyboard. Although not shown split screen embodiments are contemplated by the present disclosure for the GUI of .

In addition to a symbolic representation as shown in the AMS application can provide the user a means to visualize raw statistics in a table format such as shown in by selecting button . The table format shows raw data in section and possible suggestions in section for improving user performance which can be generated by the AMS application in step . Section can be presented in a table format with a column identifying the key being analyzed its usage and number of key presses. The user can ascertain from this table the most and least frequently used keys as well as other identifiable patterns.

The AMS application can utilize an understanding of the layout of the accessory in this case the keyboard to determine from the statistics ways that the user can improve response time or ergonomic use. For example the AMS application can determine from a layout analysis that the key combination can be reassigned to a macro based on the trigger which could provide the user a faster response time and free up the user s right hand for other tasks. The AMS application can also provide alternative suggestions. For example the AMS application can also suggest creating single button macros for each of the key combinations and which can be assigned to keys on the keyboard or left and right buttons of a mouse. The latter suggestion of assigning macros to the mouse can help the user free up his her left hand.

The AMS application can utilize present and next generation algorithms to determine how to improve response times and ergonomic usage of accessory devices. The AMS application can for example have at its disposal an understanding of the layout of each accessory the type of software being controlled by the accessory e.g. World of Warcraft type of operations commonly used to control the software e.g. known actions as shown in the actions column of an understanding of the associations made by other users e.g. gamers to improve their performance when controlling the software and so on. The AMS application can also be operable to communicate with the active software application by way of an Application Programming Interface API to receive additional usage statistics from the software which it can in turn use to improve the user s performance The AMS application can also utilize common statistical and behavior modeling techniques to predict the behavior of the user and responses from the software application to identify possible ways to improve the user s performance.

The computer devices can be for example laptop computers desktop computers or tablet computers. The computer device can process and execute computer instructions from a software application. In one embodiment the software application is a gaming program where the computer device can present a graphical user interface depicting a gaming scene on a display of or connected to the computer device . The user of the computer device can interact with the gaming program to provide navigational and control directives using any one or a combination of several input devices. For example a user at the computer device can interact with the gaming application using a mouse connected directly or indirectly to the computer device or a keyboard. In one embodiment the computer device can use the AMS application to monitor and capture functional inputs or user stimulations from physical and or virtual accessories coupled to the computer device . For example the AMS application operating from the computer device can capture stimulations from a keyboard or touchpad built into the computer device . The AMS application can process these stimulations and retrieve associated actions comprising substitute stimuli for use by the software application running at the computer device . For example the AMS application at the computer device can capture and process stimulations from a physical accessory such as a mouse device that is coupled to the computer device .

In one embodiment the computer device can be a host computing device for the system. For example the host computing device can execute the gaming application and the AMS application hereinafter referred to as the host AMS application. In one embodiment the host AMS application at the host computer device can capture and process stimulations from a virtual peripheral controller emulated on a mobile communication device A that is coupled to the host computer device . The mobile communication device A is referred to in this illustration as a peripheral computing device A.

For example the mobile communication device A can be communicatively coupled to a computing device executing the AMS application through a wireless link such as WiFi Bluetooth or a cellular link. The mobile communication device A can be a client device executing a client version of the AMS application. The virtual peripheral controller emulated by the mobile communication device can be for example a virtual gaming console controller virtual gaming pad virtual joystick or other recognizable virtual controllers. In one embodiment a graphical user interface on the mobile communication device A can depict user input elements corresponding to the emulated virtual accessory. For example the graphical user interface can depict joystick and button elements consistent with a gaming console controller.

In one embodiment as a user interacts with the virtual peripheral controller on the peripheral computing device A creating user inputs which can be captured and converted into stimuli by a client AMS application operating from the peripheral computing device A. The stimuli can be output from the peripheral computing device A to the host computing device running the server AMS application over the communications link between the devices and A. The server AMS application can process the received stimuli as it does stimuli for other accessory devices as described below. For example the server AMS application can record macro actions corresponding to stimuli from the peripheral computing device A. The server AMS application can pass the stimuli or stimuli substitutes to an operating system of the AMS server for use by a software application running at the server device. The foregoing embodiments are a subset of possible embodiments contemplated by the present disclosure. Other suitable modifications can be applied to the present disclosure.

In one embodiment a mobile communication device B with a virtual peripheral controller can be coupled to a mobile computing device such as a smart pad device. The mobile communication device B and the mobile computing device can be coupled through for example a wireless communication such as Bluetooth WiFi or cellular. The mobile computing device can be configured as a host computing device to execute a software application and the host AMS application. For example the mobile computing device can process a gaming application and present a game space graphical user interface on a built in display. In one embodiment the mobile computing device can display its own virtual controller which a user of the mobile computing device can activate through a touch sensitive screen or by way of physical controls built in to the mobile computing device .

In one embodiment a user can navigate and control the gaming application executed on the mobile computing device using the virtual peripheral controller of the mobile communication device B. A client AMS application at the mobile communication device B can capture user inputs or stimulations from the virtual peripheral controller and can send these stimuli to the host computer device . The host AMS application at the server computer device can process the received stimuli to determine associated actions and if necessary perform macro operations of multiple actions. The processed stimuli are used to navigate and control the software application running at the host computer device .

In one embodiment if a swap request is detected the host computing device can transmit a stream of the game space graphical user interface to the peripheral computing device B. The peripheral computing device can present the streamed graphics on a display associated with the peripheral computing device B. For example if the peripheral computing device B is a mobile phone device the streamed graphics representing the graphical user interface for the gaming application can be displayed on a touch screen built into the phone. In this embodiment the gaming application continues to execute on the host computing device but is displayed on the peripheral computing device B.

In one embodiment the graphical user interface that is streamed to the mobile communication device B can be adapted or transcoded to correspond to features and or limitations of the mobile communication device B. For example the server AMS application can adapt or transcode the graphical user interface to fit a display size resolution or aspect ratio of the mobile communication device B. The mobile communication device B can display the graphical user interface associated with the resumed software application.

In one embodiment the host computing device can present a virtual peripheral controller and at its own display. In one embodiment the virtual peripheral controller can be identical to the virtual peripheral controller formerly presented at the peripheral computing device B. In one embodiment the virtual peripheral controller can be adapted to the features and limitations of the host computing device . In one embodiment the peripheral computing device B can transmit a user profile and or virtual peripheral controller profile to the host computing device so that user settings or other customizations of the virtual peripheral controller can be transferred to the host computing device during the swap. In one embodiment a different type of virtual peripheral controller such as a keyboard can by presented at the host computing device .

In step the computer device can present a graphical user interface at a display communicatively coupled to the computer device. In one embodiment the display can be a display screen associated with a laptop computer or a personal computer.

In step the computer device can monitor a mobile communication device B for user inputs to a virtual peripheral controller that can be emulated by the mobile communication device B. The input functions can correspond for example to depressions of buttons interactions with gaming pads and or movements of navigation device such as joysticks.

In step the computer device can detect a stimulation of a virtual peripheral controller at the mobile communication device B. In one embodiment a client AMS application at the mobile communication device B can monitor for user inputs for navigating or controlling the resumed software application running at the computer device . For example the client AMS application at the mobile communication device B can capture stimulations from a built in keypad or touch screen as a user interacts with the emulated virtual peripheral controller displayed thereon. The client AMS application at the mobile communication device B can transmit the captured stimulations to the computer device by the communication link between the devices.

If a captured stimulation of a remote user input is detected at the computer device then in step the AMS software at the computer device can retrieve an associable action corresponding to the received stimulation. The AMS application can process the received stimuli as it does stimuli for accessory devices directly coupled to the computer device . For example the AMS application can compare the received stimulation to a user configuration to determine if there are pre programmed macro actions or alternative actions associated with the particular stimulation. The AMS application can thereby convert the received stimulation or stimulations into one or more associable actions that are sent to the operating system of the computer device for use by a software application running at the computer device in step .

In step the computer device can detect a request to swap the host and peripheral functions between the devices. For example a user can be playing a gaming program using the mobile communication device B as a virtual peripheral controller . The user can select a pause function by pressing for example a PAUSE button on the virtual peripheral controller . In one embodiment a selection of PAUSE at the host computing device or the peripheral computing device B or either device can be interpreted as a request to swap. In another embodiment another command can be used to initiate a swap. In one embodiment a host AMS application at the computer device can detect the swap request from the mobile communication device B. In embodiment a client AMS application at the mobile communication device B can detect an input at the virtual peripheral controller and transmit a request to swap. The AMS application can compare this stimulation to a user configuration to determine if the swap input is associated with an action or with a macro of a combination of commands to the operating system of the host computer device .

If a swap request is detected in step then the host computing device can transmit a stream of the first graphical user interface to the peripheral computing device B in step . The peripheral computing device B can present the streamed graphics on a display associated with the peripheral computing device B. For example if the peripheral computing device B is a mobile phone device the streamed graphics representing the graphical user interface for the gaming application can be displayed on a touch screen built into the phone. In this embodiment the gaming application continues to execute on the host computing device but is displayed on the peripheral computing device B. In one embodiment the host computing device can cause the streamed graphical user interface depicting the game space to be synchronized to the state of the graphical interface presented at the host computing device prior to the swap. In one embodiment a remote server is used to execute the gaming application. And when the swap request is detected in step the remote server can transmit a stream of the first graphical user interface to the peripheral computer device B.

In step the host computing device can present a virtual peripheral controller and at its own display. In one embodiment the virtual peripheral controller can be identical to the virtual peripheral controller formerly presented at the peripheral computing device B. In one embodiment the virtual peripheral controller can be adapted to the features and limitations of the host computing device . In one embodiment the peripheral computing device B can transmit a user profile and or virtual peripheral controller profile to the host computing device so that user settings or other customizations of the virtual peripheral controller can be transferred to the host computing device during the swap. In one embodiment a different type of virtual peripheral controller such as a keyboard can by presented at the host computing device .

From the foregoing descriptions it would be evident to an artisan with ordinary skill in the art that the aforementioned embodiments can be modified reduced or enhanced without departing from the scope and spirit of the claims described below. In one embodiment the peripheral computing device B can transmit a user profile and or virtual peripheral controller profile to the host computing device so that user settings or other customizations of the virtual peripheral controller can be transferred to the host computing device during the swap. In one embodiment a different type of virtual peripheral controller such as a keyboard can by presented at the host computing device .

In one embodiment the host computing device can transmit to the peripheral computing device B a set of files and or operating parameters corresponding to the present state of the gaming application at the point the swap request was received. For example the host computing device can respond to the swap request by storing the present state of the game as for example would occur if a player executed a save state command during game play. The host computer device can transmit to the peripheral device all the necessary files for initializing the game to the saved state. In one embodiment the peripheral computing device B can execute the software application locally after a swap on the peripheral computing device B by using the initialization information.

In one embodiment a remote server can stream the game space GUI generated by the gaming application to the host computing device and the virtual peripheral control GUI to the peripheral computing device B. In this embodiment the gaming application can be executed by the remote server. The gaming application can be adapted to determine a swap between GUIs without user input. For example the gaming application can detect a change in venue state or other detectable event in the game space. The gaming application can be designed to invoke a switch between GUIs responsive to detecting the change in venue state or other detectable event in the game space. In this embodiment the gaming application operating from the remote server can stream the game space GUI to the peripheral computing device B and the virtual peripheral control GUI to the host computing device . In this illustration the peripheral computing device B can now be referred to as a host computing device while the host computing device can now be referred to as a peripheral computing device.

In one embodiment functions of the AMS application can operate in part at the host computing device and in part at the peripheral computing device B. In one embodiment the gaming application can be executed in whole or in part at the host computing device at the peripheral computing device B a remote server or combinations thereof.

In one embodiment method can be adapted to define more than one programmable layer for an accessory. Such a feature can extend the functionality of an accessory into multi layer paradigms of input functions. The GUI of can be adapted so that a user can specify more than one programmable layer for a specific accessory.

The user can also specify which layer to present in while associating actions. If for instance layer is shown the GUI of can present the actions associated in this layer by presenting descriptors superimposed on the input functions e.g. buttons or keys . When the user switches to layer e.g. by selecting from a drop down menu the layer of interest the accessory can be shown in the GUI with a different set of associated actions. The user can define a macro or identify a key sequence to switch between layers when the accessory is in use.

The trigger for switching between layers can be a toggle function e.g. selecting the tab key on a Qwerty keyboard to switch between layers in a round robin fashion layer layer layer to layer and so on . Alternatively the user can define a hold and release trigger to switch between layers. In this embodiment the user moves to another layer while pressing a button e.g. a Shift key and returns to the preceding layer upon its release. In yet another embodiment the trigger to switch layers can be defined differently per layer. The user can for example select the letter A in layer to proceed to layer and select the letter B in layer to return to layer or proceed to yet another layer . There can be numerous combinations of layers and triggers which can be defined to substantially expand the capability of single accessory. Additionally triggers can be of any kind tactile speech etc.

In another embodiment method can be adapted so that a user can define super macros and or super profiles. A super macro can represent nested macros combinations of macros . Method can be adapted so that the user can customize the timing for executing nested macros. Similarly a super profile can represent nested profiles combinations of profiles . A super profile can for example comprise sub profiles each sub profile defining associations of actions to input functions of a particular accessory.

In yet another embodiment method can be adapted to establish audio profiles for headset accessories. When a user selects a headset accessory the GUI can be adapted to provide the user options to establish a sound output equalizer setting to optimize performance for a particular gaming application. For instance GUI can present an equalizer so that the user can raise the volume of high frequencies to an enemy s footsteps from a longer distance in a gaming application.
