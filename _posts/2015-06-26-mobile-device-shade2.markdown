Various aspects of the inventive concepts will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some exemplary embodiments are shown. The present inventive concept may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein.

It will be understood that although the terms first second etc. are be used herein to describe various elements these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another but not to imply a required sequence of elements. For example a first element can be termed a second element and similarly a second element can be termed a first element without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein the term and or includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being on or connected or coupled to another element it can be directly on or connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements can be present. In contrast when an element is referred to as being directly on or directly connected or directly coupled to another element there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion e.g. between versus directly between adjacent versus directly adjacent etc. .

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms comprises comprising includes and or including when used herein specify the presence of stated features steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

Spatially relative terms such as beneath below lower above upper and the like may be used to describe an element and or feature s relationship to another element s and or feature s as for example illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example if the device in the figures is turned over elements described as below and or beneath other elements or features would then be oriented above the other elements or features. The device may be otherwise oriented e.g. rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.

Exemplary embodiments are described herein with reference to cross sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized exemplary embodiments and intermediate structures . As such variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result for example of manufacturing techniques and or tolerances are to be expected. Thus exemplary embodiments should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result for example from manufacturing.

Various embodiments of shades in accordance with the inventive concepts are shown and describe where the shade can form part of a case within which an electronic mobile device is maintained or a housing that forms part of the electronic mobile device. These are collectively referred to as case herein in a non limiting manner. For example the shade can be part of a mobile phone case that holds a mobile phone or can be part of the housing of the mobile phone. Although a mobile phone is described other electronic devices can equally apply including but not limited to a smart phone tablet personal computer and so on 

In the shade takes an umbrella configuration. With the umbrella embodiment the shade which can comprise center left and right sections or panels can be housed or stowed behind the back side of an electronic device ease or housing or to a surface of the device itself. As shown in steps I III the left and right panels fold over the center section such that the unused folded shade can have overall length and width of the center panel . In various embodiments the dimensions of the folded shade can be less than the length and width of the mobile device or the case housing the mobile device.

The shade can include a state transition mechanism for facilitating the transition of the shade from a stowed state into a deployed state and back again in response to user actuation. For example the shade can include a grip at its top which can be used to pull and deploy the shade. The grip also referred to as a pull can also be used to push the shade back into its stowed location. In other embodiments the shade could include a push device to push the shade up and out of its stowed location. Referring to in this embodiment the pull takes the form of a grip which has grooved plastic that extends above the top of a back side of the case so the shade can be accessed and deployed by pulling up on the grooved plastic. Once the shade is accessed the user can fully extend and adjust the shade for use.

In this embodiment the shade is biased to curve over the device display so that the shade is not straight or linear in its deployed state. The curve configuration can be user manipulated or the shade can have a memory shape depending on materials used to form the shade for example materials that permit modification to the shape of the shade . In other embodiments however the shade could be straight. Also in this embodiment the shade is attached at a pivot which allows the user to reorient the shade from side to side for the most effective use.

In various embodiments as described above the shade is made of a flexible bendable material. The material may be substantially opaque to be an effective shade or filter of sunlight or other bright light. The shade can also be made of a waterproof or water resistant material to provide protection against the elements e.g. precipitation.

As shown in the shade panels can be pulled by a user to extend in a direction of extension of the mobile device then spread apart similar to cards in a card deck. The In particular sections and can be attached at a pivot point at section and can fan out relative to each other from the pivot point as shown in . At least the center shade panel is made of a flexible bendable material permitting the shade panels to be positioned over at least part of the device display .

In this embodiment an outside edge of the top panel has a ridge or grip that the user can grasp and pull to access and deploy the panels desired for use. The other panels are shown with similar ridges. Once accessed the hinged panels can be angled to user preference for degree and angle of shade. Therefore the hinges preferably offer some resistance or have preset lock in setting so that they maintain the user desired positioning.

The fan shade is stowed in the spine that runs down the center of the vertical back side of the device case. In other embodiments the spine and fan shade can be stowed off center on or in at containment mechanism at the back side of the case or at a side of the case . In this embodiment the spine includes a hinge at the narrow top edge so that upon access it can be pulled upward and fanned outward to the desired degree of coverage and angulation.

The panels can be configured to snap closed in a stacked formation on the back side of the case when not in use. To access each panel the user simply pulls each panel outward according to preference for degree and angle of shade. The hinges for example hinges can have several lock in place settings or sufficient built in resistance to allow each panel to stay in the position desired.

In various embodiments the inside of the panels can have a flat finish to provide maximum contrast reduce glare and improve visibility such as a flat black finish. This can be true of the other embodiments described herein as well. The exterior of the panels can offer creative flexibility for finish and design e.g. for branding and or personalization as shown.

In various embodiments one or more of the panels can have protrusions or tabs that facilitate opening and or closing of the shade panels from an undeployed state to a deployed fanned state e.g. as in . For example left and right panels A C can each have a tab A B as shown. Other mechanisms for enabling finger engagement can be provided in other embodiments which may or may not include such tabs or protrusions. As examples these other mechanisms could include one or more of depressions lips ridges hooks or textures integral with or coupled to one or more of the panels which could optionally be used in combination with tabs in some embodiments.

In this embodiment the three panels are layered so that the two top most panels are right and left panels and the bottom or distal panel is a center panel which is closest to the display screen . In other embodiments the arrangement or layering of the panels could be reversed so that the center panel is on top. And in yet other embodiments the center panel B could be layered between the left A and right side C panels. Returning to the present embodiment the one or both of the side panels A C can be spread to the right and left respectively and extend from the center panel B to collectively form an expanded or fanned shade. show the 3 panels A C opened i.e. spread apart similar to cards in a card deck although the shade is yet to be rotated away from the mobile device for display screen use in this figure.

In the embodiments shown when the user opens shade at the top hinge such as by rotating the shade panels about the rod see forming at least part of the hinge to be away from the display screen of the mobile device the layered panels can be maintained at one of several fixed angles at stop positions built in to the hinge . A stop position is a hinge mechanism that maintains the shade assembly in a predetermined rotational orientation relative to the mobile device or case . This can be accomplished by various types of mechanisms that increase resistance at each stop position. It can be achieved using various types of hinge devices such as seats gears tongue and groove mechanism as well as by other means known in the art. As shown in the example of the hinge can include slots corresponding to preset stop positions wherein a proximal end of the shade assembly that connects to the hinge or that includes a portion of the hinge slides into a slot to lock the shade at the corresponding stop position angle. A hinge can have more than one stop position setting.

The shade assembly panels can be deployed or locked a desired position relative to the mobile device . For example and E show the shade assembly panels deployed at a 45 degree position relative to the display screen of the mobile device which could be set in the hinge as a stop position. The hinge could be implemented in configurations that permit other or different stop positions such as at 90 degrees or other angles relative to the display screen surface or face of the mobile device. Beyond any stop positions at angles related to the display the hinge and more specifically the rod extending from holes in either side of a base through an outer edge of the top portion can be made to enable rotation of the shade at virtually any angle to a user selected position or angle 0 degrees to 360 degrees with respect to the display screen . In some embodiments the base and top portion can be configured such that the top portion has some lateral freedom of movement on rod as indicated by the double arrow in .

Also as shown in and the base having can be movably attached to a pivot post see extending from the extendable portion to form another pivot point. In the base and extendable portion each extend along the same direction of extension as the mobile device so that the hinge of the base is proximal a top or head region of the mobile device However as shown in the base can pivot or swivel about the pivot post relative to the stationary extendable portion for example in a clockwise direction about the periphery of the mobile device . In the base is about 45 degrees relative to the direction of extension of the mobile device and extendable portion . In the base is 90 degrees relative to the direction of extension of the mobile device and extendable portion . Accordingly shows the shade assembly in a layered configuration can rotate 180 degrees or more relative to the display screen of the mobile device . Therefore the hinge preferably provides sufficient resistance to maintain the shade assembly in various user selected positions within a range of positions. in particular the hinge or more specifically the rod extends along of a first axis that permits that panels to move at an angle relative to the display . The pivot post can extend along a second axis orthogonal to the first axis so that the panels and base can be rotatable to the extendable portion .

A user can deploy the shade assembly without opening the panels A C. Here the shade assembly is rotated away from the display screen of the mobile device without opening i.e. fanning out or separating from each other the panels A C. In such instances opening any or all the shade panels may not be required e.g. if no glare is present so the shade assembly can be easily rotated out of the way. In various embodiments the shade assembly could be biased on a closed undeployed position. Or there may be sufficient resistance in the hinge that the shade assembly need not be biased to maintain itself in the closed position. The closed shade protects the display screen . So when not in use the shade panels can still serve as a protective cover for the display screen .

In some embodiments the top portion is coupled to the panels of the shade assembly via the hinge . Therefore in this embodiment the shade apparatus is a separate component configured to attach to the mobile device. It could be configured to attach to the mobile device for example clip to the device couple to the device via a magnet or other coupling mechanism when the mobile device is not in a case or when it is in a case. In some embodiments therefore the hinged shade and base mechanism can form a clip arrangement that keeps the shade on the mobile device. In other embodiments the shade apparatus can be built into a mobile device case as an example or attachable to a mobile device case Therefore in various embodiments the base can be a mobile device case that fully or substantially encases a body of the mobile device. The shade assembly can be removably or permanently attached to the base whether the base takes to form of a mobile device ease or not e.g. as shown herein .

In this embodiment the mobile device shade can be removably coupled to the mobile device in a variety of orientations to accommodate different glare angles or different display orientations e.g. portrait or landscape. The mobile device shade hinge and panels can be rotated or otherwise migrated from the top of the mobile device to a side of the mobile device while remaining coupled to the mobile device. In other embodiments the base mechanism can move with the panels of the shade assembly .

In embodiments where the base is integrated with or otherwise part of a mobile device case the attachment of the hinge and shade assembly to the mobile device case can include a pivot element such as rod that enables the panels of the shade assembly to pivot relative to the base and or mobile device to achieve the various orientations mentioned see for example .

Also as described above another pivot point may be formed between the base and the extendable portion . At the second pivot point a user can angle the shade further to the right or left of the mobile device to provide desired coverage against various angles of overhead light as an example. The pivot could further be configured to allow the user to position the shade in a landscape orientation over the mobile device or at intermediate orientations between portrait and landscape. The shade panel can also be rotated backward and held to the rear of the device e.g. out of the way according to user preference.

In particular each of the intermediate panels here the right and left panels A C respectively includes or defines an opening or hole so that the post of the panel support can pass through the opening and be maintained within the well of the distal panel. Additionally a proximal edge of each of the right C and left A panels can be curved and the panel support and distal panel here the center panel can each include a depression having a corresponding curve profile so that when assembled the intermediate panels are maintained within the depressions while still being rotatable around the post of the panel support . The curvature of the intermediate panels and depressions enable a smooth clean controlled and well bounded rotation of the right C and left A panels.

Additionally one or more stabilizing mechanisms not shown may be provided between the panel support and the distal here center panel B to create a secure mating and fit between the two. In this embodiment the panel support includes one or posts that do not interfere with the rotatable intermediate panels A C and that mate with one or more wells recesses or depressions of the distal panel B.

Also shown in FIG N is the hinge which is formed between the base and the distal panel B which is the bottom center panel in this embodiment. Each of the base and distal panel comprise portions of a rod channel through which a rod is disposed when the portions of the channel from the base and distal panel are properly aligned With the rod in place in the channel the shade panels can rotate with respect to the base . In other embodiments different types of hinges and or hinge components can be used so long as they are structured and arranged to achieve the desired rotational movement. Such hinges may enable other types of movement as well 

The shade includes a base comprising a first portion and a second portion . The first portion can be movable relative to the second portion . For example the second portion can include a pivot post about which the first portion can rotate Also the shade can include a plurality of shade panels constructed and arranged in accordance with embodiments described herein. A hinge can be positioned between the base and the panels so that that panels can move relative to the base for example rotate at least partially about an axle along which the hinge extends. In particular the hinge can extend along of a first axis that permits that panels to move at an angle relative to the mobile device . The pivot post can extend along a second axis orthogonal to the first axis so that the panels and first portion can be rotatable to the second portion and the device .

As described in other embodiments herein a shade can be integrated with a mobile device case or the mobile device itself. In the embodiments illustrated in provided is the capability to remove the shade entirely from the case or otherwise separate the shade from the mobile device when not in use or otherwise desired. This can be accomplished in any number of ways.

In one embodiment the shade is attached to an abbreviated case like structure which in turn can slide on and off or otherwise be removed from an ordinary phone case. In another embodiment the shade can include a clip or related device for removably coupling the detachable shade to the case and or mobile device. In another embodiment the shade can include a flexible covering that replaces some or all of the base for example the first portion and or second portion and stretches over the case Other related attachments can equally apply for removably coupling the shade to the case and or mobile device. Here the shade can be in its entirety stored in a purse pocket bag or other small storage location.

While the foregoing has described what are considered to be the best mode and or other preferred embodiments it is understood that various modifications can be made therein and that the invention or inventions may be implemented in various forms and embodiments and that they may be applied in numerous applications only some of which have been described herein. It is intended by the following claims to claim that which is literally described and all equivalents thereto including all modifications and variations that fall within the scope of each claim.
