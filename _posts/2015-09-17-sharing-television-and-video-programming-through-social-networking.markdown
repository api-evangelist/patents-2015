In particular embodiments user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over social networking system . In particular embodiments social networking system may be a network addressable computing system hosting an online social network. Social networking system may generate store receive and send social networking data such as for example user profile data concept profile data social graph information or other suitable data related to the online social network. Social networking system may be accessed by the other components of network environment either directly or via network . In particular embodiments social networking system may include an authorization server that allows users to opt in or opt out of having their actions logged by social networking system or shared with other systems e.g. third party systems such as for example by setting appropriate privacy settings. In particular embodiments third party system may be a network addressable computing system that can host websites that embed data from social networking system . Third party system may be accessed by the other components of network environment either directly or via network . In particular embodiments one or more users may use one or more client systems to access send data to and receive data from social networking system or third party system . Client system may access social networking system or third party system directly via network or via a third party system. As an example and not by way of limitation client system may access third party system via social networking system . Client system may be any suitable computing device such as for example a personal computer a laptop computer a cellular telephone a smartphone or a tablet computer.

This disclosure contemplates any suitable network . As an example and not by way of limitation one or more portions of network may include an ad hoc network an intranet an extranet a virtual private network VPN a local area network LAN a wireless LAN WLAN a wide area network WAN a wireless WAN WWAN a metropolitan area network MAN a portion of the Internet a portion of the Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN a cellular telephone network or a combination of two or more of these. Network may include one or more networks .

Links may connect client system social networking system and third party system to communication network or to each other. This disclosure contemplates any suitable links . In particular embodiments one or more links include one or more wireline such as for example Digital Subscriber Line DSL or Data over Cable Service Interface Specification DOCSIS wireless such as for example Wi Fi or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX or optical such as for example Synchronous Optical Network SONET or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SDH links. In particular embodiments one or more links each include an ad hoc network an intranet an extranet a VPN a LAN a WLAN a WAN a WWAN a MAN a portion of the Internet a portion of the PSTN a cellular technology based network a satellite communications technology based network another link or a combination of two or more such links . Links need not necessarily be the same throughout network environment . One or more first links may differ in one or more respects from one or more second links .

As described above in conjunction with the social networking system comprises a computing system that allows users to communicate or otherwise interact with each other and access content as described herein. The social networking system stores user profiles describing the users of a social network in a user profile store . The user profiles include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history hobbies or preferences interests location and the like. For example the user profile store contains data structures with fields suitable for describing a user s profile. When a new object of a particular type is created the social networking system initializes a new data structure i.e. a node of the corresponding type assigns a unique object identifier to it and begins to add data to the object as needed. This might occur for example when a user becomes a user of the social networking system the social networking system generates a new instance of a user profile in the user profile store assigns a unique identifier to the user profile and begins to populate the fields of the user profile with information provided by the user.

In addition the user profile store may include data structures suitable for describing a user s demographic data behavioral data and other social data. Demographic data typically includes data about the user such as age gender location etc. e.g. as included in the user s profile. Behavioral data typically includes information about the user s activities within the social networking system such as specific actions posts likes comments etc. activity levels usage statistics etc. Other social data comprises information about the user from within the social networking system that is not strictly demographic or behavioral such as interests or affinities etc. In one embodiment user s interests may be explicitly specified in the user s profile or interests that may be inferred from the user s activities in the social networking system e.g. uploaded content postings reading of messages etc . Additionally the user profile store includes logic for maintaining user interest information for users according to one or more categories. Categories may be general or specific e.g. if a user likes an article about a brand of shoes the category may be the brand or the general category of shoes or clothing. Multiple categories may apply to a single user interest. In addition the user profile store may be accessed by other aspects of the social networking system .

For example the user profile store includes logic for maintaining interest information for users according to one or more categories. Categories may be general or specific e.g. if a user likes an article about a brand of shoes the category may be the brand or the general category of shoes or clothing. Multiple categories may apply to a single user interest. In addition the user profile store may be accessed by other aspects of the social networking system .

The social networking system further stores data describing one or more connections between different users in a user connection store . The connection information may indicate users who have similar or common work experience group memberships hobbies educational history or are in any way related or share common attributes. Additionally the social networking system includes user defined connections between different users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example user defined connections allow users to generate relationships with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Users may select from predefined types of connections or define their own connection types as needed. The connection store includes data structures suitable for describing a user s connections to other users connections to third party content object providers or connections to other entities. The connection stores may also associate a connection type with a user s connections which may be used in conjunction with the user s privacy setting to regulate access to information about the user. In addition the connection store may be accessed by other aspects of the social networking system .

The web server links the social networking system to one or more client devices and or one or more third party content object providers via the network . The web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as Java Flash XML and so forth. The web server may include a mail server or other messaging functionality for receiving and routing messages between the social networking system and one or more client devices . The messages can be instant messages queued messages e.g. email text and SMS messages or any other suitable messaging format.

The Application Programming Interface API request server allows one or more third party content object providers to access information from the social networking system by calling one or more APIs. The API request server also may allow third party content object providers to send information to the social networking system by calling APIs. For example a third party content object provider sends an API request to the social networking system via the network and the API request server receives the API request. The API request server processes the request by calling an API associated with the API request to generate an appropriate response which the API request server communicates to the third party content object provider via the network .

The action logger is capable of receiving communications from the web server about user actions on and or off the social networking system . The action logger populates the action log with information about user actions allowing the social networking system to track or monitor various actions taken by its users within the social networking system and outside of the social networking system . Any action that a particular user takes with respect to another user is associated with each user s profile through information maintained in the action log or in a similar database or other data repository. Examples of actions taken by a user within the social network that are identified and stored may include for example adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user attending an event posted by another user or other actions interacting with another user. When a user takes an action within the social networking system the action is recorded in the action log . In one embodiment the social networking system maintains the action log as a database of entries. When an action is taken within the social networking system an entry for the action is added to the action log . The relevance and ranking engine includes logic for calculating a relevance score for content objects including both user generated content objects and third party content objects relative to a user for ranking the content objects by their relevance scores and for selecting content objects for sending to users as notifications or as responses to user requests. To calculate the relevance score the relevance and ranking engine determines a location value by comparing the content object location and a current location for the user device determines an interest value based on whether the content object categories are included in the user s interests determines a time value based on whether the current time is within the delivery time range for the content object and determines a connection value based on how many of the user s connections are associated with the content object. Then the relevance and ranking engine combines the location value interest value connection value and time value to determine the relevance score for the content object with respect to the user. In one embodiment the values are higher for a better fit closer proximity great similarity etc. and approach a value of one and are multiplied together to yield the relevance score. From the relevance scores for each content object the relevance and ranking engine ranks the content objects for a user e.g. from highest relevance score to lowest. The relevance and ranking engine then can select content objects to send to a notification controller or can serve the highest ranked content object directly to the client device as a notification s .

The content object classifier includes logic for assigning each of the content objects a location a category and a delivery time range. Categories may reflect various categories of user interests and may be associated with the interests themselves e.g. a user likes an article about a brand of shoes and the category is the brand or the article about the shoe brand is assigned a general category of shoes or clothing. Multiple categories may apply to a single content object. General or specific locations may be assigned to content objects as well e.g. a city a particular street name or intersection or GPS coordinates. A delivery time range is assigned to each content object e.g. using a useful range based on the hours the associated business is open.

Additionally user actions may be associated with exposure to third party content objects from one or more third party content object providers . Thus in conjunction with the action log a third party content object log is maintained of user exposures to such objects and when the last exposure occurred. The action logger receives data describing a user s interaction with an object and stores it to the third party content object log . The third party content object log includes logic for storing user exposures to third party content objects and associations between users and objects. The exposure information can be used to determine whether to expose the user to the same or similar content objects and for adjusting the ranking and selection of content objects on the basis of whether the user previously has been exposed to the same or similar content object. In addition if a user becomes associated with a content object via an action e.g. uses an incentive goes to the location etc. that information also is stored and can be used for re ranking and re selecting the content objects.

The notification controller provides information regarding content objects to the client device . Information may be pushed to the client device as notifications or information may be pulled to the user device responsive to a request received from the client device . In the push circumstance notifications of content objects are initially pushed according to a default rate. Based on user engagement with the notifications the notification controller may adjust the rate in which notifications are provided to the client device . By adjusting the initial settings the notification controller provides notifications of content objects to the client device when the user is more likely to engage with the notifications. Information may be pulled to the user device at any time. Additionally the type of content that is provided to the client device may be updated based on the user engagement.

The authorization server enforces one or more privacy settings of the users of the social networking system . A privacy setting of a user determines how particular information associated with a user can be shared. The privacy setting comprises the specification of particular information associated with a user and the specification of the entity or entities with whom the information can be shared. Examples of entities with which information can be shared may include other users applications external websites or any entity that can potentially access the information. The information that can be shared by a user comprises user profile information like profile photo phone numbers associated with the user user s connections actions taken by the user such as adding a connection changing user profile information and the like.

The useful social information that is tracked and maintained by a social networking system can be thought of in terms of a social graph which includes a plurality of nodes that are interconnected by a plurality of edges. Each node in the social graph may represent something that can act on and or be acted upon by another node. Common examples of nodes include users non person entities content objects groups events messages concepts and any other things that can be represented by an object in a social networking system. An edge between two nodes in the social graph represents a particular kind of connection between the two nodes which may result from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node.

The social networking system may receive a request to associate the web content with a node in the social networking system . An external website e.g. of the third party content object provider incorporates a tag into the markup language document for the web page s of the web content to claim ownership of the pages domain in the context of the social networking system . In some cases an entire domain or collection of web pages is associated with a unique identifier that associates the web pages with a node. Once established the social networking system tracks data associated with the node in the action log .

Data stored in the connection store the user profile store and the action log allows the social networking system to generate a social graph that uses nodes to identify various objects and edges connecting nodes to identify relationships between different objects. An edge between two nodes in the social graph represents a particular kind of connection between the two nodes which may result from an action that was performed by one of the nodes on the other node.

The third party content object store stores content objects received from third parties. The third party content objects include informational content objects such as movie show times restaurant menus etc. as well as incentive content objects such as coupons discount tickets gift certificates etc. In addition some third party content objects may include a combination of information and incentives.

The location store stores location information received from client devices associated with users. The location information used by the social networking system may be obtained directly from client devices e.g. at the time a notification is to be sent or at various predetermined time intervals or the location information may be a last stored location received from the client device . In addition the location store may receive updated location information e.g. in response to a change in the location of a client device . In one embodiment if an updated location is received the updated location is provided to the relevance and ranking engine for re ranking and or re selecting the third party content objects in view of the updated location information.

In general the selection or ranking of content objects may occur at varying intervals based on several variables such as always at the beginning of a period during which a notification would be served or every X minutes during a period during which notifications will be served or every X minutes all the time e.g. so that it s ready when a search happens only in response to a change in location or expiration of a delivery time for a content object etc. Alternatively the ranking of content objects may occur as a result of user demand. The user may explicitly request the ranking by submitting a request for relevant information happening within the vicinity of the user. The request may be received in response to user selection of a refresh element included in a user application associated with the present disclosure. The request may also be implicit. For example upon launching of the user application a request may be automatically received for the ranking.

The social networking system implements context search using a context search module . Context search results are search results that are relevant to the user based on their current location as well as their social information. In this way the context search results are tailored to the user s interests connections and location at the time of the search. The context search module incorporates location information search results and relevance score information obtained from the relevance and ranking engine in order to provide a ranked list of search results and or for selection of third party content objects as the basis for serving notifications.

The ad pricing module combines social information the current time and location information to provide relevant advertisements in the form of notifications to a user. Advertisements of increased relevance to a user are more likely to result in a purchase. Dividing consumers according to their interests based on social information allows merchants to calculate the value of their potential customers. Advertisements provided through the social networking system may be priced according to the value of the customer to the merchant as indicated by their social information.

In one embodiment the UI or User Interface module is configured to display a map containing pins on a client device where each pin represents a content object in actionable proximity to a user e.g. a nearby friend deal etc. . The content objects selected to be presented as pins to the user are those content objects with sufficiently high relevance scores. Multiple pins for a nearby area can be clustered. The UI module provides the user with the ability to switch between zoom levels for the map thereby showing pins at varying distances from the user s current location e.g. nearby close and far . In one embodiment the zoom levels are based on the existence of relevant content rather than being predetermined distances from the user.

In one embodiment the UI module is configured to display a ranked list of search results on a client device that have been ranked by the context search module . The UI module is additionally configured to generate an advertisement dashboard for merchants advertising through the social networking system . The advertisement dashboard allows merchants to control the distribution and price they pay for their advertisements. For both functions the UI module is configured to generate a user interface that a client device or a third party content object provider or merchant may interact with.

An inference module determines overlapping interests between users in the social networking system . By determining the overlapping interests between a user and his or her friends the inference module may identify which interests may be imputed to the user based on the interests of the user s friends. Thus through the user s friends the inference module allows the social networking system to identify interests for the user that are not explicitly indicated by the user.

The third party content object store stores content objects received from third parties. The third party content objects include informational content objects such as movie show times movie reviews restaurant reviews restaurant menus product information and reviews etc. as well as incentive content objects such as coupons discount tickets gift certificates etc. In addition some third party content objects may include a combination of information and incentives.

The location store stores location information received from user devices associated with users. The location information used by the social networking system may be obtained directly from client devices e.g. at the time a notification is to be sent or at various predetermined time intervals or the location information may be a last stored location received from the client device . The location information may also be obtained along with a request from a user. In addition the location store may receive updated location information e.g. in response to a change in the location of a client device . In one embodiment if an updated location is received the updated location is provided to the relevance and ranking engine for re ranking and or re selection of the content objects in view of the updated location information.

In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to a user of social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation a user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over social networking system . In particular embodiments when a user registers for an account with social networking system social networking system may create a user node corresponding to the user and store the user node in one or more data stores. Users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to registered users and user nodes associated with registered users. In addition or as an alternative users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to users that have not registered with social networking system . In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with information provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation a user may provide his or her name profile picture contact information birth date sex marital status family status employment education background preferences interests or other demographic information. In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with a user. In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to one or more webpages or one or more user profile pages which may be webpages .

In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to a concept. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept may correspond to a place such as for example a movie theater restaurant landmark or city a website such as for example a website associated with social network system or a third party website associated with a web application server an entity such as for example a person business group sports team or celebrity a resource such as for example an audio file video file digital photo text file structured document or application which may be located within social networking system or on an external server such as a web application server real or intellectual property such as for example a sculpture painting movie game song idea photograph or written work a game an activity an idea or theory another suitable concept or two or more such concepts. A concept node may be associated with information of a concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation information of a concept may include a name or a title one or more images e.g. an image of the cover page of a book a location e.g. an address or a geographical location a website which may be associated with a URL contact information e.g. a phone number or an email address other suitable concept information or any suitable combination of such information. In particular embodiments a concept node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node . In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to a webpage.

In particular embodiments a node in social graph may represent or be represented by a webpage which may be referred to as a profile page . Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may send a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In general a user s social connections or activities can be used to customize or personalize the user s experience with a social TV viewing system such as the system of . Some embodiments may utilize methods to customize a user s experience as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 759 676 entitled Token Activated Federated Access to Social Network Information which is incorporated herein by reference. In particular embodiments connected devices receive content from MSOs or OTT providers while receiving or sending social data to social networking system . For example a user watching a particular TV show or movie on either service may choose to share that he or she is currently viewing the program to his or her friends. Conversely a user browsing the Electronic Programming Guide EPG of an MSO or the content navigator of an OTT provider may be presented with social data including the content that his or her friends on social networking system have watched are currently watching or plan to watch. Thus after exchanging auth messages with social networking system to authenticate the user s social networking identity with his or her connected device connected devices may receive discover messages that identify content being consumed or watched by his or her friends on the social network and send share messages to inform social networking system of what the user has is or plans to watch or consume. Although depicts these messages as being sent directly between social networking system and connected devices in particular embodiments authorization share and discover messages and may be exchanged between the provider from which content is being accessed namely MSOs and OTT providers . This disclosure contemplates any suitable means of routing messages from viewing devices to social networking system .

Although increasingly rare there are scenarios wherein a particular user of the social networking system has no means of linking his TV or viewing device to social networking system . Unconnected devices lack any means of connecting to Internet network . For example a user may not have a local ISP and only TV service from an MSO. As another example a user may have both cable service from an MSO as well as internet access from a local ISP but his or her STB may not include a NIC. In such configurations MSO communicates authorization share and discover messages with social networking system and unconnected devices communicate via STB only with MSOs .

In particular embodiments content may be delivered to user devices and tagged with content identifiers and metadata. For example Comcast may utilize its own proprietary EPG data format that lists the program name air date actors producer director etc. In particular embodiments content providers and may obtain content identifiers and metadata from content databases such as the Rovi Corporation. Each particular piece of content may be sent from devices or in particular embodiments via content providers and as graph data including a graph object and graph action. As previously discussed social networking system may de duplicate graph data for the same graph object in a graph data store by comparing various attributes about the content object for example name actors duration air date etc. Thus social networking system may attribute graph data sent from Hulu that a particular user watched the critically acclaimed feature film The Marine to the same graph object as a user currently watching The Marine on Comcast digital cable irrespective of the source and format of the content metadata.

At consumption sharing phase user consumes content by watching or queuing video content and shares a story of the consumption with social networking system . In particular embodiments user may explicitly share a story of her consumption of the content with social networking system by actively selecting sharing buttons on a user interface. In particular embodiments sharing occurs passively without user selection. When stories of content consumption by user are sent to social networking system the friends of user may view the sharing stories thereby discovering new content to consume. In particular embodiments user may specify which of her friends may view her consumption stories. In particular embodiments user may have different privacy settings for actively and passively shared consumption stories

At discovery phase user may view consumption stories published by her friends . As previously stated the ability of user to view consumption stories published by the user s friends depends on the privacy settings of each individual user . Thus the conceptual framework of describes a cycle where users are constantly discovering new content shared by their friends consuming content and sharing content with their friends. Hence the user experience both on and off social networking system is enhanced.

In particular embodiments consumption stories are not pushed to distribution services but rather the service issues a request to social networking system to query the social graph. For example when a user logs into the clicker website with their social networking ID a script of a plug in embedded in the markup language delivered to the user device may issue a query to the social graph containing the user s social networking identifier. In response social networking system may return all the user s friends consumption stories and the plug in may display the consumption stories on a predetermined portion of the page. In particular embodiments the third party system is responsible for mapping social graph content identifiers received from social networking system to content on its own website.

As another example when a user accesses a mobile application on his or her mobile device such as an iPhone or iPad the application may issue a query to the social graph for consumption stories of the friend whose account is associated with the mobile device. In particular embodiments social networking system is responsible for the mapping from social graph content identifiers to the content identifiers used by third party system . For example if a user accesses his or her programming guide on her AT T U Verse service the social networking system may return data that associates published consumption stories with programs within the programming guide.

In some embodiments user may authorize social networking system to directly control the user s DVR or STB. For example a user s STB gateway may include a DVR for recording TV shows or other content for later viewing. User may indicate to social networking system one or more preferences regarding to what extent social networking system is authorized to directly control content that is recorded on the user s DVR. In one embodiment the preferences include an authorization for social networking system to directly program the user s DVR to record TV shows or other content based on what friends of user are currently watching or plan to watch. For example social networking system may determine from posts of friends on social networking system that at least one friend is currently watching or planning to watch the show Lone Survivor. An example of a post may be I can t wait to watch Lone Survivor tonight. If user has authorized social networking system to directly control his DVR social networking system sends instructions to the user s DVR to record the show Lone Survivor. In certain embodiments this may include determining a particular start time channel and duration for the show Lone Survivor and then sending instructions to the user s DVR to begin recording the determined channel at the determined start time and for the determined duration. In some embodiments the particular start time channel and duration of known shows may be determined by communicating with MSOs OTT providers or content databases .

In another example user may indicate an authorization for social networking system to directly program the user s DVR to record TV shows or other content based on the posts of user . For example social networking system may determine from posts of user that the user is interested in the show Lone Survivor. An example of a post by user may be a comment such as that show looks interesting that is made in response to a friend s post about the show Lone Survivor. If user has authorized social networking system to directly control his DVR based on posts of user social networking system sends instructions to the user s DVR to record the show Lone Survivor as described above.

In another example user may indicate an authorization for social networking system to directly control the user s STB to view TV shows or other content based on content that is shared with user by other users e.g. friends . For example social networking system may determine that a friend of user has shared the show Lone Survivor with user . If user has authorized social networking system to directly control his STB based on content shared by his friends social networking system may send instructions to the STB of user to view the show Lone Survivor. This may include for example tuning to the appropriate channel to view Lone Survivor. 

In some embodiments user may indicate a preference that social networking system seeks the user s permission before directly programming the user s DVR. For example once social networking system determines that at least one friend of user is currently watching or is planning to watch a particular TV show social networking system may send an authorization message to user recommending that user records the particular TV show. As a specific example for illustrative purposes only a particular friend of user may post the message I can t wait to watch Lone Survivor tonight to social networking system . Social networking system may then notify user that his friend is planning to watch Lone Survivor. In certain embodiments the notification may be via email text messaging a post on social networking system or any other appropriate method. The notification may also include a request for user to authorize social networking system to automatically record Lone Survivor for the user. For example the notification may include a hyperlink button or any other appropriate method that allows the user to easily approve social networking system to record the show. If the user takes the appropriate steps to authorize social networking system to record the show social networking system sends instructions to the user s DVR to record the show Lone Survivor as discussed above. If the user does not take the appropriate steps to authorize social networking system to record the show social networking system does not send instructions to the user s DVR to record the show Lone Survivor. 

In certain embodiments user may authorize one or more friends to directly control what is recorded on the user s DVR. For example user may indicate to social networking system that certain friends are authorized to recommend shows to record on the user s DVR. As a specific example for illustrative purposes only user may indicate to social networking system that friend is authorized to record shows on the DVR of user . Friend may then interact with social networking system using for example a web browser or mobile application to indicate to social networking system that he would like for user to view Lone Survivor. For example friend may send a message to user telling user the he is planning to watch Lone Survivor or inviting or inviting user to watch Lone Survivor that friend is currently watching. In some circumstances however user may not view the message or interact with the invite before the show airs or after a certain period of time . In such circumstances social networking system may determine that user will not be able to view or record the show and thus take action to record the show for user . To do this social networking system may determine a particular start time channel and duration for the show Lone Survivor and then send instructions to the DVR of user to begin recording the determined channel at the determined start time and for the determined duration. As a result user and friend may each view the same show and may subsequently interact via social networking system about the show. Thus the social interaction between user and friend may be improved.

In some embodiments social networking system may send instructions to a user s STB to pause the current show that is being viewed by user based on interactions of the user with social networking system . For example if user is interacting with social networking system via another client system social networking system may detect this interaction and send instructions to STB gateway of user to pause the current TV show that is being viewed. As one example for illustrative purposes only user may be interacting with social networking system via a smartphone to for example post messages to social networking system . If social networking system determines that user has posted to social networking system more than a predetermined number of times within a predetermined period of time social networking system may determine that user is not currently viewing the particular TV show and thus send instructions to STB gateway of user to pause the TV show. As another example user may be chatting with friends using a chat program of social networking system . Social networking system may detect that user is interacting with the chat program more than a predetermined amount of time or has typed more than a predetermined amount of text into the chat program and thus send instructions to STB gateway of user to pause any program that is currently being viewed by the user.

In one embodiment social networking system may send instructions to STB gateway of user to mute or pause the TV when user receives a phone call. For example a mobile app of the social networking system running on a smartphone of user may detect that user has received a phone call. The mobile app may then send an indication of the phone call to social networking system . Social networking system may then send instructions to STB gateway of user to pause or mute the current TV show. As a result user may be able to focus on the phone call without having to worry about manually pausing or muting the TV.

At step one or more social actions of one or more second users of the social networking system are determined. In certain embodiments the one or more second users refer to friends described above. In some embodiments the one or more second users are associated with a user node in the social graph of step . In some embodiments the user nodes of the one or more second users are connected to a user node associated with the first user by one or more edges in the social graph. In certain embodiments the determined social actions of step are related to current or future content consumption by either the second users or the first user. For example the determined social actions may refer to posts by the first or second users to the social networking system. In some embodiments the posts may indicate particular content such as a TV show or movie that the user is currently watching is planning to watch is liked by the user or looks interesting to the user. In certain embodiments the determined social actions of step refer to any interaction by the first user with the social networking system. For example the social actions may refer to interacting with a chat program of the social networking system posting messages to the social networking system receiving a phone call on a mobile device in which an app of the social networking system is running and the like.

At step one or more instructions for the STB of the first user are determined based at least in part on the social actions of step . For example in embodiments where the social actions of step refer to current or future content consumption such as posts that indicate that a user is currently watching or is planning to watch a particular TV show the determined one or more instructions for the STB may include instructions to record or view the particular TV show. As another example in embodiments where the social actions of step refer to interactions with the social networking system such as a user typing in a chat session the determined one or more instructions for the STB may include instructions to pause the TV show currently being viewed by the user. As yet another example in embodiments where the social actions of step refer to a mobile app of the social networking system detecting that a user has received a phone call on a mobile device the determined one or more instructions for the STB may include instructions to pause or mute the TV show currently being viewed by the user. While particular scenarios and instructions have been discussed the disclosure anticipates any appropriate instruction being determined based on users social actions.

At step the instructions determined in step are provided for the STB of the first user. In one embodiment the instructions are provided by social networking system directly to the DVR or STB of the first user via network .

In some embodiments top frame is a composite overlay image that is placed on top of incoming video frame . In certain embodiments top frame is a transparent window that includes a social area . Social area may be a painted portion of top frame and may comprise a portion of top frame e.g. a small corner or may fill up the entire top frame . Social area may be opaque or semi transparent.

In some embodiments social area may be painted directly on incoming video frame . In such embodiments social TV dongle may not create top frame . Instead any appropriate technology such as frame buffering may be utilized to draw social area directly on incoming video frame . By drawing social area directly on incoming video frame social TV dongle may create output frame for display on TV .

In some embodiments social area may include any social content from social networking system such as social content discussed above. For example social area may include advertisements notifications newsfeeds tickers chat sessions or any other appropriate social content from social networking system . In the illustrated embodiment of for example social area includes social content from social networking system indicating that Friend A and two other friends of user are currently watching the show being viewed by user . In some embodiments social area may include a facepile e.g. multiple photos of users of social networking system .

In some embodiments social TV dongle may deduce what is important in incoming video frame before determining where to place social area . In general social TV dongle may perform this function in order to avoid placing social area on top of an important area of the viewing screen. For example if user is viewing a singing competition show in which a voting telephone number is displayed on the TV screen social TV dongle may detect the telephone number and avoid placing social area on top of the telephone number or any location that would obstruct the telephone number. As another example if user is viewing a sporting event in which sports scores are scrolled along one edge of the TV screen social TV dongle may detect the scrolling scores and avoid placing social area on top of the scores or any location that would obstruct the scores. Various methods of how social TV dongle may determine important areas of incoming video frame are discussed below.

In some embodiments social TV dongle may determine important areas of incoming video frame by determining static portions of the display. For example social TV dongle may compare two or more successive incoming video frames in order to determine portions of the incoming video frames that have not changed or have changed less than a predetermined amount. Social TV dongle may determine that the static portions are important areas and therefore may avoid placing social area on top of the static areas. For illustrative purposes only consider a televised sporting event in which an area of the screen is dedicated to displaying the score. This dedicated scoreboard typically would change very little if any between successive incoming video frames . Social TV dongle may determine the location of the scoreboard on the screen by comparing successive incoming video frames . Social TV dongle may then avoid overlapping the scoreboard with any portion of social area .

In some embodiments social TV dongle may determine important areas of incoming video frame by determining any text shown on the display. For example social TV dongle may analyze incoming video frame in order to determine if any portion contains text. In some embodiments this may be accomplished using optical character recognition OCR or any other appropriate technique. Social TV dongle may then avoid placing social area on top of the determined text. For illustrative purposes only consider a televised singing competition in which a telephone number is displayed on the screen. Social TV dongle may utilize for example OCR on incoming video frames in order to determine that a telephone number is being displayed and the location on the screen of the telephone number. Social TV dongle may then avoid overlapping the telephone number with any portion of social area .

In some embodiments social TV dongle may determine important areas of incoming video frame by determining whether any faces are shown on the display. For example social TV dongle may analyze incoming video frame using any appropriate facial recognition technology in order to determine if any portion of the screen contains a face. Social TV dongle may then avoid placing social area on top of any of the determined faces. For illustrative purposes only consider a televised debate in which the faces of multiple people are displayed on the screen. Social TV dongle may utilize for example facial recognition software on incoming video frames in order to determine that multiple faces are being displayed on the screen and the location on the screen of the faces. Social TV dongle may then avoid overlapping any of the faces with any portion of social area .

In some embodiments social TV dongle may determine important areas of incoming video frame using metadata provided by content producers of the program being viewed. For example social TV dongle may analyze metadata embedded in incoming video frame that indicates important areas of the screen. As another example social TV dongle may receive metadata indicating important areas of the screen for shows from content producers such as MSOs . Social TV dongle may then avoid placing social area on top of any of the important areas as indicated by the metadata.

In certain embodiments the shape or location of social area may be dynamically adjusted based on the determined important areas of the screen discussed above. For example if social area is displayed at a first location at a first time in a show it may be resized or moved at a later time in the show if social TV dongle determines that the social area is overlapping an important area of the screen. For illustrative purposes only consider a televised singing competition in which a contestant performs during a first portion of the show and then a telephone number to vote for the contestant is displayed on the screen at a later point in the show. If social area is displayed in the lower center portion of the screen during the contestant s performance during the first portion of the show e.g. to avoid overlapping the singer s face it may overlap the telephone number when it is displayed later in the show. To avoid this social TV dongle may detect that a new important area of the screen has appeared i.e. the telephone number and either adjust the size or shape of social area to avoid the telephone number or move social area to avoid the telephone number.

Some embodiments of social TV dongle may resize social area to mask or hide content in incoming video frames . For example incoming video frames may include an EPG from MSO . Social TV dongle may detect the portion of the screen occupied by the EPG using for example any of the techniques described above for determining important areas of the screen. Social TV dongle may then resize or move social area to mask the EPG.

In certain embodiments incoming video frame may be shrunk or resized in output frame . For example incoming video frame may be shrunk to only occupy a portion of output frame while social area occupies the remaining output frame . This may be utilized for example by social TV dongle to display all or a portion of a programming guide that includes social content from social networking system .

Some embodiments of social TV dongle may mask blank or corrupted incoming video frames due to slow channel switching of content source . For example some STBs are notoriously slow at switching channels. This typically results in the extended display of blank or corrupted frames of video. Some embodiments of social TV dongle may mask this effect and appear to speed up the latency of changing channels. To accomplish this some embodiments of social TV dongle may fade top frame in and out of being opaque when social TV dongle detects a channel change in incoming video stream . For example when social TV dongle detects a channel change in incoming video stream it may fade the entire top frame to black. Then after a predetermined period of time or when social TV dongle detects that the channel change in complete top frame may be faded from black back to transparent. In some embodiments social TV dongle may display social area on top frame while it is opaque. As a result a user may perceive that the change in channels occurred faster than it actually occurred.

In some embodiments social area may include reminders from a calendar associated with user . For example user may store calendar events with social networking system . Social networking system may cause reminders for calendared events to appear in social area at any appropriate time. In some embodiments social networking system may cause TV to turn on in order to display a calendar reminder in social area .

At step content from a social networking system such as social networking system is accessed. In some embodiments the content is received at a social TV dongle . In certain embodiments the content may refer to social content such as stories messages posts notifications advertisements newsfeeds tickers chat messages or any other information from the social networking system. In some embodiments the content is related to a social graph such as social graph . In some embodiments the social content is filtered to include only content that is relevant to what is currently being viewed on a TV such as TV . In some embodiments the content may be content e.g. video content from OTT provider .

At step an overlay area is generated. In some embodiments the overlay area includes the content accessed in step such as stories messages posts notifications advertisements newsfeeds tickers chat messages or any other information from the social networking system. In some embodiments the generated overlay area may refer to social area described above.

At step a placement for the overlay area of step is determined. In some embodiments the placement may be based on a determination of important areas of the first video stream of step as described above. For example the overlay area may be placed to ovoid any determined important areas of the first video stream such as faces or text. In some embodiments the overlay area may be dynamically resized to avoid any determined important areas as described above.

At step a modified video stream is generated using the first video stream received in step and the overlay area of step . In some embodiments the modified video stream is combined output frame . In certain embodiments the modified video stream is generated by combining incoming video frames with top frames as described above. In such embodiments the top frame includes the overlay area of step . In some embodiments the modified video stream is generated by painting the overlay area of step directly on incoming video frames of the first video stream.

At step the modified video stream is sent for display on a display device of a first user. In some embodiments the modified video stream is sent by social TV dongle to a TV such as TV . In other embodiments the modified video stream is sent to any other appropriate display device such as a computer monitor a tablet computer and the like. After step method may end.

Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of where appropriate.

Moreover although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components devices or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of this disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components devices or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of .

In some embodiments acoustic fingerprinting is used to determine what user is watching on TV . For example while user is watching TV a mobile app associated with social networking system may be running on mobile device of user . Mobile device may capture environmental sounds from the environment using a microphone . Environmental sounds may include for example audio from the show being viewed on TV . Environmental sounds are then sent to social networking system either directly or via social TV dongle . Social networking system may then analyze environmental sounds in order to determine what user is watching on TV . For example social networking system may compare environmental sounds to audio of known TV shows. Based on the comparison social networking system may determine what show user is watching on TV .

In some embodiments social networking system may utilize environmental sounds received from multiple users in order to determine whether the multiple users are watching a TV show separately or together.

User may then edit or approve the chat message for posting to social networking system . In another example voice recognition may be utilized to automatically add a conversation taking place in a room to a chat session with our without the use of a second screen of user such as mobile device . For example a microphone coupled to social TV dongle or a microphone of mobile device may capture a conversation between two or more users watching a show on TV . This conversation may be analyzed by social TV dongle or sent to social networking system for analysis using voice recognition. The conversation may be converted to chat messages and automatically posted to a chat room associated with the show currently being viewed on TV . In some embodiments the conversation may be determined by subtracting audio of what the user is currently watching from the captured audio.

In certain embodiments chat message displayed in mobile chat app on mobile device are concurrently shown on TV in a chat area . In some embodiments chat area may be social area described above. Chat area may be any shape size or transparency and may be located in any location on the screen of TV . In some embodiments chat area may be placed on TV to avoid important areas of the screen as discussed above. In certain embodiments the shape size or location of chat area may be dynamically altered as discussed above. For example chat area may be located to avoid overlapping faces static portions of the screen such as a scoreboard or any other determined important area of the screen. In some embodiments social networking system may send chat messages to social TV dongle for display in chat area .

The chat messages that are displayed in chat area on TV may in some embodiments include all the chat messages that are displayed in chat app . However some embodiments may filter the chat messages to only display chat messages that are important to user in chat area on TV . For example illustrates two chat message displayed in chat app of user one chat message from Friend A and one chat message from User B. Friend A may refer to friends of user and User B may refer to any other user of social networking system who does not have a connection in social graph to user e.g. is not a friend of user . Because user may not want to view every chat message on TV about the current program being viewed social networking system may cause only chat messages of friends of user to be displayed in chat area on TV . For example as illustrated in only the chat message from Friend A of user is displayed in chat area on TV of user . Social networking system may determine what chat message to display in chat area on TV using preferences from user e.g. user indicates only to display chat messages of friend friends of friends chat messages according to likes etc. connections to user in social graph or any other appropriate method.

In some embodiments chat messages associated with programs being viewed on TV may be time stamped to allow the chat messages to be synced with the program and later viewed at the same point within the program as when the chat messages were originally posted. For example many users utilize a DVR to view recorded programs at a later time from when they were originally broadcast. To allow users who are viewing recorded or time shifted content to also view chat messages related to the content some embodiments time stamp chat messages and store the chat messages to be displayed at a later time when the content is being viewed. For example social networking system may store time stamped chat messages in a data repository such as a database. The chat messages may be time stamped with for example an absolute time e.g. 02 01 2010 at 23 12 or a time relative to the content associated with the chat message e.g. 0 16 after the beginning of the program . In addition some embodiments may store other metadata with the chat messages such as an identification of the user who posted the chat message an identification of the content associated with the chat message and the like. Then when users view the content at a later time the stored chat messages related to the content may be retrieved and displayed to the users at the appropriate time in the content. For example if a particular friend of a user made the comment THIS ROCKS during a point of a show that comment may appear at that same point of the show to users viewing the show at a later time. The comments may appear on mobile device TV or both devices concurrently. As a result users may be able to view relevant chat messages about the content currently being viewed even if the content is being viewed at a later time from when the content originally aired.

In some embodiments chat messages related to content being viewed on TV may be organized by social networking system for presentation to users of social networking system . For example social networking system may organize all chat messages about a particular TV show into comment threads based on the content. In some embodiments this may include comment threads for particular shows particular episodes particular seasons etc. These comment threads may then be viewed by users using for example a web browser. In certain embodiments social networking system may dynamically form groups of users based on detected shared content experience. For example if social networking system detects that certain users have all viewed a particular TV show social networking system may recommend that each of the users join a group on social networking system for that particular show.

In some embodiments user may participate in a video chat about the current show being viewed. For example webcam coupled to social TV dongle may capture video of user as he is watching a particular show. At the same time other webcams may capture video of other users watching the particular show. Social networking system may then display the videos of each user in small boxes within chat area on TV . For example social networking system may display the videos of a certain number of friends of user who are also currently watching the particular show. In some embodiments face detection may be utilized to only display the face or head of users within chat area . In certain embodiments gestures of user for video chats may be captured and analyzed as discussed above. For example user may perform a shhhh gesture in order to mute one or more other users being displayed in the video boxes within chat area on TV . Social TV dongle may capture and determine this gesture by user and mute the appropriate video of the user within chat area that user indicates to mute.

In some embodiments an indication of second screen augmentation is presented to user . For example an indication such as an icon may be presented to user to indicate that a certain program is available for second screen interaction e.g. the user may chat about the program on a mobile device while watching the program on a TV . In some embodiments the indication may be shown in a newsfeed or a list view of available programs. In some embodiments the indication may be presented either before or after user selects to tune to a particular program.

At step a second display device of the user is determined. In some embodiments the second display device is a mobile device of the user. In some embodiments the second display device is TV .

At step a chat room is displayed on the second display device. The chat room may include various rooms such as a general lobby for a particular series of a show. In some embodiments the chat room may include chat rooms for specific seasons or episodes of a particular series. Some embodiments may provide private chat rooms in which users may conduct private conversations about the current show.

At step chat messages related to the particular content are displayed in the chat room on the second display device. The chat message may be determined from a social graph such as social graph . In some embodiments chat messages from friends and non friends of the user are displayed in the chat room. In certain embodiments only chat message from friends are displayed in the chat room. In some embodiments the user may specify preferences regarding what chat messages to display. In certain embodiments important chat message are displayed on both the first and second display devices.

Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of where appropriate. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of as occurring in a particular order this disclosure contemplates any suitable steps of the method of occurring in any suitable order. Moreover although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components devices or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of this disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components devices or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of .

In certain embodiments playlist is a list of one or more movies TV shows or other content to be viewed on TV . The content of playlist may be determined based on the interests of two or more users. For example consider a couple trying to decide what to watch together on TV . The couple may seek a recommendation using for example mobile device or remote control device . In some embodiments MSO may detect the requested recommendation and send a query to social networking system for information about the users. In some embodiments social networking system may detect the requested recommendation using for example social TV dongle and proceed to query social graph for information about the users. The information may include for example what the users are doing posts of the users likes of the users mutual friends of the users posts or likes by mutual friends of the users programming guides of mutual friends of the users etc. This information may then be used to determine content to include in playlist . As a specific example if the users and their mutual friends have recently discussed the topic weddings on social networking system then playlist may include TV shows or movies about weddings.

In certain embodiments social TV dongle may determine who is viewing TV in order to determine content to provide in playlist . For example social TV dongle may utilize any method discussed above to determine who is in close proximity to TV or social TV dongle . These methods may include utilizing BLUETOOTH to gather information from multiple mobile devices as discussed above utilizing webcam and facial recognition technology to detect users faces in the room using voice recognition to detect users voices etc. Once social TV dongle or social networking system determines who is in the room social graph may be queried to determine the interests of all the determined users. The interests of all the determined users may then be combined to determine the content for playlist . Particular embodiments of determining shared interests are discussed further below.

In certain embodiments social networking system may utilize social coefficients to determine content for playlist . For example social networking system may first query social graph to determine social coefficients of programs for an individual user . In some embodiments this may involve determining social coefficients of all available content in social networking system . Some embodiments may utilize coefficients as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 entitled Contextually Relevant Affinity Prediction in a Social Networking System which is incorporated herein by reference. Social networking system may utilize the following information from social graph in determining coefficients of specific programs for individual user 

In embodiments where it is determined that multiple users are viewing TV social networking system may first determine specific programs to recommend to each individual user as discussed above e.g. using social coefficients and then perform group aggregation in order to determine recommendations for the group of users . For example consider a scenario where three users are seeking recommendations on what to watch on TV . Social networking system may first determine social coefficients as discussed above for a first show for each of the three users. Social networking system may then average the three coefficients for the first show to determine an averaged coefficient for the first show. Social networking system may then perform similar computations for other shows to determine averaged coefficients for each show. The average coefficients may then be ranked for the three users and a predetermined number of the top ranked shows or shows that have a coefficient greater than a predetermined amount may then be presented in a shared playlist for the three users. As a specific example the following coefficients may be determined for shows A B and C for the three users 

The average coefficients may then be ranked for the three users and a predetermined number of the top ranked shows or shows that have a coefficient greater than a predetermined amount may then be presented in a shared playlist for the three users. In the above example Show B may be listed first in playlist followed by Show A and then Show C.

In some embodiments weighting factors may be used in determining average coefficients of a group of users. For example consider a family that includes a father a mother and a child. Social networking system may apply weights to the coefficients of the father mother and child in calculating the average coefficients above. For example if social networking system determines that the father watches the most TV shows social networking system may apply a higher weight to his coefficients than the mother or child. Or if social networking system determines that most of the TV shows watched in the house are children s shows it may apply a higher weight to the child s coefficients than the mother or father. Thus recommendations in playlist may be altered to prioritize content for the person who consumes the most TV shows.

In some embodiments social networking system finds the union of individual show recommendations when determining what content to display in a shared playlist . For example if two users are seeking recommendations on what to watch on TV social networking system may first determine shows to recommend for each individual user as discussed above. Social networking system may then determine whether there are any common recommended shows for the two users. For example if Shows A and B are recommended to a first user and Shows A and C are recommended to a second user Show A may be included in a shared playlist for the two users since it was recommended to both users.

As discussed above a taste algorithm may be utilized by social networking system to determine recommendations to include in playlist . For example social networking system may first determine first programs that user watched liked or otherwise interacted with on social networking system . In some embodiments the first programs may be determined using social graph or social TV dongle . In some embodiments the programs may be any of live TV programming from OTT provider such as Netflix programs from a DVR on demand programming and the like. Once the first programs have been determined social networking system may then search social graph to determine other users or friends of user who also watched liked or otherwise interacted with the first program on social networking system . Social networking system may then search social graph for second programs that the determined users or friends watched liked or otherwise interacted with on social networking system . The determined second programs may then be recommended to user in playlist as discussed above. In some embodiments weighting factors may be utilized in determining what shows to recommend to a user. For example second programs viewed by a user s friends may have a higher weight in determining recommendations for a user than second programs viewed by users who are not friends.

As an example for illustrative purposes only consider a scenario where a first user has liked the program Garage Talk in the past. Social networking system may query social graph in order to determine other users or friends of the first user who have also liked Garage Talk. For example social networking system may determine that Friend A and User B also liked Garage Talk. Social networking system may then query social graph for other shows liked by the other users or friends who also liked Garage Talk. For example social networking system may determine that Friend A and User B who liked Garage Talk also liked the shows Shop Journal and Cars Galore. Social networking system may then recommend Shop Journal and Cars Galore to the first user. If for example Friend A liked Shop Journal and User B who is not a friend of the first user liked Cars Galore then Shop Journal may appear higher in playlist than Shop Journal. 

In some embodiments social networking system may cross reference the actors or the people who were involved in making a particular program in determining what shows to recommend to user in playlist . For example social networking system may access an external database such as the Internet Movie Database IMDb in order to determine the actors producers writers etc. of a particular show liked or watched by user or the connections of user . Social networking system may then cross reference the determined information with other shows in order to determine other shows that the actors producers writers etc. were also involved with. As an example for illustrative purposes only consider a scenario where friend of user likes Show A that features Actors A and B. Social networking system may recommend Show A to user if it determines that user likes Actor B. That is because both user and friend like actors that are in a particular show social networking system may recommend that user and friend watch the same show.

In some embodiments other data points may be used to infer how much a user liked a particular show. For example social networking system may determine how much of a particular show a user watched before changing the channel turning off TV or any other action that indicates disinterest in a TV show. Some embodiments may determine this using for example social TV dongle discussed above. In certain embodiments social networking system may determine that a user began viewing a show and then checked in at another location before the end of the show. In certain embodiments this may indicate that the user became disinterested in the show. In some embodiments social networking system may determine where the user checked before the end of the show. If for example the user stopped watching a sporting event and then checked in at a sports bar social networking system may determine that the user did not become disinterested in the sporting event but instead went to a location to continue watching the sporting event with others. Social networking system may utilize posts to social networking system GPS data from mobile device or any other appropriate data to determine whether the user became disinterested in a particular show.

In certain embodiments social networking system may determine trending shows to recommend to user in playlist . For example social networking system may analyze posts likes or any other interaction with social networking system in order to determine shows that are trending. Shows that are trending may be for example shows that have received the most likes within a predetermined period. Social networking system may then include one or more trending shows in playlist .

In some embodiments users may be notified when a particular program is viewed by a large percentage of their friends. For example if over half of friends of user are currently viewing or plan to view a particular program a notification of the program may be sent to user via social networking system . In some embodiments social networking system may determine that a large percentage of a user s friends are watching or are planning to watch a program using one or more of the coefficients discussed above close friends of the user i.e. using social graph similar tastes and the like. In some embodiments the notification may include a link or button that allows user to press to begin watching the recommended show.

In some embodiments social networking system may provide a best for you recommendation to user in playlist . The best for you recommendation may be the program chosen from the currently available programs that user is most likely to watch. In some embodiments social networking system may first determine programs that are currently available to watch e.g. programs that are currently airing programs that are available via pay per view programs that are recorded on a DVR programs available from services such as Hulu and Netflix etc. . Social networking system may then perform any appropriate method to rank the available programs according to what user is likely to want to watch. In some embodiments this may include using social coefficients described above. Social networking system may then choose the top ranked program and present an option to user to view the program. In certain embodiments the top ranked program may be presented to user along with an indication such as best for you or any other appropriate indication.

In general social graph with user device concept nodes permits a user to stream any media that friends or other connections of the user are consuming. In one example a first user may begin viewing a show on his TV at the same point in the show that one of his friends is currently viewing. As a result the users may be able to simultaneously view the same TV show and interact with one another e.g. chat as discussed above through social networking system . As another example a user may be able to display photos from his mobile device on one or more of his friend s TVs or mobile devices. These any many other examples of streaming media from one user s device to another user s device may be accomplished by social networking system creating and analyzing the nodes and edges of social graph .

In some embodiments social networking system may determine what service or device a user is currently using in order to determine what and how to stream media from another user. For example social networking system may analyze a user s interactions with social networking system in order to determine whether the user is currently interacting with social networking system using a smartphone a computer a tablet computer or any other user device. As another example social networking system may determine whether a user is currently communicating with social networking system using WiFi cellular communications such as 4G or any other appropriate communications. Once the type of service or user device is determined social networking system may modify the content being shared from another user. For example if social networking system determines that a user is currently utilizing a smartphone over 4G it may optimize a video stream to be streamed to the smartphone over 4G. As another example if social networking system determines that a user is currently utilizing a TV coupled to social TV dongle social TV dongle may optimize a video stream to be viewed on TV .

In some embodiments social networking system may determine an optimal user device in which to display shared content from another user. For example social networking system may determine that a user is attempting to view a video stream that a friend is currently viewing. Social networking system may then determine that the optimal display device for the shared video stream would be a TV . As another example social networking system may determine that a user is attempting to view a photo that a friend is currently viewing on his mobile device . Social networking system may then determine that the optimal display device for the shared photo would be another mobile device .
