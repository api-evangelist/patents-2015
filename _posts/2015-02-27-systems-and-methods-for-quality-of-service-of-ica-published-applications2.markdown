The LAN WAN detector includes any logic business rules function or operations for automatically detecting a slow side connection e.g. a wide area network WAN connection such as an Intranet and associated port and a fast side connection e.g. a local area network LAN connection and an associated port . In some embodiments the LAN WAN detector monitors network traffic on the network ports of the appliance to detect a synchronization packet sometimes referred to as a tagged network packet. The synchronization packet identifies a type or speed of the network traffic. In one embodiment the synchronization packet identifies a WAN speed or WAN type connection. The LAN WAN detector also identifies receipt of an acknowledgement packet to a tagged synchronization packet and on which port it is received. The appliance then configures itself to operate the identified port on which the tagged synchronization packet arrived so that the speed on that port is set to be the speed associated with the network connected to that port. The other port is then set to the speed associated with the network connected to that port.

For ease of discussion herein reference to fast side will be made with respect to connection with a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet and operating at a network speed of the WAN. Likewise reference to slow side will be made with respect to connection with a local area network LAN and operating at a network speed the LAN. However it is noted that fast and slow sides in a network can change on a per connection basis and are relative terms to the speed of the network connections or to the type of network topology. Such configurations are useful in complex network topologies where a network is fast or slow only when compared to adjacent networks and not in any absolute sense.

In one embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to allow for auto discovery by an appliance of a network to which it connects. In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to detect the existence or presence of a second appliance deployed in the network . For example an auto discovery mechanism in operation in accordance with functions as follows appliance and are placed in line with the connection linking client and server . The appliances and are at the ends of a low speed link e.g. Internet connecting two LANs. In one example embodiment appliances and each include two ports one to connect with the lower speed link and the other to connect with a higher speed link e.g. a LAN. Any packet arriving at one port is copied to the other port. Thus appliance and are each configured to function as a bridge between the two networks .

When an end node such as the client opens a new TCP connection with another end node such as the server the client sends a TCP packet with a synchronization SYN header bit set or a SYN packet to the server . In the present example client opens a transport layer connection to server . When the SYN packet passes through appliance the appliance inserts attaches or otherwise provides a characteristic TCP header option to the packet which announces its presence. If the packet passes through a second appliance in this example appliance the second appliance notes the header option on the SYN packet. The server responds to the SYN packet with a synchronization acknowledgment SYN ACK packet. When the SYN ACK packet passes through appliance a TCP header option is tagged e.g. attached inserted or added to the SYN ACK packet to announce appliance presence to appliance . When appliance receives this packet both appliances are now aware of each other and the connection can be appropriately accelerated.

Further to the operations of the LAN WAN detector a method or process for detecting fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN packet is described. During a transport layer connection establishment between a client and a server the appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configure the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The appliance then tags the SYN packet with an ACK and copies the packet to the other port.

In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector detects fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN ACK packet. The appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN ACK packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet was tagged. If the SYN packet was not tagged the appliance copied the packet to the other port. If the SYN packet was tagged the appliance tags the SYN ACK packet before copying it to the other port.

The appliance may add insert modify attach or otherwise provide any information or data in the TCP option header to provide any information data or characteristics about the network connection network traffic flow or the configuration or operation of the appliance . In this manner not only does an appliance announce its presence to another appliance or tag a higher or lower speed connection the appliance provides additional information and data via the TCP option headers about the appliance or the connection. The TCP option header information may be useful to or used by an appliance in controlling managing optimizing acceleration or improving the network traffic flow traversing the appliance or to otherwise configure itself or operation of a network port.

Although generally described in conjunction with detecting speeds of network connections or the presence of appliances the LAN WAN detector can be used for applying any type of function logic or operation of the appliance to a port connection or flow of network traffic. In particular automated assignment of ports can occur whenever a device performs different functions on different ports where the assignment of a port to a task can be made during the unit s operation and or the nature of the network segment on each port is discoverable by the appliance .

The flow controller includes any logic business rules function or operations for optimizing accelerating or otherwise improving the performance operation or quality of service of transport layer communications of network packets or the delivery of packets at the transport layer. A flow controller also sometimes referred to as a flow control module regulates manages and controls data transfer rates. In some embodiments the flow controller is deployed at or connected at a bandwidth bottleneck in the network . In one embodiment the flow controller effectively regulates manages and controls bandwidth usage or utilization. In other embodiments the flow control modules may also be deployed at points on the network of latency transitions low latency to high latency and on links with media losses such as wireless or satellite links .

In some embodiments a flow controller may include a receiver side flow control module for controlling the rate of receipt of network transmissions and a sender side flow control module for the controlling the rate of transmissions of network packets. In other embodiments a first flow controller includes a receiver side flow control module and a second flow controller includes a sender side flow control module. In some embodiments a first flow controller is deployed on a first appliance and a second flow controller is deployed on a second appliance . As such in some embodiments a first appliance controls the flow of data on the receiver side and a second appliance controls the data flow from the sender side. In yet another embodiment a single appliance includes flow control for both the receiver side and sender side of network communications traversing the appliance .

In one embodiment a flow control module is configured to allow bandwidth at the bottleneck to be more fully utilized and in some embodiments not overutilized. In some embodiments the flow control module transparently buffers or rebuffers data already buffered by for example the sender network sessions that pass between nodes having associated flow control modules . When a session passes through two or more flow control modules one or more of the flow control modules controls a rate of the session s .

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured with predetermined data relating to bottleneck bandwidth. In another embodiment the flow control module may be configured to detect the bottleneck bandwidth or data associated therewith. Unlike conventional network protocols such as TCP a receiver side flow control module controls the data transmission rate. The receiver side flow control module controls the sender side flow control module e.g. data transmission rate by forwarding transmission rate limits to the sender side flow control module . In one embodiment the receiver side flow control module piggybacks these transmission rate limits on acknowledgement ACK packets or signals sent to the sender e.g. client by the receiver e.g. server . The receiver side flow control module does this in response to rate control requests that are sent by the sender side flow control module . The requests from the sender side flow control module may be piggybacked on data packets sent by the sender .

In some embodiments the flow controller manipulates adjusts simulates changes improves or otherwise adapts the behavior of the transport layer protocol to provide improved performance or operations of delivery data rates and or bandwidth utilization of the transport layer. The flow controller may implement a plurality of data flow control techniques at the transport layer including but not limited to 1 pre acknowledgements 2 window virtualization 3 recongestion techniques 3 local retransmission techniques 4 wavefront detection and disambiguation 5 transport control protocol selective acknowledgements 6 transaction boundary detection techniques and 7 repacketization.

Although a sender may be generally described herein as a client and a receiver as a server a sender may be any end point such as a server or any computing device on the network . Likewise a receiver may be a client or any other computing device on the network .

In brief overview of a pre acknowledgement flow control technique the flow controller in some embodiments handles the acknowledgements and retransmits for a sender effectively terminating the sender s connection with the downstream portion of a network connection. In reference to one possible deployment of an appliance into a network architecture to implement this feature is depicted. In this example environment a sending computer or client transmits data on network for example via a switch which determines that the data is destined for VPN appliance . Because of the chosen network topology all data destined for VPN appliance traverses appliance so the appliance can apply any necessary algorithms to this data.

Continuing further with the example the client transmits a packet which is received by the appliance . When the appliance receives the packet which is transmitted from the client to a recipient via the VPN appliance the appliance retains a copy of the packet and forwards the packet downstream to the VPN appliance . The appliance then generates an acknowledgement packet ACK and sends the ACK packet back to the client or sending endpoint. This ACK a pre acknowledgment causes the sender to believe that the packet has been delivered successfully freeing the sender s resources for subsequent processing. The appliance retains the copy of the packet data in the event that a retransmission of the packet is required so that the sender does not have to handle retransmissions of the data. This early generation of acknowledgements may be called preacking. 

If a retransmission of the packet is required the appliance retransmits the packet to the sender. The appliance may determine whether retransmission is required as a sender would in a traditional system for example determining that a packet is lost if an acknowledgement has not been received for the packet after a predetermined amount of time. To this end the appliance monitors acknowledgements generated by the receiving endpoint e.g. server or any other downstream network entity so that it can determine whether the packet has been successfully delivered or needs to be retransmitted. If the appliance determines that the packet has been successfully delivered the appliance is free to discard the saved packet data. The appliance may also inhibit forwarding acknowledgements for packets that have already been received by the sending endpoint.

In the embodiment described above the appliance via the flow controller controls the sender through the delivery of pre acknowledgements also referred to as preacks as though the appliance was a receiving endpoint itself. Since the appliance is not an endpoint and does not actually consume the data the appliance includes a mechanism for providing overflow control to the sending endpoint. Without overflow control the appliance could run out of memory because the appliance stores packets that have been preacked to the sending endpoint but not yet acknowledged as received by the receiving endpoint. Therefore in a situation in which the sender transmits packets to the appliance faster than the appliance can forward the packets downstream the memory available in the appliance to store unacknowledged packet data can quickly fill. A mechanism for overflow control allows the appliance to control transmission of the packets from the sender to avoid this problem.

In one embodiment the appliance or flow controller includes an inherent self clocking overflow control mechanism. This self clocking is due to the order in which the appliance may be designed to transmit packets downstream and send ACKs to the sender or . In some embodiments the appliance does not preack the packet until after it transmits the packet downstream. In this way the sender will receive the ACKs at the rate at which the appliance is able to transmit packets rather than the rate at which the appliance receives packets from the sender . This helps to regulate the transmission of packets from a sender .

Another overflow control mechanism that the appliance may implement is to use the TCP window size parameter which tells a sender how much buffer the receiver is permitting the sender to fill up. A nonzero window size e.g. a size of at least one Maximum Segment Size MSS in a preack permits the sending endpoint to continue to deliver data to the appliance whereas a zero window size inhibits further data transmission. Accordingly the appliance may regulate the flow of packets from the sender for example when the appliance s buffer is becoming full by appropriately setting the TCP window size in each preack.

Another technique to reduce this additional overhead is to apply hysteresis. When the appliance delivers data to the slower side the overflow control mechanism in the appliance can require that a minimum amount of space be available before sending a nonzero window advertisement to the sender. In one embodiment the appliance waits until there is a minimum of a predetermined number of packets such as four packets of space available before sending a nonzero window packet such as a window size of four packet . This reduces the overhead by approximately a factor four since only two ACK packets are sent for each group of four data packets instead of eight ACK packets for four data packets.

Another technique the appliance or flow controller may use for overflow control is the TCP delayed ACK mechanism which skips ACKs to reduce network traffic. The TCP delayed ACKs automatically delay the sending of an ACK either until two packets are received or until a fixed timeout has occurred. This mechanism alone can result in cutting the overhead in half moreover by increasing the numbers of packets above two additional overhead reduction is realized. But merely delaying the ACK itself may be insufficient to control overflow and the appliance may also use the advertised window mechanism on the ACKs to control the sender. When doing this the appliance in one embodiment avoids triggering the timeout mechanism of the sender by delaying the ACK too long.

In one embodiment the flow controller does not preack the last packet of a group of packets. By not preacking the last packet or at least one of the packets in the group the appliance avoids a false acknowledgement for a group of packets. For example if the appliance were to send a preack for a last packet and the packet were subsequently lost the sender would have been tricked into thinking that the packet is delivered when it was not. Thinking that the packet had been delivered the sender could discard that data. If the appliance also lost the packet there would be no way to retransmit the packet to the recipient. By not preacking the last packet of a group of packets the sender will not discard the packet until it has been delivered.

In another embodiment the flow controller may use a window virtualization technique to control the rate of flow or bandwidth utilization of a network connection. Though it may not immediately be apparent from examining conventional literature such as RFC 1323 there is effectively a send window for transport layer protocols such as TCP. The send window is similar to the receive window in that it consumes buffer space though on the sender . The sender s send window consists of all data sent by the application that has not been acknowledged by the receiver. This data must be retained in memory in case retransmission is required. Since memory is a shared resource some TCP stack implementations limit the size of this data. When the send window is full an attempt by an application program to send more data results in blocking the application program until space is available. Subsequent reception of acknowledgements will free send window memory and unblock the application program. In some embodiments this window size is known as the socket buffer size in some TCP implementations.

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured to provide access to increased window or buffer sizes. This configuration may also be referenced to as window virtualization. In the embodiment of TCP as the transport layer protocol the TCP header includes a bit string corresponding to a window scale. In one embodiment window may be referenced in a context of send receive or both.

One embodiment of window virtualization is to insert a preacking appliance into a TCP session. In reference to any of the environments of initiation of a data communication session between a source node e.g. client for ease of discussion now referenced as source node and a destination node e.g. server for ease of discussion now referenced as destination node is established. For TCP communications the source node initially transmits a synchronization signal SYN through its local area network to first flow control module . The first flow control module inserts a configuration identifier into the TCP header options area. The configuration identifier identifies this point in the data path as a flow control module.

The appliances via a flow control module provide window or buffer to allow increasing data buffering capabilities within a session despite having end nodes with small buffer sizes e.g. typically 16 k bytes. However RFC 1323 requires window scaling for any buffer sizes greater than 64 k bytes which must be set at the time of session initialization SYN SYN ACK signals . Moreover the window scaling corresponds to the lowest common denominator in the data path often an end node with small buffer size. This window scale often is a scale of 0 or 1 which corresponds to a buffer size of up to 64 k or 128 k bytes. Note that because the window size is defined as the window field in each packet shifted over by the window scale the window scale establishes an upper limit for the buffer but does not guarantee the buffer is actually that large. Each packet indicates the current available buffer space at the receiver in the window field.

In one embodiment of scaling using the window virtualization technique during connection establishment i.e. initialization of a session when the first flow control module receives from the source node the SYN signal or packet the flow control module stores the windows scale of the source node which is the previous node or stores a 0 for window scale if the scale of the previous node is missing. The first flow control module also modifies the scale e.g. increases the scale to 4 from 0 or 1 in the SYN FCM signal. When the second flow control module receives the SYN signal it stores the increased scale from the first flow control signal and resets the scale in the SYN signal back to the source node scale value for transmission to the destination node . When the second flow controller receives the SYN ACK signal from the destination node it stores the scale from the destination node scale e.g. 0 or 1 and modifies it to an increased scale that is sent with the SYN ACK FCM signal. The first flow control node receives and notes the received window scale and revises the windows scale sent back to the source node back down to the original scale e.g. 0 or 1. Based on the above window shift conversation during connection establishment the window field in every subsequent packet e.g. TCP packet of the session must be shifted according to the window shift conversion.

The window scale as described above expresses buffer sizes of over 64 k and may not be required for window virtualization. Thus shifts for window scale may be used to express increased buffer capacity in each flow control module . This increase in buffer capacity in may be referenced as window or buffer virtualization. The increase in buffer size allows greater packet through put from and to the respective end nodes and . Note that buffer sizes in TCP are typically expressed in terms of bytes but for ease of discussion packets may be used in the description herein as it relates to virtualization.

By way of example a window or buffer virtualization performed by the flow controller is described. In this example the source node and the destination node are configured similar to conventional end nodes having a limited buffer capacity of 16 k bytes which equals approximately 10 packets of data. Typically an end node must wait until the packet is transmitted and confirmation is received before a next group of packets can be transmitted. In one embodiment using increased buffer capacity in the flow control modules when the source node transmits its data packets the first flow control module receives the packets stores it in its larger capacity buffer e.g. 512 packet capacity and immediately sends back an acknowledgement signal indicating receipt of the packets REC ACK back to the source node . The source node can then flush its current buffer load it with 10 new data packets and transmit those onto the first flow control module . Again the first flow control module transmits a REC ACK signal back to the source node and the source node flushes its buffer and loads it with 10 more new packets for transmission.

As the first flow control module receives the data packets from the source nodes it loads up its buffer accordingly. When it is ready the first flow control module can begin transmitting the data packets to the second flow control module which also has an increased buffer size for example to receive 512 packets. The second flow control module receives the data packets and begins to transmit 10 packets at a time to the destination node . Each REC ACK received at the second flow control node from the destination node results in 10 more packets being transmitted to the destination node until all the data packets are transferred. Hence the present invention is able to increase data transmission throughput between the source node sender and the destination node receiver by taking advantage of the larger buffer in the flow control modules between the devices.

It is noted that by preacking the transmission of data as described previously a sender or source node is allowed to transmit more data than is possible without the preacks thus affecting a larger window size. For example in one embodiment this technique is effective when the flow control module is located near a node e.g. source node or destination node that lacks large windows.

Another technique or algorithm of the flow controller is referred to as recongestion. The standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithms are known to perform poorly in the face of certain network conditions including large RTTs round trip times high packet loss rates and others. When the appliance detects a congestion condition such as long round trip times or high packet loss the appliance intervenes substituting an alternate congestion avoidance algorithm that better suits the particular network condition. In one embodiment the recongestion algorithm uses preacks to effectively terminate the connection between the sender and the receiver. The appliance then resends the packets from itself to the receiver using a different congestion avoidance algorithm. Recongestion algorithms may be dependent on the characteristics of the TCP connection. The appliance monitors each TCP connection characterizing it with respect to the different dimensions selecting a recongestion algorithm that is appropriate for the current characterization.

In one embodiment upon detecting a TCP connection that is limited by round trip times RTT a recongestion algorithm is applied which behaves as multiple TCP connections. Each TCP connection operates within its own performance limit but the aggregate bandwidth achieves a higher performance level. One parameter in this mechanism is the number of parallel connections that are applied N . Too large a value of N and the connection bundle achieves more than its fair share of bandwidth. Too small a value of N and the connection bundle achieves less than its fair share of bandwidth. One method of establishing N relies on the appliance monitoring the packet loss rate RTT and packet size of the actual connection. These numbers are plugged into a TCP response curve formula to provide an upper limit on the performance of a single TCP connection in the present configuration. If each connection within the connection bundle is achieving substantially the same performance as that computed to be the upper limit then additional parallel connections are applied. If the current bundle is achieving less performance than the upper limit the number of parallel connections is reduced. In this manner the overall fairness of the system is maintained since individual connection bundles contain no more parallelism than is required to eliminate the restrictions imposed by the protocol itself. Furthermore each individual connection retains TCP compliance.

Another method of establishing N is to utilize a parallel flow control algorithm such as the TCP Vegas algorithm or its improved version Stabilized Vegas. In this method the network information associated with the connections in the connection bundle e.g. RTT loss rate average packet size etc. is aggregated and applied to the alternate flow control algorithm. The results of this algorithm are in turn distributed among the connections of the bundle controlling their number i.e. N . Optionally each connection within the bundle continues using the standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithm.

In another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are virtualized i.e. actual individual TCP connections are not established. Instead the congestion avoidance algorithm is modified to behave as though there were N parallel connections. This method has the advantage of appearing to transiting network nodes as a single connection. Thus the QOS security and other monitoring methods of these nodes are unaffected by the recongestion algorithm. In yet another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are real i.e. a separate. TCP connection is established for each of the parallel connections within a bundle. The congestion avoidance algorithm for each TCP connection need not be modified.

In some embodiments the flow controller may apply a local retransmission technique. One reason for implementing preacks is to prepare to transit a high loss link e.g. wireless . In these embodiments the preacking appliance or flow control module is located most beneficially before the wireless link. This allows retransmissions to be performed closer to the high loss link removing the retransmission burden from the remainder of the network. The appliance may provide local retransmission in which case packets dropped due to failures of the link are retransmitted directly by the appliance . This is advantageous because it eliminates the retransmission burden upon an end node such as server and infrastructure of any of the networks . With appliance providing local retransmissions the dropped packet can be retransmitted across the high loss link without necessitating a retransmit by an end node and a corresponding decrease in the rate of data transmission from the end node.

Another reason for implementing preacks is to avoid a receive time out RTO penalty. In standard TCP there are many situations that result in an RTO even though a large percentage of the packets in flight were successfully received. With standard TCP algorithms dropping more than one packet within an RTT window would likely result in a timeout. Additionally most TCP connections experience a timeout if a retransmitted packet is dropped. In a network with a high bandwidth delay product even a relatively small packet loss rate will cause frequent Retransmission timeouts RTOs . In one embodiment the appliance uses a retransmit and timeout algorithm is avoid premature RTOs. The appliance or flow controller maintains a count of retransmissions is maintained on a per packet basis. Each time that a packet is retransmitted the count is incremented by one and the appliance continues to transmit packets. In some embodiments only if a packet has been retransmitted a predetermined number of times is an RTO declared.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller uses wavefront detection and disambiguation techniques in managing and controlling flow of network traffic. In this technique the flow controller uses transmit identifiers or numbers to determine whether particular data packets need to be retransmitted. By way of example a sender transmits data packets over a network where each instance of a transmitted data packet is associated with a transmit number. It can be appreciated that the transmit number for a packet is not the same as the packet s sequence number since a sequence number references the data in the packet while the transmit number references an instance of a transmission of that data. The transmit number can be any information usable for this purpose including a timestamp associated with a packet or simply an increasing number similar to a sequence number or a packet number . Because a data segment may be retransmitted different transmit numbers may be associated with a particular sequence number.

As the sender transmits data packets the sender maintains a data structure of acknowledged instances of data packet transmissions. Each instance of a data packet transmission is referenced by its sequence number and transmit number. By maintaining a transmit number for each packet the sender retains the ordering of the transmission of data packets. When the sender receives an ACK or a SACK the sender determines the highest transmit number associated with packets that the receiver indicated has arrived in the received acknowledgement . Any outstanding unacknowledged packets with lower transmit numbers are presumed lost.

In some embodiments the sender is presented with an ambiguous situation when the arriving packet has been retransmitted a standard ACK SACK does not contain enough information to allow the sender to determine which transmission of the arriving packet has triggered the acknowledgement. After receiving an ambiguous acknowledgement therefore the sender disambiguates the acknowledgement to associate it with a transmit number. In various embodiments one or a combination of several techniques may be used to resolve this ambiguity.

In one embodiment the sender includes an identifier with a transmitted data packet and the receiver returns that identifier or a function thereof with the acknowledgement. The identifier may be a timestamp e.g. a TCP timestamp as described in RFC 1323 a sequential number or any other information that can be used to resolve between two or more instances of a packet s transmission. In an embodiment in which the TCP timestamp option is used to disambiguate the acknowledgement each packet is tagged with up to 32 bits of unique information. Upon receipt of the data packet the receiver echoes this unique information back to the sender with the acknowledgement. The sender ensures that the originally sent packet and its retransmitted version or versions contain different values for the timestamp option allowing it to unambiguously eliminate the ACK ambiguity. The sender may maintain this unique information for example in the data structure in which it stores the status of sent data packets. This technique is advantageous because it complies with industry standards and is thus likely to encounter little or no interoperability issues. However this technique may require ten bytes of TCP header space in some implementations reducing the effective throughput rate on the network and reducing space available for other TCP options.

In another embodiment another field in the packet such as the IP ID field is used to disambiguate in a way similar to the TCP timestamp option described above. The sender arranges for the ID field values of the original and the retransmitted version or versions of the packet to have different ID fields in the IP header. Upon reception of the data packet at the receiver or a proxy device thereof the receiver sets the ID field of the ACK packet to a function of the ID field of the packet that triggers the ACK. This method is advantageous as it requires no additional data to be sent preserving the efficiency of the network and TCP header space. The function chosen should provide a high degree of likelihood of providing disambiguation. In a preferred embodiment the sender selects IP ID values with the most significant bit set to 0. When the receiver responds the IP ID value is set to the same IP ID value with the most significant bit set to a one.

In another embodiment the transmit numbers associated with non ambiguous acknowledgements are used to disambiguate an ambiguous acknowledgement. This technique is based on the principle that acknowledgements for two packets will tend to be received closer in time as the packets are transmitted closer in time. Packets that are not retransmitted will not result in ambiguity as the acknowledgements received for such packets can be readily associated with a transmit number. Therefore these known transmit numbers are compared to the possible transmit numbers for an ambiguous acknowledgement received near in time to the known acknowledgement. The sender compares the transmit numbers of the ambiguous acknowledgement against the last known received transmit number selecting the one closest to the known received transmit number. For example if an acknowledgement for data packet is received and the last received acknowledgement was for data packet the sender resolves the ambiguity by assuming that the third instance of data packet caused the acknowledgement.

Another technique of the appliance or flow controller is to implement an embodiment of transport control protocol selective acknowledgements or TCP SACK to determine what packets have or have not been received. This technique allows the sender to determine unambiguously a list of packets that have been received by the receiver as well as an accurate list of packets not received. This functionality may be implemented by modifying the sender and or receiver or by inserting sender and receiver side flow control modules in the network path between the sender and receiver. In reference to or a sender e.g. client is configured to transmit data packets to the receiver e.g. server over the network . In response the receiver returns a TCP Selective Acknowledgment option referred to as SACK packet to the sender. In one embodiment the communication is bi directional although only one direction of communication is discussed here for simplicity. The receiver maintains a list or other suitable data structure that contains a group of ranges of sequence numbers for data packets that the receiver has actually received. In some embodiments the list is sorted by sequence number in an ascending or descending order. The receiver also maintains a left off pointer which comprises a reference into the list and indicates the left off point from the previously generated SACK packet.

Upon reception of a data packet the receiver generates and transmits a SACK packet back to the sender. In some embodiments the SACK packet includes a number of fields each of which can hold a range of sequence numbers to indicate a set of received data packets. The receiver fills this first field of the SACK packet with a range of sequence numbers that includes the landing packet that triggered the SACK packet. The remaining available SACK fields are filled with ranges of sequence numbers from the list of received packets. As there are more ranges in the list than can be loaded into the SACK packet the receiver uses the left off pointer to determine which ranges are loaded into the SACK packet. The receiver inserts the SACK ranges consecutively from the sorted list starting from the range referenced by the pointer and continuing down the list until the available SACK range space in the TCP header of the SACK packet is consumed. The receiver wraps around to the start of the list if it reaches the end. In some embodiments two or three additional SACK ranges can be added to the SACK range information.

Once the receiver generates the SACK packet the receiver sends the acknowledgement back to the sender. The receiver then advances the left off pointer by one or more SACK range entries in the list. If the receiver inserts four SACK ranges for example the left off pointer may be advanced two SACK ranges in the list. When the advanced left off pointer reaches at the end of the list the pointer is reset to the start of the list effectively wrapping around the list of known received ranges. Wrapping around the list enables the system to perform well even in the presence of large losses of SACK packets since the SACK information that is not communicated due to a lost SACK packet will eventually be communicated once the list is wrapped around.

It can be appreciated therefore that a SACK packet may communicate several details about the condition of the receiver. First the SACK packet indicates that upon generation of the SACK packet the receiver had just received a data packet that is within the first field of the SACK information. Secondly the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information indicate that the receiver has received the data packets within those ranges. The SACK information also implies that the receiver had not at the time of the SACK packet s generation received any of the data packets that fall between the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information. In essence the ranges between the second and subsequent ranges in the SACK information are holes in the received data the data therein known not to have been delivered. Using this method therefore when a SACK packet has sufficient space to include more than two SACK ranges the receiver may indicate to the sender a range of data packets that have not yet been received by the receiver.

In another embodiment the sender uses the SACK packet described above in combination with the retransmit technique described above to make assumptions about which data packets have been delivered to the receiver. For example when the retransmit algorithm using the transmit numbers declares a packet lost the sender considers the packet to be only conditionally lost as it is possible that the SACK packet identifying the reception of this packet was lost rather than the data packet itself. The sender thus adds this packet to a list of potentially lost packets called the presumed lost list. Each time a SACK packet arrives the known missing ranges of data from the SACK packet are compared to the packets in the presumed lost list. Packets that contain data known to be missing are declared actually lost and are subsequently retransmitted. In this way the two schemes are combined to give the sender better information about which packets have been lost and need to be retransmitted.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller applies a technique referred to as transaction boundary detection. In one embodiment the technique pertains to ping pong behaved connections. At the TCP layer ping pong behavior is when one communicant a sender sends data and then waits for a response from the other communicant the receiver. Examples of ping pong behavior include remote procedure call HTTP and others. The algorithms described above use retransmission timeout RTO to recover from the dropping of the last packet or packets associated with the transaction. Since the TCP RTO mechanism is extremely coarse in some embodiments for example requiring a minimum one second value in all cases poor application behavior may be seen in these situations.

In one embodiment the sender of data or a flow control module coupled to the sender detects a transaction boundary in the data being sent. Upon detecting a transaction boundary the sender or a flow control module sends additional packets whose reception generates additional ACK or SACK responses from the receiver. Insertion of the additional packets is preferably limited to balance between improved application response time and network capacity utilization. The number of additional packets that is inserted may be selected according to the current loss rate associated with that connection with more packets selected for connections having a higher loss rate.

One method of detecting a transaction boundary is time based. If the sender has been sending data and ceases then after a period of time the sender or flow control module declares a transaction boundary. This may be combined with other techniques. For example the setting of the PSH TCP Push bit by the sender in the TCP header may indicate a transaction boundary. Accordingly combining the time based approach with these additional heuristics can provide for more accurate detection of a transaction boundary. In another technique if the sender or flow control module understands the application protocol it can parse the protocol data stream and directly determine transaction boundaries. In some embodiment this last behavior can be used independent of any time based mechanism.

Responsive to detecting a transaction boundary the sender or flow control module transmits additional data packets to the receiver to cause acknowledgements therefrom. The additional data packets should therefore be such that the receiver will at least generate an ACK or SACK in response to receiving the data packet. In one embodiment the last packet or packets of the transaction are simply retransmitted. This has the added benefit of retransmitting needed data if the last packet or packets had been dropped as compared to merely sending dummy data packets. In another embodiment fractions of the last packet or packets are sent allowing the sender to disambiguate the arrival of these packets from their original packets. This allows the receiver to avoid falsely confusing any reordering adaptation algorithms. In another embodiment any of a number of well known forward error correction techniques can be used to generate additional data for the inserted packets allowing for the reconstruction of dropped or otherwise missing data at the receiver.

In some embodiments the boundary detection technique described herein helps to avoid a timeout when the acknowledgements for the last data packets in a transaction are dropped. When the sender or flow control module receives the acknowledgements for these additional data packets the sender can determine from these additional acknowledgements whether the last data packets have been received or need to be retransmitted thus avoiding a timeout. In one embodiment if the last packets have been received but their acknowledgements were dropped a flow control module generates an acknowledgement for the data packets and sends the acknowledgement to the sender thus communicating to the sender that the data packets have been delivered. In another embodiment if the last packets have not been received a flow control module sends a packet to the sender to cause the sender to retransmit the dropped data packets.

In yet another embodiment the appliance or flow controller applies a repacketization technique for improving the flow of transport layer network traffic. In some embodiments performance of TCP is proportional to packet size. Thus increasing packet sizes improves performance unless it causes substantially increased packet loss rates or other nonlinear effects like IP fragmentation. In general wired media such as copper or fibre optics have extremely low bit error rates low enough that these can be ignored. For these media it is advantageous for the packet size to be the maximum possible before fragmentation occurs the maximum packet size is limited by the protocols of the underlying transmission media . Whereas for transmission media with higher loss rates e.g. wireless technologies such as WiFi etc. or high loss environments such as power line networking etc. increasing the packet size may lead to lower transmission rates as media induced errors cause an entire packet to be dropped i.e. media induced errors beyond the capability of the standard error correcting code for that media increasing the packet loss rate. A sufficiently large increase in the packet loss rate will actually negate any performance benefit of increasing packet size. In some cases it may be difficult for a TCP endpoint to choose an optimal packet size. For example the optimal packet size may vary across the transmission path depending on the nature of each link.

By inserting an appliance or flow control module into the transmission path the flow controller monitors characteristics of the link and repacketizes according to determined link characteristics. In one embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets with sequential data into a smaller number of larger packets. In another embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets by breaking part a sequence of large packets into a larger number of smaller packets. In other embodiments an appliance or flow controller monitors the link characteristics and adjusts the packet sizes through recombination to improve throughput.

Still referring to the flow controller in some embodiments may include a QoS Engine also referred to as a QoS controller. In another embodiment the appliance and or network optimization engine includes the QoS engine for example separately but in communication with the flow controller . The QoS Engine includes any logic business rules function or operations for performing one or more Quality of Service QoS techniques improving the performance operation or quality of service of any of the network connections. In some embodiments the QoS engine includes network traffic control and management mechanisms that provide different priorities to different users applications data flows or connections. In other embodiments the QoS engine controls maintains or assures a certain level of performance to a user application data flow or connection. In one embodiment the QoS engine controls maintains or assures a certain portion of bandwidth or network capacity for a user application data flow or connection. In some embodiments the QoS engine monitors the achieved level of performance or the quality of service corresponding to a user application data flow or connection for example the data rate and delay. In response to monitoring the QoS engine dynamically controls or adjusts scheduling priorities of network packets to achieve the desired level of performance or quality of service.

In some embodiments the QoS engine prioritizes schedules and transmits network packets according to one or more classes or levels of services. In some embodiments the class or level service may include 1 best efforts 2 controlled load 3 guaranteed or 4 qualitative. For a best efforts class of service the appliance makes reasonable effort to deliver packets a standard service level . For a controlled load class of service the appliance or QoS engine approximates the standard packet error loss of the transmission medium or approximates the behavior of best effort service in lightly loaded network conditions. For a guaranteed class of service the appliance or QoS engine guarantees the ability to transmit data at a determined rate for the duration of the connection. For a qualitative class of service the appliance or QoS engine the qualitative service class is used for applications users data flows or connection that require or desire prioritized traffic but cannot quantify resource needs or level of service. In these cases the appliance or QoS engine determines the class of service or prioritization based on any logic or configuration of the QoS engine or based on business rules or policies. For example in one embodiment the QoS engine prioritizes schedules and transmits network packets according to one or more policies as specified by the policy engine .

In some embodiments the appliance and or network optimization engine is transparent to any data flowing across a network connection or link such as a WAN link. In one embodiment the appliance and or network optimization engine operates in such a manner that the data flow across the WAN is recognizable by any network monitoring QOS management or network analysis tools. In some embodiments the appliance and or network optimization engine does not create any tunnels or streams for transmitting data that may hide obscure or otherwise make the network traffic not transparent. In other embodiments the appliance operates transparently in that the appliance does not change any of the source and or destination address information or port information of a network packet such as internet protocol addresses or port numbers. In other embodiments the appliance and or network optimization engine is considered to operate or behave transparently to the network an application client server or other appliances or computing device in the network infrastructure. That is in some embodiments the appliance is transparent in that network related configuration of any device or appliance on the network does not need to be modified to support the appliance .

The appliance may be deployed in any of the following deployment configurations 1 in line of traffic 2 in proxy mode or 3 in a virtual in line mode. In some embodiments the appliance may be deployed inline to one or more of the following a router a client a server or another network device or appliance. In other embodiments the appliance may be deployed in parallel to one or more of the following a router a client a server or another network device or appliance.

Upon completion of processing the appliance forwards the processed network packet to the router to transmit to the destination on the network. In this way the appliance can be coupled to the router in parallel but still operate as it if the appliance were inline.

In some embodiments and still referring to a first program may be used to install and or execute the client agent or any portion thereof automatically silently transparently or otherwise. In one embodiment the first program is a plugin component such an ActiveX control or Java control or script that is loaded into and executed by an application. For example the first program comprises an ActiveX control loaded and run by a web browser application such as in the memory space or context of the application. In another embodiment the first program comprises a set of executable instructions loaded into and run by the application such as a browser.

Traditional QoS and acceleration processes may classify network packets via source or destination IP but this may be inefficient and counterproductive when a single IP address is associated with several applications. For example a client at one IP address could execute a VoIP application requiring a high service priority a web browsing process with medium priority and an FTP client with a low priority but if QoS and acceleration is only based on the IP address these distinctions would be lost. Furthermore even if port numbers are used to attempt to distinguish services distinctions between applications using the same port are lost. For example a system that considers all traffic on TCP port 80 to be medium priority web browsing may not recognize that some of the traffic is a low priority http file transfer some is a medium or high priority web application and still other is streamed multimedia using port 80 to tunnel through a firewall.

Further distinctions may exist too. For example in environments using ICA RDP or other application delivery protocols or systems application data traffic for multiple applications including word processors email applications VoIP or video chat applications file system explorers or other applications may be transmitted via a data or control channel on a single port. Distinctions between these applications and their differing requirements of QoS and priority would be lost. Similarly in environments in which application data from multiple applications is sent via a single encrypted channel an intermediary passing the encrypted traffic may not be able to determine priority and implement proper queuing.

Accordingly in some embodiments of the above discussed systems network performance may be enhanced and optimized by providing QoS and acceleration engines with packet or data specific information. In addition to source and destination IP addresses and port numbers packet or data specific information can include direction of traffic client to host or server server or host to client or both Virtual LAN VLAN ID source or destination application or associated application service class ICA priority type of service differentiated service code point DSCP or other information. Some or all of this information may be used to classify the network packet at a plurality of layers of a network stack allowing for deep inspection of the packet and multiple levels of granularity of classification.

Referring now to shown is a block diagram of an embodiment of a system for providing multi level classification of a network packet. In brief overview the system includes elements operating in kernel mode and user mode . Elements operating in kernel mode may include one or more NICs which may comprise one or more network interfaces discussed above in connection with a plug in framework a QoS plug in and a client agent driver . These components may interact communicate or exchange data with elements operating in user mode via a shared memory pool and or an IO control channel . Elements operating in user mode may include a network optimization engine an XML Remote Procedure Call RPC client a client agent control service and storage of default policies and configuration data . In some embodiments network optimization engine may include a reporter policy library XML RPC listener telnet listener and a simple network management protocol SNMP agent . Furthermore a management layer provides management components including a PHP Hypertext Preprocessor PHP server a command line interface CLI capable of providing a telnet or ssh shell an SNMP interface and a management interface such as Microsoft management console MMC and or Windows management instrumentation WMI via a WMI provider service.

Still referring to and in more depth in some embodiments the system may include a plug in framework . Plug in framework may comprise a library service process module extensible service provider or other interface for managing or controlling the execution of network services. In some embodiments plug in framework may provide an interface between applications and layers of a network stack below the application layer. In some embodiments plug in framework may manage multiple plug ins or network service providers and execute said network service providers or plug ins in a proper order. For example it may be inefficient in some embodiments to encrypt data prior to performing packet filtering operations. Such execution order may be determined dynamically on a per packet basis. For example in one embodiment encryption may performed after content filtering on transmitted packets and performed prior to content filtering on received packets such that content filtering is always performed on decrypted packets. Similarly by determining which plug ins are needed on a per packet basis plug in framework may reduce overhead for less used functions and increase efficiency of operations.

Plug ins to the plug in framework may include encryption compression security proxies re routing filtering deep packet inspection acceleration flow control disk based or memory based compression or other services. In one embodiment plug ins may include a QoS plug in . In some embodiments QoS plug in may provide per packet QoS and priority queuing bandwidth limiting and regulation and traffic blocking. In some embodiments QoS plug in may set Type of Service ToS bits in a packet for management by intelligent switches and QoS enabled routers. In a further embodiment QoS plug in may set ToS bits in conformance with a differentiated service code points DSCP scheme such as that described in IETF RFC 2474 or any other service class and priority queuing system.

Plug in framework may in some embodiments include a packet interception and filtering system. In one embodiment plug in framework may intercept a packet at one or more layers of a network stack below the application layer and utilize one or more filters on the packet to determine one or more plug ins to apply. For example in one embodiment plug in framework may intercept a packet received by a network interface and may utilize a filter to determine if the packet is encrypted. If the packet is encrypted plug in framework may apply a decryption plug in. If the packet is not encrypted plug in framework may disable or not apply the decryption plug in reducing the amount of processing needed for the packet. In some embodiments these filters may be applied on a per packet basis. In another embodiment these filters may be applied on a per flow basis a per class basis a per link basis or other less granular bases. In some embodiments plug in framework may include and manage any components of any embodiments of the client agent of .

As shown in plug in framework may provide plug in management for one or more NICs. Each NIC may provide one or more communications links or ports. These communications links may be defined to differentiate network traffic to different physical network segments and may include multiple links per adapter. Filters may be applied by plug in framework to links according to a filter policy. A filter policy may indicate one or more filters to be applied to packets received or transmitted via a link and may include an order in which the filters are applied. Additionally in some embodiments multiple filter policies may be applied to a link and each policy may have an associated priority. For example in one embodiment a first policy with a high order may be applied to all links while a second policy with a lower order may be applied to one or more specific links such as links associated with internal network segments on a LAN. Plug in framework may apply these policies based on the order such that in the example above the first policy may be applied first and the second policy applied second. This allows for different filtering and processing operations on different network segments. In some embodiments different policies may be applied to traffic on a link depending on direction. For example a first policy may be applied to inbound packets while a second policy is applied to outbound packets.

In some embodiments QoS plug in may comprise a service process subroutine or other executable code for classifying packets and applying QoS policies. In other embodiments QoS plug in may comprise a library database policy set or functions executed by plug in framework for classifying packets and applying QoS policies. In one embodiment QoS plug in provides functionality for identifying various ethernet protocols including IP non IP TCP and UDP traffic. In another embodiment QoS plug in provides functionality for identifying traffic via stateful or deep packet inspection. Accordingly QoS plug in may include a database or storage element for recording or caching information about a packet flow link and or a state of a communication link. In one embodiment QoS plug in may include a list of applications and functionality for identifying whether a packet is associated with an application in the list of applications. In some embodiments the applications in the application list are pre defined either by a user or administrator of a system or by the manufacturer of QoS plug in . In other embodiments QoS plug in may dynamically recognize applications and add them to the application list. In one embodiment QoS plug in may attach or append an application identifier to a packet after identifying an application associated with the packet. The application identifier may comprise a code name string pointer table or list index or other identifier to indicate an application in the application list associated with the packet.

In one embodiment QoS plug in may provide one or more queues for buffering network packets. In one embodiment QoS plug in may provide a plurality of queues with each queue having an associated priority. For example QoS plug in may provide a low priority queue a medium priority queue and a high priority queue and place packets into the queues responsive to QoS priorities associated with the packets. QoS plug in may then process the queues in order of priority. For example in one embodiment QoS plug in may process a high priority queue at a faster rate or more frequently than the plug in processes a low priority queue. In another embodiment QoS plug in may move packets within a single queue. For example QoS plug in may place high priority packets ahead of low priority packets within the queue. In one embodiment packet priority may be determined responsive to ToS bits DSCP bits ICA priority tags or any other information in the packet. In some embodiments the QoS plug in may have a plurality of queues corresponding to each of a number of one or more priorities identified by the protocol packet or otherwise such as a number of queues for the number of priorities identified by ToS bits DSCP bits or ICA priority tags.

In some embodiments QoS plug in may include one or more application classifiers. An application classifier may comprise logic executable code or other functionality for parsing a network packet received by the QoS plug in either from an internal source or external source at a network layer. In some embodiments QoS plug in may include a plurality of application classifiers each operating at a different network layer. Accordingly the application classifiers may provide multi level classification of network packets. In one embodiment a first application classifier operating at a lower network layer may classify a received packet as corresponding to a first application and attach an application identifier corresponding to the first application. The application classifier may pass the received packet to a second classifier operating at a higher network layer which may classify the received packet as corresponding to a second application. The second classifier provided with both classifications via the application identifier may determine the second classification is more appropriate and may modify the application identifier accordingly. This may be done for example to allow for queuing of encrypted network packets for processing by a decryption module. For example a first classifier may classify an encrypted packet as a TCP packet or UDP packet but due to the encryption may be unable to determine an application layer protocol of the packet. However in some embodiments a policy may indicate that UDP packets should be decrypted at a higher priority than TCP packets. Accordingly even though the first classifier may not have access to all of the information in the packet information relevant to a processing order of a decryption module may be identified providing for additional prioritized processing and QoS improvements. After decryption the decrypted packets may be passed to a second classifier to be further identified and classified responsive to a higher layer protocol still achieving the fine grained classification of high level application based QoS.

Application classifiers may access a list of applications with associated application identifiers. In some embodiments the applications in the list may be predetermined. In other embodiments application classifiers may include functionality for recognizing a new application not in the list and creating a new application identifier. For example an application classifier may include a parser to identify application data traffic associated with an application sent via a remote desktop protocol or ICA protocol. The application classifier may determine that the application does not have a corresponding application identifier in the list of applications and may create a new application identifier in the list corresponding to the new application. Application identifiers may include parameters of the application including application name type protocol service class default policies ToS ports URL group membership user traffic flow or other information.

Turning briefly to illustrated is a block diagram of an embodiment of parent child relationships of a plurality of layer 3 7 protocols. One skilled in the art may readily appreciate that the parent child relationships shown may be applied to other protocols including Appletalk ICMP IPX NetBIOS SIP DNS NTP POP IMAP Telnet RDP ICA or any other type and form of networking protocols. Network packets may be associated with several protocols which may be parsed along these parent child relationships. For example an HTTP network packet is also a TCP and IP packet. In classifying packets a QoS plug in network optimization engine or other component may classify a packet at one layer and attach an application identifier. In some embodiments the application identifier may include a parent identifier. Accordingly an application classifier parsing a data packet to determine that the packet is for example an SAP packet may attach a first application identifier that indicates the parent is HTTP. In an application identifier list the protocol HTTP may be identified as having a parent protocol of TCP. Similarly the protocol of TCP may be identified as having a parent protocol of IP. Accordingly a single high level application identifier may identify a plurality of lower level protocols through these established parent child relationships. Additionally groups may be created responsive to these relationships. For example TCP and UDP both have a parent relationship with IP and thus may be grouped together as child protocols of IP.

In addition to grouping applications via parent child relationships applications may be identified as part of one or more predetermined groups. Predetermined groups may include for example web services file delivery directory services VoIP email games peer to peer applications client server applications routing protocols security protocols or other information. An application identifier may indicate that the application is part of several groups via one or more flags. For example an application identifier may include a plurality of flags to indicate that an application is a web based peer to peer multimedia file transfer utility using an IP protocol. In one embodiment the application identifier may use a field with one or more bits set to indicate membership in the one or more groups. For example in some embodiments applications may be identified as belonging to one or more of the following groups 

In some embodiments application definitions may include a unique identifier to identify the application an identifier of a parent application in the application list a unique application name a long name or description of the application a composite group ID as discussed above a classifier identifier such as a network transport session or application level classifier module used for classifying traffic a next classifier identifier for embodiments in which multiple classifiers may be required to classify traffic a flag to indicate if the application is capable of being accelerated a flag to indicate whether the definition has been modified and a vector array of application parameters. These application parameters may be defined dynamically. For example in some embodiments the vector array of application parameters may include a name of a parameter such as port a type of parameter such as unsigned int or string a value of the parameter to be evaluated based on the type minimum and maximum values of the parameter if any and a flag to indicate whether the parameter is user editable. Multiple parameters may be defined for an application.

Returning to client agent driver may comprise a driver library API service or other interface for communication between a client agent or components of a client agent discussed above in more detail and plug in framework . In some embodiments the client agent driver comprises any embodiments of the client agent . Because kernel mode components and user mode components may use different structures and objects in one embodiment client agent driver may comprise a translation library or API for allowing a network optimization engine or components of the network optimization engine to communicate with plug in framework and or QoS plug in .

In some embodiments kernel mode components may interact communicate or exchange data with elements operating in user mode via a shared memory pool and or an IO control channel . In one embodiment shared memory pool may comprise a predetermined memory structure or location accessible by both kernel mode components and user mode components.

In some embodiments reporter may comprise a service function module subroutine logic or other executable code for requesting and collecting data and creating reports or reporting objects. In some embodiments reporter may include an interface for requesting information from QoS plug in including statistics of dropped packets and bytes transmitted and received packets and bytes latency buffer size and other information. In one embodiment reporter may request such information at regular intervals while in another embodiment reporter may request the information responsive to a trigger such as a user request. In some embodiments the interval may be configured by a user or administrator.

In one embodiment reporter may collect data at a plurality of different levels or scopes. For example in one such embodiment reporter may collect data specific to one or more QoS policies one or more applications one or more service classes one or more links or system wide data. Accordingly this data may be provided in reports focused on each level or scope. In some embodiments system wide data may include historical accelerated and un accelerated data allowing a user or administrator to determine the system efficiency gained through acceleration. Because multiple links may be configured per network adapter and traffic received via one link may be transmitted to multiple links reporter may collect data per link individually and aggregate the data to provide a complete overview of network traffic. Similarly reporter may collect application specific data to provide a user or administrator with an improved understanding of traffic flow to and from applications. For example reporter may collect and display data sorted by application in order of traffic sent traffic received packets sent packets received total traffic sent total traffic and total packets.

Likewise in some embodiments reporter may collect and display data associated with a QoS policy for each policy on a per link basis. In other embodiments reporter may collect and display data associated with one or more service classes including rates of traffic and statistics by service class per link.

In some embodiments historical data may be retained at varying levels of granularity including once per second once per minute once per 5 minutes once per hour once per two hours once per day or any other value and may be retained for varying durations including one minute one hour one day one week and one month. In some embodiments reporter may retain multiple concurrent sets of historical data of varying duration and granularity.

In one embodiment reporter may create one or more reporting objects responsive to an acceleration or QoS policy. Objects may be created specific to one or more of traffic direction object type unique identifiers of the policy or parent objects. Reporter may collect. For each object in one embodiment reporter may collect statistics or data including a number of bytes or packets processed by the policy a number of discarded bytes or packets and a number of dropped bytes or packets. Such packets or bytes may be dropped or discarded due to blocking or regulation policies.

Reporter may include one or more APIs or XML RPC methods which in some embodiments may be applied to various reporting objects statistics or collected data discussed above such as getting a sorted list of applications in order of statistics or counters for the object such as a list of dropped packets per application getting a sorted list of all applications in a specified group in order of statistics or counters for the object such as all HTTP applications or all applications associated with Google getting report data for a specific link getting report data for a specific service class or getting report data for a specific QoS policy. Such reports in one embodiment may be output as an XML file or array of link name and counter statistic pairs. Furthermore for managing reports and counters reporter may include XML RPC methods for resetting one or more application counters link counters service class counters or QoS policy counters.

Because a lot of data may be stored in extended performance counters which some reporting objects may not use in some embodiments reporter uses selective data collection and reporting. In these embodiments each reporting object may include one or more flags for relevant data such as bytes packets bytes discarded packets discarded bytes dropped packets dropped and may collect and report only flagged data. In another embodiment the reporting object may include a flag indicating to collect and report all data.

In some embodiments reporter may include or manage counters for transmitted dropped packets received dropped packets NIC stops receive buffer drops outbound packets filtered by a copy or clone setting traced packets or packets not included in a trace received packets packets dropped from a queue filters that cannot be allocated in memory NIC no carrier indicators timeout indicators stops or timeouts packets received dropped or received with padding while in a loopback mode received or transmitted packets bytes errors dropped packets multicast packets received or transmitted collisions detected receive length errors receive oversize errors receive CRC errors receive frame errors receive buffer FIFO errors receive buffer missed packet errors transmission aborted errors transmission carrier loss errors transmission buffer FIFO errors transmission heartbeat errors transmission window errors or number of compressed packets or bytes transmitted or received.

In other embodiments reporter may include or manage counters associated with a plug in framework for a number of bytes or packets received from a network stack a number of bytes or packets received from the stack and passed to a filter a number of bytes in IPSec packets or number of IPSec packets received from the stack a number of bytes or packets received from network adapters a number of bytes or packets received from adapters and passed to a filter a number of bytes in IPSec packets or number of IPSec packets received from adapters a number of packets dropped a number of packets received passed to a filter and or dropped by protocol a number of trace packets dropped a number of packets lost a number of packets dropped from a transmission queue a number of times a packet could not be removed from a transmission queue or was dropped due to stalls adapter connects disconnects or failures or number of times that an adapter went up down or into standby.

In some embodiments counters may be specific to an adapter or on a per adapter basis and may include packets received or transmitted bytes received or transmitted packets or bytes dropped from a transmission queue and packets or bytes dropped from a receive buffer.

Similarly to enhance the usability of reports reporter may apply a filter to data prior to generating reports. In some embodiments reporter may filter relevant data based on counters such as bytes packets bytes discarded packets discarded bytes dropped packets dropped or all data. In other embodiments reporter may filter relevant data based on time such as data collected within the last minute last hour last day last week last month or all data. In still other embodiments reporter may filter relevant data based on flow or traffic direction including inbound outbound or both. In yet still other embodiments data may be collected as both a counter value and a rate of change and reporter may filter data by type including value rate or all. In other embodiments reporter may filter data by reporting only a specified number of active objects such as the top ten most active applications the top five links dropping the most inbound packets or any other number of objects. In still other embodiments reporter may filter data by application group such as all applications belonging to the group games . In yet still other embodiments reporter may filter data by link such that reporter may report only statistics for a specific link. In many embodiments multiple filters may be applied. For example in one such embodiment reporter may report the rate of dropped bytes per second of inbound data for an email application over the past hour for link 3. Reporter may in some embodiments sort the data prior to reporting.

Policy library may comprise a library database registry data file or other data storage element for storing modifying and retrieving one or more policies for use by network optimization engine and or QoS plug in . In one embodiment policy library may include default parameters which may be stored in a default policy file . These policies may be applied by network optimization engine and or QoS policy to packets flows or links. In one embodiment management functions discussed in more detail below may be treated as services accessed via an internal or virtual link. In these embodiments to avoid processing packets directed to these functions with compression encryption QoS or other acceleration features policy library may apply a policy to each of one or more external or non management links indicating that traffic on each of the one or more external or non management links should be sent to an accelerator function. Similar policies may be used for various types of traffic including address resolution protocol traffic generic routing encapsulation traffic with non internal destinations or other types of traffic that should not be processed by one or more acceleration features of network optimization engine .

In one embodiment a QoS policy may include one more actions to be applied when traffic matches one or more filter conditions of the policy. In one embodiment an action to be applied may include regulating or limiting the bandwidth of the traffic matching the filter condition. In a further embodiment an action may include regulating or limiting the bandwidth of the traffic at different levels depending on direction of flow. For example a policy may indicate to limit inbound traffic to a first rate and limit outbound traffic to a second rate. In another embodiment an action to be applied may be to process traffic matching the filter condition at a minimum latency or as fast as possible which may include prioritizing the minimum latency traffic ahead of other traffic or buffering or delaying other non minimum latency traffic. In another embodiment an action to be applied may be to block traffic matching the one or more filter conditions.

In yet another embodiment an action to be applied may be to process the traffic according to a priority level. In some embodiments multiple priority levels may exist including three high medium low five high high medium medium low medium low seven very high high high medium medium low medium low very low or any other number. In one embodiment numerical priority values may be used for each level. For example in one embodiment priority levels of 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 may correspond to the seven priority levels discussed above. However other values may be used providing coarser or finer divisions as necessary. In some embodiments a priority level of medium may be used when there is no priority specified in a policy. In some embodiments priority levels may exist for background traffic. Processing the traffic according to the priority level may in some embodiments comprise processing traffic at varying rates or frequencies according to priority or performing other acceleration functions described herein.

In still another embodiment an action to be applied may be to mark a network traffic packet matching the one or more conditions with ToS bits for management by intelligent switches and QoS enabled routers. In another embodiment the action may be to mark the packet with DSCP bits. In yet still another embodiment the action may be to mark the packet with an ICA priority tag.

As discussed above policies may be applied to packets that match one or more filter conditions. In some embodiments these filter conditions may include an application name type or identifier a port a direction of flow a local IP address a remote IP address a VLAN ID a DSCP setting a priority a packet size a Web Cache Communication Protocol WCCP service group ID or any other type of information. Filter conditions may include an order of precedence of application such that one condition with a high precedence may be applied before a condition with a low precedence. In some embodiments a user or administrator of a system may adjust the precedence of one or more filter conditions.

Referring briefly ahead to illustrated is a block diagram of an embodiment of a network optimization engine for providing multi level classification of a network packet. Policy library may provide for translation or conversion from data structures useable by QoS plug in to those useable by network optimization engine or other user mode components. In some embodiments such translation or conversion may be provided via one or more classifiers configuration policy translators and report translators. Classifiers may be used by QoS plug in or network optimization engine to define and classify applications. Classifiers may be updated by policy library responsive to changes in definitions of applications. Similarly configuration policy translators may be created responsive to link policies service class policies and or QoS policies. For example rules in a service class filter and actions in a QoS policy may be used to build a policy which may be passed to QoS plug in using the translator. Similarly data for reports discussed in more detail above may be collected or processed using a translator provided by policy library .

In some embodiments discussed in more detail below a classifier may comprise an application program module service daemon subroutine logic functionality or other executable code for classifying a packet as corresponding to an application. In one embodiment a classifier may include a parser for detecting or locating information in a packet identifying the packet as corresponding to the application. In another embodiment a classifier may include or manage an application list with one or more applications and one or more corresponding application identifiers. In a further embodiment discussed in more detail below the application list may include information of a parent child relationship with another application. In another further embodiment discussed in more detail below the application list may include group membership information of an application. In some embodiments the classifier may include functionality for parsing a packet for information identifying a new application not in the application list and adding the new application to the application list and establishing a new application identifier for the new application.

In some embodiments for QoS and acceleration to work together link and service class policies need to be set up in a policy tree. In one embodiment of such a tree two link policy objects may be created for each link one for each direction inbound and outbound . Service class policies may be created under each link policy. Thus when a packet arrives the packet may be classified statistics may be gathered for reporting and QoS or acceleration actions may be applied.

Returning to in some embodiments network optimization engine may include an XML RPC listener a telnet listener and or an SNMP agent . XML RPC listener telnet listener and SNMP agent may comprise one or more services functions subroutines daemons applications or other executable code for monitoring communications between network optimization engine management functions and configuration storage . For example SNMP agent may provide processing and transmission of SNMP management data and commands either internally or via a network connection. XML RPC listener may interface with an XML RPC client which may in some embodiments comprise a web browser a shell terminal or any other type and form of client interfaces for processing XML RPC calls or other HTTP PHP or similar traffic. In one embodiment XML RPC client may interface to a WMI provider or other management interface for automation and monitoring.

In some embodiments network optimization engine QoS plug in and or client agent driver may include or communicate with a license module. In one embodiment if the license module detects that the product is not licensed one or more filter or QoS policies may be disabled such that network traffic is unprocessed.

The system shown in may be deployed in various embodiments including as part of an intermediary device such as a router network switch firewall network bridge or other device or as part of a client or a server. In these various embodiments network ports of the system may be used together for bridging or routing from one network segment to another or may be used separately. In these embodiments the system may communicate with other routers via normal routing policy based routing web cache communication protocol WCCP routing or any other routing mechanism. For example the system may be deployed in a direct or end point mode an in line or virtual in line VI mode a routed mode a WCCP mode a proxy mode a tunnel mode or in any other deployment mode.

In these embodiments NIC ports or adapters may use multiple links as discussed above. Each link may be identified by one or more configuration parameters. These parameters may include a link ID which may be an internal index or unique ID an adapter name which may be defined by a user or administrator or generated automatically a link type identifier which may be used to define a link object type such as LAN WAN site or any other type one or more filter rules to be applied to the link maximum inbound link speed or bandwidth in bps or any other metric maximum outbound link speed or bandwidth in bps or any other metric and an order in which policies or communications associated with the link are processed such that higher order policies may be processed before lower order policies. In some embodiments the parameters may be modifiable by a user or administrator of the system and the parameters may include a modified flag set to a zero value in some embodiments or a non zero value in other embodiments to indicate the policy has been modified.

To support QoS in different network topologies configurations and deployment modes as discussed above each link definition or identification may further include one or more filtering parameters including one or more IP addresses adapter names ethernet addresses VLAN IDs WCCP service group IDs or any other identifier. In some embodiments each link may include a single entry for IP addresses and or ethernet addresses such that there is no differentiation between source and destination addresses. In one such embodiment the addresses may be used as source or destination addresses based on the direction of a link policy i.e. inbound or outbound. For example a link with an address of 1.2.3.4 may have a filter policy for inbound traffic that is applied to traffic with a destination IP of 1.2.3.4 and a filter policy for outbound traffic that is applied to traffic with a source IP of 1.2.3.4. In some embodiments IP addresses may be specified or defined in different formats including dotted strings arrays of bytes and or integer values.

In one embodiment links may be managed through one or more remote procedure call commands or methods as discussed above. These methods may include commands for creating a link renaming a link deleting a link changing a link getting parameters of a link resetting one or more counters associated with a link or getting statistics or counter values from the one or more counters associated with the link. Further commands may be associated with the methods for use in a CLI or other interface including commands for displaying link statistics in one or more formats such as XML displaying or dumping characteristics of a link in one or more formats such as XML displaying or dumping cached characteristics of a link in one or more formats such as XML displaying a list of current links or applications utilizing links and resetting one or more counters associated with a link. In one embodiment link definitions may be stored in a parameter file in a format such as XML. These definitions may in some embodiments be first created during initialization. The hierarchy afforded by XML may be used for example to denote policies or service classes associated with links in both inbound and outbound modes 

Service classes in some embodiments may be used to differentiate between priorities of traffic. As discussed above DSCP bits may be used to denote service classes with each class being a group of DSCPs with the same precedence value. Values within a class may offer similar network services but with slight differences such as gold silver and bronze performance sub classes . As discussed above IETF RFC 2474 describes some service classes via code numbers. In some embodiments DSCP bits may be mapped to some or all of these code numbers to ensure compatibility with RFC 2474 compliant switches as shown below 

Similarly other priority codes may be mapped to one or more service classes. For example in some embodiments ICA priority tags may include the values 0 3 representing high medium low and background tasks which may be mapped to one or more DSCP bits or other service class levels.

In some embodiments QoS policies may include multiple parameters including a unique identifier to identify a policy action one or more action flags to identify which actions are used with the QoS policy such as blocking providing bandwidth limiting or regulation providing traffic with minimum latency etc. as discussed above a unique QoS policy name a priority level a service bits setting to change ToS or DSCP bits of a packet processed according to the policy a maximum input and or output bandwidth an ICA priority value or other protocol priority value to include with the packet and a flag indicating whether the policy has been modified.

In some embodiments different actions such as acceleration QoS reporting and classification may be applied to packets based on service class. In one embodiment reporting and classification actions may be implicit or may be required for all service classes. Thus in this embodiment only two options QoS and acceleration may be reported to a user or administrator or provided as configuration options. In some embodiments acceleration actions may be based on the applications included in a service class definition. For example a service class may only be accelerate able if it includes applications capable of being accelerated. Not all service classes are relevant for acceleration depending on the application or applications used to define a service class. Some dynamic protocol applications can t be configured for acceleration. Thus options may be provided in a configuration tool for a user or administrator to select acceleration and or QoS tasks to be utilized for a class. In some embodiments some statistical parameters such as compression ratio or accelerated vs. un accelerated traffic will not be available for classes not selected for acceleration usage. In one embodiment when an option for acceleration usage is selected the configuration tool may only display the list of applications which can be accelerated. In some embodiments the configuration tool may include a mechanism to find which applications can be accelerated.

In some embodiments service classes may include or be defined by parameters such as a unique identifier for the service class a precedence order for processing of the policy related to the service class one or more flags of supported policies one or more filter rules in an ordered list one or more QoS policies which in one embodiment may comprise an array of values of policy identifier and link identifier pairs one or more acceleration policies a flag identifying if the service class has been modified and a flag that may be set to enable or disable the service class without deleting the parameters from the device configuration. In some embodiments acceleration policies may include flow control disk based compression and memory based compression. QoS policies may be separately defined within a service class parameter and may be associated with multiple service classes.

In some embodiments XML RPC commands and methods may be used to manage service classes. These commands and methods may include commands for creating a service class renaming a service class deleting a service class changing a service class parameter or parameters getting or retrieving a service class parameter or parameters resetting one or more counters associated with the service class getting or retrieving one or more counter values or statistics associated with the service class setting an acceleration policy or policies for the service class setting a QoS policy or policies for the service class updating an order of precedence of the service class and changing an enabled or disabled state of the service class. Commands for a CLI or other interface may include commands to display a list of current service classes display entries in an index table of service classes display service class statistics in one or more formats such as XML convert or output a service class definition in XML retrieve a cached XML definition of a service class reset a service class driver reverse a service class index to control order of application dump connection information of connections associated with a service class and reset one or more service class counters. In one embodiment the service class list may be stored in an XML file and may be created as a default list during initialization. In some embodiments default service classes may be hard coded while in others they may be generated responsive to presence of one or more applications or components during initialization.

In some embodiments a system such as that shown in may comprise functionality for disabling one or more features. This may be helpful particularly for testing purposes. In some embodiments one or more acceleration policies and or one or more QoS policies may be disabled without deleting them from an active configuration. In one embodiment disabling policies may be controlled a system state parameter such that QoS policies and or acceleration policies may be enabled or disabled based on the setting or unsetting of a predetermined bit such as a first bit for QoS policies and a second bit for acceleration policies. In a further embodiment an XML RPC method may be used to get a current state of system features such as QoS or acceleration being enabled or disabled or used to set a current state by changing the value of the predetermined bit or bits.

In some embodiments the system may include functionality for processing encrypted traffic discussed in more detail below in connection with . For example in one embodiment the system may decrypt compress and re encrypt SSL traffic. Service classes may be utilized with SSL traffic by filtering SSL traffic based on one or more characteristics such as destination port SSL server address and source IP address. As discussed above in connection with a system including a reporter may collect and report statistics associated with SSL traffic. To provide per application level statistics in some embodiments the reporter may use a multi level classification method such as the one discussed in more detail below in connection with to classify SSL traffic as associated with or corresponding to an application. Per application statistics may then be collected and reported for the encrypted traffic along with statistics for unencrypted traffic. For example in one such embodiment a service class may be defined for messaging API MAPI traffic with a filter of an SSL server IP and port address and traffic associated with that IP and port may be classified as MAPI traffic. If another service class includes a MAPI enabled application such as Microsoft Outlook the encrypted traffic may be reported along with unencrypted traffic associated with the MAPI enabled application. Conversely if no service classes include MAPI enabled applications then in some embodiments the encrypted traffic may be reported as unclassified TCP traffic. Accordingly it may be preferable to configure an application specific service class along with the SSL service class.

In some embodiments a system may include a default configuration with default link and service classes that a user or administrator may be prevented from deleting. For instance default link and service classes may be used in some embodiments as templates for constructing new links and service classes and accordingly shouldn t be deleted. Accordingly in these embodiments service classes links policies and or other objects may include one or more flags or predetermined bits set to indicate one or more of the user is not allowed to delete the object the user is not allowed to edit the object definition the user is not allowed to change the order of the object the user is not allowed to change the QoS policy and or actions for the object and the user is not allowed to change the acceleration policy for the object. Each flag may be represented by an independent bit in a string such that multiple flags may be independently set.

In some embodiments other defaults may be utilized too. For example the system may include default maximum queue depths for packet queueing and maximum number of entries and or table size values for reporting application link service class or other statistics. In some embodiments the system may also include preconfigured filter rules such as a rule to send all TCP traffic to the QoS plug in and or network optimization engine for classification and or further processing. This may be done for example to avoid additional processing of management interface traffic. In other embodiments the system may include a rule to direct generic routing encapsulation GRE tunneled traffic to the QoS plug in. For example one rule may indicate that all GRE traffic whether TCP or UDP that is not web cache communication protocol traffic may be passed to the QoS plug in or network optimization engine for classification or further processing. Another rule with a higher precedence may also be used to intercept GRE WCCP traffic. In one embodiment such a rule may be applied only to incoming traffic directed to a hosted IP address.

In one embodiment internal address resolution protocol ARP or pseudo ARP messages may be utilized to identify the proper adapter to use for specified traffic. In such embodiments the system may include a preconfigured rule to intercept outbound TCP synchronization SYN packets on a predetermined port such as 5555 for passing to a QoS plug in or network optimization engine. Once the packet is passed to one of these modules the module may use MAC information in the packet to identify an adapter and update an ARP table. To ensure that the SYN packet does not result in a hanging connection the module may reply with an RST packet back to the original socket to terminate the connection.

Other preconfigured policies that may exist in some embodiments include an exclude policy in which specified traffic is dropped. In one embodiment of a system with such a policy traffic matching a filter set may have a policy applied with the policy lacking any action that causes the traffic to be sent to a QoS plug in or network optimization engine. Accordingly by placing this policy first in precedence the traffic may be excluded from further processing. Filters that may be used in some embodiments include predetermined port numbers such as 3389 for RDP terminal services 80 or 443 for HTTP communications 22 for SSH 23 for telnet or other ports including those used for internal XML RPC protocol messages. In other embodiments the filters may include source or destination IP addresses matching hosted IP addresses of the system such as loopback addresses or internal configuration addresses. In still other embodiments in which the system uses virtual IP VIP addresses filters may be used to exclude TCP traffic with source or destination IP addresses matching virtual IP addresses. In yet still other embodiments in which the system interacts with another system to provide high availability HA services filters may be used to exclude HA management traffic with source or destination IP addresses matching IP addresses hosted on an HA management adapter.

In some embodiments for managing signaling channel traffic between a client and appliance or applications on the system the system may include a preconfigured signal channel policy. In one such embodiment outbound traffic from a signaling channel IP and port may be redirected back and inbound traffic to the signaling channel IP and port may be directed to a QoS plug in or network optimization engine.

In some embodiments the system may include a preconfigured policy to apply QoS to UDP traffic without performing acceleration techniques on the traffic. For example in systems that serve as a proxy for UDP traffic from a WCCP router MAC and IP addresses may be flipped to allow content routing for real time redirection of traffic flows. Accordingly in one embodiment the system may include a filter that intercepts UDP traffic with destination MAC addresses matching a system interface and destination IP address not matching an interface and passes the traffic to a QoS plug in for prioritization.

In some embodiments the system may include bandwidth management functionality. In an embodiment of aggressive bandwidth management the system may ignore conventional congestion control and packing signals. For example the system may resend packets in response to packet loss but not reduce transmission rates and or may not use a slow start protocol but immediately send packets at the negotiated bandwidth. In some embodiments the system may ignore self clocking routines. For example in one such embodiment the system may send data to fill a window such as an 8 MB window regardless of not receiving any ACK packets. In these aggressive bandwidth management embodiments a receiver side QoS system may not be able to slow down a remote sender utilizing these aggressive techniques without adjusting negotiated bandwidth through TCP options.

Shown in is a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for providing multi level classification of a network packet. In brief overview at step a first classifier may receive a network packet. At step the first classifier may classify the received packet as corresponding to a first predetermined application. At step the first classifier may include an application identifier of the first predetermined application with the network packet. At step a second classifier may receive the network packet. At step the second classifier may classify the received packet as corresponding to a second predetermined application. At step the second classifier may determine whether to use the included application identifier of the first predetermined application or the application identifier of the second predetermined application.

Referring to and in more detail at step a first classifier operating in a first portion of a network stack of a device may receive a packet of network traffic from a network port. In some embodiments the first classifier may receive the packet of network traffic via an intermediary process such as a filter of a plug in framework or network optimization engine discussed above. In some embodiments the first classifier may operate in a kernel level of the device. In one embodiment the first classifier may intercept the packet of network traffic. In a further embodiment the first classifier may intercept the packet at a network layer or portion of the network stack below a transport layer. In such embodiments the packet may be referred to variously as intercepted or received by the classifier.

At step in some embodiments the first classifier may classify the received packet of network traffic as corresponding to a first predetermined application. In one embodiment the first classifier may parse the packet to identify one or more protocols identified within the packet. For example in one embodiment the first classifier may identify a network protocol of the packet and classify the received packet as corresponding to a first predetermined application that utilizes the network protocol. In another embodiment the first classifier may identify other information in the packet including a protocol type an application name a data string one or more data flags or any other information that may identify the packet as corresponding to the first predetermined application. In some embodiments the first classifier may classify the received packet at a network layer of the network stack or below a transport layer of the network stack.

At step in some embodiments the first classifier may include an application identifier of the first predetermined application with the packet. In one embodiment including an application identifier with the packet may comprise attaching or appending the application identifier to the packet. In another embodiment including an application identifier with the packet may comprise adding or modifying a flag or string of a header of the packet. For example in one such embodiment the first classifier may add a string to an options field of a protocol header of the packet identifying the application identifier. In other embodiments the application identifier may be included in an data object that comprises the packet of network traffic. In one embodiment in which data has been fragmented across a plurality of network packets data of the packets may be assembled into a contiguous data block and the application identifier may be included with the data block.

At step in many embodiments a second classifier operating at a layer of the network stack of the device above the first portion of the network stack at which the first classifier operates may receive the network packet. In some embodiments the second classifier may receive the network packet communicated by the first classifier. For example in one embodiment the first classifier may communicate the packet via the network stack to the second classifier. In another embodiment the first classifier may communicate the packet via the network stack and the second classifier may intercept the packet. In yet another embodiment the first classifier may communicate the packet to the second classifier via a memory mapped interface. Thus in some embodiments the first classifier may explicitly transfer the packet to the second classifier while in other embodiments the first classifier may simply transmit the packet agnostic to further processing or without knowledge of the second classifier s operations. In some embodiments the second classifier may execute in a user level of the device. In many embodiments the second classifier may operate on the packet at or above a transport layer of the network stack.

At step in some embodiments the second classifier may classify the received packet as corresponding to a second predetermined application. In one embodiment the second classifier may classify the received packet as corresponding to a second predetermined application via content of the packet at or above a transport layer of the network stack. In one embodiment the second classifier may parse the packet to identify one or more protocols identified within the packet. For example in one embodiment the second classifier may identify an application protocol of the packet and classify the received packet as corresponding to a second predetermined application that utilizes the application protocol. In another embodiment the second classifier may identify other information in the packet including a protocol type an application name a data string one or more data flags or any other information that may identify the packet as corresponding to the second predetermined application. In some embodiments the second classifier may identify the packet as comprising a remote display protocol remote desktop protocol or ICA protocol packet and may identify an application associated with application display or control data within the packet as the second predetermined application.

At step in some embodiments the second classifier may determine whether to use the second classifier s classification of the packet as corresponding to the second predetermined application or the first classifier s classification of the packet identified by the application identifier. In one embodiment the second classifier may determine that the first predetermined application is more granular than the second predetermined application and may maintain or utilize the application identifier of the first classifier. For example in one embodiment the first classifier may identify network traffic as corresponding to a web application and the second classifier may identify the network traffic as corresponding to HTTP traffic. In such a case the first identification of web application may be more granular than the second identification of HTTP which may include both HTTP web applications and other HTTP data. In one embodiment granularity may be determined responsive to parent child relationships of applications and protocols discussed above in connection with . For example if a first identifier is a child of a second identifier then the first identifier may be considered more granular. In other embodiments the second classifier may determine that the second predetermined application is a more appropriate classification than the first predetermined application and may replace the application identifier included with the packet with a second application identifier of or corresponding to the second predetermined application. For example if the identification of the second predetermined application is more granular than the identification of the first predetermined application then the second classifier may replace the application identifier included with the packet with an application identifier corresponding to the second predetermined application. Once properly classified by either the first application or the second application various QoS policies may be applied to the packet responsive to the classification.

As discussed above an application list may include many predetermined applications. However in some embodiments of a remote desktop or thin client system it may be possible that any application could be accessed remotely. Accordingly network packets of the remote display protocol may include application display data graphical data or control data corresponding to an application that is not included in the list of predetermined applications. Thus it may be valuable for an application classifier to include functionality for recognize and add new applications to the application list.

In one embodiment application classifiers discussed above may include functions to interact with a list of predetermined applications. For example in one embodiment application classifiers may use APIs to create an application definition with parameters either as a list of parameters or an XML file. XML RPC methods may also be used to manage the application list including methods for creating an application definition renaming an application definition deleting an application definition changing an application definition setting getting or retrieving an application definition getting or retrieving an application definition by name getting or retrieving an application definition by group identifier resetting one or more counters associated with an application definition or getting or retrieving one or more counter values or statistics associated with the application definition. Commands for a CLI or other interface to interact with the application list may include commands for displaying application definition statistics or counter values in one or more formats including XML retrieving an application definition in an XML format retrieving a cached version of an application definition in an XML format displaying the list of applications or a list of currently used applications and resetting one or more counters associated with an application.

Referring now to illustrated is a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for discovery of applications via a remote display protocol to include in a list of applications for classification of network traffic. In brief overview at step an intermediary device may classify traffic of a remote display protocol according to a list of applications for the remote display protocol. At step the intermediary device may parse the traffic for application information. At step the intermediary device may identify a new application not in the list of applications for the remote display protocol from the parsed application information. At step the intermediary device may add the new application to the list of applications used for classification of remote protocol display traffic. In some embodiments the intermediary device may then repeat step to reclassify the traffic.

Still referring to and in more detail in some embodiments at step a device intermediary to a plurality of clients and a plurality of servers may classify traffic of a remote display protocol according to a list of applications for the remote display protocol. Although referred to generally as a remote display protocol the protocol may include an RDP protocol an ICA protocol a remote frame buffer RFB protocol an X11 protocol or any other type and form of remote display protocol. The list of applications may be preconfigured by a user or administrator or in some embodiments the list of applications for the remote display protocol may be established during initialization of the device. In one embodiment the device may establish the list of applications for the remote display protocol responsive to or corresponding to one or more applications published by one or more servers of the plurality of servers for the remote display protocol.

At step in one embodiment the device may parse the remote display protocol traffic traversing the device for application information of the remote display protocol. In some embodiments a server of the plurality of servers may publish an application as an application accessible on the server by one or more users via the remote display protocol. In many such embodiments the server may transmit remote display protocol traffic advertising the newly published application to the one or more users. Upon receiving this traffic the intermediary device may parse the traffic to identify the newly published application. In other embodiments the intermediary device may parse remote display protocol traffic for an identifier of an application. For example in some embodiments traffic may be sent that identifies an application to be executed launched quit closed or otherwise interacted with. The device may then parse the traffic to determine the identification of the application.

At step in some embodiments the device may identify from the parsed application information a new application not in the list of applications for the remote display protocol. In one embodiment identifying a new application may comprise comparing a name of the new application from the parsed application information with names from the list of applications. In another embodiment identifying a new application may comprise comparing an identifier a string a unique ID or any other information in the parsed application information with corresponding information in the list of applications. In some embodiments the device may determine that the parsed application information of the remote display protocol identifies an application as the new applications. In other embodiments the device may determine that the parsed application information identifies an application already in the list of applications. In such embodiments the device may skip step .

At step in some embodiments the intermediary device may add the new application to the list of applications used for classification of remote display protocol traffic. In one embodiment the device may establish an application identifier discussed above for the new application. In other embodiments the device may establish a priority for the new application from a plurality of priorities. For example in one such embodiment the device may establish the new application as being a high priority application. In a further embodiment the device may receive remote display protocol traffic for the new application and may classify the remote display protocol traffic according to the established priority. QoS and other acceleration techniques may be performed responsive to the classified priority. In many embodiments the device may receive further remote display protocol traffic for the new application and may classify the remote display protocol traffic according to classification information for the new application added to the list of applications.

As discussed above in many embodiments a device performing QoS priority queuing and other acceleration techniques may classify received packets as corresponding to an application and then apply QoS and other policies associated with the application. However in many embodiments packets may be encrypted such that prior to encryption an application classifier cannot determine the application associated with or corresponding to the packets. One solution may be to not classify packets until after they ve been decrypted. However this may result in all encrypted packets being placed into a decryption queue or buffer regardless of priority. Accordingly it may be more efficient to decrypt packets in an order dependent on a first classification of the encrypted network packet and reclassify encrypted network traffic after decryption.

Shown in is a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for providing classification of encrypted network traffic. In brief overview at step a first classifier may receive an encrypted packet. At step the first classifier may classify the encrypted packet as corresponding to a first predetermined application. At step the first classifier may include an application identifier of the first predetermined application with the encrypted network packet. At step a second classifier may receive and decrypt the network packet. At step the second classifier may classify the decrypted packet as corresponding to a second predetermined application. At step the second classifier may determine whether to use the included application identifier of the first predetermined application or the application identifier of the second predetermined application.

Still referring to and in more detail at step a first classifier operating at a first portion of a network stack of a device may receive an encrypted packet of network traffic via a network port. In some embodiments the first classifier may receive the packet of network traffic via an intermediary process such as a filter of a plug in framework or network optimization engine discussed above. In some embodiments the first classifier may operate in a kernel level of the device. In one embodiment the first classifier may intercept the encrypted packet. In a further embodiment the first classifier may intercept the encrypted packet at a network layer or portion of the network stack below a transport layer. In such embodiments the encrypted packet may be referred to variously as intercepted or received by the classifier.

At step in some embodiments the first classifier may classify the received encrypted packet. In one embodiment the first classifier may classify the encrypted packet as corresponding to a first predetermined application. In one embodiment the first classifier may parse the packet to identify one or more protocols identified within the packet. For example in one embodiment the first classifier may identify a network protocol of the packet and classify the received packet as corresponding to a first predetermined application that utilizes the network protocol. In another embodiment the first classifier may identify other information in an unencrypted portion of the encrypted packet such as an IP header including a protocol type an application name a data string one or more data flags or any other information that may identify the packet as corresponding to the first predetermined application. In one embodiment the first classifier may classify the packet based on unencrypted portions of the packet. In another embodiment the first classifier may receive a packet comprising an encrypted payload and classify the packet based on non payload content. In another embodiment a packet may comprise an encrypted packet of a first protocol encapsulated in an unencrypted second protocol and the first classifier may classify the packet based on the unencrypted encapsulation headers and or data portions. In some embodiments the first classifier may classify the received packet at a network layer of the network stack or below a transport layer of the network stack.

At step in some embodiments the first classifier may include an application identifier corresponding to a first predetermined application identified by the classification with the packet. In one embodiment including an application identifier with the packet may comprise attaching or appending the application identifier to the packet. In another embodiment including an application identifier with the packet may comprise adding or modifying a flag or string of a header of the packet. For example in one such embodiment the first classifier may add a string to an options field of a protocol header of the packet identifying the application identifier. In other embodiments the application identifier may be included in an data object that comprises the packet of network traffic. In one embodiment in which data has been fragmented across a plurality of network packets data of the packets may be assembled into a contiguous data block and the application identifier may be included with the data block.

At step in many embodiments a second classifier operating at a second portion of the network stack of the device above the first portion at which the first classifier operates may receive the network packet. In some embodiments the second classifier may decrypt the packet. In other embodiments the second classifier may pass the packet to a decryption module which may decrypt the packet and return the unencrypted packet to the second classifier. In some embodiments the second classifier may receive the encrypted packet communicated by the first classifier. For example in one embodiment the first classifier may communicate the encrypted packet via the network stack to the second classifier. In another embodiment the first classifier may communicate the encrypted packet via the network stack and the second classifier may intercept the packet. In yet another embodiment the first classifier may communicate the encrypted packet to the second classifier via a memory mapped interface. Thus in some embodiments the first classifier may explicitly transfer the encrypted packet to the second classifier while in other embodiments the first classifier may simply transmit the packet agnostic to further processing or without knowledge of the second classifier s operations. In some embodiments the second classifier may execute in a user level of the device. In many embodiments the second classifier may operate on the packet at or above a transport layer of the network stack.

At step in some embodiments the second classifier may classify or reclassify the packet based on decrypted content of the encrypted packet. In one embodiment the second classifier may classify the packet as corresponding to a second predetermined application via decrypted content of the packet at or above a transport layer of the network stack. In one embodiment the second classifier may parse the packet to identify one or more protocols identified within the packet. For example in one embodiment the second classifier may identify an application protocol of the decrypted packet and classify the packet as corresponding to a second predetermined application that utilizes the application protocol. In another embodiment the second classifier may identify other information in the packet including a protocol type an application name a data string one or more data flags or any other information that may identify the packet as corresponding to the second predetermined application. In some embodiments the second classifier may identify an application associated with application display or control data within the packet as the second predetermined application. In one embodiment the second classifier may identify the second predetermined application within a tunnel of encrypted network traffic. In another embodiment the second classifier may identify the second predetermined application from an unencrypted payload comprising a packet encapsulated with a tunnel protocol header such as an TLS or SSL protocol.

At step in some embodiments the second classifier may determine whether to use the included application identifier or an application identifier of the second predetermined application. In one embodiment the second classifier may determine to use the application identifier of the second predetermined application and may reclassify the encrypted packet. In one embodiment the second classifier may determine that the second predetermined application is a more appropriate classification than the first predetermined application and may replace the application identifier included with the packet with a second application identifier of or corresponding to the second predetermined application. For example if the identification of the second predetermined application is more granular than the identification of the first predetermined application then the second classifier may replace the application identifier included with the packet with an application identifier corresponding to the second predetermined application. In one embodiment granularity may be determined responsive to parent child relationships of applications and protocols discussed above in connection with . For example if a first identifier is a child of a second identifier then the first identifier may be considered more granular. In another embodiment the second classifier may determine that the first predetermined application is more granular than the second predetermined application and may maintain or utilize the application identifier of the first classifier. For example in one embodiment the first classifier may identify network traffic as corresponding to a web application and the second classifier may identify the network traffic as corresponding to HTTP traffic. In such a case the first identification of web application may be more granular than the second identification of HTTP which may include both HTTP web applications and other HTTP data. Once properly classified by either the first application or the second application various QoS policies may be applied to the packet responsive to the classification.
