This invention relates to phosphoric acid based electrolytes and applications thereof including fuel cells having phosphoric acid based electrolytes.

The phosphoric acid fuel cell is known as one of most researched and commercially most advanced types of fuel cell. An advantage it holds over NAFION based fuel cells is the higher temperature range of operation permitted by the electrolyte. Electrolytes in phosphoric acid fuel cells have been used up to 160 C. before water loss to form pyrophosphoric acid leads to reduced conductivity and poorer performance.

Proton exchange membrane fuel cells PEMFCs are under intense development as non polluting power sources that in principle are the most efficient means of converting chemical energy to electrical energy and mechanical work. However practical realization of this efficiency even in the simple H Ofuel cell case proves to be fraught with difficulties. NAFION fuel cells based on sulfonated polytetrafluoro ethylene proton conductive membranes are favored for their high conductivities but are limited to temperatures below 100 C. because of loss at higher temperatures of the water needed for high conductivity which means the fuel cell is susceptible to catalyst poisoning by CO gas impurities. The NAFION based cells also suffer from acute water crossover hence water management problems.

Attempts have been made to increase the operating temperature of the NAFION membrane cell by various methods. However NAFION and other perfluorinated polymer electrolytes i.e. FLEMION and ACIPLEX are limited in commercial applications because of the high materials costs coupled with the reduced performance at high temperatures.

In a first general aspect preparing an electrolyte includes reacting phosphoric acid HPO in the liquid state with silicon tetrachloride SiCl thereby forming a fluid suspension. The fluid suspension is heated to yield a liquid electrolyte including phosphoric acid HPO pyrophosphoric acid HPO and a particulate solid comprising a silicophosphoric acid wherein the silicophosphoric acid is an acidic molecular compound including silicon and phosphorus.

In a third general aspect a liquid electrolyte includes phosphoric acid HPO pyrophosphoric acid HPO and a particulate solid comprising a silicophosphoric acid wherein the silicophosphoric acid is an acidic molecular compound including silicon and phosphorus.

A fourth general aspect includes a solid electrolyte formed by dissolving a composition in water to yield a homogenous solution and drying the homogenous solution to yield the solid electrolyte.

In some implementations the silicophosphoric acid is separated from the liquid electrolyte to yield a more concentrated composition including the silicophosphoric acid. Separating the silicophosphoric acid from the liquid electrolyte may include for example centrifuging the liquid electrolyte. The composition may be in the form of a paste at room temperature. In some cases the paste includes residual phosphoric acid pyrophosphoric acid or a combination thereof. The composition is typically soluble in water. In certain cases the composition is combined with water to yield a homogeneous solution.

The details of one or more embodiments are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

As described herein phosphoric acid HPO in the liquid state and silicon tetrachloride SiCl and are reacted to yield a fluid suspension and the fluid suspension is heated to yield a liquid electrolyte including phosphoric acid pyrophosphoric acid and a particulate solid including a silicophosphoric acid. As used herein a silicophosphoric acid is an acidic molecular inorganic compound including silicon and phosphorus. SiPOH is used herein to refer to a silicophosphoric acid or a mixture of two or more silicophosphoric acids each having a different chemical formula. SiPOH dissolves in water to form a clear homogenous aqueous solution. Upon standing the homogenous solution forms a gel and the gel is dried to form a solid electrolyte referred to herein as SiPOly. The solid inorganic electrolyte is has an elastic or rubbery properties and is typically flexible and deformable.

The fluid suspension or SiPOH stabilized phosphoric acid electrolyte can be used as a liquid inorganic electrolyte for hydrogen oxygen fuel cells. This liquid inorganic electrolyte demonstrates superior behavior to phosphoric acid in both open circuit voltage OCV and in current delivery the efficiency of utilization of the gaseous fuel being particularly unexpected. This liquid electrolyte has an extended stability range remaining substantially unchanged in properties as monitored by sensitive electrical conductivity criteria over 24 hours at 250 C. far above the operating range of the standard phosphoric acid even when moderately pressurized showing higher proton decoupling higher thermal stability and higher conductivity than anhydrous phosphoric acid. This liquid electrolyte extends the temperature range of fuel cell operation to temperatures where catalyst poisoning by such agents as CO and other platinum binders is no longer a factor. The efficiency of gas utilization giving nearly 100 current efficiency is notable. Thus this electrolyte is suitable for use in fuel cells either as a liquid electrolyte or with further processing to SiPOly as a solid electrolyte having a conductivity at ambient temperature and humidity exceeding that of NAFION 115 in its optimized form and at 80 C. exceeding that of NAFION 115 in its 100 humidified form under 3.5 atmospheres of pressure.

Electrolytes described herein showed increased temperature range without sacrifice of high temperature conductivity or open circuit voltage. This is achieved by introduction of the SiPOH which inhibits decomposition or water loss to 250 C. thus extending the temperature range of the phosphoric acid fuel cell to 250 C. Conductivity data to 285 C. and full H Ocell polarization curves to 226 C. have been obtained. High current efficiency current density per unit of fuel supplied per sec is observed and a power density of 184 mWcmis achieved at 226 C. with hydrogen flow rate of 4.1 mL min.

The electrolytes described herein extend the temperature range of the phosphoric acid fuel cell to 250 C. while improving its operating fuel efficiency. The current efficiency i i i current obtained with these electrolytes is believed to be higher than that reported to date for any other type of fuel cell operating at 1 atm pressure. Its voltage efficiency is also believed to be comparable to or better than that of known phosphoric acid based fuel cells.

In the fluid suspension is heated to yield a liquid electrolyte including phosphoric acid pyrophosphoric acid HPO and a particulate solid including a silicophosphoric acid. In some cases the suspension is heated to a temperature of at least 100 C. at least 200 C. or at least 250 C. In certain cases the suspension is heated to a temperature sufficient to yield a molar ratio of pyrophosphoric acid to phosphoric acid in the liquid electrolyte in the range between 0.1 1 and 0.8 1 or between 0.3 1 and 0.7 1. The liquid electrolyte is a stronger acid than phosphoric acid and can serve as a liquid electrolyte for a fuel cell without further refinement. The HPO insoluble components in the suspension can be increased in quantity for example by extended reaction times using excess SiCland additional heating. The fluid suspension is a stable fluid suspension.

The silicophosphoric acid is an acidic molecular compound including silicon and phosphorus. The silicophosphoric acid typically includes oxygen and hydrogen. Heating the suspension also removes most all or substantially all e.g. 99 of the chlorine from unreacted silicon tetrachloride generating hydrochloric acid gas. The liquid phosphoric acid based electrolyte is a water soluble suspension of SiPOH in a mixture of phosphoric acid and pyrophosphoric acid and has a creamy white appearance. According to P NMR spectroscopic analysis of one liquid electrolyte sample the phosphorus content of the phosphoric acid pyrophosphoric acid mixture is split approximately 2 1 between phosphoric acid and pyrophosphoric acid. In some cases the molar ratio of pyrophosphoric acid to phosphoric acid is in the range between 0.3 1 and 0.7 1 or between 0.1 1 and 0.8 1.

SiPOH formed in process 100 may have a ratio of silicon to phosphorus in the range between 1.2 and 1 4. In some cases SiPOH includes a silicophosphoric acid having a four coordinate silicon atom. Such a silicophosphoric acid may have an empirical formula of SiPOH or a chemical formula including SiPOH. In one example a silicophosphoric acid has the chemical formula SiPOH HPO . In another example a silicophosphoric acid may have or include a chemical structure depicted by the following arrangement of atoms 

In one implementation of process a liquid electrolyte is prepared by reacting SiClwith anhydrous phosphoric acid obtained by fusion of the dry crystalline form T 42 C. . The reaction is carried out under mild conditions under gentle flow of nitrogen gas initially 45 C. Tof SiClis 57 C. and continuing with gradually rising temperature reaching 100 C. for three hours until the liquid is saturated with reaction products becoming creamy in color due to a fine precipitate of SiPOH followed by gradually increasing temperature to 270 C. over one hour that establishes a content of HPOin the liquid electrolyte.

SiPOH can be separated from the liquid electrolyte formed in by methods such as i centrifugation to yield a paste of solid with some excess solution or ii by an exothermic acetone extraction process which dissolves the excess HPO but not the SiPOH. Both yield the X ray diffraction pattern shown in . In contrast when ethanol is added to the centrifugation product and the temperature is raised e.g. to 80 C. to expel the volatiles SiPO a white crystalline solid of known structure insoluble in water is formed.

In another implementation of the process shown in the liberated HCl can be collected in an internal chemical trap. The reaction is performed in a closed system comprised of a 3 neck Schlenk reaction flask. One of the joints contains a cold finger kept at about 20 C. and the other attaches to a tube containing an HCl trap. In some embodiments the HCl trap can be a liquid mixture of two amine aluminum chloride adducts. In some embodiments the HCl trap is a liquid mixture of diethylmethylamine aluminum chloride and 2 methylpyridine aluminum chloride. In some embodiments the ratio of diethylmethylamine aluminum chloride and 2 methylpyridine aluminum chloride is about 7 3 by weight. Phosphoric acid and silicon tetrachloride are added to the Schlenk flask under nitrogen atmosphere in a ratio of 7 3 by weight. The mixture is kept at 50 C. for 2 h. The phosphoric acid melts completely with bubbles evolving continuously. The temperature is slowly increased to 120 C. for 4 h. The final product is a white suspension comprising SiPOH white solid and excess phosphoric acid. The excess phosphoric acid can be separated by centrifugation and the remaining solid can be washed several times with a solvent that is insert with respect to SiPOH. In some embodiments the solvent is pentafluoropropanol.

Water soluble light scattering material isolated as a white powder by the acetone extraction SiPOH was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma ICP chemical analysis technique Optical Emission Spectrometer Themo iCAP6300 with stock standards including a 998 ppm single element silicon solution and a 100 ppm solution of KHPO. shows an X ray diffraction pattern of the powder obtained using a high resolution X ray diffractometer PANALYTICAL X PERT PRO . The powder is stable on heating to 285 C. but then decomposes losing about one mole of water per mole of SiPOH as described herein. The X ray powder patterns of the product heated to 310 C. and 650 C. are shown in respectively. The pattern of is attributable to SiPO and is believed to be that of a less stable configuration of the same compound.

The P NMR spectrum of SiPOH acid was determined in two conditions. The liquid product of the reaction of equimolar quantities of HPOand SiCl externally referenced to triphenylphosphine was used as the first NMR sample. The spectrum of the resulting SiPOH in a phosphoric acid medium is shown in and includes two resonances one at 0.1881 ppm known for phosphoric acid and a second at 12.6968 ppm which can be identified as the resonance for pyrophosphoric acid HPO. This peak is more intense for a sample prepared with a larger ratio of initial SiClto HPO and heated for longer times as might be expected for HPO. The second NMR sample was obtained by dissolving some of the latter sample in DO to give a solution approximately one molar in HPO assuming this to be the majority component. The new resonance appears at 9.6250 ppm as shown by enlarged . This is less downfield that in the first solution presumably in response to the change in proton activity. The corresponding peak for HPOmoved to from 0.1881 of to 1.7 in .

The proton NMR spectrum of the same reaction product that gave the P spectra of shown in shows a single sharp peak at 9.1169 ppm from the external acetone d6 reference quite similar to but more acidic than that of a corresponding pure HPOsample. The latter shows a single peak at 8.7681 ppm from the same external reference. Since SiPOH is a minority component and since the observed resonance is presumably an exchange average it is implied that SiPOH is strongly acidic.

The 4 coordination for Si double bridging to the phosphate group suggests an explanation for the difference between the XRD of the initial dehydration product of SiPOH and the pattern for the known SiPOstructure. The latter has six coordinate Si thought to require a more significant rearrangement than can be promoted at 300 C. The structure of is thought to retain 4 coordinate Si with double bridges e.g. as depicted in chemical structure 2 above .

The chemical formula SiPOHwas further tested by titration of the acid protons using standard NaOH solution. 10 ml of a solution that was 0.1 molar in SiPOH according to the assigned molecular formula was found to require a little more than the expected 20 ml of standard 0.1 molar NaOH to reach neutral according to standard strong acid indicators. The excess 5.9 ml is thought to be due to HPOnot fully removed from the SiPOH sample preparation. This test does not distinguish between a strong diprotic acid and a strong hexaprotic acid.

SiPOH containing phosphoric acid liquid electrolyte formed as described with respect to is chemically table for long periods of time at temperatures up to 250 C. For example SiPOH containing phosphoric acid liquid electrolyte remains unchanged in properties monitored by sensitive electrical conductivity over 24 hours at temperatures up to 250 C. Above 285 C. the SiPOH appears to precipitate solid SiPOin an unknown crystal form. While its presence leads to an increase in electrolyte viscosity its conductivity above 150 C. is superior to that of phosphoric acid thought to be due at least in part to a superior free proton contribution.

In the concentrated SiPOH composition is dissolved in water to yield a clear homogenous solution. In the homogenous solution is treated to yield a gel. Treating the homogenous solution to yield a gel includes for example removing water from the gel e.g. by allowing the homogenous solution to stand for a length of time e.g. an hour or more . In removing water from the gel yields a solid electrolyte in the form of a rubbery substance referred to herein as a silicophosphoric acid polymer or SiPOly. Removing water from the gel may include drying the gel in a vacuum oven e.g. at 40 C. .

In one implementation of the process shown in 1.63 g of the composition obtained as in is dissolved in 3.63 g of distilled water. The gel forms in about 90 min. The gel is mechanically fragile but shrinks away from the container and strengthens into a rubbery button as water is removed by vacuum over drying at 40 C. The weight loss v. time function is shown in . The loss is rapid at first but reaches a constant mass. About 90 wt of the initial water content is lost in the drying process.

A comparison of the XRD pattern of SiPOH gel with that of conventional anhydrous silica gel shown in suggests that the SiPOH gel is a homogenous network of siloxy units that may be more correlated than in silica gel yet loosely connected enough that the structure remains floppy and easily but elastically deformable. The spectrum suggests a dense amorphous silica network with sufficient network defects that the structure remains flexible. Within the SiPOH gel there appears to be a uniform distribution of essentially pure phosphoric acid.

The H and P spectra of the gel are shown in respectively while the silicon spectrum obtained by solid state NMR on the same gel is shown in . show sharp spectral lines resonances at 9.5 ppm relative to TMS and at 0 relative to HPO that are essentially those of phosphoric acid suggesting that the preparation procedure has produced a phosphoric acid gel in which the supporting structure is a silicate or silicophosphate net. That this supporting structure contains silicon in a 4 coordinated state is shown by the spectrum in where the resonance is found at 107 ppm.

The rubbery SiPOly formed as described with respect to contains very little free water because heating at 300 C. is accompanied by a mass loss of only 10 wt and the weight of the dry now crystalline but hygroscopic powdery material remains almost unchanged when the temperature is raised to 600 C. As an additional measure of its stability the rubbery SiPOly is quite stable up to 150 C. It has a yellowy color and is translucent.

SiPOly may also be formed on a substrate to coat the substrate or at least a portion of the substrate with solid electrolyte. The substrate may be solid or porous. A porous substrate includes for example a matrix a mesh a porous paper a porous polymer and the like. The substrate may be flexible or rigid. Suitable substrates include for example a glass wool mesh and a metal screen. shows process for forming a substrate coated with a solid electrolyte. In liquid is removed from the liquid electrolyte formed as described in to yield a concentrated SiPOH composition. The composition includes SiPOH in the form of paste. Removing liquid from the suspension is described with respect to in . In the composition is combined with water to yield a homogenous solution as described with respect to in . In a substrate is contacted with the homogenous solution. Contacting the substrate with the homogenous solution includes for example positioning the substrate in the homogenous solution dipping the substrate in the homogenous solution spraying the substrate with the homogenous solution or the like.

In homogeneous solution is solidified to coat at least a portion of the substrate with a solid electrolyte derived from SiPOH SiPOly . Depending on the porosity of the substrate the substrate may also be impregnated with SiPOly. When coated on a substrate the SiPOly is a yellowish translucent deformable polymeric solid that is proton conductive and stable up to 140 C. at 1 atm and above 60 C. has conductivity in excess of that of pressurized NAFION as described herein. In some embodiments the deformable polymeric solid is stable up to 150 C. When the substrate is a mesh the mesh provides mechanical support to the SiPOly. A mesh or other porous substrate coated with SiPOly may be used as a proton conductive membrane.

Through process SiPOly can be coated on or impregnated in a substrate or both without low temperature aqueous processing thereby avoiding chemical modification of the electrolyte. The acidic nature of the solid electrolyte improves adherence to certain substrates such as polybenzimidazole membranes. This improved coupling is thought to be due at least in part to proton transfer energy to the basic moieties in the substrate.

In another implementation of the process shown in 2.8 g of water is added to 1.2 g of SiPOH which dissolves completely. A quartz membrane Cole Parmer QR 200 Tokyo Roshi Kaisha Ltd initially 1.5 mm thickness is added to the solution as the substrate for the gel. After vacuum drying at 40 C. for 15 h and room temperature vacuum drying for another 9 h a colorless transparent soft gel is formed. The total weight loss is 66 corresponding to a 95 loss of water.

The fuel cell performance using the SiPOH containing phosphoric acid liquid electrolyte was studied in the same TEFLON sandwich cell with E TEK electrodes used in the study by Belieres et al. Binary inorganic ionic salt mixtures as high conductivity electrolytes for 100 C. fuel cells Chem. Commun. Cambridge 4799 2006 which is incorporated by reference herein and also depicted in .

Anode and cathode may be for example E TEK carbon Pt electrodes. Electrolyte may be a liquid such as that described with respect to a solid electrolyte such as that described with respect to pristine SiPOly or a substrate e.g. mesh coated at least partially with a solid electrolyte such as that described with respect to . The liquid electrolyte is held in the cavity formed by TEFLON spacers with fuel cell secured via end caps and . The pristine SiPOly and coated substrate are held between electrodes and and secured via end caps and .

Above 150 C. the electrolyte conductivity determined using a twin electrode dip type cell of cell constant 1.83 cm is superior to that of pure HPO. This is thought to be due to a superior free proton contribution at high temperatures. The conductivity is reversible up to 285 C. Tested at a constant 250 C. the conductivity remained invariant within the temperature control fluctuations over a 24 hour period and over a 48 hr period at 230 C. so loss of water has been greatly diminished. In an operating fuel cell producing water the minor loss of water observed in the static experiment is not expected to significantly impact results.

An advantage of the pristine SiPOly membrane is the low water content which permits it to operate at much higher temperatures. In contrast the specific conductivity of NAFION is strongly influenced by the number of water molecules surrounding the sulfonyl group. As is well known water is transported across the membrane during operation causing flooding. Consequently water management becomes a crucial problem. The low water content and the higher operating temperature permitted with the pristine SiPOly membrane avoids this difficulty.

One aspect of the fuel cell performance with the present electrolyte is the fuel usage efficiency monitored by the hydrogen flow rate at maximum current. Table 1 lists the current efficiency defined as 1 2 the moles Hsupplied per sec Faradays of electricity flowing per sec both at the peak power condition. A second value based on the current flowing when the cell voltage without IR correction vanishes is sometimes made and may approach 100 but the first metric is believed to be more relevant.

The voltage efficiency is also presented in Table 1 using two alternative definitions. The first is OCV theoretical emf 100 at the temperature of measurement while the second is that based on the voltage at the power maximum. Again the SiPOH stabilized electrolyte yields favorable numbers relative to other cells for which the data are available.

Fuel efficiency is an especially notable aspect of the fuel cell performance with the SiPOH stabilized phosphoric acid liquid. That is while other fuel cell studies report maximum current output with hydrogen flow rates of 20 30 ml min per cmof electrode area maximum currents were obtained in this work with much smaller flow rates. Except for the highest temperatures where the full 25 ml min was needed fuel flow rates needed to maintain the maximum current were small e.g. 10 ml min at 120 C. corresponding to almost 100 current efficiency . Table 1 lists efficiencies of the fuel cell described herein and includes comparisons with reported values as noted. The higher efficiencies are presumably linked to the same advantageous kinetics that lead to very short recovery times. The recovery time is the time taken to recover the open circuit voltage after fuel flow has stopped and is typically on the order of 10 30 min. However with SiPOH electrolytes the recovery time is in some cases too short to measure properly typically on the order of seconds. This feature can be especially advantageous in fuel cell implementations.

The data shown in were obtained with fuel cells having a proton conductive membrane based on the rubbery solid electrolyte formed as described with respect to . In forming the SiPOly coated membrane a fiberglass wool filter membrane Cole Palmer item QR 200 Toyo Roshi Kaisha Ltd Japan 2 mm thick initially was coated with SiPOly as described with respect to . This membrane was placed in cell depicted in between two standard E Tek electrodes LT140E W 0.5 mgPt cm . To achieve a better contact between the electrode and the electrolyte the assembled cell was left in a dessicator overnight prior to testing. During the testing the cell was left 2 3 hours at each temperature to ensure thermal equilibrium. The temperature of the cell was tracked relative to the oven atmosphere temperature during the test for any indication of direct burning by fuel crossover.
