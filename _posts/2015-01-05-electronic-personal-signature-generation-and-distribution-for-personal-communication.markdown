The specification of the above referenced patent application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

With the advent of high speed communication technology that facilitates communication between people via social networking platforms text messages electronic mails emails etc. the practice of communicating via digital messages has almost become the norm. However these digital messages generally lack personalization for example by a personal mark made by a pen a finger etc. a personal signature of a sender of the digital message etc. Conventional communication systems do not support meaningful and personally signed communication in the form of exchange of messages for business and personal uses. Personalized messages are typically aimed at conveying a person s emotions such as thoughts sympathies love gratitude etc. Adding an original personal signature to such personalized messages and delivering the personalized messages together with the added personal signature enhances the level of intimacy associated with the communication. There is a need for personal communication via personal signature bundled personalized messages to provide recipients of these personalized messages an experience comparable to receiving a personally signed letter. Also adding a personal signature to business correspondence is typically customary and therefore needed in exchanging business messages.

Personalizing for example modifying line style line color etc. of the signature based on a theme of the communication or based on preferences of a sender increases an overall appeal of the communication. Conventional communication systems do not allow dynamic personalization of a personal signature while maintaining the integrity and originality of the personal signature. Also such conventional communication systems do not authenticate digitally received personal signatures. A recipient of the communication would typically want to be assured that the source of a personalized message is authentic that is the communication has originated from a genuine source that is a genuine sender a sender with whom the recipient is acquainted or a sender with whom the recipient has previously communicated. Therefore the recipient would like to receive a confirmation of an authentic personal signature for example a verified autograph of a sender along with the personalized message.

Hence there is a long felt but unresolved need for a computer implemented method and system that generates and delivers an electronically signed and authenticated personalized communication such as a personalized message. Moreover there is a need for a computer implemented method and system that dynamically configures a personal signature based on a theme of the personalized communication and or sender preferences while maintaining the integrity and originality of the personal signature. Furthermore there is a need for a computer implemented method and system that authenticates a personal signature as an autograph of a sender of the personalized communication.

Also various structural elements may be employed depending on the design choices of the system designer.

The personal communication system disclosed herein allows users for example senders and recipients to apply optimize authenticate and deliver computer generated personal signatures in a personalized communication by utilizing a rule based technology. As used herein personal signature refers to an original signature for example a handwritten signature or an autograph composed by a sender. Also as used herein rule base technology refers to a computer technology that establishes a set of rules that the personal communication system automatically implements to perform the functions of the computer implemented method disclosed herein. In an embodiment the personal communication system is incorporated in a sender device and in one or more recipient devices. As used herein sender device refers to a communication device utilized by a sender of a personalized communication to access the personal communication system provide media content and a personal signature and generate and deliver an electronically signed and authenticated personalized communication. Also as used herein recipient device refers to a communication device utilized by a recipient of a personalized communication. The personal communication system executes computer program codes for example using a Ruby on Rails application framework for generating and delivering an electronically signed and authenticated personalized communication.

The personal communication system receives media content and a personal signature and media content composed by a sender from a sender device for example the iPhone of Apple Inc. via a graphical user interface GUI provided by the personal communication system. The sender provides media content for generating the personalized communication for example by writing dictating typing drawing uploading media content etc. on the GUI of the personal communication system.

A Ruby on Rails implementation of a code snippet from a computer program code executed by the personal communication system for receiving the personal signature of the sender is disclosed below 

In an embodiment the GUI provided by the personal communication system is a touch enabled interface configured to receive a handwritten personal signature composed by the sender through one or more input modes comprising for example a manual input mode and a device input mode. As used herein manual input mode refers to a mode of input of the personal signature via the GUI using a sender s anatomical parts comprising for example fingers toes etc. Also as used herein device input mode refers to a mode of input of the personal signature via the GUI using one or more signature input devices. The signature input devices comprise for example a finger brush a stylus pen a digital pen an active pen a light pen etc. The personal communication system has a computer enhanced and generated signed personal messaging capability that derives the sender s personal signature for example from a stylus pen a finger brush a digital pen etc. on the GUI of the personal communication system. The personal communication system enables a personalized communication originator that is the sender of the personalized communication to create a personal signature for a private letter via the sender device. For example the sender creates a personal signature for example an original mark of the signee by using free strokes of a signature input device such as a stylus pen or by using manual free strokes created using one or more fingers of the sender s hand within a predefined section that the personal communication system designates on the GUI to receive the personal signature. In an embodiment the sender can create and provide a personal signature as a drawing comprising for example a sketch a design an illustration a cartoon a doodle initials etc. and any combination thereof on the GUI of the personal communication system. Thus the personal communication system via the GUI facilitates creation of the handwritten personal signature in a digital form to recreate a personal signature typically used as a correspondence mark of a conventional physical letter communication.

The personal communication system authenticates the received personal signature as an autograph of the sender of the personalized communication. To authenticate the received personal signature of the sender the personal communication system receives biometric input data from the sender device while receiving the personal signature via the GUI of the personal communication system and compares the received biometric input data with biometric identification data associated with the sender device. As used herein biometric input data refers to data representing human characteristics for example fingerprints of one or more fingers of a sender that the sender uses for providing the personal signature to the personal communication system via the GUI. Also as used herein biometric identification data refers to data used to identify a sender for example fingerprint data of a sender that the sender stores on his her sender device as an access code for unlocking the sender device. In an embodiment the personal communication system authenticates the received personal signature of a specific sender using touch identification ID technology for example the Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology of Apple Inc. for authenticating the received personal signature and converting the received personal signature into an original digital autograph of that specific sender who is an owner of the sender device or has registered his her biometric identification data in the sender device.

The personal communication system authenticates the received personal signature as an original autograph of the sender by matching the biometric identification data comprising for example finger touch identification ID data with the received biometric input data. In an embodiment the personal communication system provides an authentication window for authenticating the received personal signature within a short time period of receiving the personal signature for example within about 5 seconds to about 10 seconds. The personal communication system authenticates the received personal signature for generating and associating an autograph status to the authenticated personal signature. For facilitating authentication of the personal signature by the personal communication system the personal communication system is operable with and or configurable on multiple types of sender devices. For example the personal communication system adapts to any sender device for example a mobile device configured with a finger touch ID hardware interface for authenticating the received personal signature of the sender.

Consider an example where a sender using a sender device accesses the personal communication system for generating and delivering a personalized communication electronically signed with the sender s personal signature as an autograph. The sender uploads an image that he she wishes to send to one or more recipients to the personal communication system via the GUI. The sender physically touches and moves his her finger for example an index finger on the GUI to create a personal signature to be positioned on the uploaded image. The personal communication system receives the created personal signature via the GUI. In an embodiment the personal communication system provides an option to the sender to authenticate the received personal signature as an autograph. When the sender selects the option to authenticate his her personal signature the personal communication system prompts the sender to provide the biometric input data that is fingerprint data of the index finger used by the sender for creating the personal signature. For example the sender provides the biometric input data by physically touching his her index finger and or holding the index finger onto a home button configured with a touch sensor on the sender device. The personal communication system retrieves the biometric identification data for example the fingerprint data stored as touch identification ID data for unlocking the sender device from a memory unit of the sender device. The touch ID data is stored in the memory unit of the sender device as an access code. The personal communication system compares the biometric input data provided by the sender with the retrieved biometric identification data. If the comparison results in a positive match then the personal communication system authenticates the received personal signature as the sender s autograph. The personal communication system confirms the biometric touch ID match of the sender that is the personal signature composer to provide an autograph status to the sender s personal signature.

The personal communication system configures one or more of multiple parameters of the received personal signature based on one or more sender preferences while maintaining the integrity and originality of the received personal signature. The parameters comprise for example ink color font size font background color display style line thickness curve smoothness etc. The sender preferences comprise for example a selected theme and one or more configuration inputs for the parameters. As used herein configuration inputs refer to inputs provided by the sender for changing the parameters of the personal signature. The configuration inputs comprise for example a default theme a default font size a default ink color etc. In an embodiment the sender sets the configuration inputs after registration with the personal communication system or at the time of configuring the personal communication system on the sender device. In an embodiment the personal communication system configures the sender preferences based on the settings provided by the sender during registration with the personal communication system. The personal communication system uses specific rules for allowing the sender to modify the parameters of the personal signature. For example the sender can use the personal communication system to modify the font color of a personalized communication based on sender preferences set by the sender using themes provided by the personal communication system. In this example the personal signature of the sender automatically inherits the ink color from the theme in use. In an embodiment the personal communication system automatically configures an ink color of the personal signature based on a default ink color preference received as a configuration input at the time of registration of the sender with the personal communication system. In an embodiment the personal communication system configures the parameters of the personal signature for example based on a theme or a default ink color on receiving the personal signature from the sender that is on origination or creation or composition of the personal signature by the sender.

The personal communication system maintains a uniform thickness throughout a stroke of the sender s personal signature. In an embodiment the personal communication system performs automatic curve smoothing to avoid a jagged appearance of the personal signature according to personalization choices selected by the sender or the configuration inputs provided by the user. The personal communication system maintains the personal signature while other parameters for example the background the font size the font color etc. of the personalized communication change based on the sender preferences. The maintenance of the integrity and originality of the received personal signature comprises maintaining a font style of the received personal signature irrespective of a change in the sender preferences. For example the personal communication system maintains a font style of the personal signature irrespective of a change in the theme selected by the sender.

After positioning the personal signature in the received media content the personal communication system enables the sender to preview the received media content along with the positioned personal signature via the sender device or via a browser. The personal communication system allows for integration of a unique personal signature of the sender per personalized communication.

In an embodiment the personal communication system assigns an authentication indicator proximal to the positioned personal signature of the sender or the media content received from the sender device for indicating an authenticated status of the received personal signature. The authentication indicator comprises for example an icon a symbol a stamp a logo an emblem a code an image a digital watermark a multimedia object such as an animation etc. in one or more of multiple sizes and shapes. Examples of the authentication indicator comprise a star a polygon a checkmark etc. In an embodiment the personal communication system positions the authentication indicator in a predefined section for example a top right section a top left section a bottom left section a bottom right section a top center section a bottom center section etc. proximal to the positioned personal signature or the media content received from the sender device. In another embodiment the personal communication system dynamically selects the authentication indicator based on sender preferences comprising for example a selected theme and one or more configuration inputs. For example for a personalized communication with a music theme the personal communication system selects a musical note symbol such as a musical single bar note symbol or a musical whole note symbol as the authentication indicator and positions the authentication indicator at a predefined section proximal to the positioned personal signature on the received media content. The authenticated status provided by the authentication indicator to the positioned personal signature represents an autograph status of the personal signature. The personal communication system generates and positions the authentication indicator for example an icon a digital watermark etc. proximal to the positioned personal signature or the received media content to mark the positioned personal signature with the autograph status. For example the authentication indicator displayed next to or around the positioned personal signature of the sender symbolizes the authenticated and original autograph status of the personal signature composed by the sender.

The personal communication system generates a personalized communication comprising the received media content with the positioned personal signature for example using a theme and writing options selected by the sender. The personal communication system generates for example a text based personalized communication such as a personal letter a personal text an audio based personalized communication such as a recorded audio letter or a video based personalized communication such as a recorded video letter based on the type of media content received from the sender device.

In this embodiment the personal communication system renders multiple personalized communications with multiple personal signatures in an explore section that makes publicly available the published personalized communications.

The personal communication system delivers the generated personalized communication with the sender s positioned personal signature to one or more recipients and or recipient devices of the recipients via one or more of multiple delivery modes for example digital mail postal mail etc. as exemplarily illustrated in . The delivery modes comprise for example communication channels in social networks electronic mail email systems short message service systems multimedia messaging service systems online blogs postal delivery systems etc. In addition to generating the personal signature in an accurate position on the received media content the personal communication system delivers a bundled message comprising the personalized communication and the personal signature to the recipients and or the recipient devices. The personal communication system distributes the personalized communication across digital delivery modes for example using application programming interfaces APIs within the personal communication system to render the personal signature in a particular position on the personalized communication.

In an embodiment the personal communication system delivers the generated personalized communication with the positioned personal signature of the sender to one or more recipients and or recipient devices when an optimal time condition defining a minimum time required for composing the personalized communication is met. The optimal time condition defines a minimum time required for composing the personalized communication by the sender based on a preliminary time condition configured by the personal communication system or time parameters defined by a sender and or a recipient. In this embodiment the personal communication system configures a preliminary time condition and displays the configured preliminary time condition on the sender device via the GUI of the personal communication system. The configured preliminary time condition defines a minimum time required for composing the personalized communication by the sender. In an embodiment the personal communication system allows both senders and recipients to influence the minimum time for writing and receiving a personalized communication. The personal communication system determines an optimal time condition selected from the configured preliminary time condition a sender configured time condition and a recipient configured time condition as disclosed in the co pending non provisional patent application Ser. No. 14 559 897 titled Time Based Personal Communication filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Dec. 3 2014 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The personal communication system detects an attempt by a sender to generate and send the personalized communication based on the received media content. The personal communication system times the composition of the personalized communication on detection of the attempt to generate and send the personalized communication based on the received media content. The personal communication system generates a timing verification report based on the timing for verifying whether the determined optimal time condition is met. The timing report comprises a total time devoted by the sender in composing the personalized communication. The personal communication system performs an action based on the verification indicated in the generated timing verification report. For example the personal communication system renders a notification to the sender device for instructing the sender to continue composing the personalized communication until the determined optimal time condition is met or generates the personalized communication based on the media content received from the sender and delivers the generated personalized communication to one or more recipients and or recipient devices when the determined optimal time condition is met.

Consider an example where the personal communication system configures a preliminary time condition of 1 minute for composing a personalized communication. If the sender has not devoted at least 1 minute to compose the personalized communication and proceeds to submit the composed personalized communication to the personal communication system the personal communication system displays a notification instructing the sender to continue composing the personalized communication until 1 minute has lapsed. If the sender has devoted 1 minute or more to compose the personalized communication and then proceeds to submit the composed personalized communication to the personal communication system the personal communication system generates the personalized communication with the positioned personal signature and delivers the personalized communication with the positioned personal signature to one or more recipients and or recipient devices.

Consider another example where a sender wishes to compose a personalized communication for example a Christmas greetings letter and deliver the composed letter to a recipient device as a private letter. The sender invokes the personal communication system via a sender device for example a smartphone. The sender registers or logs in to the personal communication system via the sender device. The sender accesses the GUI provided by the personal communication system selects a private letter delivery option and selects a theme for example a snowfall theme suitable for the Christmas greetings letter. The sender types content for the Christmas greetings letter on the GUI and uploads an image for example a Christmas tree image to be attached to the typed content for the Christmas greetings letter to the personal communication system. The sender provides a personal signature and biometric input data via the GUI using for example a finger. The personal communication system authenticates the sender s personal signature by comparing the received biometric input data that is the fingerprint of the sender s finger with a touch identification ID access code associated with the sender device for unlocking the sender device. The personal communication system dynamically configures the parameters for example font color font size etc. of the personal signature based on the snowfall theme selected while maintaining the integrity and originality of the personal signature. The personal communication system positions the authenticated personal signature with the configured parameters in a predefined section for example bottom left of the typed content for the Christmas greetings letter. The personal communication system assigns an authentication indicator for example a blue colored star mark a red colored Christmas bell etc. proximal to the positioned personal signature to indicate an authenticated status of the personal signature. The personal communication system generates and displays the Christmas Greetings letter with the positioned personal signature on the GUI. If the time taken by the sender for composing the Christmas greetings letter meets the optimal time condition of the personal communication system the personal communication system delivers the generated Christmas greetings letter along with the positioned personal signature to the intended recipient via a delivery mode for example an electronic mail system a short message service system etc. for a private digital delivery of the Christmas greetings letter.
