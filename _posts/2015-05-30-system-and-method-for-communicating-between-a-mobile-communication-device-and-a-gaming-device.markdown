The greeting from the venue apparatus is preferably an audio greeting a tactile or a visual greeting.

A communications sequence diagram for communications between a mobile communication device a gaming device and a venue server and CRM database is shown in . The gaming device transmits a beacon signal to discover other devices to connect to. The beacon signal preferably includes a unique identifier. Alternatively the beacon signal comprises the gaming device name the device class a list of services and a unique identifier. When a mobile device which is already enabled to be discoverable is in proximity of a predetermined distance preferably within three feet of the gaming device the beacon signal from the gaming device is received by the mobile device. The predetermined distance for the beacon signal acts as a mechanism to ensure that the end user is interested in an interaction with the gaming device . A preferred distance is within three feet of the gaming device since if the beacon signal from the gaming device is greater than three feet the end user may be passing by and not interested in an interaction. Further if the beacon signal from the gaming device is greater than three feet there may be overlapping beacon signals received at the mobile device creating a situation where two gaming devices are greeting the end user.

The beacon signal from the gaming device is received at the low energy BLUETOOTH transceiver of the mobile device and sent to the resident mobile application . The resident mobile application is for the venue rewards program and has previously been downloaded by the end user into the memory of the mobile device .

The beacon signal from the gaming device includes a unique identifier. The resident mobile application verifies the identifier in a registry to determine if the gaming device is approved for interaction with the resident mobile application . The registry is preferably on the resident mobile application and the verification occurs on the mobile device . Alternatively the registry in at a registry database of the venue and the resident mobile application sends a request over a network to the venue server to verify the identifier in the registry of a registry database of the venue. The network is preferably the WLAN of the venue and the verification request from the resident mobile application is sent over the WLAN and the Internet if necessary to the venue server. Alternatively the network is a communications network of a wireless telecommunications carrier and the verification requests is sent over the communications network over the Internet and to the venue server for verification in the registry database.

A verification message is sent from the venue server to the mobile device either over the WLAN or over the communications network.

Additionally verification prevents unauthorized interactions with the resident mobile application . Further the registry may have multiple levels of authorization wherein the end user has opted in to interact with gaming devices venue apparatuses at a certain level. For example the end user may only wish to interact with slot machines with a certain pay out percentage or video poker machines with a high minimum bet. Or the end user may opt to interact with only reservation kiosks. Thus the end user has further control over the interaction providing the end user with an added incentive to agree to such an interaction.

Once the verification process has been completed the connection between the gaming device and the mobile device may proceed. At this point in time the gaming device prepares to present a greeting to the end user based on profile information for the end user in the CRM database of the venue.

More preferably the greeting is based on the accessible profile information for the end user in the CRM database of the venue and the capabilities of the gaming device . Further the interaction of the gaming device with the mobile device subsequent to the greeting is also preferably based on the accessible profile information for the end user in the CRM database of the venue and the capabilities of the gaming device . The gaming device preferably presents a visual greeting to the end user. Alternatively the gaming device presents an audio greeting to the end user. Alternatively the gaming device presents a tactile greeting to the end user. Alternatively the gaming device presents an aromatic greeting to the end user. Alternatively the gaming device presents a combination of two or more of an audio greeting a visual greeting a tactile greeting and aromatic greeting to the end user.

For example the visual greeting is a recognition of the end user in a favorite color or pattern of the end user on a display screen of the gaming device . If the end user is an anonymous patron the recognition may refer to a nickname associated with the end user.

If for example the greeting is an aromatic greeting a preferred scent of the end user such as pine oranges or the ocean is emitted from the gaming device .

If for example the greeting is tactile the presentation may be a puff of hot air or cold air a vibration of the gaming device or a hot or cold handle of the gaming device .

If for example the greeting is audio the greeting is in a preferred language e.g. Mandarin of the end user with a female or male voice in a preferred tone as desired or pleasing to the end user.

The profile data for the end user preferably assesses the value the end user is to the venue. A valuable end user financially or otherwise receives better treatment than an end user of lesser or unknown value to the venue. For example the CRM database may know that the end user has lost at a particular type of gaming device and the valuable end user may be reminded by the gaming device of previous losses to maintain a good relation with the valuable end user.

Information is received at the gaming device from the venue server over the venue WLAN. Preferably the greeting is determined at the venue server and transmitted to the gaming device to present to the end user. Alternatively the data for the end user is sent to the gaming device and a software program is run at a processor of the gaming device to determine which greeting to present to the end user.

Thus the resident mobile application may only communicate with the venue server over the WLAN or a communication network while the gaming device acts as a greeter on behalf of the venue server .

An important object of the invention is to make the end user feel comfortable interacting with the gaming device .

Further the interaction continues subsequent to the greeting with subsequent interactions based on the profile data for the end user and the content of the real time interaction.

As shown in a typical gaming device includes a processor system memory which includes RAM with the operating system applications and other programs ROM with the BIOS and program data non removable non volatile memory such as a hard drive or ROM removable non volatile memory such as flash memory or SD MMC a user input interface communications controller for WI FI BLUETOOTH or RFID NFC communications peripheral controller video controller and a display .
