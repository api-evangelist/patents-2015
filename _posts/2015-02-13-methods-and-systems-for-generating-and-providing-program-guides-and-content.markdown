title: Methods and systems for generating and providing program guides and content
abstract: Systems and methods for identifying, assembling, and publishing content are described. A content item, such as a video, having a first time length, is identified by a system to be included in a program scheduled for a first time period. The video may be hosted on a third party system. A first span of time within the first program is allocated for the video, wherein the first span of time is longer than the first time length. The system determines, prior to or at the first time period, a time difference between a current length of the video and the first span of time. At least partly in response to determining that the video has a time length shorter than the first span of time, the system selects supplemental content based at least in part of the determined time difference to be streamed to user terminals over a data network within the first time period.

Any and all applications for which a foreign or domestic priority claim is identified in the Application Data Sheet as filed with the present application are hereby incorporated by reference under 37 CFR 1.57.

The present invention is related to the identification generation organization and distribution of content.

Video sharing sites have become ever more popular. Users upload videos to a video sharing website. Other users can then navigate to and within the website to locate videos of interest. Users then watch the videos independent of other users that is users do not watch the videos on a schedule but rather at whatever random time a given user accesses the video. Thus using conventional techniques it is difficult for users to locate videos of interest. Further video viewing is an isolating experience where users are viewing videos at different times and often because of the difficulty in locating content friends infrequently view the same videos.

The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects.

Optionally the content for a given channel or a program within a channel is streamed from multiple third party content sites to the user terminals without passing through the content site system that organizes the third party content into channels and programs.

The example content scheduling system includes a processing unit a network interface a non transitory computer readable medium drive and an input output device interface all of which may communicate with one another by way of a communication bus. The network interface may provide the content scheduling system with connectivity to one or more networks e.g. network or computing systems. The processing unit may thus receive information and instructions from other computing devices systems or services such a user terminals and third party content hosting services via a network. The processing unit may also communicate to and from memory and further provide output information via the input output device interface . The input output device interface may also accept input from various input devices such as a keyboard mouse digital pen touch screen etc.

The memory may contain computer program instructions that the processing unit may execute in order to implement one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. The memory generally includes RAM ROM and or other persistent or non transitory computer readable storage media. The memory may store an operating system that provides computer program instructions for use by the processing unit in the general administration and operation of the content scheduling system . The memory may further include other information for implementing aspects of the present disclosure.

Optionally the memory includes an interface module . The interface module can be configured to facilitate generating one or more interfaces through which a third party user utilizing a compatible computing device may send to or receive from the content scheduling system content content metadata preferences content recommendations instruction data or otherwise communicate with the content scheduling system . Specifically the interface module may be configured to facilitate processing functions described herein including generating and providing program guides scheduling programming generating recommendations providing program guide navigational tools providing DVR functionality dynamically generating programs enabling a user to generate a program providing user interfaces etc. The user interfaces described herein can be implemented as a graphical user interface GUI web based user interface computer program smartphone or tablet program or application touchscreen command line interface gesture voice or text interface etc. or any combination thereof. A user may cause a program to be played by a content player by selecting a program from a program guide. A program may also be displayed without a user having to select a program or channel and without the display of a program guide. Further the program guide need not be displayed to a user for the user to view or listen to programs or channels. For example the user may access a program or channel via voice command e.g. recognized by a voice command system a body hand gesture or a wand gesture e.g. recognized by a camera equipped gesture recognition system or a wand motion tracking system a remote control or otherwise.

In addition the memory may include a data processing module that may be executed by the processing unit . Optionally the data processing module implements aspects of the present disclosure. For example the data processing module can be configured to process user queries instructions data and content from the data stores etc.

The content scheduling system may communicate with a variety of third party content hosting systems wherein the third party systems are not operated by the same entity that operates the content scheduling system from which content may be streamed. Optionally a content programmer sometimes referred to as a curator defines a program and or a channel. For example the content programmer may define a channel to be cats . The content programmer may define a program for the cats channel to be cats playing with dogs with a time length of 30 minutes to be provided to users at a specified day time or at recurring days times . The content programmer may search for identify and select program appropriate content e.g. video content music content still image content social streams text messages etc. from one or more content sites such as third party video music image social media blogs e.g. microblogs and or other hosting sites that may host video clips music media still images graphics social media blog microblog messages e.g. text and or audio video messages etc. from one or many users. The content programmer may define an order for the selected clips and or other form of content to be presented in when the program is viewed or listened to by users. For example the content scheduling system may record clip sequencing information specified by a programmer or the system to indicate the order that selected clips will be played back as part of a program. The system may associate metadata with a given clip in a program such as a starting point time and a stop point time for each clip. Thus the system may cause the clips in a given program to be sequenced so as to provide a user with a seamless viewing experience. Optionally the programmer may indicate where advertisements may be inserted between clips. For example the programmer may specify that an advertisement may be inserted between the 4th and 5th clip and the 9th and 10th clip. Then during playback one or more advertisements may be selected and inserted at the designated points between clips.

Optionally a mediation layer is provided to dynamically determine the placement of advertising on programs comprised of short videos or other content. The mediation layer may include defined rules e.g. programmer defined rules that specify when an advertisement is to be displayed e.g. within a specified time block within a program based on how much of a particular program a user has viewed based on the subject matter of a given item of content e.g. as determined from associated metadata based on what is occurring or being displayed in the content between specified clips etc. .

Optionally a single clip or other streaming content being viewed by a viewer may be automatically paused during playback at a designated point or time or randomly and an advertisement e.g. optionally from a source different than the clip such as from an advertisement server may be selected e.g. by the advertisement server streamed and played to the user. When the advertisement has completed playing the playing of the clip may be resumed. Thus an advertisement may optionally be played as a mid roll advertisement with respect to a given clip.

A programming module may keep a running tally of the sum of the lengths in time of the video clips and or other content selected by the content programmer for a program and display the running tally to the content programmer. The programming module may provide a visual and or audible alert to the user when the running tally is equal to the defined time length of the program and may provide a different notification when the running tally is greater than the defined time length of the program. If the total length of the selected clips and or other content exceeds the defined program length the programming module may optionally trim the last clip in the program or a portion of each clip and or other content in the program to bring the total length of the program to be about equal to the defined length of the program. The content scheduling system records the locators for the selected clips or other content such as image content social streams blog e.g. microblogs text messages etc. or a locator for a playlist of the selected clips or other content the ordering of the clips and or other content and day s time s the video program is to be presented to users and then causes the program with the clips in the defined order to be presented accordingly at the scheduled days times and causes a program guide to include a listing for the program at the specified days times for the specified duration.

Optionally the system may automatically perform at least a portion of the content selections for a channel or program optionally using for example a channel generation module or an automatic program generation module. For example the system may search for and locate video content using search terms e.g. specified by a content programmer corresponding to various categories subjects. By way of illustration if the system is seeking to define a channel of videos and or other content regarding cats the system may issue a search for videos of cats. The system may issue the search request using the search engine of one or more third party content hosting sites e.g. by submitting the search request and search terms using an application programming interface associated with the content hosting sites . The content hosting sites may use tags e.g. assigned by the user that posted the video assigned by other users assigned by an operator of the video hosting sites etc. associated with the video content to identify videos corresponding to the search request. By way of further example if the system is instructed to include microblog entries as part of the cat channel the system may search for microblog entries e.g. TWITTER tweets that include cat related text or hashtags e.g. funnycat .

The system may use further criteria in selecting among videos and or other content for the cat channel or for a specific program. For example the system may issue a search query for cats and optionally filter the results based on one or more criteria. Optionally the system may search for cat videos and or other content of a specific length or range of lengths e.g. 5 minutes between 4 minutes and 6 minutes etc. . Other criteria may be used as well in determining which videos and or other content to select and include in a given program for a given channel. For example the system may access the number of views on the third party video hosting site and or the user ratings provided by users of the third party video hosting site in determining which videos to select.

By way of illustration the system may be programmed to select only those videos which have more than a threshold number of positive indications e.g. more than 500 positive indications e.g. thumbs up votes and or greater than a specified percentage of positive posting indications e.g. 75 of users that provide an indication as to whether or not they like the video indicate that they like the video or a specified ratio of positive indications vs. negative indications e.g. a ratio of at least 3 1 of positive indications vs. negative indications . In addition or instead the system may access and or analyze other types of indications. For example the indications e.g. social presence social rating number of followers number of posted videos aggregated number of views for all videos posted by author for videos posted on one or more sites audience size and or type other author activities etc. may relate to the author source of an item of content generally. For example a threshold may be set with respect to an author s number of followers social rating influence rating number of friends on a social networking site etc. Such indications may be accessed from the third party video hosting site on which the content is hosted and or from other sites and sources e.g. social networking sites influence scoring sites microblog sites etc. .

By way of further illustration in this example the system may select videos for the cat channel that have a tag and or title of cat have at least 600 views and or have at least a 75 approval rating. The system may in addition or instead select the top 50 or other number most viewed cat videos or the top 50 or other number rated videos for the channel. The system or other content programmer may in addition or instead select videos of cats from the top 50 ranked or other number authors based on the number of followers they have and or their influence score. The system may assemble a channel and a program based on the identified videos from one or more third party sites.

By way of further example the system may access the number of followers a blogger e.g. a microblogger has and or the number of times a given blog post has been re posted by others in determining which blog posts to select for a program. Other example factors that may be taken into account in selecting content may include the number of replies that were received in response to a content posting the number of likes a posting received the number of different social networking sites a posting was reposted too an engagement or influence rating of a posting user which may be based at least in part on engagement measurements such as the ratio of reactions generated by content posted by the user over the number of content postings and or where the rating may be generated by the system and or accessed from one or more influence rating services such as KLOUT KRED PEERINDEX etc. etc.

The system may use the supplemental content identification module or other tool to periodically review the video hosting websites to ensure that the selected videos for a given program are still available to be streamed to the user display. If the system determines that certain videos that had already been included in scheduled program are no longer available the system may find alternative videos of similar length e.g. based on a length tag or other length indication and subject matter e.g. because the alternative video had been previously manually designated as an alternate video from the specific program based on a subject tag or other indication to substitute in place of the missing videos as discussed in greater detail herein. Similarly the system may periodically review other content hosting websites to ensure that the selected content items e.g. microblog postings social networking page postings etc. for a given program are still available to be provided to the user terminal. If the system determines that certain other content items that have already been included in scheduled program are no longer available the system may find alternative content of similar length e.g. based on a length tag or other length indication type and or subject matter to substitute in place of the missing content.

The system may also communicate with a variety of user terminals over a network e.g. via the Internet . The system may provide user terminals with access to the program guide e.g. as a web app via a web browser and or via a dedicated application such as a phone app hosted on a user terminal and enable the user terminals to access programs streamed directly from the content hosting systems and or via the system according to the timing of the program guide schedule. The system may also provide simulated digital video recorder DVR functionality as described elsewhere herein. The system may also host administrator user interfaces and associated programs. A mobile device may have an application installed thereon that enables the mobile device to act as a remote control and enables the user to navigate the program guide on a user terminal via inputs on the mobile device .

The system may include data stores that store content to be streamed to users e.g. backup alternate content as discussed herein standard channel content promotional advertisement content etc. location information for content to be streamed to users e.g. URLs to video content on third party hosting sites URLs to music content image content social content microblogs etc. or any combination thereof on local or third party content hosting sites program schedules user account information e.g. user channel and content preferences e.g. genre program subject matter content and or channel likes and or dislikes provided by the user via one or more interfaces user specifications of channels to be blocked user reminder instructions user bookmarks user viewing history e.g. which channels and programs the user has watched how often the user watches a given channel or program how long a user watches a given program or channel etc. rules and or other information.

By way of example user account information e.g. user channel and content preferences explicitly provided by the user user channel and content preferences as determined from the user s content viewing history etc. user behaviors e.g. how long a user watches content per day or week how many times in a specified time period the user changes channels how often per specified time period the user tries a new channel or show a channel or show the user has not previously viewed etc. promoted content e.g. content sponsored by an advertiser or other third party and or data from third parties may be used in generating content recommendations for the user and or in organizing how a program guide is presented to the user. Optionally the program guide generation module may be utilized to generate and or personalize program guides. For example some or all of the foregoing data may optionally be used in determining the ordering of channels in the electronic program guide e.g. which channels are presented first second third etc. which if any channels are to excluded from the program guide e.g. channels that the system determines are of low interest to the user which channels are to be highlighted e.g. via color animation pop up interfaces or otherwise etc. what types of information are to be included in the program guide etc. Thus a program guide may be automatically generated and customized for a given user.

Optionally an artificial intelligence engine may be provided which learns the user s preferences and interests e.g. based on the user account information and viewing and or navigation behavior and recommends other content e.g. other programs and channels via text graphics and or a computer generated voice track synchronized with the lips and facial movements of a computer generated host which may appear as a human or which may appear as a cartoon figure animal or otherwise . The computer generated host may be configured to act as channel or program host.

The content hosting systems may enable users to upload or otherwise post media content e.g. recorded and or live streaming content such as videos social media content or other content and to provide media titles and or other tags e.g. descriptive subject matter tags . The videos or other content may be associated with metadata such as length of the videos or other content and or length of advertisement streamed as a pre roll or post roll video advertisement . The users and or the hosting systems may assign a categorization tag to the media content e.g. humor cats licensed television shows science film and entertainment gaming etc. and may record and post viewer rating information and track and post the number of views. Some or all of this information may be accessed and used by the system e.g. using an application programming interface API as similarly discussed herein.

In this example on the left side of the program guide the vertical axis channel numbers are provided although other channel naming conventions may be used such as titles letters colors etc. . On the horizontal axis time periods are listed. Program titles are provided with an indication e.g. a graphical indication and or numerical start stop times as to when a given program starts and ends. Thus the programs listed by the program guide are scheduled planned events typically with a specified duration within a channel timeline. The user can scroll over the channels on the left side and the user interface will present additional information regarding the channels and or regarding programs and episodes of recurring programs. The user can scroll forward and backward thorough the program timeline by mousing over the timeline header or otherwise. The viewing area and program may be displayed at the same time as the program guide or the viewing area may be closed to provide a larger area for the display of the program guide. Similarly the program guide may be closed or overlaid to provide a larger area for the display of the viewing area e.g. by activating a full screen control provided by the user interface .

Within the program guide there are individual links by channel that are accessed by the user s browser when the channel is changed. For example the link for the channel Top 40 may be in the form of http pluto.tv channels Top 2040    . A given channel may have associated content playlists which are a series of clips organized into scheduled programs episodes and which may be accessed by the user browser. Thus a playlist may optionally be in the form of a list of clips e.g. compiled by human content programmers or automatically by the system which share a similar theme message or subject and that are organized into a program with a specified duration.

The viewing area displays the currently playing program for a user selected channel. Optionally information regarding the program is displayed in conjunction with the program. Some of the information may be pulled from the metadata of the currently playing clip and some of the information may be pulled from the channel name and the program name. For example the viewing area user interface may display the corresponding channel number the channel name the program name the name of the currently playing clip and or other information. It is understood that a user does not have to select a specific program to view the program. The user can select a channel and the programs for that channel will continuously play on the user s terminal according to the schedule until the user navigates to another channel pauses a program closes the program guide application etc. The program guide may emphasize the currently playing channel and or program in the program listing e.g. using color bolding animation or otherwise .

Optionally an all channels control is provided. The user can activate the all channels control and in response the user interface will list all the current active channels although the user may need to scroll through the channel listing to view all the active channels . The user can also select a categories control and in response the user interface will display channel groupings where channels are grouped according to theme category e.g. 100 200 children 300 400 sports 500 600 on demand 700 800 pay per view 900 1000 user generated channels etc. and the names and or channel numbers for each channel are provided. An example channel categories user interface is illustrated in . The various categories may optionally be visually indicated using separate spaced apart color coded rectangles for each category with a category name as a header and with a listing of channels for each category.

The user can also activate a control which when detected causes the user interface to display additional or fewer channels in the grid or to display only channels the user had previously indicated as being favorite or preferred channels of the user.

Optionally as noted above in addition to displaying scheduled programs the same program guide user interface may optionally also list on demand programs e.g. free on demand content pay per view movies music television shows or other content that are part of a subscription package etc. where a user can click on an on demand program listing at any time and have the program streamed to the user. The on demand content listings may optionally be grouped so that they are listed as adjacent channels e.g. channels 500 600 may be dedicated to on demand channels . The grouped on demand content listings may be displayed above or below the scheduled programming channels or between an upper set and a lower set of scheduled programming channels.

If there is a fee associated with viewing an item of on demand content e.g. the content is pay per view content or is rentable for a specific period of time optionally associated fee information is accessed from a data store and provided for display within or in association with the on demand listing. If the user clicks on an item of fee based content the user may be prompted to enter payment information or to agree that previously provided payment information may be used to charge the fee. The user may then be charged the fee and may view the fee based content. Optionally the grouping of on demand channels may be displayed as a single entry and an expand control may be provided which if activated by the user causes each on demand channel entry to be displayed. Thus optionally the same program guide may display listings for and access to both on demand and linear scheduled channels.

Optionally a randomizer control e.g. a button or menu entry is provided which when activated by a user causes the system to generate in substantially real time a program and or channel of non scheduled content and or content not specifically selected by the user e.g. where the program or channel is not simply a playlist defined by the user . However optionally the content is not truly randomly selected but may be selected based on one or more criteria. Optionally some or all of the content is randomly selected and or handpicked by an operator. For example the system may access user account information e.g. a user s content preferences viewing behavior and or viewing history to be used in selecting in substantially real time one or more items of content to be displayed to the user as a program or channel. For example if the user s account information indicates that the user likes baseball and skateboarding bloopers but is not interested in football bloopers the randomizer may select from one or more sources baseball and skateboarding blooper video content and generate a program for the user from selected baseball and skateboarding blooper video content while excluding football blooper video content from the program.

Optionally an intelligent channel scan mode is provided that determines a priority order for channels to jump to in response to a user activating a scan control based at least in part on processed set s of data. By way of illustration a scan control may be provided which when activated causes a player to cycle through channels presenting content from each channel cycled through for a period of time e.g. 1 second 3 second 5 seconds or other period of time or to the end of the current content item e.g. video clip or the end of the current program which is optionally settable by the user before jumping to the next channel. If the user likes content being provided by a channel the user can activate the scan control again or a play control to stop scanning and to enable the content of the current channel to be presented. The scan mode may be configured to scan though each available channel or to scan through only a subset of available channels.

The ordering of the scan may be based on the ordering of the channels in the program guide or the ordering of the scan may be dynamically determined. For example the scan sequence may be based on the content the user is currently viewing the user viewing history user preferences other user account information e.g. genre program subject matter content and or channel likes and or dislikes user specifications of channels to be blocked user reminder instructions user bookmarks etc. etc.

For example depending on the configuration of the scan mode if the user is currently viewing a sports channel when activating the scan control the scan mode may only scan through other sports channels. By way of further example depending on the configuration of the scan mode if the user is currently viewing a sports channel when activating the scan control the scan mode may first scan through other sports channels and then scan through non sports channels.

Optionally a user interface is provided via which the user may specify one or more specific scan sequences which may be associated with respective scan controls. The user interface may include a field via which the user can enter a scan sequence name which may then be presented in association with the respective scan controls. Thus for example a user may define a sports channel scan sequence a comedy channel scan sequence a music channel scan sequence a reality show scan sequence etc. A menu of respective scan controls may be presented via which the user can select the desired scan sequence. In response to the user selection the content player will then scan through the selected channel sequence.

Optionally a recommendation control is provided which when activated by the user causes the system to generate and or display program and or channel recommendations. The recommendations may be based at least in part on one or more of the following user account information e.g. genre program subject matter content and or channel likes and or dislikes user specifications of channels to be blocked user reminder instructions user bookmarks etc. user viewing history user navigation behavior etc.

As further illustrated in a chat control is optionally provided which enables a user to initiate a chat e.g. a text chat with others. Optionally a chat user interface is provided e.g. in response to the user activating the chat control displaying names and or images of the certain of the user s friends as illustrated in . The names or images of the user s friends may be accessed from a social networking site or may be provided directly by the user e.g. via an add a friend interface . The chat user interface may indicate which of the user s friends are online and which of the user s friends are currently viewing the same program as the user. illustrates a chat session which may take place while the various chatters are viewing a program e.g. a scheduled program on a channel so that the chat session is synchronized with the episode . Optionally the user interface may access video and audio content from a webcam and a microphone to enable users to chat via a video and or audio conference. The webcam may also be positioned and used to enable a user s friends watch the user watching a given program.

The user can invite others to watch a current or future program via the chat user interface or optionally via a direct invitation user interface. For example the user can activate an invitation control and an invitation will be sent to a friend or other user specified by the user. The invitation may identify the program title channel and or the program date time. Optionally the invitation may include preexisting invitation template text and dynamic text identifying the program and channel the user is watching such as I am watching Cats having dinner on Channel 302. Please watch along with me or I will be watching Cats having dinner on Channel 302 on Friday December 26. Please watch along with me the underlined text indicates the dynamic text . The dynamic text may be determined by detecting what program the user is watching and determining which channel it is on. The dynamic text may then be inserted into the invitation. The invitation may be sent in real time. Optionally the chat user interface may also provide access to a public chat room as illustrated in .

Controls to a real or simulated digital video or other content recorder DVR may be provided for display on a user terminal in association with a video or other content player. Optionally the DVR may be a module hosted by the system or hosted by the user s terminal and implemented in part using software in communication with the software providing the program guide. An example DVR set of controls is illustrated in . As will be described optionally the DVR may be used to record a program view a recorded program e.g. from a library specific to a user or from a shared library pause and rewind a live program share a program currently being watched and or share bookmarks. In this example a pause play control a rewind control a fast forward control and a scrubber control are provided. For example the user may instruct via a record control provided by the program guide user interface that a show be recorded for later playback. A DVR user interface may also provide a listing library of recorded programs which may be virtually recorded programs from which the user may select for playback. The DVR function may enable the user to rewind or fast forward through a recorded or currently playing program using corresponding rewind and fast forward controls.

Optionally an actual DVR is not used. Rather the interface simulates the functionality of a DVR. Thus for example although the DVR control set enables the user to pause rewind and fast forward through a program a copy of the program is not stored on the user terminal or on the content scheduling system. Instead the DVR control set is controlling playback of media being streamed from the third party content sources. Thus for example if a user provides a record instruction while watching the program no actual content is recorded in response. Instead a bookmark may be stored e.g. on the user terminal or on the content scheduling system indicating at what point in the program the user activated the record program. When the user later accesses the recorded program the system access the stored bookmark determines at what time point the user activated the bookmark and causes playback of the corresponding clip and hence program that included the clip accessed from the third party content site to begin at the bookmarked location. Thus advantageously storage space on the user terminal or content scheduling is not wastefully occupied storing the content from the third party content site.

Optionally the user may associate several bookmarks with a program where each bookmark is associated with a different time point in the program. The program guide may include a listing control which when activated by the user causes a listing of the bookmarks recordings to be generated and displayed to the user. The listing may display some or all of the following a frame from the program corresponding to the location of the bookmark the name of the program the program channel and the date time the user created the bookmark. The user can then select a given bookmark or recording for playback and the corresponding program will then be played back at the bookmarked point.

A user s bookmarks and library may be associated with the user s account and optionally may not be accessible to other users. Optionally the user can select to share some or all of the user s bookmarks or library of programs with one or more other users. For example the user may share bookmarks for a particular program a set or sets of programs a channel or set of channels. The recipient s of the bookmarks or library may be notified that the user is sharing the bookmarks or library with the recipient and may view a similar generated bookmark listing. Optionally a bookmark or access to a bookmark via a link or otherwise may be included in an invitation from the user such as the invitations discussed elsewhere herein to one or more other users to watch the program e.g. beginning at the bookmarked location . Thus the system enables the user to engage in the viewing of the program starting at a bookmarked location with other remote users with whom the user shared the bookmark with. Optionally the library and or bookmarks may be shared across a variety of different platform types e.g. tablet computers smart phones desktop computers networked televisions etc. or only one or more user and or system selected platform types.

In addition the DVR the virtual or non virtual DVR may be used to navigate through a program being viewed by the user in accordance with its scheduled display. That is the DVR enables the user to rewind pause and fast forward through a live program. Optionally the DVR prevents that user from fast forwarding through a program past it current live point. Optionally instead the DVR may enable the user to fast forward through a program past it current live point. Of course if the program is an actual live program e.g. a live sporting event the user is prevented from fast forwarding through the program past the current actual live point in the program.

Because a given program may be composed of multiple clips being streamed from different sources which are then logical and visually stitched together to provide a seamless viewing experience to a viewer rewinding or fast forwarding through a given program may cause clip boundaries to be traversed. Because certain clips may be from different sources the system determines if the rewind or fast forward instruction will cause a clip boundary to be traversed and if so will determine which other clip should be streamed to the user video player based on the amount of rewinding or fast forwarding. The system will then cause the appropriate clip from the appropriate source to be streamed to the user video player from the appropriate point in the clip. It is understood that a user may rewind or fast forward through a program using dedicated rewind and fast forward controls a scrubber or otherwise. An example DVR user interface is discussed below with respect to .

Optionally a library add control e.g. a button may be provided on third party pages e.g. website pages or via a browser plug in that enables a user to add a video on the third party page to the user s individual library e.g. the user s DVR library for access via the DVR or otherwise . For example when the user activates the library add control code associated with the library add control detects the activation and transmits corresponding video locator information or locator information for other content such as image content social streams microblogs text messages etc. to the user s library which may be hosted on the user s terminal and or the system . For example the locator information may comprises a URL and or an internal code of the third party that points to the video or other content specifically separately from the page as a whole so that when the video is later accessed by the user only the video and not the surrounding page is displayed in the user s video player. Thus for example if the user comes across a video on a news channel website but does not have time to view the video the user can save the video to the user s library for later playback by activating the library add control. Optionally the video may be added to a specific private or public playlist or channel such as a user defined channel of videos that the user has saved but not yet viewed.

If the user clicks on a program listed in the program guide that has not yet begun a reminder control is presented e.g. in a pop up window or otherwise an example of which is illustrated in the notify me control . If the user activates the reminder control the reminder user interface illustrated in is presented. The user can provide an instruction that a reminder be transmitted to the user preset amount of time or a user specified amount before the beginning of the program. Optionally the user can specify via a user account specification via a control in the pop up window via a menu selection or otherwise how the reminder is to be provided.

For example the user can specify that the reminder is to be provided via an audible alert or visual on the user s terminal via an SMS MMS message transmitted to a user mobile device via an email via an automated phone call via an entry on the user s calendar which will cause the calendar to provide an audible and or visual reminder and or otherwise. By way of illustration the user can specify that the reminder is to be provided at the program start time 1 minute before the program start time 15 minutes before the program start time 1 hour before the program start time or other amount of time before the program start time. The system or app will store the reminder instructions and provide reminders to the user accordingly. As illustrated in the reminder user interface may also include an interface via which the user can invite another person to watch the upcoming program at the same time. In the example illustrated in a field is provided via which the user can indicate e.g. by entering an email address or SMS address of the invitee to whom the invitation is to be provided. The invitee will then be provided with a reminder at about the same time the user is provided the reminder e.g. via email SMS or otherwise .

Optionally the program guide user interface can be navigated using a remote control. For example the remote control may be in the form of a mobile device such as a mobile phone with a touch screen or a touch tablet which has a remote control application or other application including a remote control module such as a program guide application including a remote control module downloaded to and installed thereon. The remote control may be configured to directly communicate with the user interface application hosted on the user s terminal via a local wireless communication protocol such as Bluetooth or via a local area wireless network such as a Wi Fi network or otherwise. Optionally in order to enable the remote control to be synchronized with the program guide presented in a browser on the user terminal the user selects a sync control presented via the remote control application e.g. the phone app . The application then prompts the user to enter in the remote sync code generated by the web app executed by the user browser as illustrated in . Once the user enters the code into a field presented by the application the application becomes a remote control for the web app. For example the application may present a version of the program guide formatted for the remote control application host e.g. a smart phone or tablet display as illustrated in . When the user selects a given channel or program on the program guide provided via the remote control that same channel or program will be selected in the web app on the user terminal. Thus the user inputs on the remote control may be functionally mirrored on the user terminal. Similarly and optionally when the user selects a given channel or program via the web app that same channel or program will be selected on the remote control.

Optionally a parental control is provided via which the user can prevent channels and or programs having an unacceptable rating e.g. a rating above G or PG or other than a PG rating from being presented unless an override input is entered e.g. a PIN code . An administrating user e.g. a parent may specify an override code via a user interface accessible via the program guide see e.g. the example illustrated in . The system will record the override code specified by the user. If someone attempts to access via the user s account a program that exceeds the permitted rating such access is detected by the application or system and in response the user interface provides a visual and or an audible notification that the program rating exceeds the parental control threshold and prompts the user to enter the override code. If the user enters the correct override code as verified by the system or application then the program will be displayed via the user interface. If the user fails to enter the correct override code then the program will not be displayed.

Example backend user interfaces will now be discussed that enable a content programmer to program channels and programs. illustrates an example user interface including a search field via which the user can enter search queries to search for channels or clips. The search queries may be routed to one or more content hosting sites and or a content repository or index maintained by the content scheduling system. The search results may then be presented to the user. The search results may be aggregated if they included results from more than one source. The operator can add new channels to a channel lineup by activating a new channel control and can add a new video clip or other content to a program by activating a new clip control.

Optionally the index of content may be made available to third parties e.g. over a network via an application programming interface API . The third parties may access and use the index to identify and locate content from one or more sources that meet one or more filter conditions specified by the third party where a filter condition may relate to content metadata . For example the content index may include content locators e.g. URLs for Internet content unique content identifiers and or metadata extracted and optionally normalized e.g. into an interoperable standard data format from one or more content sources e.g. video music image social media microblogs and or other hosting sites or data stores . By way of further example the content metadata may include length information. By way of yet further example the content metadata may identify notable individuals associated with an item of content e.g. names of writers actors directors producers artists performers etc. in association with their respective titles job functions content title content subject matter topic content classification e.g. video music blog etc. instruments played e.g. for music content other metadata discussed herein etc. Metadata may have been obtained via the content source via an analysis of the content e.g. by processing the content to identify actors music subject matter etc. and or from other databases e.g. other databases that store and provide access to content metadata .

Thus for example a third party may specify via an interface a length subject matter and category for desired content and a search engine will locate and return via the API search results identifying corresponding content and or some or all of the associated metadata. The third parties may utilize the metadata and identified content to construct their own electronic program guides their own programs and or channels or may use the identified content and metadata for other purposes.

FIG. C illustrates an example user interface presenting lists of programs for a selected channel Top 40 in this example generated by the system. The system categorizes organizes and presents the programs as groups based at least in part on the program status such as On Air meaning the program is scheduled to be aired In Progress meaning the program is still being edited and is not yet complete Completed meaning the program is ready per programmer guidelines and is ready to be scheduled into the program tool and Archived meaning the programs have been aired or assembled but not aired but are not currently scheduled to be aired. The aired airing dates and times and program lengths for each program may be provided for display as well. Corresponding delete controls are provided for deleting a given program. An add control is provided to enable the programmer to duplicate an existing program and then manipulate edit into a new program. When the system detects that the user has activated the add control the system makes a copy of the corresponding program or the data used to assemble the clips into the program . The user may then activate an edit control provided by the user interface via which the user can edit the program details including the name description and or published state. FIG. C a user interface similar to that of FIG. C. In this example the system organizes the list so that programs that are in progress are grouped together and programs that are on air are grouped together. In this example the program title aired date time and duration may be listed. Add edit and delete controls are provided and may be used as similarly discussed above with respect to FIG. C.

Referring again to the example illustrated in an import control is provided. The import control enables the programmer to import a clip or to import a list of clips or links locator thereto such as a URL or other locator into the program at once. A user may enter one or more clip locators e.g. a URL into a corresponding field and the system will import the corresponding clip s .

Example content programmer user interfaces will now be discussed. illustrates an example user interface via which the programmer can enter locators for one or more clips or locators for other content optionally including real time generated content such as a streaming microblog to be imported. It is understood that the term real time includes substantially real time e.g. in less than 0.5 seconds in less than 1 second in less than 2 seconds etc. unless the context indicates otherwise. illustrates a report generated by the system indicating which locators entered via the user interface of are not usable e.g. are not embeddable by the system in the program guide . The list of bad clip locators may include for each corresponding clip some or all of the following a thumbnail for the clip the clip title a clip description the number of clip views the clip duration and the date the clip was posted in addition to some or all of the metadata associated to the original clip. A control is provided via which the operator can remove the bad locators clips or bad locators for other content . illustrates an example clip assignment user interface via which the programmer can assign a given clip to an associated category channel program or playlist. The system will then store the assignment.

For example the programmer can drag a given program identifier to a calendar user interface which lists days and time for specifying broadcast dates and times and drop the program identifier at a desired month week day and time for the selected channel. The example calendar user interface includes navigation controls enabling the user to navigate to a desired month week and or year. If the identified program is a series with multiple episodes optionally dragging and dropping the program name will cause the latest newest episode to be added to the calendar at the specified date time. Optionally multiple or all of the episodes for the selected program are listed optionally including the episode title number version and last air date in an episode user interface and the programmer can drag and drop whichever episode the programmer wishes to add to the calendar. The system may track update and display calendar status information such as the date time the calendar was last modified who last modified the calendar last sync with a live calendar for consumer viewing date time and by who the calendar status e.g. draft finalized etc. etc. The system may synchronize the updated calendar with the live calendar in response to detection a sync command from an authorized programmer.

It is understood that the programs which may be added by a content programmer to a channel or schedule are not limited to prerecorded programs. The programming tool can be used to select and add an upcoming live program e.g. a concert sporting event awards show interview etc. to a schedule for a channel. For example the live program may be streamed from a third party content site. The programming tool may inspect and check the programming to ensure that the programmer did not schedule the live event to be played at a date time that is prior to the occurrence of the live event. If the programming tool determines that the programmer has attempted to schedule a live event to be played before the occurrence of the live event e.g. as determined by comparing scheduling day time metadata accessed from the third party content site with that of the programming calendar the programming tool may notify the programmer of the error and optionally prevent the programmer from scheduling the live program at such a premature date time. Thus optionally a given channel may include prerecorded and live streamed programs clips or other content such as image content social streams blogs text messages etc. . Adding a live streamed event to a channel may optionally be performed seamlessly in a manner similar to that of recorded non live content.

An auto program user interface corresponds to an auto program function. The programmer can define certain criteria for the auto programming of programs by entering or selecting via respective fields an ending date a duration e.g. in days weeks or months and the number of occurrences. The auto program function takes a selection single or multiple programming blocks and receives the date duration or number of occurrences in which to automatically program the selection into the future. Optionally in order to use the auto program function the programming pattern e.g. day s of the week refresh cycle daily weekly bi monthly monthly needs to be pre defined at the program level. The auto program function will automatically program the program episodes in accordance with the programmer s definition thereby reducing the effort and time needed to perform a repetitive programming process.

A duplicate selection user interface corresponds to a duplicate selection function. The programmer can define certain criteria for the programming of programs by entering or selecting via respective fields a start date a repeat definition e.g. repeat every Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and or Sunday duration e.g. in days weeks or months and the number of occurrences. The duplicate selection function takes a selection single or multiple programming blocks and receives the definition in which to automatically program the selection into the future. The duplicate selection may be used where the programming pattern is not pre defined at the program level. The duplicate selection function will automatically program the program episodes in accordance with the programmer s definition thereby reducing the effort and time needed to perform a repetitive programming process.

A check schedule user interface corresponds to a check schedule function. The check schedule function is configured to detect errors e.g. unused space e.g. a time range in the schedule where no content is designated to be played scheduling of a live event to be played at a time prior to the occurrence of the live event removed or invalidated clips or other content insufficient available advertising and promotional space in terms of time incomplete metadata e.g. missing thumbnails titles descriptions length information etc. etc. and to report the errors to the programmer before the programmer synchronizes their programming calendar to a live calendar for consumer viewing. The check schedule function report may include a list of programming errors that need to be fixed and programming errors that may be ignored auto program function. The programmer can define start and end dates for the schedule check via the check schedule user interface.

Optionally consumers may also be provided with access to some or all features of the channel scheduling tool to enable users to program their own channels and to share their channels with other users. Optionally one or more channels may be crowd sourced by multiple users. Thus the broader population may be provided with curating tools to let independent users generate channels.

For example the curating tools may enable an independent user to create a linear scheduled experience out of on demand content. For example a library of different content may be provided via which the user can assemble a program or channel. By way of illustration on demand content may be categorized as to themes or subject matter e.g. retro comedy reality clips etc. . The independent user may select one or more categories of content from the library and select one or more items of content from the categories of content to create a program or a set of programs. Optionally the independent user may include content from other sources as well. The independent user may define a channel using the programs e.g. where the programs are scheduled to be shown at specified times or according to a specified schedule and the channel may be made available to users at large e.g. via an electronic program guide provided to other users that includes a listing for the user generated channel or program or only to users identified by the independent user that created the channel or that have a specified social networking relationship with the independent user.

In the example illustrated in a channel name field is provided via which the user may enter a name for the user s channel. A playlist name field where a playlist may correspond to a program is provided via which the user may enter a name for the current music video playlist being defined. An add music videos interface is provided via which the user can specific or select a music video to add to the playlist. For example the user may enter a song artist or album name and a system search engine will locate and present a listing of matching music videos with associated play controls enabling the user to view play the music videos. The user may then select one or more of the matching music videos to add to the playlist. Optionally the add music videos interface may be configured to receive a locator e.g. a URL for a music video to be added to the playlist 

A playlist field displays the music videos currently included in the playlist including the name of the music video song the associated record label the play time and the play ordering 1 2 3 etc. . A play control may be provided with respective playlist entries which when activated will cause the corresponding music video to be played. A delete control may be provided in association with a given playlist entry which the user can activate in order to delete the playlist entry from the playlist. The current playlist running time may be calculated and displayed. The playlist running time may be recalculated and displayed when additions or deletions are made to the playlist. A control may be provided enabling the user to select cover art for a given playlist entry and or for the channel as a whole. The user playlist definitions are received and stored by the system.

Optionally a user interface may be provided that enables the user to insert user generated content e.g. video clips between non user generated content e.g. between video content from this party video hosting sites . For example the user generated content e.g. where the user records a video of the user acting as a program or channel host may be used to introduce the next item of non user generated content. By way of illustration if the user is defining a top 10 list program that discusses 10 items of video content the user interface may first prompt the user to record e.g. using a video recorder included in the user terminal an overall program introduction. The user interface may then prompt the user to record an introduction to the video rated number 10. The user interface may then prompt the user to record an introduction to the video rated number 9 then 8 then 7 and so on. Thus the user interface provides a template guiding the user through the program and channel creation process. The process may assemble a channel using a plurality of user generated programs.

As noted above the program lineup for a given channel may be manually selected by an operator or automatically selected by a channel generation module . For example an operator may specify a theme for a channel. The operator may assign one or more tags to a channel where the tags correspond to the channel theme. By way of illustration if the theme of the channel is to be cats the operator may assign the tags cat feline and kitten to the channel. The operator may specify further tags for a specific desired program episode at a specific time. A given program may be made up of multiple clips e.g. short videos and or other content such as image content social streams microblogs text messages etc. from one or more sources e.g. the video hosting sites discussed above social network streams microblogs etc. . The operator may also specify time lengths for programs and the day and or time the corresponding program is to be shown. Optionally the operator may specify a desired time length with minimum or acceptable maximum time for the program and or for clips and or other content included in program. The operator may also specify e.g. by providing a URL one or more sources for video content.

For example the operator may want a program about cat tricks for a 6 00 PM presentation. The operator may specify program tags cat tricks tricks swimming cat climbing etc. The operator may further specify that the program is 30 minutes long and each clip to be included in the program is to be preferably 2 minutes but no shorter than 1 minute long and no longer than 3 minutes long and the program is to be displayed at 6 00 PM. The module may then search the specified video or other content sources for videos or other content with tags corresponding to one or more of the tags specified by the user that are preferably 2 minutes long and no shorter than 1 minute and no longer than 3 minutes where the total length of the videos are 30 minutes. The operator may optionally specify thresholds for numbers of views and viewer ratings the clips or other content are to have as similarly discussed elsewhere herein. The operator can similarly specify multiple programs for a given day or days and the channel generation module will locate corresponding clips.

The channel generation module will then schedule the found clips or other content to be routed to users that have elected to view the corresponding programs or channels via the program guide user interface. Optionally the resulting program assembled by the channel generation module may be presented by the system to an operator e.g. a content programmer to ensure that the program and the assembled clips or other content for the program are suitable. The operator may change the ordering of the clips and or other content and may delete clips and add clips or other content e.g. accessed from a system database of clips or other content and or by manually navigating to one or more video sources or other content sources to identify and select clips or other content .

As similarly discussed above the content described herein may be in the form of video content music content still image content social streams text messages etc. or any combination thereof. Thus for example a programmer or an end user programming their own channel may compose a program e.g. an episode or channel to include a mixture of video clips streaming microblogs and social networking streams. By way of illustration a programmer may compose a channel program to include a 3 minute video clip of a pet doing tricks followed by a 30 second stream of a social network associated with the channel which may include substantially real time user posts related to the video clip followed by a 15 second stream of a microblog of a first specified person which may include substantially real time posts from the first person related to the video clip followed by a 2 minute clip of a pet doing tricks followed by another 30 second stream of the social network associated with the channel followed by a 15 second stream of a microblog of a second specified person followed by a 2 minutes of a live dog show and so on. Thus a program and or channel may integrate different types of content media including live and recorded content from different types of sources.

As similarly discussed above programs and or channels may be automatically generated and programs and or channels. Further socially driven real time programming of channels may be provided. By way of illustration viewer input may be taken into account in generating a program or channel in real time. For example a poll may be provided to users e.g. via the program guide a pop up prompt a text message or otherwise during a clip program advertisement or content transition asking viewers what they would like to see next. When the poll is for an existing channel the poll may include choices related to the subject matter of the channel or program. By way of illustration if the channel is for dog tricks the poll may ask if they want to see a clip of a video a dog performing a retrieving trick a jumping trick or a catching trick. Based at least in part on the votes corresponding content may be selected optionally in real time and the selected content may then be displayed next and or at a later time.

Optionally content e.g. a video clip image etc. for a channel or program and or the theme of a channel or program may be selected or generated based at least in part on input from social network sources. For example trending subjects may be identified on one or more social network sites such as microblog sites image posting sites etc. The trends may be identified via metadata e.g. keywords key phrases hashtags subject descriptions etc. associated with social network data or from an analysis of the content itself. For example the speed of posts e.g. the number of posts per minute and acceleration of posts e.g. the rate of increase or decrease of posts over a period of time such as the last hour regarding a particular subject may be determined and used in selecting an item of content for a program may be used to select a title or a channel.

Rules may be defined which specify which social network data in terms of content source and or time period is to be used in determining which content to select. For example a rule may specify that video clips from one or more specified sources having metadata corresponding to the top 10 Twitter hashtags over the last 24 hours are to be selected for a program. By way of further example a rule may be defined specifying that the 20 most popular video clips in terms of views over the last 7 days from a specified video hosting website having the phrase cat trick in the title are to be identified and that the top 5 of those 20 video clips having the most views over the previous 24 hours are to be selected to form a program.

Optionally an automated process of selecting and or generating transitions interstitials between clips or programs may be utilized. For example an interstitial may be in the form of text video and or audio content that may be presented during e.g. as a partial overlay and or after a given item of primary content is being displayed where primary content may be a programmed clip such as a clip of a cat trick for a cat trick program . The interstitial may be used to aid in tying or bridging clips into a program or tying or bridging programs into a channel. The interstitial may provide information regarding an upcoming clip or program. The interstitial may optionally be selected based at least in part on characteristics of a viewer e.g. user preferences user profile information etc. . Rules may be defined to select an interstitial.

An interstitial may include static content e.g. static text and or dynamic content e.g. dynamically selected text . By way of illustration static text may include the phrase Coming up next followed by dynamic text including the title or subject matter of the upcoming content the week s funniest cat videos optionally obtained from metadata associated with the upcoming content.

By way of further example the interstitial content may be selected that corresponds to the user s interests. By way of illustration if it is determined that the next program is not of interest to the viewer e.g. by comparing preference information for the viewer that indicates the viewer s subject matter interests with metadata of the next program that indicates the subject matter of the next program but a program that will be displayed in two hours is of high interest to the viewer the system may select a interstitial that discusses the program that will be displayed in two hours rather than the next program.

Optionally as discussed above the system may be configured to generate using artificial intelligence a computer generated channel or program host. For example the host characteristics may be selected based at least in part on user account information user preference information e.g. expressly provided and or inferred user preferences and or metadata associated with program host. The computer generated host may be used to deliver interstitial content examples of which are discussed above.

Another challenge presented by creating channels and programs for clips from different video sources e.g. video websites and or for other content is that the different video sources may provide custom video players for videos hosted by a given source. For example each source s video player may have a different appearing video player with common controls placed in different positions and with some video players having different control sets than other video players. Conventionally such inconsistent player user interfaces and functionality does not pose much of a problem for users as users typically are accessing videos at a single source during a given viewing session.

However when users are viewing via a single site multiple videos as part of a channel they expect to have a unified viewing experience and it would be confusing and disconcerting to be presented with a different player for each program video. To address this problem certain embodiments provide a meta player that integrates other video players into single experience and provides a common video player interface. For example while the user is watching a channel the meta player may cause a given program to be presented in a video presentation area. When the next program comes on it too is presented in the same video presentation area even though the native players may present the videos in differently positioned presentation areas. Further the meta player places a common set of video player controls at the same locations and with the same appearance even though the native players may have different control placements and different control appearances.

By way of example the common controls may be defined to include some or all of the following rewind fast forward play pause record navigate to the next clip or other content like share which enables a user to instruct that a notification regarding the program optionally including a link to the program be sent to a designated recipient etc. Optionally if a given source player includes a control that is not included in the common control set that non common control is excluded from presentation to the user via the meta player. Optionally instead if a given source player includes a control that is not included in the common control set that non common control is presented to the user via the meta player in an area reserved for the display of non common controls.

In certain embodiments the system determines what player is needed to play a given video clip e.g. based on the source of the clip the URL to the clip and then uses a program e.g. implemented using an interpreted client side script such as JavaScript to call the appropriate player wrapped in the meta player interface.

The video player may be configured to display programs from two or more channels at a time in respective windows. For example the windows may be configured as picture in a picture windows as side by side windows or as windows that the user may drag and drop to desired locations.

Thus certain embodiments optionally provide seamless switching of video sources and players in a manner transparent to the user to thereby provide the user with a unified experience when viewing content from different sources e.g. within a program or a channel .

The content players may include chromeless content players that provide outside developers access to the standard player controls and enable the outside developers to provide their own customized skin and or additional features. Different content players may be configured to play different types of formats of content e.g. MPEG MKV AVI FLV etc. . Optionally the original video host s advertisements analytics watermark etc. are preserved with the content stream.

A given player controller API routes commands received from a user via the native environment to the currently active content player. A stage module ensures the appropriate content player is being used for the content e.g. video clip currently being played. By way of illustration a given program may include four video clips each of which utilizes a different content player. When the program is played the stage module causes a first content player to play a first item of content a second content player to play a second item of content etc. However to the user it appears as if the same content player with the same controls in the same positions is being used to play each of the four video clips.

At block metadata associated with the first content item is accessed. Optionally the metadata may be accessed from a local data store e.g. local content data store of content scheduling system . Optionally the metadata is accessed from the first content item source. The metadata associated with the first content item may include some or all of the following data an identification of what content player is to be used to play the first content item an identifier identifying the first source and or a content item identifier e.g. a unique alphanumeric or other code identifying the first content item.

At block the process determines at least in part from the metadata which content player is to be used to play the first content item. At block the process instructs a unified content player on a user terminal to access the first content player and to utilize the first content player to play the first content item from the first content source. For example the instructions may include the first content player identifier the first source identifier and or the first content item identifier. Optionally the instructions include a URL corresponding to the first content item. The first content player may be presented via a user browser and may be generated using code e.g. JavaScript from the content scheduling system the first content source and or other source. The first content player may be configured so that the appearance conforms to a standardized uniform content player appearance e.g. with the controls in a certain location and with a certain appearance which may be different than that of the first content player in its native form .

At block a determination is made whether it is time for the next content item the second content item in this example to be played by the unified player. For example the determination may be based on a timer or a trigger e.g. metadata associated with the program that indicates that it is or is about to be time for the second content item to be played. If it is time for the second content item to be played at block metadata associated with the second content item is accessed although the metadata may be accessed earlier such as at the beginning of the program . Optionally the metadata may be accessed from a local data store e.g. local content data store of content scheduling system . Optionally the metadata is accessed from the second content item source. The metadata associated with the second content item may include some or all of the following data an identification of what content player is to be used to play the second content item an identifier identifying the second source and or a content item identifier e.g. a unique alphanumeric or other code identifying the second content item.

At block the process determines at least in part from the metadata which content player is to be used to play the second content item. At block the process instructs a unified content player on a user terminal to access the second content player and to utilize the second content player to play the second content item from the second content source. For example the instructions may include the second content player identifier the second source identifier and or the second content item identifier. Optionally the instructions include a URL corresponding to the second content item. The second content player may be presented via a user browser and may be generated using code e.g. JavaScript from the content scheduling system the second content source and or other source. The second content player may be configured so that the appearance conforms to a standardized uniform content player appearance e.g. with the controls in a certain location and with a certain appearance which may be different than that of the second content player in its native form so that the second content player and the first content player appear the same to the user and the switching of content players is transparent to the user e.g. the user is unaware that different content players are being used to play content from different sources . The process may then repeat for the next content item and so on.

It is understood that other activities may be performed by the unified content player during playback of a content item. For example the unified content player may report e.g. to the content scheduling system or other system the current playback position of the content item being played buffering delays and or other information.

Another challenge posed by the process of composing a program using one or more clips from third party content hosting sources over which the system operator has no control is that a given clip may be deleted at any time e.g. by the third party hosting site by the posting user or otherwise . For example a content hosting source may delete a video clip because of an alleged copyright violation because of viewer complaints regarding the video clip or for other reasons. Thus when a clip is scheduled to be displayed to users as part of a program the clip may be no longer be available and an error condition may occur or there may be a dead space within the corresponding program or if the program is composed of a single clip the whole program may be dead .

In order to address this problem optionally certain embodiments identify backup content e.g. video content or other content to be substituted for removed or other unavailable video content that had been included in a program. In an example embodiment before a given program is scheduled to air the system may determine whether or not the clip is still available. For example the system may issue a query to the hosting site via an API regarding the availability of the clip and the hosting system will then provide a response received by the system the response indicating whether or not the clip is still available or may provide no response which may indicate that the clip is no longer available . By way of illustration the system may be scheduled to perform the availability check 30 minutes before the program airs 12 hours before the program airs one day before the program airs or other time period before the program airs.

If the system determines that the clip is not available the system may identify a substitute clip from a pool of clips or from one or more other sources optionally including a pool of clips stored and maintained by the content scheduling system . By way of example a pool of substitute clips or other content may have already been manually or automatically identified for the specific program e.g. a dedicated program pool . The system may then select the substitute clip or other content from the program pool based at least in part on the similarly to the length in time of the no longer available clip. For example if the currently unavailable clip is 2 minutes in length the system may identify a clip from the pool that is 2 minutes or less in length. By way of further example the system may identify a clip between 1 minute and 45 seconds and 2 minutes and 15 seconds long.

Thus optionally the system may select substitute content that is longer than the time period of the unavailable content and may truncate the excess content corresponding to the time that exceeds that of the unavailable content. Optionally if the system selects substitute content that is longer than that of the unavailable content the system may delete other content from the program to compensate e.g. the system may delete previously included promotional advertising content for other programs . Optionally instead the system may select substitute content that is no longer than the time period of the unavailable content.

Optionally rather than using a dedicated program pool of substitute backup clips the system may search for and select substitute clips from a broader pool e.g. a pool specific to a given channel or from third party content hosting sites. For example the substitute clip may be selected by the system based on its similarity e.g. as determined by comparing tags to the currently unavailable clip and on the clip length. By way of illustration if the currently unavailable clip has a tag of cat tricks and is 5 minutes in length the system may identify a substitute clip that also has the tag cat tricks or a functional synonym for cat tricks e.g. cat stunts and that is about 5 minutes in length.

Optionally rather than using a substitute clip to replace a video clip live content or other content type may be specified such as a microblog or social network stream.

Optionally the currently unavailable clip may be substituted using two or more clips or other content which may include live content and or recorded content that combined have about the same length as the currently unavailable clip. A packing algorithm may be used to select multiple clips or other content to replace a given currently unavailable clip. The system may select a combination of substitute content where each item of content of the combination is shorter than the unavailable content but the combined length of the combination is longer than the time period of the unavailable content. The system may truncate the excess content from one of the items of the combination of substitute content e.g. the last item of content corresponding to the time that exceeds that of the unavailable content. Optionally instead the system may select a combination of content having a length that is no longer than the time period of the unavailable content. Optionally if the length is shorter than the time period of the unavailable content fill in content may be selected and used to fill in the time period.

Yet another challenge posed by composing a program using one or more clips or other content from sources over which the system operator has no control is that a given clip may actually vary in length. For example a given clip may include a lead in video or post roll commercial when initially identified and selected for a given program and so the clip including the commercial will have a first length. The lead in clip may be dynamically selected by an advertisement server at the time the clip is requested. Thus different advertisements of different lengths may be selected based on when the clip is requested and or based on the location of the requester. Therefore the given clip may include a different video commercial of a different length than the video commercial that was streamed as a lead in commercial when the clip was originally selected or the clip when originally selected may not have included any lead in video commercial and hence the total length of the clip including the lead in advertisement may change.

In order to address this problem and to ensure that the lengths of clips are synchronized with the scheduled program end time certain embodiments schedule a longer time for a given clip item of content or for the program in which the given clip is to be included than the actual length of the clip when initially selected for the program. The selected scheduled length may be configured to accommodate the maximum anticipated potential increase in clip length. For example typically lead in advertisements are 1 minute or less and so the system may schedule an additional minute for the clip or may schedule an additional 2 minutes to even better ensure that the total clip time including the lead in post roll or other advertisement will not exceed the scheduled time for the clip.

Then when the clip is about to be e.g. within 1 second within 15 seconds within 30 seconds or is played as part of the program the system may examine the clip e.g. the clip metadata that indicates the advertisement length and or the clip length to determine the current total clip length including the advertisement from the advertisement server of the about to be played clip. For example the system may use an API to access the clip length without the advertisement from the content hosting system. If the total clip length is shorter than the amount of time scheduled for the clip or for multiple clips in a given program the system may select other content to fill out the time. The fill in content may be selected based on its length and optionally based on its relevancy to the program. If the system determines that the clip is shorter than the allocated time the system may identify fill in content which may be in the form of one or more video clips or still static images.

Optionally the system may select fill in content that is longer than the time period that needs to be filled in and will truncate the excess content corresponding to the time that exceeds the period that needs to be filled in. Optionally if the system selects fill in content that is longer than the time period that needs to be filled in the system may delete other content from the program to compensate e.g. the system may delete previously included promotional advertising content for other programs . The fill in content may correspond to the subject matter of the program may be promotional content for other programs or may be advertisement content for one or more products or services. Optionally the fill in content may be retrieved from a pool of clips maintained by the system or from one or more other sources. By way of example a pool of fill in clips may have been manually or automatically identified for the specific program e.g. a dedicated program pool . The system may then select the fill in clip from the program pool based at least in part on the similarity to the length in time of the clip underrun.

Optionally certain channels may be provided to and accessed by users for free. Optionally certain channels may be paid subscription channels where the system will prevent access to the channels by users that the system determines has not subscribed to those channels. Optionally bundled subscription packages may be provided where programs and or channels are bundled by subject e.g. any available shows regarding a specified sports team theme e.g. travel music etc. event a live concert a sporting event etc. etc. and users may subscribe to one or more bundles. Optionally certain programs channels may be on a pay per view basis where the system informs the user that the user needs to pay a fee to access a given program or to access a channel for a specified period of time.

Optionally the system may access e.g. via an API programming information from other broadcasters e.g. cable and or over the air broadcasters that also provide content to computers mobile devices etc. or that otherwise provide access to their content and may add the programming information e.g. name of program air date time etc. to the programming guide discussed above. Thus the program guide may provide an integrated program guide including information for multiple broadcasters e.g. online video content sources over the air broadcasters cable broadcasters etc. . Optionally the program guide enables the user to select and view channels and content from such broadcasters. Optionally a user interface is provided via which the user can provide log in information for the user s account s with the other broadcaster s that require or ask for such log in in information order to access their content. The system may then utilize such log in information from the user e.g. user ID password etc. to verify that the user is authorized to access such broadcaster content and or the system forwards the login information to the broadcaster for verification and authorization.

Optionally one or more channels may be embedded on and streamed to one or more third party sites e.g. websites . For example a blog about hip hop music may embed a hip hop music channel for viewing by its audience. Optionally the channel may be presented with links to the site hosted by the system. Optionally a company may utilize the system to generate a channel or program for a company brand. For example if the company manufacturers or sells sports footwear the system may be utilized to generate programs and or channels of content related to or depicting footwear with the company brand. The content for the program of channel may be hand selected by the company or the content may be automatically identified and or assembled into a program or channel as similarly discussed elsewhere herein. The company channel may be accessed via a company website a website hosted by the system and or a third party content hosting website. Optionally a given channel or program may be syndicated across a plurality of platforms and distribution points e.g. to other linear platforms to cable or satellite set top boxes etc. . For example an interface e.g. provided via a software developer kit may be provided enabling a publisher to create a channel e.g. as discussed elsewhere herein and specify how and to where the channel is to be broadcast e.g. over the air over the internet via cable etc. .

Optionally content may utilize IP and or wireless multicast streaming e.g. to reduce network bandwidth usage where a given stream may be accessed by multiple destinations rather than only using one to one unicast streaming. For example in multicast streaming a multicast transmission may transmit IP packets to a group of destination terminals on a network. A destination node e.g. a user terminal may send to the system a join message when joining a multicast streaming transmission and may send a leave messages when leaving a multicast streaming transmission. For example when a user is viewing a first channel and then switches to second channel a leave message may be transmitted by the destination node for leaving the first channel and a join message may be transmitted by the destination node for joining the second channel. Using multicast transmission a system can send a packet of data e.g. content data once for receipt by multiple destination nodes. Multicast addressing may utilize a variety of different transport layer protocols such as Pragmatic General Multicast PGM or is User Datagram Protocol UDP .

Optionally the content scheduling system operator or other entity may run advertisements on third party content sites. For example the content scheduling system operator may purchase keywords corresponding to content such as a video e.g. a music video of a popular performer . Then when a user of a third party content site performs a search using search terms that correspond to the keywords an advertisement which may comprise a link text an image frame for the video may be identified and displayed to the user on the user s terminal. When the user clicks on the advertisement link for the video the video may be played to the user. Optionally the video is played via the site hosted by the content scheduling system. Optionally the video is played via a third party content site. The content scheduling system may identify a channel that it determines the user may like based at least in part on the user selection of the video e.g. by identifying a similar theme subject matter etc. using comparing metadata associated with the channels and the video . For example prior to the user selecting the video an association of the video with a channel may optionally be performed so that once a user selects the video the system already knows which channel to select. The content scheduling system may detect or determine when the video has finished playing to the user and then cause the user to be provided with videos from the selected channel e.g. in accordance with the channel schedule . For example the currently playing program for the selected channel may be streamed to the user terminal for display to the user. The channel may be identified to the user by name channel number and or otherwise.

Optionally advertisement insertion points may be assigned by a programmer to different points within a playlist such as before or after a given clip in a playlist. Thus rather than specifying an advertisement insertion time the insertion points are associated with the beginning and or endings of clips within a playlist such as a playlist of clips that forms a program. The advertisements may comprise linear advertisements advertisements that appear before after or during a break in the video content sometimes referred to as pre roll post roll or mid roll and or non linear advertisements advertisements that appear along with the video content e.g. overlays that cover part of the video as it plays . The advertisements may be served by an advertisement server.

Optionally an operator may specify a maximum number of minutes and or quantity of advertisements that may be added to a playlist. For example if the program is scheduled to be 30 minutes long including advertisements and the corresponding playlist includes 22 minutes of content then only 8 minutes of the program time is allocated to advertisements. When the programmer adds an advertisement insertion point the programmer may specify the length in time of the advertisement to be inserted. The programming tool may calculate the current program length including the base program and the current advertisement insertions and optionally continuously display the total time to the programmer. The system may compare the current total time against the scheduled program time. Optionally if the programmer attempts to add an advertisement insertion point with an associated time length that would cause the total length of the program to exceed the scheduled length an error notice may be generated and presented to the programmer and optionally the programming tool will prevent the addition of the advertisement insertion point.

Example processes will now be described with reference to the figures. The processes may be performed by or using the systems disclosed herein or by or with other systems. It is understood that not all the following processes need to be performed nor do all the process states need to be performed.

At block a program definition for the program scheduled at a first time period is accessed from a data store of program definitions. For example the program definition may indicate which content items are included in the program and the display ordering of the content items the content items lengths the start time of a given content item relative to the beginning of the program e.g. content item 3 begins 5 minutes into the program and may include locators e.g. URLs for the content items. The program definition may have been established days weeks months or other time period before the next showing of the program. At block at least partly in response to the determination that the availability evaluation is to be performed a determination is made for a given content item as to whether the content item is still available. For example as similarly discussed elsewhere herein a query may be issued to the hosting site via an API regarding the availability of the content item and the response if any will be received from the hosting system the response indicating whether or not the clip is still available or the host system may provide no response which may indicate that the content item is no longer available .

If the process determines that the content item is available at block the process enables the content to be streamed as scheduled during the first time period.

If the process determines that the content item is no longer available at block the process may identify a substitute content item from a pool of content items or from one or more other sources optionally including a pool of content items stored and maintained by the content scheduling process having one or more specified similar properties e.g. subject length source creator posting date popularity etc. . By way of example a pool of substitute content items or other content may have previously been manually or automatically identified for the specific program e.g. a dedicated program pool . The process may then select the substitute content item or other content from the program pool based at least in part on the similarly to the length in time of the no longer available content item. Optionally in addition to or instead of using a dedicated program pool of substitute backup content items the process may search for and select substitute content items from a broader pool e.g. a pool specific to a given channel or from third party content hosting sites.

As similarly discussed elsewhere herein optionally the process may select substitute content that is longer than the time period of the unavailable content and may truncate or edit out the excess content corresponding to the time that exceeds that of the unavailable content. Optionally if the process selects substitute content that is longer than that of the unavailable content the process may delete other content from the program to compensate e.g. the process may delete previously included promotional advertising content for other programs . Optionally instead the process may select substitute content that is no longer than the time period of the unavailable content. Optionally the currently unavailable content item may be substituted using two or more content items that combined have about the same length as the currently unavailable content item. Optionally rather than using a substitute content item to replace a recorded content item live content or other content type may be specified such as a microblog or social network stream.

At block the process enables the recorded and or live substitute content item s to be streamed to a user terminal in place of the original content item during the first time period.

Referring now to an example process for determining whether supplemental content is needed for a program will be discussed. The process may optionally be performed using the supplemental content identification module discussed above. At block a program definition for a program scheduled at a first time period is accessed. For example the program definition may indicate the content items that are included in the program and the ordering of the content items for display the content items lengths the start time of a given content item relative to the beginning of the program and may include locators for the content items. Some or all of the content items may be hosted by third party hosting sites. For example the content items may include a first content item e.g. a video clip or other content hosted by a third party site server where the first content item has a first time length where the first time length may include time allocated for an advertisement e.g. a 30 second video advertisement as well as for the primary non advertising content. The program definition and the content item time lengths may have been established days weeks months or other time period before the next showing of the program. At block a first span of time is allocated for the first content item hosted by the third party site server where the first span of time is longer than the first time length of the first item.

At block the current length of the first content item is determined. The current length may be the current total content item length e.g. including an advertisement that will be or is currently being served from an advertisement server where the current advertisement may be a different advertisement and have a different time length the previously allocated first time length . For example a rule may be defined that states that the length evaluation is to be performed a specified period of time before the program is scheduled to be presented or a specified period of time before the first content item is next scheduled to be presented e.g. within 1 second within 15 seconds within 30 seconds 1 day or other period of time prior to the next presentation of the first content item . Optionally in addition or instead the rule may specify a specific day and or time at which the length evaluation is to be performed.

The process may examine the first content item e.g. the content item metadata that indicates the advertisement length and or the content item length to determine the current total content item length including the advertisement from the advertisement server . For example the process may optionally use an API to access the content item length without the advertisement from the content hosting system.

At block a determination is made as to whether the current total content item length is shorter than the allocated first span of time for the first content item. If the total content item length is shorter than allocated first span of time for the first content item or for multiple content items in a given program at block the process may identify and select other content to fill out the time e.g. the time the first span of time current total content item length . The fill in supplemental content may be selected based on its length and optionally based on its relevancy to the program and or on other criteria e.g. subject source creator posting date popularity etc. . If the process determines that the content item is shorter than the allocated first span of time the process may identify fill in content which may be in the form of one or more video content items or other content items e.g. still images blogs streams etc. .

Optionally the process may select fill in supplemental content that is longer than the time period that needs to be filled in and will truncate or edit out the excess content corresponding to the time that exceeds the period that needs to be filled in. Optionally if the process selects fill in content that is longer than the time period that needs to be filled in the process may delete other content from the program to compensate e.g. the process may delete previously included promotional advertising content for other programs . The fill in content may correspond to the subject matter of the program may be promotional content for other programs or may be advertisement content for one or more products or services. Optionally the fill in content may be retrieved from a pool of content items maintained by the process or from one or more other sources. By way of example a pool of fill in content items may have been manually or automatically identified for the specific program e.g. a dedicated program pool . The process may then select the fill in content item from the program pool based at least in part on the similarity to the length in time of the content item underrun.

As noted above the length of a given content item e.g. a video clip in a program may vary for a variety of reasons such as a change in the time length of an advertisement e.g. a video advertisement . In the previous example the total content time length for an item of content e.g. including an item of primary content and an advertisement decreased from when the item of content was originally scheduled as part of a program. However it is also possible that total content time length for an item of content e.g. including an item of primary content and an advertisement may increase from when the item of content was originally scheduled as part of a program. This increase in time may also be caused by content buffering delays on a user s terminal or elsewhere. Buffering delays may be reported to the system by the content player which may be a third party content player utilized by the unified content player executing on the user terminal and or the system may infer a delay from playback status information from the content player. For example the content player may report the current position in time and or by frame of the playback of content and the system may compare the report current position to the scheduled position to determine if there is a playback delay on the user terminal.

Thus for example if a program was scheduled to run for 30 minutes but at the scheduled viewing time the total content time length of an item of content included in the program is 30 seconds longer than originally scheduled of if there was a 30 second buffering delay the total time for the program will now be 30 minutes and 30 seconds. In order to deal with this technical challenge an example technique is to truncate the end of the program e.g. the last 30 seconds to ensure the next program begins as scheduled. However this may provide an unpleasant user viewing experience as a key portion of the program may be cut off.

Another technique sometimes referred to herein as a time shift adjustment process that may optionally be used is to enable a first program to be shown to the user without truncation even if the first program overruns its scheduled time as scheduled in the electronic program guide and to delay the playback of the next adjacent program so that the next adjacent program does not start until 30 seconds or other delay period after its scheduled start time. For example the delay may be determined by calculating the time difference between an amount of time originally allocated for a given item of content and the actual play time. Optionally the electronic program guide may be dynamically adjusted to reflect the extended time of the first program and or the delayed start and or end of the next program and optionally of still additional subsequent programs . Optionally the electronic program guide is not adjusted to reflect the extended time of the first program and or the delayed start and or end of the next program. As discussed herein the various items of content included in a program may optionally be streamed to the user terminal from various content sources for playback via a content player.

Optionally in the situation where the user may experience a time shift e.g. as a result of an advertisement that ran longer than its allocated time or as a result of buffering delays the time shift adjustment process may choose to not play or inhibit playing of one or more upcoming advertisements in order to allow the program or channel being viewed by the user to catch up to the originally scheduled live non time shifted timeline.

The foregoing technique may be dynamically performed on a viewer by viewer basis. Thus if a first user is viewing the first program with the extended time then the next adjacent program start time may be delayed as discussed above. However if a second user is not viewing the first program or had been viewing the first program but without delays such as might be caused by buffering on the first user terminal but then begins viewing the next adjacent program e.g. by selecting the next adjacent program via the electronic program guide the next adjacent program will begin playing to the second user via a content player at the originally scheduled time.

Thus two different users watching the same time scheduled program may actually view them with a time shift comprising a relative time skew e.g. 30 seconds apart in this example where the relative time skew may be based on changes in program length of one or more programs being viewed by one user that are not being viewed by another user or an a playback delay e.g. a buffering delay that might affect one user but not another user. Further optionally the electronic program guide of the first user is dynamically adjusted to take into account the extended length of the first program while the electronic program guide of the second user is not dynamically adjusted.

As similarly discussed above changes in time length of a given item of content may be determined from metadata accessed via an API from the content source. Optionally content buffering or other data may be accessed from a user terminal to determine if a display of a given item of content is being delayed as a result of buffering or other delays.

Referring now to an example process for dynamically generating a customized program guide is discussed. The process may optionally be performed using the program guide generation module discussed above. At block explicitly provided user preferences are accessed. For example explicitly provided user preferences may be accessed from user account information which stores genre program subject matter content and or channel likes and or dislikes user specifications of channels to be blocked user reminder instructions user bookmarks etc. previously provided by the user.

At block user viewing behavior e.g. how long a user watches content per day or week how many times in a specified time period the user changes channels how often per specified time period the user tries a new channel or show a channel or show the user has not previously viewed etc. and viewing history may be accessed. At block inferred user preferences may be determined or accessed. For example a user s likes and or dislikes may be inferred from the user s viewing history user navigation and viewing behavior etc. By way of illustration it may be inferred that the user s most viewed channels in a specified past time period e.g. the last 30 days are the user s most preferred channels. On the other hand if a user frequently switches to a specific channel for short periods of time e.g. a sports news channel the process may infer that even though the user does not spend long period of time viewing the channel the channel is still a strongly preferred channel.

At block a personalized dynamically generated program guide is generated based at least in part on the explicitly provided user preferences and or the inferred user preferences. For example the explicitly provided user preferences and or the inferred user preferences may be used in determining the ordering of channels in the electronic program guide e.g. which channels are presented first second third etc. which if any channels are to excluded from the program guide e.g. channels that the system determines are of low interest to the user which channels are to be highlighted e.g. via color animation pop up interfaces or otherwise etc. what types of information are to be included in the program guide etc. The personalized dynamically generated program guide may then be provided for display to a user terminal.

Referring now to an example process for automatically assembling a program from multiple content items will be discussed. The process may optionally be performed using the automatic program generation module discussed above. At block a user interface is provided via which a programmer where the programmer programs shows and may be unfamiliar with software programming languages can specify criteria and rules for selecting content items for a program. For example the user interface may enable a programmer to specify a name for the program keywords associated with the subject matter of the program a program length a maximum content item length a minimum content item length the desired content type e.g. recorded video clips still images social media postings blog streams etc. content sources e.g. content hosting sites content item popularity thresholds content item author popularity thresholds social influence ratings e.g. scores or rankings etc.

At block the process identifies content that satisfies the specified criteria and ensures that the total length of the assembled of the content items optionally including advertising does not exceed the specified program length by keeping a running total of the item content being added to the program. For example the process may access via various content hosting APIs associated metadata to determine if the criteria are met before selecting a given content item to be included in the program. For example as part of the process of determining if a given item of content matches keywords included in the criteria the process may compare keywords specified by the programmer to tags associated with the item content to determine if there is a match.

At block the process assembles the program including the selected content items and programs the content items to appear in a specified order. The program may then optionally be included in a program guide and users may access and view the program via their user terminals.

Referring now to an example process for dynamically generating a program or channel is described. The process may optionally be performed using the automatic program generation module discussed above. The process may be performed in substantially real time. The generated content may include non scheduled content and or content not specifically selected by the user e.g. where the program or channel is not simply a playlist defined by the user . At block the process detects a user activation of a dynamic program generation control sometimes referred to herein as a randomizer control presented via a user interface of a user terminal.

At block the process accesses from memory dynamic program generation randomizer rules. For example the randomizer rules may include one or more of the following do not include more than a specified number of content items from the same author do not include more than a specified number of content items from the same source do not include content items longer than a first specified length do not include content items shorter than a second specified length the dynamically generated program shall be a first specified length only include content meeting a specified popularity threshold only include content from authors meeting a specified popularity threshold only include content from authors meeting a specified social influence rating threshold etc.

At block the process accesses user account information e.g. explicitly provided user preferences e.g. including likes and or dislikes inferred user preferences e.g. including likes and or dislikes user specifications of channels to be blocked user reminder instructions user bookmarks user viewing history user navigation and viewing behavior etc. . The process selects one or more content items based at least in part on the user account information and or the dynamic program generation rules. At block the process dynamically generates a program using the selected content and causes the content to be streamed to the user terminal.

Referring now to an example process for fast forwarding or rewinding through a programmed composed of content items from multiple content sources e.g. video hosting sites etc. is described. The process may optionally be performed using the unified player module discussed above.

At block a program comprised of multiple items of content from multiple sources e.g. from a plurality of content hosting servers operated by different entities is being streamed to a user terminal. For example the program may include a first content item from a first source and a second content item from a second source. The user issues a content navigation instruction by activating a content navigation control such as a fast forward control or a rewind control. At block a determination is made as to whether execution of the navigation instruction will cause a content boundary will be traversed. For example the process may determine whether a fast forward operation began while the first content item is being streamed from a first source will exceed the length of the first content item. If the fast forward operation began while the first content item is being streamed from a first source will exceed the length of the first content item then at block the fast forward process proceeds through the first content item from the first source e.g. with selected frames from the first content item being presented during the fast forward process and at block the fast forward process proceeds through at least a portion of the second content item from the second source e.g. with selected frames from the second content item being presented during the fast forward process .
