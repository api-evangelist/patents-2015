title: Modular device payment system
abstract: A modular device payment module includes a chassis. A modular device connector is located on the chassis. A payment module database in the chassis stores funding source information and security information. A payment module engine in the chassis determines that the modular device connector has been connected to a modular device frame of a modular device, and retrieves modular device identifying information from the modular device. The payment module then determines that the modular device identifying information matches an authorized modular device identified by the security information in the payment module database and, in response, enables the transmission of at least some of the funding source information from the payment module database to conduct a payment transaction.

This is a Continuation application to U.S. Utility application Ser. No. 14 555 144 filed Nov. 26 2014 entitled MODULAR DEVICE PAYMENT SYSTEM the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure generally relates to online and or mobile payments and more particularly to a modular device payment system.

More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks such as for example the Internet. Consumers routinely purchase products and services from merchants and individuals alike. The transactions may take place directly between a conventional or on line merchant or retailer and the consumer and payment is typically made by entering credit card or other financial information. Transactions may also take place with the aid of an on line or mobile payment service provider such as for example PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. Such payment service providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties involved. Purchasing with the assistance of a payment service provider from the convenience of virtually anywhere using a mobile device is one main reason why on line and mobile purchases are growing very quickly.

The use of phones and other user devices for making online and or mobile payments is growing rapidly as traditional payment devices such as cash and credit cards are being replaced by wireless payment systems that allow the user to use their phone or other user device to transmit payment information to a merchant device of a merchant in order to complete a purchase.

Traditionally phones have been provided by manufacturers to users as an integrated device that must be entirely replaced when one or more components fail or become obsolete. However recently the concept of a modular phone has been proposed which provides a modular phone frame to which different modular components of the phone may be attached e.g. a screen module a battery module a storage module a camera module a speaker module etc. The use of modular components along with the provision of a modular component ecosystem that allows for phone manufacturers and third party suppliers to provide users with modular components allows a user to replace modular components rather than the entire phone when one of the modular components on the phone fails or becomes obsolete.

The concept of the modular phone provides for several advantages in online and or mobile payments via phones and or other user devices that are described in detail below.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

The present disclosure provides modular device payment systems and methods for making payments using modular device payment modules that are configured to connect to a modular device frame of a modular device such as for example a modular phone. The payment module may provide a self contained payment device that stores information about one or more funding sources that may include one or more communication systems and that provides a payment module engine that is configured to conduct payment transactions using the funding source information and the communication system s . The payment module may store security information that ensures that the payment module cannot be used with unauthorized modular devices and upon connection to a module device frame the payment module may retrieve modular device identifying information from that modular device determine whether it matches an authorized modular device identified by the security information and if so enable the transmission of the funding source information for conducting a payment transaction. If the modular device identifying information retrieved from the modular device does not match an authorized modular device identified by the security information the payment module may take steps such as disabling the transmission of the funding source information locking the payment module and even erasing the funding source information and or other information from the payment module. In addition the payment module may include additional integrated or attachable features such as for example a biometric input device a card reader a card information provisioning member and or other payment and security features. In specific embodiments the payment module may provide a highly secure multiple virtual currency wallet management system that utilizes a virtual machine and physical or virtual cards that each store a respective virtual currency wallet and that operate to present multiple layers of authentication to protect virtual currencies that are accessible on the payment module.

As illustrated in each of the modules may be connected to the modular device frame to provide the modular device and as discussed above users may replace failed modules add different modules and upgrade modules depending on the user s desired functionality of the modular device . For example if a storage module is running out of space the user may upgrade the current storage module with a higher capacity storage module and connect it to the modular device frame . Furthermore as discussed below a payment module may be provided that connects to the modular device frame and that may be configured to conduct payment transactions either by itself e.g. without the need to communicate with other modules connected to the modular device frame or with the assistance of and or utilizing communication with other modules connected to the modular device frame . While a specific modular device has been illustrated and described one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that a wide variety of different types of modular devices having different form factors different modular device frames different module connection methods and or other different modular device characteristics will benefit from the teachings of the present disclosure and thus will fall within its scope.

Referring now to an embodiment of a payment module is illustrated. The payment module includes a chassis having a front surface a rear surface located opposite the chassis from the front surface a top surface extending between the front surface and the rear surface a bottom surface extending between the front surface and the rear surface and located opposite the chassis from the top surface and a pair of opposing side surfaces and extending between the front surface the rear surface the top surface and the bottom surface and located opposite the chassis from each other. A plurality of modular device connectors extend from the rear surface and are coupled to components housed in and or provided by the payment module discussed in further detail below. In the illustrated embodiment a plurality of sub module connections are included on the payment module and are coupled to components housed in and or provided by the payment module . As discussed below in some embodiments sub modules may be coupled to the payment module through the sub module connections while in other embodiments the sub module functionality discussed below may be integrated as part of the payment module .

Referring now to an embodiment of a payment module is illustrated that may be the payment module discussed above with reference to . As such the components included in and or provided by the payment module discussed below may be housed in the chassis of the payment module . The payment module may include a hardware processing system not illustrated and a non transitory computer readable medium or memory system that includes instructions that when executed by the hardware processing system cause the hardware processing system to configure a payment module engine that performs the functionality of the payment module engines and payment modules taught herein. The payment module may also include one or more physical interfaces e.g. the modular device connectors and or the sub module connections that are coupled to the payment module engine through for example a bus or other connection between the hardware processing system and the one or more physical interfaces . The payment module may also include one or more wireless communication systems such as for example a Wi Fi communication system a Bluetooth communication system or Bluetooth Low Energy BLE communication system a Near Field Communication NFC system a beacon communication system and or a variety of other wireless communications systems known in the art that are coupled to the payment module engine through for example a bus or other connection between the hardware processing system and the wireless communication system . The payment module also includes a payment module database that stores funding source information and security information discussed in further detail below and that is coupled to the payment module engine through for example a bus or other connection between the hardware processing system and a storage system that provides the payment module database .

While each of the components of the payment module are illustrated as included in the payment module in some embodiments at least some of the components of payment module may be coupled to the payment module engine through the one or more physical interfaces and the modular device frame . For example in some embodiments the wireless communication system may be included in the Wi Fi communication module and coupled to the payment module engine through the one or more physical interfaces and the modular device frame . As such one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that other components utilized by the payment module engine as discussed below may be similarly provided as modules included on the modular device .

In some embodiments the payment module may be utilized in conjunction with a payment service provider such as for example PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. For example a payment service provider may utilize a payment service provider device to provide payment services to a user of the payment module. As in known in the art of payment services one or more account providers utilizing account provider devices may provide funding source accounts such as checking accounts savings accounts credit accounts and or other payment accounts to the user. The user may then provide funding source information associated with those accounts provided by the account providers to the payment service provider via the payment service provider device and then use a payment service provider account to make payments that may be drawn from one or more of those funding sources. In addition the payment service provider may provide payment accounts to the user as well for making payments.

In some embodiments the funding source information stored in the payment module database may be provided by a user and may include any funding sources associated with a user and provided by the account providers and or payment service providers discussed above. For example a user may connect the payment module to the modular device frame of the modular device provide a username and password or other authentication information that may be verified by the payment module using the security information in the payment module database to authorize the payment module to conduct payment transactions when connected to the modular device and provide information about checking account funding sources e.g. checking account numbers etc. savings account funding sources e.g. savings account numbers etc. credit account funding sources e.g. credit account numbers expiration dates security codes etc. and or a variety of funding sources known in the art for authentication and storage in the payment module database . As such when provisioned with funding source information the payment module may be considered an electronic wallet that stores information about any funding source that the user may wish to use with a merchant. Furthermore the user may add and or remove funding sources as desired to the payment module.

However in some embodiments the payment module may be funding source specific such that it is only associated with a single funding source. For example a credit account provider may provide the user with a credit account payment module that includes only funding source information associated with their credit account e.g. a credit account number expiration date security code etc. and the user may provide authentication information substantially as described above to authorize that credit account payment module for use in conducting payment transactions when connected to the modular device frame of the modular device . Similarly the payment module may be solely a virtual currency wallet manager as discussed below. As such the user may possess multiple funding source specific payment modules that may be connected to the modular device frame depending on which funding source the user would like to use to conduct a payment transaction.

Referring now an embodiment of a payment module is illustrated that is substantially similar to the payment modules and or discussed above with reference to and but with the provision of a biometric input system . The biometric input system may be housed in and or located on the chassis and coupled to the payment module engine through a bus or other connection between the hardware processing system and the biometric input system . In the illustrated embodiment the biometric input system is a thumbprint or fingerprint reader but in other embodiments may include eye scanners a facial capture and recognition system and or a variety of other biometric input systems known in the art. The payment module illustrated in provides an example of the payment module with an integrated sub module i.e. a biometric input system sub module but in other embodiments the biometric input system sub module may be coupled to the payment module via the sub module connectors . As discussed below the biometric input system allows for the user to authenticate with the payment module to conduct payment transactions. As such the user may register a biometric input with the payment module upon initial connection to a modular device by providing authentication information and then allowing the biometric input system to receive and store a biometric input as part of the security information in the payment module database .

Referring now an embodiment of a payment module is illustrated that is substantially similar to the payment modules and or discussed above with reference to and but with the provision of a card sub module that includes a card information provisioning member that extends from the card sub module and that includes an information transfer element . In the illustrated embodiment the card sub module is a separate sub module that includes sub module connectors not illustrated that engage the sub module connections on the payment module to couple the card sub module to the payment module engine through a bus or other connection between the hardware processing system and the sub module connections but in other embodiments the card sub module may be integrated with the payment module . The card sub module provides the card information provisioning member with the information transfer element configured to transfer funding source information to a card reader device. In some embodiments the information transfer element may be a conventional magnetic stripe information transfer element that is configured to provide card information to a card reader device. In other embodiments the payment module engine may be configured to dynamically program push or otherwise provide card information to the information transfer element such that that card information may be transferred from the information transfer element to a card reader when the card information provisioning member is moved through the card reader i.e. the user may select from different funding source information in the payment module database to have card information associated with a selected funding source be provided to the information transfer element to for example provide a particular credit card number for a selected credit card account to the card reader using the card information provision member . The payment module illustrated in provides an example of a sub module coupled to the payment module via the sub module connectors . However as discussed above the functionality of the card sub module may be integrated i.e. without the ability to attached and detach the card sub module from the payment module chassis with the payment module while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure.

Referring now an embodiment of a payment module is illustrated that is substantially similar to the payment modules and or discussed above with reference to and but with the provision of a card reader sub module that includes a card reader channel that is defined by the card reader sub module and that includes an card reader element not illustrated but located in the card reader channel as would be understood by one of skill in the art . In the illustrated embodiment the card reader sub module is a separate sub module that includes sub module connectors not illustrated that engage the sub module connections on the payment module to couple the card reader sub module to the payment module engine through a bus or other connection between the hardware processing system and the sub module connections but in other embodiments the card reader sub module may be integrated with the payment module . In the illustrated embodiment the payment module engine is configured to receive card information from a card when a magnetic stripe or other information transfer element is moved through the card reader channel and past the card reader element. As such the payment module may be utilized by a merchant for accepting payments in a payment transaction rather than a customer providing payment in a payment transaction.

Referring now to an embodiment of a payment module is illustrated that is substantially similar to the payment modules and or discussed above with reference to and but with the provision of a highly secure multiple virtual currency wallet management system. The payment module includes the payment module engine that is coupled to a hypervisor that may be provided by instructions on the non transitory memory system that when executed by the hardware processing system cause the hardware processing system to perform the functionality of the hypervisor and its subcomponents discussed below. One of those subcomponents includes a virtual machine that is configured to be communicatively coupled to or to otherwise access a plurality of cards discussed below that may include for example secure digital SD cards and or other storage cards known in the art. In an embodiment the virtual machine may be provided by a hardware processing system that is provided in the payment module and that is dedicated to providing the virtual machine e.g. that is separate from the hardware processing system that provides the payment module engine or may be provided by a virtualized processing module that is dedicated to providing the virtual machine . In the illustrated embodiment the cards are virtual cards and up to but in some embodiments the cards and may be physical cards that are coupled to the payment module .

Each of the virtual cards includes a different virtual currency wallet by for example including a virtual currency wallet application that stores one or more private keys that provide the ability to transfer virtual currency associated with one or more public addresses as is known in the art of virtual currency. For example each virtual card may include a TrueCrypt or similar linked folder that stores the virtual currency wallet application on that virtual card. As such virtual card includes a first virtual currency wallet virtual card includes a second virtual currency wallet and virtual card includes an Nth virtual currency wallet . In some embodiments each of the virtual currency wallets and may be associated with different types of virtual currency e.g. virtual currency wallet may provide access to Bitcoin virtual currency wallet may provide access to Litecoin virtual currency wallet may provide access to Dogecoin etc. . In other embodiments at least some of the virtual currency wallets and may be associated with the same type of virtual currency e.g. the first virtual currency wallet may store one or more first private keys that provide the ability to transfer virtual currency e.g. Bitcoin associated with one or more first public addresses and the second virtual currency wallet may store one or more second private keys that provide the ability to transfer the same type of virtual currency e.g. Bitcoin associated with one or more second public addresses that are different from the one or more first public addresses .

The highly secure multiple virtual currency wallet manager provided by the payment module provides the ability to manage and store multiple virtual currency wallets of the same and or different types of virtual currency while presenting three security layers to a user attempting to access a virtual currency wallet to transfer virtual currency to another user. As discussed in further detail below a user wishing to access any of the first virtual currency wallet the second virtual currency wallet or the Nth virtual currency wallet must provide a first authentication to the virtual machine then must provide a second authentication to the virtual card that stores the virtual currency wallet the user wishes to access and must then provide a third authentication to the virtual currency wallet the user wishes to access. In addition the virtual or physical cards may be cloned backed up or otherwise copied to a separate storage system e.g. a physical storage device the cloud etc. to ensure that failure theft loss or other unavailability of the payment module does not threaten access to the virtual currency on any of those virtual cards.

Referring now to an embodiment of a method for conducting a payment transaction with a modular device payment module is illustrated. The method begins at block where the payment module is connected to the modular device. As discussed above the payment module may be connected to the modular device frame of the modular device by positioning the modular device connectors on the payment module adjacent the module connections on the modular device frame and moving the payment module towards the modular device frame to engage the modular device connectors and the module connections . Engagement of the modular device connectors and the module connections physically couples the payment module to the modular device frame and permits communication by the payment module engine with the modular device frame and other modules that are connected to the modular device frame .

The method then proceeds to block where modular device identifying information is retrieved. Prior to the method the user may have defined identified or otherwise provided information about one or more authorized modular devices as part of the security information in the payment module database . In an embodiment a device identifier phone number unique code user information identifying information that includes identifiers that are associated with each of the modules that are connected to the modular device frame and or other information that uniquely identifies a modular device of the user may be provided to the payment module for storage in the payment module database as part of the security information . For example upon connecting the payment module to a modular device frame as discussed above and determining that the modular device is not authorized discussed below the payment module may provide the user with the ability to authorize that modular device for the payment module by requesting user authorization credentials e.g. a user identifier and passcode a biometric identifier etc. . If those user authorization credentials are verified with credentials included in the security information the payment module may then retrieve the identifying information from the modular device and associate it with an authorized modular device in the security information . In addition additional security may be provided for the payment module by sending authorized modular device information to a provider of the payment module e.g. a payment service provider and having the authorized modular device information stored in the security information prior to providing the payment module to the user.

In an embodiment the payment module engine operates at block to communicate with at least one of a component in the modular device frame and or another module that is connected to the modular device frame to retrieve identifying information from the modular device . For example identifying information about the modular device may be stored in the modular device frame e.g. in a storage device included in the modular device frame in the security module coupled to the modular device frame and or in other modules that are coupled to the modular device frame . The identifying information retrieved by the payment module engine may include the device identifier phone number unique code user information and or other information that was used to uniquely identify the modular device . In some examples the identifying information may include identifiers that are associated with each of the modules that are connected to the modular device frame .

The method then proceeds to decision block where it is determined whether the modular device is authenticated for the payment module. In an embodiment the payment module engine compares the identifying information retrieved from the modular device at block with the security information in the payment module database to determine whether the identifying information matches an authorized modular device identified by the security information . As such the payment module engine may determine at decision block that the device identifier phone number unique code user information or other information that uniquely identifies the modular device matches device identifiers phone numbers unique codes user information or other information that uniquely one or more modular devices in the security information of the payment module database . In a specific embodiment the security information may include a plurality of identifiers for modules that define an authorized modular device and at decision block the payment module engine may determine whether some subset of identifiers retrieved from each of the modules that are connected to the modular device frame match some subset of the plurality of identifiers for modules that define an authorized modular device . As such the identifiers for modules connected to the modular device frame that are retrieved at block may not all need to match all of the identifiers for modules that define an authorized modular device as long as some minimum subset matches which allows for authentication of the modular device for the payment module even if some of the modules on an authorized modular device are replaced.

If at decision block it is determined that the modular device is not authenticated for the payment module the method proceeds to block where a security action is performed. In an embodiment the payment module may determine at decision block that the modular device to which the payment module was connected at block is not authenticated for the payment module e.g. its identifying information is not associated with an authenticated modular device in the security information and in response may perform a security action at block . Security actions may include preventing the transmission of any of the funding source information in the payment modular database for use in conducting a payment transaction locking the payment module such that further communication through the modular device frame is disabled and or to prevent a payment transaction from being conducted erasing the funding source information in the payment module database wiping all information stored on non transitory computer readable mediums in the payment module and or performing a variety of other security actions known in the art that would prevent any sensitive information on the payment module from being accessed.

If at decision block it is determined that the modular device is authenticated for the payment module the transmission of the funding source information from the payment module database is enabled. In an embodiment the payment module engine may enable allow and or otherwise facilitate the transmission of funding source information from the payment module database in order to conduct a payment transaction discussed in further detail below. Thus a user of the payment module may authorize any number of modular devices for use with the payment module and then use the payment module with any of those modular devices while ensuring via blocks that loss or theft of the payment module will not allow its use with a non authorized modular device.

The method may then proceed to optional decision block and block where it is then determined whether a request to access a virtual currency wallet is received. Optional decision block and block illustrate a situation where the payment module provides a virtual currency wallet manager that regulates access to multiple virtual currency wallets. However in some embodiments the payment module may not include the virtual currency wallet manager taught herein and following a determination at decision block that the modular device is authorized for the payment module the method may proceed directly to block . However when the payment module include the virtual currency wallet manager a request to access a virtual currency wallet included on the payment module may initiate additional security layers in the payment module . However if at decision block it is determined that no request to access a virtual currency wallet has been received the method proceeds to block where a payment transaction is conducted.

In an embodiment at block the payment module engine may receive a request to conduct a payment transaction and in response retrieve at least some of the funding source information to conduct the payment transaction. As discussed above prior to the method the payment module may provide the user to ability to add funding sources to the payment module database that are then stored in the funding source information . For example the user may add checking funding source s to the funding source information e.g. by providing checking account information needed to conduct a payment transaction using checking s account of the user savings funding source s to the funding source information e.g. by providing savings account information needed to conduct a payment transaction using savings account s of the user credit funding source s to the funding source information e.g. by providing credit account information needed to conduct a payment transaction using credit account s of the user and or any other funding sources known in the art to the funding source information.

Requests to conduct a payment transaction may be received in a variety of manners and will typically result in a payment transaction conducted with a merchant through a merchant device but will sometime result in a payment transaction conducted with another user through their user device. In an embodiment the payment module may use the wireless communication system to receive a request to conduct a payment transaction. For example the user of the modular device may bring the modular device and payment module within range of an NFC or other wireless payment system in order provide a request to the payment module to conduct a payment transaction and the payment module may then communicate with the payment system to transmit funding source information to the payment system in order to conduct the payment transaction e.g. via the wireless communication system s in the payment module using a communication module connected to the modular device frame etc. . In such embodiments a payment application may be provided for display on the display module to the user to allow the user to select a funding source for conducting the payment transaction or the payment module may default to a particular funding source.

In another embodiment the payment module may communicate with another payment module i.e. on another modular device to receive a request to conduct a payment transaction. For example the user of the modular device may bring the modular device within range or into engagement with another modular device e.g. via a bump or other touching of the modular devices in order provide a request to the payment module to conduct a payment transaction and the payment module may then communicate with the payment module in the other modular device to transmit funding source information to the payment system in order to conduct the payment transaction. In such embodiments a payment application may be provided for display on the display module to the user to allow the user to select a funding source for conducting the payment transaction or the payment module may default to a particular funding source.

In another embodiment the user may utilize a payment application provided for display on the display module to select a funding source for conducting the payment transaction and the payment module may provide funding source information for that funding source to the card sub module for transmission using the information transfer element on the card information provisioning member . As such the user may select one of a plurality of credit cards checking cards rewards cards discount cards gift cards or other cards to have information for the selected card provided on the information transfer element such that when the user moves the card information provisioning member through a card reader the information for the selected card is provided to the card reader for conducting the payment transaction.

While a few examples have been provided one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that the payment module may retrieve funding source information from the payment module database and conduct the payment transaction at block using any of a variety of methods known in the art that will fall within the scope of the present disclosure. In addition other payment activities may be performed by the payment module engine in the payment module including bill splitting e.g. by touching payment modules on different modular devices etc. account information retrieval and review and or other payment activities known in the art.

If at decision block a request to access a virtual currency wallet is received the method then proceeds to block where a plurality of security layers are authenticated. Referring now to an example of receiving a request to access a virtual currency wallet and in response authenticating a plurality of security layers is illustrated and described. However a variety of manners for receiving requests to access virtual currency wallets and authenticate security layers other than those illustrated are envisioned as falling within the scope of the present disclosure.

Referring now to a modular device is illustrated that may be the modular device discussed above with reference to . However in some embodiments the functionality described as performed by the payment module engine in the payment module coupled to the modular device may instead be performed by a payment engine located in an integrated user device such as a non modular phone or other user device. The modular device includes a display module that may be for example the display module discussed above. In the illustrated embodiment the display module is displaying a home screen that includes a plurality of application icons including a virtual currency wallet management application icon . In embodiment the user of the modular device may select the virtual currency wallet management application icon and at decision block the payment module engine will detect a request to access a virtual currency wallet. In other embodiments rather than having a virtual currency wallet manager the home screen may instead include virtual currency wallet application icons that when selected by the user cause the payment module engine to detect a request to access a virtual currency wallet at decision block .

Referring now to and with reference to the modular device is illustrated with the display module displaying a first security layer screen that may be provided by the virtual machine and the payment module engine at block of the method . For example in response to the user selecting the virtual currency wallet management application icon or a virtual currency wallet application icon the payment module engine may communicate with the virtual machine to access the virtual currency wallets included in the virtual cards and accessible by the virtual machine and the virtual machine may present a first security layer using the first security layer screen . The first security layer screen includes a first authentication request section that provides a user identifier input and a password input and that requests that the user provide a username and password to access the virtual currency wallets. In order to access the virtual currency wallets the user must provide the correct username and password to pass the first security layer presented by the virtual machine and the payment module engine and or the virtual machine may receive any username and password provided in the user identifier input and a password input compare it to the security information in the payment module database and authenticate the user for the first security layer in response to determining that a provided username and password are associated with a user that is authorized to access the virtual currency wallets. While a username and password are illustrated as necessary for authenticating at the first security layer any authentication technique is envisioned as falling within the scope of the present disclosure.

Referring now to in response to determining that a provided username and password are associated with a user that is authorized to access the virtual currency wallets the display module on the modular device may display a virtual currency wallet application icon screen that includes a plurality of virtual currency wallet application icons and . In the illustrated embodiment the virtual currency wallet application icons and are associated with different virtual currency wallets holding different types of virtual currency e.g. a Bitcoin wallet a Litecoin wallet and a Dogecoin wallet . However any number of virtual currency wallets may be included in the virtual machine and may be hold different types of virtual currency or the same types of virtual currency e.g. there may be multiple virtual currency application icons on the virtual currency wallet application icon screen that hold Bitcoins . In response to being presented the virtual currency wallet application icon screen the user may select the virtual currency wallet application icon for the virtual currency wallet that the user wishes to access in order to for example conduct a payment transaction.

Referring now to and with reference to the modular device is illustrated with the display module displaying a second security layer screen that may be provided by one of the virtual cards or and the payment module engine at block of the method . For example in response to the user selecting the virtual currency wallet application icon i.e. the Bitcoin wallet in the payment module engine may communicate with the virtual card e.g. via the virtual machine to access the first virtual currency wallet included in the virtual card and the virtual card may present a second security layer using the second security layer screen . The second security layer screen includes a second authentication request section that provides a plurality of pattern elements and that requests that the user use the pattern elements in order to access the first virtual currency wallet . In order to access the first virtual currency wallet the user must draw a pattern by connecting the pattern elements to pass the second security layer presented by the virtual card and the payment module engine and or the virtual card may receive any pattern provided using the pattern elements compare it to the security information in the payment module database and authenticate the user for the second security layer in response to determining that a provided pattern associated with a user that is authorized to access the first virtual currency wallet . While a pattern using pattern elements is illustrated as necessary for authenticating at the second security layer any authentication technique is envisioned as falling within the scope of the present disclosure.

Referring now to in response to determining that a provided pattern is associated with a user that is authorized to access the first virtual currency wallet the display module on the modular device may display a third security layer screen that may be provided by the first virtual wallet application and the payment module engine at block of the method . For example in response to the user providing an authenticated pattern the payment module engine may communicate with the first virtual wallet application e.g. via the virtual machine and the virtual card to access the first virtual currency wallet included in the virtual card and the first virtual currency wallet may present a third security layer that includes a third authentication request section that provides a request that the user provide a biometric input in order to access the first virtual currency wallet . In order to access the first virtual currency wallet the user must provide a biometric input to a biometric input system e.g. a thumb scan on the biometric input system discussed above to pass the third security layer presented by the first virtual currency wallet and the payment module engine and or the first virtual currency wallet may receive the biometric input provided compare it to the security information in the payment module database and authenticate the user for the third security layer in response to determining that a biometric input is associated with a user that is authorized to access the first virtual currency wallet . While a biometric input is illustrated as necessary for authenticating at the third security layer any authentication technique is envisioned as falling within the scope of the present disclosure.

Following being authenticated to pass the third security layer the method may proceed to block discussed in detail above. However in addition to being able to conduct conventional payment transactions as discussed above the user may now also be able to conduct payment transaction using the first virtual currency wallet by for example transferring virtual currency to another user by designating a public address of that user designating a virtual currency amount and providing a private key for the first virtual currency wallet such that the first virtual currency wallet may transfer the designated amount of virtual currency to the public address associated with the other user. As discussed above while specific security layers including usernames and passwords pattern provisioning and biometric inputs have been illustrated and described any of authentication techniques may be utilized in authenticating the plurality of authentication levels at block . It has been found that the three or more security layers provide practically insurmountable security for the virtual currency wallets stored on the payment module .
