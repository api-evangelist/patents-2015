Traffic to and from memory is a large power consumer in a computer system. Therefore it is of utmost importance to develop techniques that reduce the memory traffic.

One way to reduce power consumption from memory traffic is to use a cache hierarchy and another is to employ different types of compression of the data that is being transported.

For certain areas of a rendered image the best choice of compression decompression codec is to use a palette based codec. Palette based compression may be based on clustering which makes the actual palette much smaller to store in turn improving compression success rates.

The palette in itself is a large portion of the entire compressed representation in a palette based codec. The palette may be compressed using both a clustered approach and by skip encoding color channels that are constant.

The task at hand is to i collect all individual colors in the tile and store these in a palette and ii assign each sample pixel value an index to this palette. The data collected depicted in involves converting each of the colors in this case these are only three colors identifying each by a code or index 0 1 or 2 in this example and creating a palette which shows which colors 3 of the palette of available colors in this case 4 is actually being used.

At the end of this process the total number of bits needed to store the palette along with the palette indices are counted. Then a check determines whether this number of bits fits in the bit budget of the compressed unit. This check may involve determining whether the proposed compression results in fewer number of cache lines than in raw format. If so compression is achieved.

The palette itself takes fewer bytes to store than the full representation and so this will make the compression success rate higher in some cases. This in turn will reduce memory traffic and will increase energy efficiency in some embodiments.

Given a palette based codec consisting of N colors a palette is stored and then each pixel sample needs k ceil logN index bits to point into the color palette. The colors in the palette are compressed so they take up less space.

For example for an 8 4 pixel tile where each color takes 32 bits RGBA the uncompressed tile uses 32 4 128 bytes. Assume compression to 64 bytes i.e. 512 bits is required. Each pixel needs k bits for the index i.e. 32 k bits in total are needed. Each color in the palette uses 32 bits same as original data in the tile and there are N palette colors. In total this sums to 32 k 32 N which is less than or equal to 512.

In this case this means that k N is less than or equal to 16 and hence it makes sense to use k 4 bits which in theory makes it possible to use at most 2or 16 different colors in the palette. Then there are 512 4 32 or 384 bits left for the color palette and this means that N is 384 32 or 12 colors in the palette.

However one could compress more tiles if one were able to store 16 colors in the palette and by using compression of the colors in the palette this goal can be achieved. Alternatively one can use k 5 bits which gives 512 32 5 32 or 11 colors in the palette. Since there are 5 bits per index one can potentially use a palette with up to 32 colors. However this can only be done if the palette is compressed.

As a first simple technique one bit per color channel is used to indicate whether color is constant in one of the color channels. If a bit is 1 as an example all pixels in the tile have the same value for that channel. For example all red values may be 23. In this case the constant value i.e. 23 is also stored.

As an example using the RGBA color space the alpha A component is often 0 all over the tile or 255 all over the tile. If one color channel is skipped 8 bits are stored for the constant channel since these are 32 bits for RGBA or 8 bits per channel times 4 values. A skip bit is also stored for each of the four channels to indicate whether the channel is skipped. So in total an extra 12 bits are stored in the example of having one constant color and so each color in the palette is now only 24 3 8 bits.

In the case with k 5 bits N equals 512 12 32 5 24 14.167 colors or rounding down 14 colors in the palette compared to 11 colors before.

This compression technique can be called the skip bit technique. More than one channel may be constant. If two channels are constant then the 4 skip bits and then 8 8 bits are stored for the constant channels and so on.

In addition one can store the minimum color value of all colors in the palette and then encode the difference between a color in the palette and this minimum color. These differences can often be encoded done with fewer bits.

However in many cases the palette encoding method beats other encoding methods. These cases often include tiles where there are distinct groups of colors in the palette.

For example assume a very dark gray background with a bit of noise in it and then suddenly two white pixels appear. The difference from the minimum color which would be the darkest gray and the white pixels is huge and all differences would be encoded with as many bits that are needed for the difference between white and the darkest gray pixel. As a result no compression can be obtained. In this case there were only two pixels that destroyed the possibility of compression. However these situations often occur in user interfaces for example and it is advantageous if they are very compressible.

The palette may be compressed using clustering. Clustering involves finding two or more minimum lowest color value colors and then compressing each color in the palette relative to one of these minimum colors. In the example above the minimum dark gray color may be one minimum color and the white color is one minimum color. All dark gray colors called cluster are encoded relative the minimum dark gray color and the two white colors called cluster are encoded relative to the minimum white color.

An example of clustering is shown in for one embodiment using residual bits per sample pixel in addition to the color now cluster indices. In there are only two redish colors cross hatched and double cross hatched and one blue color no hatching using indices 0 for the blue color and 1 for the two redish colors . The residual bits encode the difference of one of the two redish color values from the minimum color value. The palette in this example only has two colors with one of the variant red colors indicated via residual bits.

There are several ways to find clusters. Assume that one wants to find only two clusters. In this case two colors that can act as means are found. The better these guesses are for the means the faster the method will converge.

The means can be found in one embodiment by finding a minimal bounding box around the color in the space of the remaining color channels e.g. RGB or RGBA or RGA if B is constant and thus skipped . Next assume that the minimal bounding box is split in the middle in each color dimension and this results in a number of sub boxes. Next the colors that are closest to each corner of this minimal bounding box are found. Two of these corner colors are picked each having the most colors in its sub box. These colors are the two means to initialize a k means clustering algorithm.

Next apply one or more steps of k means clustering. The first step is simply to associate each color with the means that it is closest to in RGB space for example . When this has been done each color in the palette has been assigned to one means which is a color from the palette . The second step updates each means as the average of all the colors assigned to that cluster. Then one may do steps one and two a few more times if needed.

Yet another variant is more iterative. The idea is to take one color from the palette and build a cluster around that color as long as the added colors are sufficiently close. If a color is encountered that is too far away from the current cluster then a new cluster color is allocated. Continue with the rest of the colors and attempt to merge them into either of the current two clusters. Then a third cluster can be added etc. To enable this one bit per sample pixel is used to signal if residual bits are stored or not.

Thus referring to a sequence may be implemented in software firmware and or hardware. In software and firmware embodiments it may be implemented by computer executed instructions stored in one or more non transitory computer readable media such as magnetic optical or semiconductor storage.

The sequence begins by looping over all samples or pixels in a tile as indicated in block . Then the difference between a given color and colors already in the palette is checked as indicated in block . If the difference is small because it is less than a threshold as determined in diamond then store residual bits and mark the sample as indicated in block . The residual bits are indicated at .

On the other hand if the difference is not small a check at diamond determines whether the color is already in the palette. If not the color is stored in the palette as indicated in block . Then the palette is updated as indicated at and the flow iterates back to block .

If the color is already in the palette as determined in diamond the palette entry identifier ID is recorded as indicated in block . Then the sample or pixel is provided in the palette entry list as indicated at .

A check at diamond determines whether there are any samples or pixels left. If so the flow iterates back to block and otherwise the flow ends.

The selection between storing a new palette entry or residual bits against an existing color is arbitrary. In the general case a gain in number of stored bits can be achieved as long as the number of residual bits per entry plus one bit per sample is lower than a full color in the palette.

Assume that we have a tile with N colors with RGB for example. There is nothing that restricts this technique to any particular color space.

In an example is given that only visualizes the red and green channels R and G . To the left the red R and green G axes are labelled. There are 8 pixel colors here. Green pixels or samples are indicated by open circles and red pixels or samples are indicated by solid circles. In the middle the minimal box around the pixel colors are found. The circle D is at the left bottom corner and so this is the minimum color of these 8 pixel colors. In the middle split the minimal box into four 2 2 cells indicated in dashed lines . To the right the minimal boxes B and B are computed for each cell which created two groups. The dark circles D and D show the minimal colors for these two groups.

In one clustering algorithm simply encode each non empty cell with the minimum color dark circles D and D in and then add some encoding of residuals inside that box. This may be done with standard methods.

This example is in two dimensions but usually there are three RGB or four RGBA dimensions. Since the coding of the minimal color of a group is rather expensive sometimes it makes sense to merge two groups into one. One may also choose to transform the colors into another color space such that YCoGg in order to reduce the volume of each box therefore reducing the number of residual bits.

In an iterative scheme one pair of groups boxes that increases the total volume of the resulting merged groups boxes the least are merged. In RGB space 8 cells are obtained by splitting once per dimension. Each group only has one direct neighbor in x y or z. There are several heuristics to use here including the following examples 

Merging only needs to continue until the target bit threshold is reached or less . There is also the possibility to split more than once per dimension. This creates more cells whose minimal boxes must be merged. Each cell may get more direct neighbors in this case.

After two or more clusters have been generated the minimum color of each cluster is stored. In addition as mentioned above the 4 skip bits may be stored per cluster and if a channel is constant within a cluster then that channel need not encode residuals. In this case 3 size bits are stored per channel to indicate how many residual bits are needed per channel. For example if the maximum difference for the red channel within a cluster is 13 then 4 bits are needed to store such differences and hence then 3 size bits will be set to 4 in this case.

Sequence as shown in for compression using clustering may be implemented in software firmware and or hardware. In software and firmware embodiments it may be implemented by computer executed instructions stored in one or more non transitory computer readable media such as a magnetic optical or semiconductor storage. The sequence may be implemented for example by a graphics processing unit in some cases.

The sequence begins by looping over a tile block . A tile is simply an image portion containing samples or pixels. First any constant color channels are found as indicated in block . Then clusters are found in block coded in block and added to palette . Any clusters that are of constant color may also be skipped but encoded as well. One may also use separate skip bits per cluster which may be useful in some cases. In block the flow loops over all samples or pixels in a tile. A cluster or palette entry is selected in block .

The palette entry identification and residual is encoded as indicated in block . The sample or pixel residual values are stored. The sample or pixel is stored in the palette entry list .

A check at diamond indicates whether there are more samples or pixels left to process and if so the flow iterates back to loop over the tile. Otherwise the flow ends.

With the described difference encoding in each cluster better compression of the palette may be obtained and this will make the succession rate for compression substantially higher and compression hardware for color buffers will succeed more often and as a result the power usage will be reduced in some embodiments.

In some embodiments each execution unit e.g. A is an individual vector processor capable of executing multiple simultaneous threads and processing multiple data elements in parallel for each thread. In some embodiments execution unit array A N includes any number individual execution units.

In some embodiments execution unit array A N is primarily used to execute shader programs. In some embodiments the execution units in array A N execute an instruction set that includes native support for many standard 3D graphics shader instructions such that shader programs from graphics libraries e.g. Direct 3D and OpenGL are executed with a minimal translation. The execution units support vertex and geometry processing e.g. vertex programs geometry programs vertex shaders pixel processing e.g. pixel shaders fragment shaders and general purpose processing e.g. compute and media shaders .

Each execution unit in execution unit array A N operates on arrays of data elements. The number of data elements is the execution size or the number of channels for the instruction. An execution channel is a logical unit of execution for data element access masking and flow control within instructions. The number of channels may be independent of the number of physical Arithmetic Logic Units ALUs or Floating Point Units FPUs for a particular graphics processor. In some embodiments execution units A N support integer and floating point data types.

The execution unit instruction set includes single instruction multiple data SIMD instructions. The various data elements can be stored as a packed data type in a register and the execution unit will process the various elements based on the data size of the elements. For example when operating on a 256 bit wide vector the 256 bits of the vector are stored in a register and the execution unit operates on the vector as four separate 64 bit packed data elements Quad Word QW size data elements eight separate 32 bit packed data elements Double Word DW size data elements sixteen separate 16 bit packed data elements Word W size data elements or thirty two separate 8 bit data elements byte B size data elements .

In some embodiments sampler includes specialized texture or media sampling functionality to process texture or media data during the sampling process before providing the sampled data to an execution unit.

During execution the graphics and media pipelines send thread initiation requests to thread execution logic via thread spawning and dispatch logic. In some embodiments thread execution logic includes a local thread dispatcher that arbitrates thread initiation requests from the graphics and media pipelines and instantiates the requested threads on one or more execution units A N. For example the geometry pipeline e.g. of dispatches vertex processing tessellation or geometry processing threads to thread execution logic . In some embodiments thread dispatcher can also process runtime thread spawning requests from the executing shader programs.

Once a group of geometric objects has been processed and rasterized into pixel data pixel shader is invoked to further compute output information and cause results to be written to output surfaces e.g. color buffers depth buffers stencil buffers etc. . In some embodiments pixel shader calculates the values of the various vertex attributes that are to be interpolated across the rasterized object. In some embodiments pixel shader then executes an application programming interface API supplied pixel shader program. To execute the pixel shader program pixel shader dispatches threads to an execution unit e.g. A via thread dispatcher . In some embodiments pixel shader uses texture sampling logic in sampler to access texture data in texture maps stored in memory. Arithmetic operations on the texture data and the input geometry data compute pixel color data for each geometric fragment or discards one or more pixels from further processing.

In some embodiments the data port provides a memory access mechanism for the thread execution logic output processed data to memory for processing on a graphics processor output pipeline. In some embodiments the data port includes or couples to one or more cache memories e.g. data cache to cache data for memory access via the data port.

In some embodiments the graphics processor execution units natively support instructions in a 128 bit format . A 64 bit compacted instruction format is available for some instructions based on the selected instruction instruction options and number of operands. The native 128 bit format provides access to all instruction options while some options and operations are restricted in the 64 bit format . The native instructions available in the 64 bit format vary by embodiment. In some embodiments the instruction is compacted in part using a set of index values in an index field . The execution unit hardware references a set of compaction tables based on the index values and uses the compaction table outputs to reconstruct a native instruction in the 128 bit format .

For each format instruction opcode defines the operation that the execution unit is to perform. The execution units execute each instruction in parallel across the multiple data elements of each operand. For example in response to an add instruction the execution unit performs a simultaneous add operation across each color channel representing a texture element or picture element. By default the execution unit performs each instruction across all data channels of the operands. In some embodiments instruction control field enables control over certain execution options such as channels selection e.g. predication and data channel order e.g. swizzle . For 128 bit instructions an exec size field limits the number of data channels that will be executed in parallel. In some embodiments exec size field is not available for use in the 64 bit compact instruction format .

Some execution unit instructions have up to three operands including two source operands src src and one destination . In some embodiments the execution units support dual destination instructions where one of the destinations is implied. Data manipulation instructions can have a third source operand e.g. SRC where the instruction opcode determines the number of source operands. An instruction s last source operand can be an immediate e.g. hard coded value passed with the instruction.

In some embodiments the 128 bit instruction format includes an access address mode information specifying for example whether direct register addressing mode or indirect register addressing mode is used. When direct register addressing mode is used the register address of one or more operands is directly provided by bits in the instruction .

In some embodiments the 128 bit instruction format includes an access address mode field which specifies an address mode and or an access mode for the instruction. In one embodiment the access mode to define a data access alignment for the instruction. Some embodiments support access modes including a 16 byte aligned access mode and a 1 byte aligned access mode where the byte alignment of the access mode determines the access alignment of the instruction operands. For example when in a first mode the instruction may use byte aligned addressing for source and destination operands and when in a second mode the instruction may use 16 byte aligned addressing for all source and destination operands.

In one embodiment the address mode portion of the access address mode field determines whether the instruction is to use direct or indirect addressing. When direct register addressing mode is used bits in the instruction directly provide the register address of one or more operands. When indirect register addressing mode is used the register address of one or more operands may be computed based on an address register value and an address immediate field in the instruction.

In some embodiments instructions are grouped based on opcode bit fields to simplify Opcode decode . For an 8 bit opcode bits 4 5 and 6 allow the execution unit to determine the type of opcode. The precise opcode grouping shown is merely an example. In some embodiments a move and logic opcode group includes data movement and logic instructions e.g. move mov compare cmp . In some embodiments move and logic group shares the five most significant bits MSB where move mov instructions are in the form of 0000xxxxb and logic instructions are in the form of 0001xxxxb. A flow control instruction group e.g. call jump jmp includes instructions in the form of 0010xxxxb e.g. 0x20 .

In some embodiments graphics processor includes a graphics pipeline a media pipeline a display engine thread execution logic and a render output pipeline . In some embodiments graphics processor is a graphics processor within a multi core processing system that includes one or more general purpose processing cores. The graphics processor is controlled by register writes to one or more control registers not shown or via commands issued to graphics processor via a ring interconnect . In some embodiments ring interconnect couples graphics processor to other processing components such as other graphics processors or general purpose processors. Commands from ring interconnect are interpreted by a command streamer which supplies instructions to individual components of graphics pipeline or media pipeline .

In some embodiments command streamer directs the operation of a vertex fetcher that reads vertex data from memory and executes vertex processing commands provided by command streamer . In some embodiments vertex fetcher provides vertex data to a vertex shader which performs coordinate space transformation and lighting operations to each vertex. In some embodiments vertex fetcher and vertex shader execute vertex processing instructions by dispatching execution threads to execution units A B via a thread dispatcher .

In some embodiments execution units A B are an array of vector processors having an instruction set for performing graphics and media operations. In some embodiments execution units A B have an attached L1 cache that is specific for each array or shared between the arrays. The cache can be configured as a data cache an instruction cache or a single cache that is partitioned to contain data and instructions in different partitions.

In some embodiments graphics pipeline includes tessellation components to perform hardware accelerated tessellation of 3D objects. In some embodiments a programmable hull shader configures the tessellation operations. A programmable domain shader provides back end evaluation of tessellation output. A tessellator operates at the direction of hull shader and contains special purpose logic to generate a set of detailed geometric objects based on a coarse geometric model that is provided as input to graphics pipeline . In some embodiments if tessellation is not used tessellation components can be bypassed.

In some embodiments complete geometric objects can be processed by a geometry shader via one or more threads dispatched to execution units A B or can proceed directly to the clipper . In some embodiments the geometry shader operates on entire geometric objects rather than vertices or patches of vertices as in previous stages of the graphics pipeline. If the tessellation is disabled the geometry shader receives input from the vertex shader . In some embodiments geometry shader is programmable by a geometry shader program to perform geometry tessellation if the tessellation units are disabled.

Before rasterization a clipper processes vertex data. The clipper may be a fixed function clipper or a programmable clipper having clipping and geometry shader functions. In some embodiments a rasterizer depth in the render output pipeline dispatches pixel shaders to convert the geometric objects into their per pixel representations. In some embodiments pixel shader logic is included in thread execution logic . In some embodiments an application can bypass the rasterizer and access un rasterized vertex data via a stream out unit .

The graphics processor has an interconnect bus interconnect fabric or some other interconnect mechanism that allows data and message passing amongst the major components of the processor. In some embodiments execution units A B and associated cache s texture and media sampler and texture sampler cache interconnect via a data port to perform memory access and communicate with render output pipeline components of the processor. In some embodiments sampler caches and execution units A B each have separate memory access paths.

In some embodiments render output pipeline contains a rasterizer and depth test component that converts vertex based objects into an associated pixel based representation. In some embodiments the rasterizer logic includes a windower masker unit to perform fixed function triangle and line rasterization. An associated render cache and depth cache are also available in some embodiments. A pixel operations component performs pixel based operations on the data though in some instances pixel operations associated with 2D operations e.g. bit block image transfers with blending are performed by the 2D engine or substituted at display time by the display controller using overlay display planes. In some embodiments a shared L3 cache is available to all graphics components allowing the sharing of data without the use of main system memory.

In some embodiments graphics processor media pipeline includes a media engine and a video front end . In some embodiments video front end receives pipeline commands from the command streamer .

In some embodiments display engine contains special purpose logic capable of operating independently of the 3D pipeline. In some embodiments display controller couples with a display device not shown which may be a system integrated display device as in a laptop computer or an external display device attached via a display device connector.

In some embodiments graphics pipeline and media pipeline are configurable to perform operations based on multiple graphics and media programming interfaces and are not specific to any one application programming interface API . In some embodiments driver software for the graphics processor translates API calls that are specific to a particular graphics or media library into commands that can be processed by the graphics processor. In some embodiments support is provided for the Open Graphics Library OpenGL and Open Computing Language OpenCL from the Khronos Group the Direct3D library from the Microsoft Corporation or support may be provided to both OpenGL and D3D. Support may also be provided for the Open Source Computer Vision Library OpenCV . A future API with a compatible 3D pipeline would also be supported if a mapping can be made from the pipeline of the future API to the pipeline of the graphics processor.

In some embodiments client specifies the client unit of the graphics device that processes the command data. In some embodiments a graphics processor command parser examines the client field of each command to condition the further processing of the command and route the command data to the appropriate client unit. In some embodiments the graphics processor client units include a memory interface unit a render unit a 2D unit a 3D unit and a media unit. Each client unit has a corresponding processing pipeline that processes the commands. Once the command is received by the client unit the client unit reads the opcode and if present sub opcode to determine the operation to perform. The client unit performs the command using information in data field . For some commands an explicit command size is expected to specify the size of the command. In some embodiments the command parser automatically determines the size of at least some of the commands based on the command opcode. In some embodiments commands are aligned via multiples of a double word.

The flow diagram in shows an exemplary graphics processor command sequence . In some embodiments software or firmware of a data processing system that features an embodiment of a graphics processor uses a version of the command sequence shown to set up execute and terminate a set of graphics operations. A sample command sequence is shown and described for purposes of example only as embodiments are not limited to these specific commands or to this command sequence. Moreover the commands may be issued as batch of commands in a command sequence such that the graphics processor will process the sequence of commands in at least partially concurrence.

In some embodiments the graphics processor command sequence may begin with a pipeline flush command to cause any active graphics pipeline to complete the currently pending commands for the pipeline. In some embodiments the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline do not operate concurrently. The pipeline flush is performed to cause the active graphics pipeline to complete any pending commands. In response to a pipeline flush the command parser for the graphics processor will pause command processing until the active drawing engines complete pending operations and the relevant read caches are invalidated. Optionally any data in the render cache that is marked dirty can be flushed to memory. In some embodiments pipeline flush command can be used for pipeline synchronization or before placing the graphics processor into a low power state.

In some embodiments a pipeline select command is used when a command sequence requires the graphics processor to explicitly switch between pipelines. In some embodiments a pipeline select command is required only once within an execution context before issuing pipeline commands unless the context is to issue commands for both pipelines. In some embodiments a pipeline flush command is is required immediately before a pipeline switch via the pipeline select command .

In some embodiments a pipeline control command configures a graphics pipeline for operation and is used to program the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline . In some embodiments pipeline control command configures the pipeline state for the active pipeline. In one embodiment the pipeline control command is used for pipeline synchronization and to clear data from one or more cache memories within the active pipeline before processing a batch of commands.

In some embodiments return buffer state commands are used to configure a set of return buffers for the respective pipelines to write data. Some pipeline operations require the allocation selection or configuration of one or more return buffers into which the operations write intermediate data during processing. In some embodiments the graphics processor also uses one or more return buffers to store output data and to perform cross thread communication. In some embodiments the return buffer state includes selecting the size and number of return buffers to use for a set of pipeline operations.

The remaining commands in the command sequence differ based on the active pipeline for operations. Based on a pipeline determination the command sequence is tailored to the 3D pipeline beginning with the 3D pipeline state or the media pipeline beginning at the media pipeline state .

The commands for the 3D pipeline state include 3D state setting commands for vertex buffer state vertex element state constant color state depth buffer state and other state variables that are to be configured before 3D primitive commands are processed. The values of these commands are determined at least in part based the particular 3D API in use. In some embodiments 3D pipeline state commands are also able to selectively disable or bypass certain pipeline elements if those elements will not be used.

In some embodiments 3D primitive command is used to submit 3D primitives to be processed by the 3D pipeline. Commands and associated parameters that are passed to the graphics processor via the 3D primitive command are forwarded to the vertex fetch function in the graphics pipeline. The vertex fetch function uses the 3D primitive command data to generate vertex data structures. The vertex data structures are stored in one or more return buffers. In some embodiments 3D primitive command is used to perform vertex operations on 3D primitives via vertex shaders. To process vertex shaders 3D pipeline dispatches shader execution threads to graphics processor execution units.

In some embodiments 3D pipeline is triggered via an execute command or event. In some embodiments a register write triggers command execution. In some embodiments execution is triggered via a go or kick command in the command sequence. In one embodiment command execution is triggered using a pipeline synchronization command to flush the command sequence through the graphics pipeline. The 3D pipeline will perform geometry processing for the 3D primitives. Once operations are complete the resulting geometric objects are rasterized and the pixel engine colors the resulting pixels. Additional commands to control pixel shading and pixel back end operations may also be included for those operations.

In some embodiments the graphics processor command sequence follows the media pipeline path when performing media operations. In general the specific use and manner of programming for the media pipeline depends on the media or compute operations to be performed. Specific media decode operations may be offloaded to the media pipeline during media decode. In some embodiments the media pipeline can also be bypassed and media decode can be performed in whole or in part using resources provided by one or more general purpose processing cores. In one embodiment the media pipeline also includes elements for general purpose graphics processor unit GPGPU operations where the graphics processor is used to perform SIMD vector operations using computational shader programs that are not explicitly related to the rendering of graphics primitives.

In some embodiments media pipeline is configured in a similar manner as the 3D pipeline . A set of media pipeline state commands are dispatched or placed into in a command queue before the media object commands . In some embodiments media pipeline state commands include data to configure the media pipeline elements that will be used to process the media objects. This includes data to configure the video decode and video encode logic within the media pipeline such as encode or decode format. In some embodiments media pipeline state commands also support the use one or more pointers to indirect state elements that contain a batch of state settings.

In some embodiments media object commands supply pointers to media objects for processing by the media pipeline. The media objects include memory buffers containing video data to be processed. In some embodiments all media pipeline states must be valid before issuing a media object command . Once the pipeline state is configured and media object commands are queued the media pipeline is triggered via an execute command or an equivalent execute event e.g. register write . Output from media pipeline may then be post processed by operations provided by the 3D pipeline or the media pipeline . In some embodiments GPGPU operations are configured and executed in a similar manner as media operations.

In some embodiments 3D graphics application contains one or more shader programs including shader instructions . The shader language instructions may be in a high level shader language such as the High Level Shader Language HLSL or the OpenGL Shader Language GLSL . The application also includes executable instructions in a machine language suitable for execution by the general purpose processor core . The application also includes graphics objects defined by vertex data.

In some embodiments operating system is a Microsoft Windows operating system from the Microsoft Corporation a proprietary UNIX like operating system or an open source UNIX like operating system using a variant of the Linux kernel. When the Direct3D API is in use the operating system uses a front end shader compiler to compile any shader instructions in HLSL into a lower level shader language. The compilation may be a just in time JIT compilation or the application can perform shader pre compilation. In some embodiments high level shaders are compiled into low level shaders during the compilation of the 3D graphics application .

In some embodiments user mode graphics driver contains a back end shader compiler to convert the shader instructions into a hardware specific representation. When the OpenGL API is in use shader instructions in the GLSL high level language are passed to a user mode graphics driver for compilation. In some embodiments user mode graphics driver uses operating system kernel mode functions to communicate with a kernel mode graphics driver . In some embodiments kernel mode graphics driver communicates with graphics processor to dispatch commands and instructions.
