title: Mortar retention system for automated weapons
abstract: A retention system protects the round stored inside a rotating continuous belt-type magazine, and holds the round securely while allowing it to be readily and easily released prior to firing. The retention system permits all the retaining devices to be easily retracted so that a ramming mechanism of the weapon can push the round into the chamber without interference. The gun tube of the automated weapon houses the round and provides interfaces for all other components to attach. The tube length minimizes the axial movement of the round. The round is held within the tube by a front door assembly and a rear door assembly. The door assembly is made of a crescent-shaped door attached to a pivot shaft, in order to minimize the amount of rotational travel required to open the door for loading or firing the round.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention relates in general to the field of munitions. More specifically this invention relates to a system and associated method for retaining securing and protecting the ammunition within a magazine or within an ammunition feeding mechanism of an automated weapon.

One of the challenges of automating mortar weapons is the design of a system that handles and protects the ammunition. The standard mortar round is typically difficult to restrain securely within a magazine or ammunition feeding mechanism of an automated weapon. The round must be protected from gunfire shock adverse weather conditions and transportation loads while remaining ready to be fired without any user handling or intervention.

In addition the mortar round includes delicate features such as the aluminum fins and propellant charge increments which must be protected from damage resulting from handling and transportation. To further exacerbate the concerns associated with traditional automated weapons the ogive geometric shape and design of the mortar round does not provide a useful feature for securing the mortar within the ammunition feeding mechanism.

Previous methods of mortar round retention for automatic or semi automatic weapons included storing the ammunition in a sealed container clamping the round tightly with a friction hold or by interfacing with the tapered section of the mortar body. Storing the ammunition in a sealed container requires user handling before firing. The use of a retention device against the tapered section of the mortar body is prone to wedging and jamming. Maintaining sufficient friction to retain the round when subjected to transportation and firing loads has proven to be relatively difficult. Furthermore the force applied to the round decreases over time and with repeated firing loads with the springs taking a permanent set.

While these conventional methods provided a certain level of protection to the ammunition there still remains a need for a more efficient retention system that secures and protects the ammunition within the feeding mechanism of an automated weapon.

The present invention addresses the foregoing concerns and presents a new retention system that protects the round stored inside a rotating continuous belt type magazine and that holds the round securely while allowing it to be readily and easily released prior to firing. The retention system permits all the retaining devices to be easily retracted so that a ramming mechanism of the weapon can push the round into the chamber without interference.

An ammunition magazine tube of the automated weapon houses the round and provides interfaces for all other components to attach. The tube length restricts the axial movement of the round.

The ammunition is held within the tube by a front door assembly and a rear door assembly. Each of these two door assemblies is made of a crescent shaped door attached to a pivot shaft. The crescent shape permits the door to retain the ammunition during transportation while minimizing the amount of rotational travel required to open the door for loading or firing the round.

The door assembly rotation is guided by two shaft supports for each of the two door assemblies. To open the doors each door assembly is fitted with a release lever. A front release lever is actuated by the plunger of a firing solenoid and will open both the front and rear doors for firing. A rear release lever is actuated by a loading solenoid but only opens the rear door as required for loading or resupplying ammunition into the magazine.

The doors are held in the closed position by torsion springs. The lower door supports provide additional support for the door when they are in the closed position prevent cantilever type loading on the door shaft and provide a positive rotational stop for each door.

The ammunition is also clamped in place by a formed clamping spring to prevent vibration during transportation. This clamping spring also provides a method of inventory control. When the head of the spring is forced downward by the round it will fall into the range of a proximity sensor to indicate the presence of ammunition in the cell. The head also interfaces with a cam when the cell is driven to the firing position to further depress the spring in order to completely release the ammunition prior to firing.

A linking collar assembly allows additional cells to be linked together to form a continuous chain. Each cell has four linking collars two in the front and two in the rear.

The present retention system provides positive round retention while remaining readily releasable and protecting the critical areas of the round. The combination of the doors and clamp spring prevents axial movement and vibration of the mortar during transportation and firing loads seen by the system. The present design is not susceptible to jamming from a wedging action because there is no interface with the tapered section of the round. The doors are held closed by the torsion spring and are easily opened by means of solenoids.

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

With reference to it illustrates an exemplary operation of an automated weapon that is provided with an ammunition feeding mechanism according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this example the automated weapon includes a gun tube and a recoiling mass that translates back and forth within a firing chamber . As used herein the term recoiling mass generally refers to the components of the automated weapon that move in response to the energy of expending an round by the automated weapon . This term may encompass for example a breech or a ramming mechanism recoil cylinders recoil springs or firing mechanism.

While the ammunition feeding mechanism is shown as including four rounds and it should be clear that the ammunition feeding mechanism can be provided with a different number of rounds wherein each round i.e. is respectively stored in a storage cell i.e. .

As further illustrated in the ammunition feeding mechanism can be for example a rotating continuous belt type magazine of the automated weapon . The ammunition feeding mechanism or magazine of this particular example is formed of a plurality of generally similar interconnected storage cells i.e. each of which embodies a retention system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The ammunition feeding mechanism is also comprised of one or more gun tube clearance cell which ensures that the gun tube of the automated weapon is clear and unobstructed.

The general operation of the automated weapon will now be described in connection with . shows the first round being chambered and the recoiling mass being cocked and latched. shows the recoiling mass unlatched and ramming the first round forward along the arrow A causing the first round to be fired through the gun tube .

The retention system is generally formed of a front door assembly a rear door assembly a central support collar and a clamping spring . The front door assembly and the rear door assembly are generally similar in design and function and thus only the front door assembly will be described in greater detail.

Considering now the front door assembly it generally includes a front door shaft a front rotating door a front door release lever a front door return spring a first front door shaft support and a second front door shaft support .

The front door shaft is preferably but not necessarily a metallic rod whose length is approximately equal to half the length of the canister plus the thickness of the assembled front door linking collars and the front rotating door .

The front rotating door is made of a crescent shaped metallic sheet. It is secured to forward end of the front door shaft so that it selectively opens and closes the front open end of the canister . In this illustration the front door shaft can be rotated by approximately fifty five 55 degrees. Concurrently and as further illustrated in the closed front rotating door provides support to a nose of the round .

In addition as further illustrated in the front rotating door includes a circularly shaped inner contour that has a generally similar diameter as that of the front end of the canister . As a result when the front rotating door is in an open position the inner chamber of the canister is fully opened and exposed to allow unhindered expulsion of the round .

With reference to the front door return spring is firmly secured to the forward end of the front door shaft . The other or rearward end of the front door return spring presses against the forward side of the first front door shaft support in order to keep the front rotating door in a closed position when the storage cell is assembled. The front rotating door includes a lip that engages a lock which is mounted on the front end of the canister .

With further reference to when the storage cell is assembled the front door release lever is firmly secured to the rearward end of the front door shaft and rests against the rearward end of the second front door shaft support . As a result of this configuration when the front door release lever is in a default i.e. not pressed state it rests in an upward position . However as illustrated in when it is desired to open the front rotating door and the rear rotating door the front door release lever is pressed downward to cause the front door shaft to rotate clockwise as viewed from the front end of the storage cell .

In the embodiment illustrated in the first front door shaft support is secured to a collar C which in turn is securely mounted on the outer periphery of the collar . Similarly the second front door shaft support is secured to the central support collar which in turn is securely mounted onto the collar .

The front door linking collars are generally similar in design and construction and therefore only the collar will be described in more detail. The collar is formed of a cylindrical ring having a circular cross section. The inner diameter of the ring is selected so that the collar can be securely fitted on the front end of the canister .

With reference to the collar further includes a shoulder that is provided with two holes . The shoulder protrudes outwardly to enable the engagement of the collar to another storage cell on one side i.e. left side of the storage cell in a chain configuration as shown in by means of two pins . Pins and allow for connection to a subsequent magazine cell while pin also incorporates a roller which ensures the smooth operation of the magazine as it revolves within its housing. The ring includes an inner flat shoulder that engages a groove or cutout in cell thereby axially restraining collar and similarly collar .

As illustrated in the collar includes a shoulder that is similar in design and function to the shoulder and that protrudes outwardly to enable the engagement of the collar to another storage cell another side i.e. right side of the storage cell in a chain configuration.

Considering now the rear door assembly in connection with it is generally similar in design and function to the front door assembly and includes a rear door shaft a rear rotating door a rear door release lever a rear door return spring a first rear door shaft support and a second rear door shaft support .

In operation and with further reference to if the storage cell does not contain an round then the arm of the clamping spring extends generally parallel to the canister with its head extending through an opening to the inner chamber . The retention system further includes a proximity sensor that is disposed in the vicinity of the clamping spring and is mounted of the magazine housing so that when the head of the central spring is unbiased by the round then the head will fall out of the range of the proximity sensor to indicate that the storage cell does not house the round .

If the storage cell contains a round then as shown in the head pushes against the round to provide it with lateral support causing the arm to bend downward away from the canister and the head to fall into the range of the proximity sensor to indicate the presence of the round thus providing an expeditious inventory of the rounds within the ammunition feeding mechanism .

As shown in the retention system includes a clamp release cam that interfaces with a farthermost end of the head as the storage cell is advanced to the firing position in order to depress the clamping spring and to retain it in a depressed state in order to completely release the round .

As further illustrated in the retention system includes an actuator that is disposed at a short distance from the front door release lever and the rear door release lever . The actuator generally includes two solenoids each with a plunger only one solenoid and one plunger are illustrated in . Both solenoids and plungers are similar in design and function and therefore only one plunger will be described herein in more detail. The plunger is disposed atop the front door release lever and the other plunger not shown is disposed atop the rear door release lever .

When the plunger is retracted as is illustrated in the front door release lever is in an upward position causing the front rotating door to remain closed. In the illustration shown in the solenoid is activated so that only the plunger is extended downward to push down on the front door release lever causing both the front rotating door and the rear rotating door to be opened.

Similarly when it is desired to open the rear rotating door as illustrated in the solenoid is activated so that the plunger not shown associated with the rear door release lever is extended downward to push down on the rear rotating door .

As a result of this design the firing position is distinct from the loading position. One solenoid plunger is located above the firing position that is aligned with the front door release lever . The other solenoid plunger not shown is located above the rear door release lever in the loading position. The firing solenoid does actuate actuate the rear door release lever and the loading solenoid does not actuate the front door release lever .

The gun tube clearance cell is generally similar in design construction to the storage cell but is functionally different therefrom. The gun tube clearance cell is primarily designed to ascertain that the gun tube is clear and unobstructed and to provide a safe transport position for the recoiling system. The gun tube clearance cell is different than the other storage cells i.e. because it is not meant to store an round.

In a preferred embodiment the gun tube clearance cell is open at both ends so that the recoiling mass of the automated weapon can be stored in the forward position for safety i.e. not cocked back as shown in . The gun tube clearance cell includes a generally cylindrically shaped hollow canister an optical or ultrasonic release assembly an ultrasonic source and a chain link assembly .

Considering now the canister it is generally similar in design and construction to the canister as described earlier. The chain link assembly includes two front end linking collars that are secured to the front end of the canister and that are similar in design construction and function to the linking collars .

The chain link assembly further includes two rear end linking collars that are secured to the rear end of the canister and that are similar in design construction and function to the linking collars . In this particular embodiment the gun tube clearance cell does not include neither a front door nor a rear door with the understanding that other embodiments of the present invention might selectively include a fixed rear door and or a rotatable front door that is actuated similarly to the front rotating door as described earlier.

The ultrasonic source selectively generates and emanates an ultrasonic wave as it will be explained later in more detail in connection with . The optical release assembly is generally formed of a collar that is mounted on the outer surface of the canister . A rotatable reflective surface selectively rotates along an axis that is transverse to the axial direction of the canister .

A lever is also mounted on the collar and is retained by a spring . The lever and the rotatable reflective surface engage each other by means of meshing gears .

In operation when the gun tube clearance cell is not functional a spring retains the lever in an unbiased position and the rotatable reflective surface is stowed against the inner surface of the canister . In use a solenoid that is similar to the solenoid actuates the lever which engages the rotatable reflective surface and causes it to be lowered from a stowed position to an extended position at for example 45 relative to the longitudinal axis of the canister .

The ultrasonic source generates an ultrasonic wave that travels through the opening in the canister to be reflected by the rotatable reflective surface parallel to the longitudinal axis of the canister . The ultrasonic source optical source further includes a sensor that evaluates the echo of the ultrasonic wave laser beam that is received back at the sensor. If no echo is received the gun tube is assumed to be free from obstruction.
