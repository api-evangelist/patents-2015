The activity of cells can be regulated by external signals that stimulate or inhibit intracellular events. The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases including numerous forms of cancer inflammatory disorders metabolic disorders vascular and neuronal diseases Gaestel et al. 2007 14 2214 2234 .

Kinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and or themselves i.e. autophosphorylation . Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues e.g. erb2 PDGF receptor EGF receptor VEGF receptor src abl serine threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and or threonine residues e.g. mTorC1 mTorC2 ATM ATR DNA PK Akt and dual specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine serine and or threonine residues.

Lipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids. These enzymes and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid derived biologically active organic molecules play a role in many different physiological processes including cell proliferation migration adhesion and differentiation. Certain lipid kinases are membrane associated and they catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphoinositide s kinases e.g. PI3 kinases PI4 Kinases diacylglycerol kinases and sphingosine kinases.

The phosphoinositide 3 kinases PI3Ks signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is also a key factor in many other diseases in humans. PI3K signaling is involved in many disease states including allergic contact dermatitis rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis inflammatory bowel diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder psoriasis multiple sclerosis asthma disorders related to diabetic complications and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.

PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3 OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities expression patterns and modes of regulation. The class I PI3Ks p110 p110 p110 and p110 are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3 which engages downstream effectors such as those in the Akt PDK1 pathway mTOR the Tec family kinases and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI 3 P and PI 3 4 P2. The PI3Ks are protein kinases that control cell growth mTORC1 or monitor genomic integrity ATM ATR DNA PK and hSmg 1 .

The delta isoform of class I PI3K has been implicated in particular in a number of diseases and biological processes. PI3K is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells including leukocytes such as T cells dendritic cells neutrophils mast cells B cells and macrophages. PI3K is integrally involved in mammalian immune system functions such as T cell function B cell activation mast cell activation dendritic cell function and neutrophil activity. Due to its integral role in immune system function PI3K is also involved in a number of diseases related to undesirable immune response such as allergic reactions inflammatory diseases inflammation mediated angiogenesis rheumatoid arthritis and auto immune diseases such as lupus asthma emphysema and other respiratory diseases. Other class I PI3K involved in immune system function includes PI3K which plays a role in leukocyte signaling and has been implicated in inflammation rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases such as lupus.

Unlike PI3K the beta isoform of class I PI3K appears to be ubiquitously expressed. PI3K has been implicated primarily in various types of cancer including PTEN negative cancer Edgar et al. 2010 70 3 1164 1172 and HER2 overexpressing cancer such as breast cancer and ovarian cancer.

Described herein are compounds capable of selectively inhibiting certain isoform s of class I PI3K without substantially affecting the activity of the remaining isoforms of the same class. For example non limiting examples of inhibitors capable of selectively inhibiting PI3K and or PI3K but without substantially affecting the activity of PI3K are disclosed. Such inhibitors can be effective in ameliorating disease conditions associated with PI3K activity.

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. As used herein the term pharmaceutically acceptable salt refers to those salts which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of subjects without undue toxicity irritation allergic response and the like and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example Berge et al. describes pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in 1977 66 1 19. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds provided herein include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid phosphoric acid sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid oxalic acid maleic acid tartaric acid citric acid succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate alginate ascorbate aspartate benzenesulfonate besylate benzoate bisulfate borate butyrate camphorate camphorsulfonate citrate cyclopentanepropionate digluconate dodecylsulfate ethanesulfonate formate fumarate glucoheptonate glycerophosphate gluconate hemisulfate heptanoate hexanoate hydroiodide 2 hydroxy ethanesulfonate lactobionate lactate laurate lauryl sulfate malate maleate malonate methanesulfonate 2 naphthalenesulfonate nicotinate nitrate oleate oxalate palmitate pamoate pectinate persulfate 3 phenylpropionate phosphate picrate pivalate propionate stearate succinate sulfate tartrate thiocyanate p toluenesulfonate undecanoate valerate salts and the like.

Organic bases from which salts can be derived include for example primary secondary and tertiary amines substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines cyclic amines basic ion exchange resins and the like such as isopropylamine trimethylamine diethylamine triethylamine tripropylamine and ethanolamine. In some embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt is chosen from ammonium potassium sodium calcium and magnesium salts.

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a solvate e.g. a hydrate . As used herein the term solvate refers to compounds that further include a stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amount of solvent bound by non covalent intermolecular forces. The solvate can be of a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Where the solvent is water the solvate is a hydrate . Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates are complexes that for example can include 1 to about 100 or 1 to about 10 or one to about 2 3 or 4 solvent or water molecules. It will be understood that the term compound as used herein encompasses the compound and solvates of the compound as well as mixtures thereof.

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a prodrug. As used herein the term prodrug refers to compounds that are transformed in vivo to yield a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound. A prodrug can be inactive when administered to a subject but is converted in vivo to an active compound for example by hydrolysis e.g. hydrolysis in blood . In certain cases a prodrug has improved physical and or delivery properties over the parent compound. Prodrugs are typically designed to enhance pharmaceutically and or pharmacokinetically based properties associated with the parent compound. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism see e.g. Bundgard H. 1985 pp. 7 9 21 24 Elsevier Amsterdam . A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi T. et al. Pro drugs as Novel Delivery Systems Vol. 14 and in ed. Edward B. Roche American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press 1987 both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. Exemplary advantages of a prodrug can include but are not limited to its physical properties such as enhanced water solubility for parenteral administration at physiological pH compared to the parent compound or it enhances absorption from the digestive tract or it can enhance drug stability for long term storage.

The term prodrug is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject. Prodrugs of an active compound as described herein can be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved either in routine manipulation or in vivo to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a subject cleaves to form a free hydroxy free amino or free mercapto group respectively. Examples of prodrugs include but are not limited to acetate formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like. Other examples of prodrugs include compounds that comprise NO NO ONO or ONOmoieties. Prodrugs can typically be prepared using well known methods such as those described in 172 178 949 982 Manfred E. Wolff ed. 5th ed. 1995 and H. Bundgaard ed. Elselvier N.Y. 1985 .

For example if a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group a prodrug can comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as C C alkyl C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 alkanoyloxy ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms 1 methyl 1 alkanoyloxy ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms 1 alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms 1 methyl 1 alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 5 to carbon atoms N alkoxycarbonyl aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms 1 N alkoxycarbonyl amino ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms 3 phthalidyl 4 crotonolactonyl gamma butyrolacton 4 yl di N N C C alkylamino C C alkyl such as dimethylaminoethyl carbamoyl C C alkyl N N di C C alkylcarbamoyl C C alkyl and piperidino pyrrolidino or morpholino C C alkyl.

Similarly if a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound contains an alcohol functional group a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl 1 methyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl C C alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl N C C alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl succinoyl C C alkanoyl amino C C alkanoyl arylacyl and aminoacyl or aminoacyl aminoacyl where each aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L amino acids P O OH P O O C C alkyl or glycosyl the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate .

If a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound incorporates an amine functional group a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R carbonyl RO carbonyl NRR carbonyl where R and R are each independently C C alkyl C C cycloalkyl benzyl a natural aminoacyl or natural aminoacyl natural aminoacyl C OH C O OYwherein Yis H C C alkyl or benzyl C OY Ywherein Yis C C alkyl and Yis C C alkyl carboxy C C alkyl amino C C alkyl or mono N or di N N C C alkylaminoalkyl C Y Ywherein Yis H or methyl and Yis mono N or di N N C C alkylamino morpholino piperidin 1 yl or pyrrolidin 1 yl.

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable form is an isomer. Isomers are different compounds that have the same molecular formula. Stereoisomers are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are arranged in space. As used herein the term isomer includes any and all geometric isomers and stereoisomers. For example isomers include geometric double bond cis and trans isomers also termed E and Z isomers R and S enantiomers diastereomers d isomers and l isomers racemic mixtures thereof and other mixtures thereof as falling within the scope of this disclosure.

Geometric isomers can be represented by the symbol which denotes a bond that can be a single double or triple bond as described herein. Provided herein are various geometric isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the arrangement of substituents around a carbon carbon double bond or arrangement of substituents around a carbocyclic ring. Substituents around a carbon carbon double bond are designated as being in the Z or E configuration wherein the terms Z and E are used in accordance with IUPAC standards. Unless otherwise specified structures depicting double bonds encompass both the E and Z isomers.

Substituents around a carbon carbon double bond alternatively can be referred to as cis or trans where cis represents substituents on the same side of the double bond and trans represents substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. The arrangement of substituents around a carbocyclic ring can also be designated as cis or trans. The term cis represents substituents on the same side of the plane of the ring and the term trans represents substituents on opposite sides of the plane of the ring. Mixtures of compounds wherein the substituents are disposed on both the same and opposite sides of plane of the ring are designated cis trans. 

 Enantiomers are a pair of stereoisomers that are non superimposable mirror images of each other. A mixture of a pair of enantiomers in any proportion can be known as a racemic mixture. The term is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms but which are not mirror images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn Ingold Prelog R S system. When a compound is an enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated or depending on the direction dextro or levorotatory which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers diastereomers and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined in terms of absolute stereochemistry at each asymmetric atom as R or S . The present chemical entities pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers including racemic mixtures optically substantially pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active R and S isomers can be prepared for example using chiral synthons or chiral reagents or resolved using conventional techniques.

The enantiomeric excess or enantiomeric excess of a composition can be calculated using the equation shown below. In the example shown below a composition contains 90 of one enantiomer e.g. the S enantiomer and 10 of the other enantiomer e.g. the R enantiomer. 90 10 100 80 .

Thus a composition containing 90 of one enantiomer and 10 of the other enantiomer is said to have an enantiomeric excess of 80 . Some compositions described herein contain an enantiomeric excess of at least about 50 75 90 95 or 99 of the S enantiomer. In other words the compositions contain an enantiomeric excess of the S enantiomer over the R enantiomer. In other embodiments some compositions described herein contain an enantiomeric excess of at least about 50 75 90 95 or 99 of the R enantiomer. In other words the compositions contain an enantiomeric excess of the R enantiomer over the S enantiomer.

For instance an isomer enantiomer can in some embodiments be provided substantially free of the corresponding enantiomer and can also be referred to as optically enriched enantiomerically enriched enantiomerically pure and non racemic as used interchangeably herein. These terms refer to compositions in which the percent by weight of one enantiomer is greater than the amount of that one enantiomer in a control mixture of the racemic composition e.g. greater than 1 1 by weight . For example an enantiomerically enriched preparation of the S enantiomer means a preparation of the compound having greater than about 50 by weight of the S enantiomer relative to the R enantiomer such as at least about 75 by weight further such as at least about 80 by weight. In some embodiments the enrichment can be much greater than about 80 by weight providing a substantially enantiomerically enriched substantially enantiomerically pure or a substantially non racemic preparation which refers to preparations of compositions which have at least about 85 by weight of one enantiomer relative to other enantiomer such as at least about 90 by weight and further such as at least 95 by weight. In certain embodiments the compound provided herein is made up of at least about 90 by weight of one enantiomer.

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a tautomer. As used herein the term tautomer is a type of isomer that includes two or more interconvertable compounds resulting from at least one formal migration of a hydrogen atom and at least one change in valency e.g. a single bond to a double bond a triple bond to a single bond or vice versa . Tautomerization includes prototropic or proton shift tautomerization which is considered a subset of acid base chemistry. Prototropic tautomerization or proton shift tautomerization involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors including temperature solvent and pH. Where tautomerization is possible e.g. in solution a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. Tautomerizations i.e. the reaction providing a tautomeric pair can be catalyzed by acid or base or can occur without the action or presence of an external agent. Exemplary tautomerizations include but are not limited to keto to enol amide to imide lactam to lactim enamine to imine and enamine to a different enamine tautomerizations. A specific example of keto enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane 2 4 dione and 4 hydroxypent 3 en 2 one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol keto tautomerization. A specific example of phenol keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin 4 ol and pyridin 4 1H one tautomers.

Unless otherwise stated structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms.

The disclosure also embraces isotopically labeled compounds which are identical to those recited herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into disclosed compounds include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorus fluorine and chlorine such as H H C C N O O P P S F and Cl respectively. Certain isotopically labeled disclosed compounds e.g. those labeled with H and C are useful in compound and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes can allow for ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability e.g. increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements . Isotopically labeled disclosed compounds can generally be prepared by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent. In some embodiments provided herein are compounds that can also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. All isotopic variations of the compounds as disclosed herein whether radioactive or not are encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure.

In some embodiments provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration containing a compound as disclosed herein and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration containing i an effective amount of a disclosed compound optionally ii an effective amount of one or more second agents and iii one or more pharmaceutical excipients suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition further contains iv an effective amount of a third agent.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition can be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms such as capsules cachets or tablets or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non aqueous liquid an oil in water emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more ingredients. In general the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then if necessary shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules optionally mixed with an excipient such as but not limited to a binder a lubricant an inert diluent and or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.

The present disclosure further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example water can be added e.g. about 5 in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. For example pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and or humidity during manufacturing packaging and or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include but are not limited to hermetically sealed foils plastic or the like unit dose containers blister packs and strip packs.

An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the pharmaceutical compositions for an oral dosage form any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers such as for example water glycols oils alcohols flavoring agents preservatives coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions solutions and elixirs or aerosols or carriers such as starches sugars microcrystalline cellulose diluents granulating agents lubricants binders and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example suitable carriers include powders capsules and tablets with the solid oral preparations. In some embodiments tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.

Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to corn starch potato starch or other starches gelatin natural and synthetic gums such as acacia sodium alginate alginic acid other alginates powdered tragacanth guar gum cellulose and its derivatives e.g. ethyl cellulose cellulose acetate carboxymethyl cellulose calcium sodium carboxymethyl cellulose polyvinyl pyrrolidone methyl cellulose pre gelatinized starch hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose microcrystalline cellulose and mixtures thereof.

Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include but are not limited to talc calcium carbonate e.g. granules or powder microcrystalline cellulose powdered cellulose dextrates kaolin mannitol silicic acid sorbitol starch pre gelatinized starch and mixtures thereof.

Disintegrants can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions as provided herein to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant can produce tablets which can disintegrate in the bottle. Too little can be insufficient for disintegration to occur and can thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient s from the dosage form. Thus a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient s can be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used can vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration and can be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant can be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to agar agar alginic acid calcium carbonate microcrystalline cellulose croscarmellose sodium crospovidone polacrilin potassium sodium starch glycolate potato or tapioca starch other starches pre gelatinized starch other starches clays other algins other celluloses gums or mixtures thereof.

Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to calcium stearate magnesium stearate mineral oil light mineral oil glycerin sorbitol mannitol polyethylene glycol other glycols stearic acid sodium lauryl sulfate talc hydrogenated vegetable oil e.g. peanut oil cottonseed oil sunflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil zinc stearate ethyl oleate ethylaureate agar or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include for example a syloid silica gel a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.

When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active ingredient therein can be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents coloring matter or dyes and for example emulsifying and or suspending agents together with such diluents as water ethanol propylene glycol glycerin and various combinations thereof.

The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent for example calcium carbonate calcium phosphate or kaolin or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium for example peanut oil liquid paraffin or olive oil.

Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to hydrophilic surfactants lipophilic surfactants and mixtures thereof. That is a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants can be employed a mixture of lipophilic surfactants can be employed or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant can be employed.

A suitable hydrophilic surfactant can generally have an HLB value of at least about 10 while suitable lipophilic surfactants can generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic lipophilic balance HLB value . Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic and have greater solubility in oils while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10 as well as anionic cationic or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly lipophilic i.e. hydrophobic surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions.

Hydrophilic surfactants can be either ionic or non ionic. Suitable ionic surfactants include but are not limited to alkylammonium salts fusidic acid salts fatty acid derivatives of amino acids oligopeptides and polypeptides glyceride derivatives of amino acids oligopeptides and polypeptides lecithins and hydrogenated lecithins lysolecithins and hydrogenated lysolecithins phospholipids and derivatives thereof lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof carnitine fatty acid ester salts salts of alkylsulfates fatty acid salts sodium docusate acylactylates mono and di acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono and di glycerides succinylated mono and di glycerides citric acid esters of mono and di glycerides and mixtures thereof.

Within this group non limiting examples of lipophilic surfactants include glycerol fatty acid esters propylene glycol fatty acid esters and mixtures thereof or are hydrophobic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of vegetable oils hydrogenated vegetable oils and triglycerides.

In one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition can include a solubilizer to ensure good solubilization and or dissolution of a compound as provided herein and to minimize precipitation of the compound. This can be especially important for pharmaceutical compositions for non oral use e.g. pharmaceutical compositions for injection. A solubilizer can also be added to increase the solubility of the hydrophilic drug and or other components such as surfactants or to maintain the pharmaceutical composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion.

Examples of suitable solubilizers include but are not limited to the following alcohols and polyols such as ethanol isopropanol butanol benzyl alcohol ethylene glycol propylene glycol butanediols and isomers thereof glycerol pentaerythritol sorbitol mannitol transcutol dimethyl isosorbide polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyvinylalcohol hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives ethers of polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of about 200 to about 6000 such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol PEG ether glycofurol or methoxy PEG amides and other nitrogen containing compounds such as 2 pyrrolidone 2 piperidone caprolactam N alkylpyrrolidone N hydroxyalkylpyrrolidone N alkylpiperidone N alkylcaprolactam dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone esters such as ethyl propionate tributylcitrate acetyl triethylcitrate acetyl tributyl citrate triethylcitrate ethyl oleate ethyl caprylate ethyl butyrate triacetin propylene glycol monoacetate propylene glycol diacetate caprolactone and isomers thereof valerolactone and isomers thereof butyrolactone and isomers thereof and other solubilizers known in the art such as dimethyl acetamide dimethyl isosorbide N methyl pyrrolidones monooctanoin diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and water.

Mixtures of solubilizers can also be used. Examples include but not limited to triacetin triethylcitrate ethyl oleate ethyl caprylate dimethylacetamide N methylpyrrolidone N hydroxyethylpyrrolidone polyvinylpyrrolidone hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hydroxypropyl cyclodextrins ethanol polyethylene glycol 200 100 glycofurol transcutol propylene glycol and dimethyl isosorbide. In some embodiments solubilizers include sorbitol glycerol triacetin ethyl alcohol PEG 400 glycofurol and propylene glycol.

The amount of solubilizer that can be included is not particularly limited. The amount of a given solubilizer can be limited to a bioacceptable amount which can be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances it can be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts for example to maximize the concentration of the drug with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the pharmaceutical composition to a subject using conventional techniques such as distillation or evaporation. Thus if present the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of about 10 25 50 100 or up to about 200 by weight based on the combined weight of the drug and other excipients. If desired very small amounts of solubilizer can also be used such as about 5 2 1 or even less. Typically the solubilizer can be present in an amount of about 1 to about 100 more typically about 5 to about 25 by weight.

Pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be formulated into preparations in solid semi solid or liquid forms suitable for local or topical administration such as gels water soluble jellies creams lotions suspensions foams powders slurries ointments solutions oils pastes suppositories sprays emulsions saline solutions dimethylsulfoxide DMSO based solutions. In general carriers with higher densities are capable of providing an area with a prolonged exposure to the active ingredients. In contrast a solution formulation can provide more immediate exposure of the active ingredient to the chosen area.

The pharmaceutical compositions also can comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients which are compounds that allow increased penetration of or assist in the delivery of therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum permeability barrier of the skin. There are many of these penetration enhancing molecules known to those trained in the art of topical formulation.

Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled release of one or more active agents using for example hydropropylmethyl cellulose other polymer matrices gels permeable membranes osmotic systems multilayer coatings microparticles liposomes microspheres or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art including those described herein can be readily selected for use with the active agents provided herein. Thus the pharmaceutical compositions provided encompass single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as but not limited to tablets capsules gelcaps and caplets that are adapted for controlled release.

All controlled release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non controlled counterparts. In some embodiments the use of a controlled release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the disease disorder or condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled release formulations include extended activity of the drug reduced dosage frequency and increased subject compliance. In addition controlled release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics such as blood levels of the drug and can thus affect the occurrence of side e.g. adverse effects.

In some embodiments controlled release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of a compound as disclosed herein that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect and gradually and continually release other amounts of the compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of the compound in the body the compound should be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled release of an active agent can be stimulated by various conditions including but not limited to pH temperature enzymes water or other physiological conditions or compounds.

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutical composition can be administered using intravenous infusion an implantable osmotic pump a transdermal patch liposomes or other modes of administration. In one embodiment a pump can be used see Sefton 14 201 1987 Buchwald et al. 88 507 1980 Saudek et al. 321 574 1989 . In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment a controlled release system can be placed in a subject at an appropriate site determined by a practitioner of skill i.e. thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson 115 138 vol. 2 1984 . Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer 249 1527 1533 1990 . The one or more active agents can be dispersed in a solid inner matrix e.g. polymethylmethacrylate polybutylmethacrylate plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride plasticized nylon plasticized polyethyleneterephthalate natural rubber polyisoprene polyisobutylene polybutadiene polyethylene ethylene vinylacetate copolymers silicone rubbers polydimethylsiloxanes silicone carbonate copolymers hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid collagen cross linked polyvinylalcohol and cross linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane e.g. polyethylene polypropylene ethylene propylene copolymers ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymers ethylene vinylacetate copolymers silicone rubbers polydimethyl siloxanes neoprene rubber chlorinated polyethylene polyvinylchloride vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate vinylidene chloride ethylene and propylene ionomer polyethylene terephthalate butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer ethylene vinyl acetate vinyl alcohol terpolymer and ethylene vinyloxyethanol copolymer that is insoluble in body fluids. The one or more active agents then diffuse through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active agent in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof as well as the needs of the subject.

A compound described herein can be delivered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds described herein and or one or more additional therapeutic agents such as a chemotherapeutic formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. In some instances the compound described herein and the additional therapeutic agent are administered in separate pharmaceutical compositions and can e.g. because of different physical and or chemical characteristics be administered by different routes e.g. one therapeutic is administered orally while the other is administered intravenously .

In general a suitable daily dose of a compound described herein and or a chemotherapeutic will be that amount of the compound which in some embodiments can be the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally doses of the compounds described herein for a patient when used for the indicated effects will range from about 0.0001 mg to about 100 mg per day or about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per day or about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg per day or about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per day or about 0.0001 mg to about 500 mg per day or about 0.001 mg to about 500 mg per day or about 0.01 mg to 1000 mg or about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg per day or about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg per day or about about 1 mg to 50 mg per day or about 5 mg to 40 mg. An exemplary dosage is about 10 to 30 mg per day. In some embodiments for a 70 kg human a suitable dose would be about 0.05 to about 7 g day such as about 0.05 to about 2.5 g day. Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient composition and mode of administration without being toxic to the patient. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range can be more than adequate while in other cases still larger doses can be employed without causing any harmful side effect e.g. by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day.

In some embodiments the compounds can be administered daily every other day three times a week twice a week weekly or bi weekly. The dosing schedule can include a drug holiday i.e. the drug can be administered for two weeks on one week off or three weeks on one week off or four weeks on one week off etc. or continuously without a drug holiday. The compounds can be administered orally intravenously intraperitoneally topically transdermally intramuscularly subcutaneously intranasally sublingually or by any other route.

In some embodiments a compound as provided herein is administered in multiple doses. Dosing can be about once twice three times four times five times six times or more than six times per day. Dosing can be about once a month once every two weeks once a week or once every other day. In another embodiment a compound as disclosed herein and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment the administration of a compound as provided herein and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment the administration continues for more than about 6 10 14 28 days two months six months or one year. In some cases continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary.

Administration of the pharmaceutical compositions as disclosed herein can continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments an agent as disclosed herein is administered for more than 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 14 or 28 days. In some embodiments an agent as disclosed herein is administered for less than 28 14 7 6 5 4 3 2 or 1 day. In some embodiments an agent as disclosed herein is administered chronically on an ongoing basis e.g. for the treatment of chronic effects.

Since the compounds described herein can be administered in combination with other treatments such as additional chemotherapeutics radiation or surgery the doses of each agent or therapy can be lower than the corresponding dose for single agent therapy. The dose for single agent therapy can range from for example about 0.0001 to about 200 mg or about 0.001 to about 100 mg or about 0.01 to about 100 mg or about 0.1 to about 100 mg or about 1 to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day.

When a compound provided herein is administered in a pharmaceutical composition that comprises one or more agents and the agent has a shorter half life than the compound provided herein unit dose forms of the agent and the compound provided herein can be adjusted accordingly.

In some embodiments provided herein are kits. The kits can include a compound or pharmaceutical composition as described herein in suitable packaging and written material that can include instructions for use discussion of clinical studies listing of side effects and the like. Such kits can also include information such as scientific literature references package insert materials clinical trial results and or summaries of these and the like which indicate or establish the activities and or advantages of the pharmaceutical composition and or which describe dosing administration side effects drug interactions or other information useful to the health care provider. Such information can be based on the results of various studies for example studies using experimental animals involving in vivo models and studies based on human clinical trials.

In some embodiments a memory aid is provided with the kit e.g. in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card e.g. as follows First Week Monday Tuesday . . . etc. . . . Second Week Monday Tuesday . . . etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A daily dose can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day.

The kit can further contain another agent. In some embodiments the compound as disclosed herein and the agent are provided as separate pharmaceutical compositions in separate containers within the kit. In some embodiments the compound as disclosed herein and the agent are provided as a single pharmaceutical composition within a container in the kit. Suitable packaging and additional articles for use e.g. measuring cup for liquid preparations foil wrapping to minimize exposure to air and the like are known in the art and can be included in the kit. In other embodiments kits can further comprise devices that are used to administer the active agents. Examples of such devices include but are not limited to syringes drip bags patches and inhalers. Kits described herein can be provided marketed and or promoted to health providers including physicians nurses pharmacists formulary officials and the like. Kits can also in some embodiments be marketed directly to the consumer.

An example of such a kit is a so called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms tablets capsules and the like . Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. The strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.

Kits can further comprise pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles that can be used to administer one or more active agents. For example if an active agent is provided in a solid form that must be reconstituted for parenteral administration the kit can comprise a sealed container of a suitable vehicle in which the active agent can be dissolved to form a particulate free sterile solution that is suitable for parenteral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles include but are not limited to Water for Injection USP aqueous vehicles such as but not limited to Sodium Chloride Injection Ringer s Injection Dextrose Injection Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection and Lactated Ringer s Injection water miscible vehicles such as but not limited to ethyl alcohol polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol and non aqueous vehicles such as but not limited to corn oil cottonseed oil peanut oil sesame oil ethyl oleate isopropyl myristate and benzyl benzoate.

The present disclosure further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example water can be added e.g. about 5 in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. For example pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and or humidity during manufacturing packaging and or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include but are not limited to hermetically sealed foils plastic or the like unit dose containers blister packs and strip packs.

Phosphoinositide 3 kinases PI3Ks are members of a conserved family of lipid kinases that regulate numerous cell functions including proliferation differentiation cell survival and metabolism. Several classes of PI3Ks exist in mammalian cells including Class IA subgroup e.g. PI3K which are generally activated by receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs Class IB e.g. PI3K which is activated by G protein coupled receptors GPCRs among others. PI3Ks exert their biological activities via a PI3K mediated signaling pathway that includes several components that directly and or indirectly transduce a signal triggered by a PI3K including the generation of second messenger phosphotidylinositol 3 4 5 triphosphate PIP3 at the plasma membrane activation of heterotrimeric G protein signaling and generation of further second messengers such as cAMP DAG and IP3 all of which leads to an extensive cascade of protein kinase activation reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck B. et al. 2001 70 535 602 . For example PI3K is activated by cellular receptors through interaction between the PI3K regulatory subunit p85 SH2 domains or through direct interaction with RAS. PIP3 produced by PI3K activates effector pathways downstream through interaction with plextrin homology PH domain containing enzymes e.g. PDK 1 and AKT PKB . Fung Leung WP. 2011 23 4 603 8 . Unlike PI3K PI3K is not associated with a regulatory subunit of the p85 family but rather with a regulatory subunit in the p101 family. PI3K is associated with GPCRs and is responsible for the very rapid induction of PIP3. PI3K can be also activated by RAS.

In some embodiments provided herein are methods of modulating a PI3K kinase activity e.g. selectively modulating by contacting the kinase with an effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form e.g. pharmaceutically acceptable salts hydrates solvates isomers prodrugs and isotopically labeled derivatives thereof or pharmaceutical compositions as provided herein. Modulation can be inhibition e.g. reduction or activation e.g. enhancement of kinase activity. In some embodiments provided herein are methods of inhibiting kinase activity by contacting the kinase with an effective amount of a compound as provided herein in solution. In some embodiments provided herein are methods of inhibiting the kinase activity by contacting a cell tissue organ that express the kinase of interest with a compound provided herein. In some embodiments provided herein are methods of inhibiting kinase activity in a subject by administering into the subject an effective amount of a compound as provided herein. In some embodiments the kinase activity is inhibited e.g. reduced by more than about 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 or 90 when contacted with a compound provided herein as compared to the kinase activity without such contact. In some embodiments provided herein are methods of inhibiting PI3 kinase activity in a subject including mammals such as humans by contacting said subject with an amount of a compound as provided herein sufficient to inhibit or reduce the activity of the PI3 kinase in said subject.

In some embodiments the kinase is a lipid kinase or a protein kinase. In some embodiments the kinase is selected from a PI3 kinase including different isoforms such as PI3 kinase PI3 kinase PI3 kinase PI3 kinase DNA PK mTor Abl VEGFR Ephrin receptor B4 EphB4 TEK receptor tyrosine kinase TIE2 FMS related tyrosine kinase 3 FLT 3 Platelet derived growth factor receptor PDGFR RET ATM ATR hSmg 1 Hck Src Epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR KIT Inulsin Receptor IR and IGFR.

As used herein a PI3K mediated disorder refers to a disease or condition involving aberrant PI3K mediated signaling pathway. In one embodiment provided herein is a method of treating a PI3K mediated disorder in a subject the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition as provided herein. In some embodiments provided herein is a method of treating a PI3K or PI3K mediated disorder in a subject the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition as provided herein. In some embodiments provided herein is a method for inhibiting at least one of PI3K and PI3K the method comprising contacting a cell expressing PI3K in vitro or in vivo with an effective amount of the compound or composition provided herein. PI3Ks have been associated with a wide range of conditions including immunity cancer and thrombosis reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck B. et al. 2010 DOI 10.1007 82 2010 65 . For example Class I PI3Ks particularly PI3K and PI3K isoforms are highly expressed in leukocytes and have been associated with adaptive and innate immunity thus these PI3Ks are believed to be important mediators in inflammatory disorders and hematologic malignancies reviewed in Harris S J et al. 2009 Drugs 10 11 1151 62 Rommel C. et al. 2007 7 3 191 201 Durand C A et al. 2009 183 9 5673 84 Dil N Marshall A J. 2009 46 10 1970 8 Al Alwan M M et al. 2007 178 4 2328 35 Zhang T T et al. 2008 2008 122 4 811 819.e2 Srinivasan L et al. 2009 139 3 573 86 .

Numerous publications support roles of PI3K PI3K and PI3K in the differentiation maintenance and activation of immune and malignant cells as described in more detail below.

The importance of PI3K in the development and function of B cells is supported from inhibitor studies and genetic models. PI3K is an important mediator of B cell receptor BCR signaling and is upstream of AKT calcium flux PLC MAP kinase P70S6k and FOXO3a activation. PI3K is also important in IL4R S1P and CXCR5 signaling and has been shown to modulate responses to toll like receptors 4 and 9 Inhibitors of PI3K have shown the importance of PI3K in B cell development Marginal zone and B1 cells B cell activation chemotaxis migration and homing to lymphoid tissue and in the control of immunoglobulin class switching leading to the production of IgE. Clayton E et al. 2002 196 6 753 63 Bilancio A et al. 2006 107 2 642 50 Okkenhaug K. et al. 2002 297 5583 1031 4 Al Alwan M M et al. 2007 178 4 2328 35 Zhang T T et al. 2008 2008 122 4 811 819.e2 Srinivasan L et al. 2009 139 3 573 86 

In T cells PI3K has been demonstrated to have a role in T cell receptor and cytokine signaling and is upstream of AKT PLC and GSK3b. In PI3K deletion or kinase dead knock in mice or in inhibitor studies T cell defects including proliferation activation and differentiation have been observed leading to reduced T helper cell 2 TH2 response memory T cell specific defects DTH reduction defects in antigen dependent cellular trafficking and defects in chemotaxis migration to chemokines e.g. S1P CCR7 CD62L . Gar on F. et al. 2008 111 3 1464 71 Okkenhaug K et al. 2006 . 177 8 5122 8 Soond D R et al. 2010 115 11 2203 13 Reif K 2004 . 2004 173 4 2236 40 Ji H. et al. 2007 110 8 2940 7 Webb L M et al. 2005 175 5 2783 7 Liu D et al. 2010 184 6 3098 105 Haylock Jacobs S et al. 2011 2011 36 3 4 278 87 Jarmin S J et al. 2008 118 3 1154 64 .

In neutrophils PI3K along with PI3K and PI3K contribute to the responses to immune complexes FC RII signaling including migration and neutrophil respiratory burst. Human neutrophils undergo rapid induction of PIP3 in response to formyl peptide receptor FMLP or complement component C5a C5a in a PI3K dependent manner followed by a longer PIP3 production period that is PI3K dependent and is essential for respiratory burst. The response to immune complexes is contributed by PI3K PI3K and PI3K and is an important mediator of tissue damage in models of autoimmune disease Randis T M et al. 2008 38 5 1215 24 Pinho V 2007 179 11 7891 8 Sadhu C. et al. 2003 170 5 2647 54 Condliffe A M et al. 2005 106 4 1432 40 . It has been reported that in certain autoimmune diseases preferential activation of PI3K may be involved. Kulkarni et al. 2011 4 168 ra23 1 11 . It was also reported that PI3K deficient mice were highly protected in an Fc R dependent model of autoantibody induced skin blistering and partially protected in an Fc R dependent model of inflammatory arthritis whereas combined deficiency of PI3K and PI3K resulted in near complete protection in inflammatory arthritis. Id. .

In macrophages collected from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD glucocorticoid responsiveness can be restored by treatment of the cells with inhibitors of PI3K . Macrophages also rely on PI3K and PI3K for responses to immune complexes through the arthus reaction FCgR and C5a signaling Randis T M et al. 2008 38 5 1215 24 Marwick J A et al. 2009 179 7 542 8 Konrad S et al. 2008 283 48 33296 303 .

In mast cells stem cell factor SCF and IL3 dependent proliferation differentiation and function are PI3K dependent as is chemotaxis. The allergen IgE crosslinking of FCgR1 resulting in cytokine release and degranulation of the mast cells is severely inhibited by treatment with PI3K inhibitors suggesting a role for PI3K in allergic disease Ali K et al. 2004 431 7011 1007 11 Lee K S et al. 2006 20 3 455 65 Kim M S et al. 2008 29 10 493 501 .

Natural killer NK cells are dependent on both PI3K and PI3K for efficient migration towards chemokines including CXCL10 CCL3 SIP and CXCL12 or in response to LPS in the peritoneum Guo H et al. 2008 205 10 2419 35 Tassi I et al. 2007 27 2 214 27 Saudemont A 2009 106 14 5795 800 Kim N et al. 2007 110 9 3202 8 .

The roles of PI3K PI3K and PI3K in the differentiation maintenance and activation of immune cells support a role for these enzymes in inflammatory disorders ranging from autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis to allergic inflammatory disorders such as asthma and inflammatory respiratory disease such as COPD. Extensive evidence is available in experimental animal models or can be evaluated using art recognized animal models. In an embodiment described herein is a method of treating inflammatory disorders ranging from autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis to allergic inflammatory disorders such as asthma and COPD using a compound described herein.

For example inhibitors of PI3K and or have been shown to have anti inflammatory activity in several autoimmune animal models for rheumatoid arthritis Williams O. et al. 2010 Chem Biol 17 2 123 34 WO 2009 088986 WO2009 088880 WO 2011 008302 . PI3K is expressed in the RA synovial tissue especially in the synovial lining which contains fibroblast like synoviocytes FLS and selective PI3K inhibitors have been shown to be effective in inhibiting synoviocyte growth and survival Bartok et al. 2010 62 Suppl 10 362 . Several PI3K and inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate arthritic symptoms e.g. swelling of joints reduction of serum induced collagen levels reduction of joint pathology and or inflammation in art recognized models for RA such as collagen induced arthritis and adjuvant induced arthritis WO 2009 088986 WO2009 088880 WO 2011 008302 .

The role of PI3K has also been shown in models of T cell dependent response including the DTH model. In the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE model of multiple sclerosis the PI3K double mutant mice are resistant. PI3K inhibitors have also been shown to block EAE disease induction and development of TH 17 cells both in vitro and in vivo Haylock Jacobs S. et al. 2011 36 3 4 278 87 .

Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE is a complex disease that at different stages requires memory T cells B cell polyclonal expansion and differentiation into plasma cells and the innate immune response to endogenous damage associated molecular pattern molecules DAMPS and the inflammatory responses to immune complexes through the complement system as well as the Freceptors. The role of PI3K and PI3K together in these pathways and cell types suggest that blockade with an inhibitor would be effective in these diseases. A role for PI3K in lupus is also predicted by two genetic models of lupus. The deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog PTEN leads to a lupus like phenotype as does a transgenic activation of Class1A PI3Ks which includes PI3K . The deletion of PI3K in the transgenically activated class 1A lupus model is protective and treatment with a PI3K selective inhibitor in the murine MLR lpr model of lupus improves symptoms Barber D F et al. 2006 176 1 589 93 .

In allergic disease PI3K has been shown by genetic models and by inhibitor treatment to be essential for mast cell activation in a passive cutaneous anaphalaxis assay Ali K et al. 2008 180 4 2538 44 Ali K 2004 431 7011 1007 11 . In a pulmonary measure of response to immune complexes Arthus reaction a PI3K knockout is resistant showing a defect in macrophage activation and C5a production. Knockout studies and studies with inhibitors for both PI3K and PI3K support a role for both of these enzymes in the ovalbumin induced allergic airway inflammation and hyper responsiveness model Lee K S et al. 2006 20 3 455 65 . Reductions of infiltration of eosinophils neutrophils and lymphocytes as well as TH2 cytokines IL4 IL5 and IL13 were seen with both PI3K specific and dual PI3K and PI3K inhibitors in the Ova induced asthma model Lee K S et al. 2006 118 2 403 9 .

PI3K and PI3K inhibition can be used in treating COPD. In the smoked mouse model of COPD the PI3K knockout does not develop smoke induced glucocorticoid resistance while wild type and PI3K knockout mice do. An inhaled formulation of dual PI3K and PI3K inhibitor blocked inflammation in a LPS or smoke COPD models as measured by neutrophilia and glucocorticoid resistance Doukas J et al. 2009 328 3 758 65 .

Class I PI3Ks particularly PI3K and PI3K isoforms are also associated with cancers reviewed e.g. in Vogt P K et al. 2010 Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 347 79 104 Fresno Vara J A et al. 2004 30 2 193 204 Zhao L and Vogt P K. 2008 Oncogene 27 41 5486 96 Inhibitors of PI3K e.g. PI3K and or have been shown to have anti cancer activity e.g. Courtney K D et al. 2010 28 6 1075 1083 Markman B et al. 2010 Ann Oncol. 21 4 683 91 Kong D and Yamori T 2009 Curr Med Chem. 16 22 2839 54 Jimeno A et al. 2009 J Clin Oncol. 27 156s suppl abstr 3542 Flinn I W et al. 2009 27 156s suppl abstr 3543 Shapiro G et al. 2009 J Clin Oncol. 27 146s suppl abstr 3500 Wagner A J et al. 2009 27 146s suppl abstr 3501 Vogt P K et al. 2006 Virology 344 1 131 8 Ward S et al. 2003 10 3 207 13 WO 2011 041399 US 2010 0029693 US 2010 0305096 US 2010 0305084 . In an embodiment described herein is a method of treating cancer.

Types of cancer that can be treated with an inhibitor of PI3K particularly PI3K and or include e.g. leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia acute myeloid leukemia chronic myeloid leukemia e.g. Salmena L et al. 2008 133 403 414 Chapuis N et al. 2010 16 22 5424 35 Khwaja A 2010 347 169 88 lymphoma e.g. non Hodgkin s lymphoma e.g. Salmena L et al. 2008 133 403 414 lung cancer e.g. non small cell lung cancer small cell lung cancer e.g. Herrera V A et al. 2011 31 3 849 54 melanoma e.g. Haluska F et al. 2007 34 6 546 54 prostate cancer e.g. Sarker D et al. 2009 15 15 4799 805 glioblastoma e.g. Chen J S et al. 2008 7 841 850 endometrial cancer e.g. Bansal N et al. 2009 16 1 8 13 pancreatic cancer e.g. Furukawa T 2008 43 12 905 11 renal cell carcinoma e.g. Porta C and Figlin R A 2009 182 6 2569 77 colorectal cancer e.g. Saif M W and Chu E 2010 Cancer J. 16 3 196 201 breast cancer e.g. Torbett N E et al. 2008 415 97 100 thyroid cancer e.g. Brzezianska E and Pastuszak Lewandoska D 2011 16 422 39 and ovarian cancer e.g. Mazzoletti M and Broggini M 2010 17 36 4433 47 .

Numerous publications support a role of PI3K and PI3K in treating hematological cancers. PI3K and PI3K are highly expressed in the heme compartment and some solid tumors including prostate breast and glioblastomas Chen J. S. et al. 2008 7 4 841 50 Ikeda H. et al. 2010 116 9 1460 8 .

In hematological cancers including acute myeloid leukemia AML multiple myeloma MM and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL overexpression and constitutive activation of PI3K supports the model that PI3K inhibition would be therapeutic Billottet C et al. 2006 25 50 6648 59 Billottet C et al. 2009 69 3 1027 36 Meadows S A 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Ikeda H et al. 2010 116 9 1460 8 Herman S E et al. 2010 116 12 2078 88 Herman S E et al. 2011 . 117 16 4323 7. In an embodiment described herein is a method of treating hematological cancers including but not limited to acute myeloid leukemia AML multiple myeloma MM and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL .

A PI3K inhibitor CAL 101 has been evaluated in a phase 1 trial in patients with haematological malignancies and showed activity in CLL in patients with poor prognostic characteristics. In CLL inhibition of PI3K not only affects tumor cells directly but it also affects the ability of the tumor cells to interact with their microenvironment. This microenvironment includes contact with and factors from stromal cells T cells nurse like cells as well as other tumor cells. CAL 101 suppresses the expression of stromal and T cell derived factors including CCL3 CCL4 and CXCL13 as well as the CLL tumor cells ability to respond to these factors. CAL 101 treatment in CLL patients induces rapid lymph node reduction and redistribution of lymphocytes into the circulation and affects tonic survival signals through the BCR leading to reduced cell viability and an increase in apoptosis. Single agent CAL 101 treatment was also active in mantle cell lymphoma and refractory non Hodgkin s lymphoma Furman R R et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Hoellenriegel J et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Webb H K et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Meadows et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Kahl B et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Lannutti B J et al. 2011 117 2 591 4 .

PI3K inhibitors have shown activity against PI3K positive gliomas in vitro Kashishian A et al. Poster presented at The American Association of Cancer Research 102Annual Meeting 2011 Apr. 2 6 Orlando Fla. . PI3K is the PI3K isoform that is most commonly activated in tumors where the PTEN tumor suppressor is mutated Ward S et al. 2003 10 3 207 13 . In this subset of tumors treatment with the PI3K inhibitor either alone or in combination with a cytotoxic agent can be effective.

Another mechanism for PI3K inhibitors to have an affect in solid tumors involves the tumor cells interaction with their micro environment. PI3K PI3K and PI3K are expressed in the immune cells that infiltrate tumors including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes macrophages and neutrophils. PI3K inhibitors can modify the function of these tumor associated immune cells and how they respond to signals from the stroma the tumor and each other and in this way affect tumor cells and metastasis Hoellenriegel J et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. .

PI3K is also expressed in endothelial cells. It has been shown that tumors in mice treated with PI3K selective inhibitors are killed more readily by radiation therapy. In this same study capillary network formation is impaired by the PI3K inhibitor and it is postulated that this defect contributes to the greater killing with radiation. PI3K inhibitors can affect the way in which tumors interact with their microenvironment including stromal cells immune cells and endothelial cells and be therapeutic either on its own or in conjunction with another therapy Meadows S A et al. Paper presented at 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Geng L et al. 2004 64 14 4893 9 .

In other embodiments inhibition of PI3K such as PI3K and or can be used to treat a neuropsychiatric disorder e.g. an autoimmune brain disorder. Infectious and immune factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric disorders including but not limited to Sydenham s chorea SC Garvey M. A. et al. 2005 20 424 429 Tourette s syndrome TS obsessive compulsive disorder OCD Asbahr F. R. et al. 1998 155 1122 1124 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder AD HD Hirschtritt M. E. et al. 2008 1 1 16 Peterson B. S. et al. 2000 57 364 372 anorexia nervosa Sokol M. S. 2000 10 133 145 Sokol M. S. et al. 2002 159 1430 1432 depression Leslie D. L. et al. 2008 47 1166 1172 and autism spectrum disorders ASD Hollander E. et al. 1999 156 317 320 Margutti P. et al. 2006 3 149 157 . A subset of childhood obsessive compulsive disorders and tic disorders has been grouped as Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococci PANDAS . PANDAS disorders provide an example of disorders where the onset and exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms is preceded by a streptococcal infection Kurlan R. Kaplan E. L. 2004 113 883 886 Garvey M. A. et al. 1998 13 413 423 . Many of the PANDAS disorders share a common mechanism of action resulting from antibody responses against streptococcal associated epitopes such as GlcNAc which produces neurological effects Kirvan. C. A. et al. 2006 179 173 179 . Autoantibodies recognizing central nervous system CNS epitopes are also found in sera of most PANDAS subjects Yaddanapudi K. et al. 2010 15 712 726 . Thus several neuropsychiatric disorders have been associated with immune and autoimmune components making them suitable for therapies that include PI3K and or inhibition.

The chemical stability of one or more subject compounds is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. The following details an exemplary procedure for ascertaining chemical stability of a subject compound. The default buffer used for the chemical stability assay is phosphate buffered saline PBS at pH 7.4 other suitable buffers can be used. A subject compound is added from a 100 M stock solution to an aliquot of PBS in duplicate to give a final assay volume of 400 L containing 5 M test compound and 1 DMSO for half life determination a total sample volume of 700 L is prepared . Reactions are incubated with shaking for 24 hours at 37 C. for half life determination samples are incubated for 0 2 4 6 and 24 hours. Reactions are stopped by adding immediately 100 L of the incubation mixture to 100 L of acetonitrile and vortexing for 5 minutes. The samples are then stored at 20 C. until analysis by HPLC MS MS. Where desired a control compound or a reference compound such as chlorambucil 5 M is tested simultaneously with a subject compound of interest as this compound is largely hydrolyzed over the course of 24 hours. Samples are analyzed via RP HPLC MS MS using selected reaction monitoring SRM . The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler a mixed mode C12 2 20 mm column and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC MS MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 24 hours relative to the amount remaining at time zero expressed as percent is reported as chemical stability. In case of half life determination the half life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining vs. time assuming first order kinetics.

Class I PI3 Ks can be either purchased p110 p85 p110 p85 p110 p85 from Upstate and p110 from Sigma or expressed as previously described Knight et al. 2004 . ICvalues are measured using either a standard TLC assay for lipid kinase activity described below or a high throughput membrane capture assay. Kinase reactions are performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing kinase inhibitor 2 DMSO final concentration buffer 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4 10 mM MgCl2 and freshly sonicated phosphatidylinositol 100 g ml . Reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP containing 10 Ci of 32P ATP to a final concentration of 10 or 100 M and allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature. For TLC analysis reactions are then terminated by the addition of 105 l 1N HCl followed by 160 l CHCl MeOH 1 1 . The biphasic mixture is vortexed briefly centrifuged and the organic phase is transferred to a new tube using a gel loading pipette tip precoated with CHCl. This extract is spotted on TLC plates and developed for 3 4 hours in a 65 35 solution of n propanol 1M acetic acid. The TLC plates are then dried exposed to a phosphorimager screen Storm Amersham and quantitated. For each compound kinase activity is measured at 10 12 inhibitor concentrations representing two fold dilutions from the highest concentration tested typically 200 M . For compounds showing significant activity ICdeterminations are repeated two to four times and the reported value is the average of these independent measurements.

The kinase reaction is performed in a microtiter plate e.g. a 384 well microtiter plate . The total reaction volume is approximately 20 l per well. In the first step each well receives 2 l of test compound in 20 dimethylsulphoxide resulting in a 2 DMSO final concentration. Next approximately 14.5 l of a kinase PIP2 mixture diluted in 1 reaction buffer is added per well for a final concentration of 0.25 0.3 g ml kinase and 10 M PIP2. The plate is sealed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. To start the reaction 3.5 l of ATP diluted in 1 reaction buffer is added per well for a final concentration of 10 M ATP. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by adding 5 l of Stop Solution per well and then 5 l of Detection Mix is added per well. The plate is sealed incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then read on an appropriate plate reader. Data is analyzed and ICs are generated using GraphPad Prism 5.

A subject compound is added from a 400 M stock solution to an aliquot of pre warmed plasma to give a final assay volume of 400 L or 800 L for half life determination containing 5 M test compound and 0.5 DMSO. Reactions are incubated with shaking for 0 minutes and 60 minutes at 37 C. or for 0 15 30 45 and 60 minutes at 37 C for half life determination. Reactions are stopped by transferring 50 L of the incubation mixture to 200 L of ice cold acetonitrile and mixed by shaking for 5 minutes. The samples are centrifuged at 6000 g for 15 minutes at 4 C. and 120 L of supernatant removed into clean tubes. The samples are then evaporated to dryness and submitted for analysis by HPLC MS MS.

In one embodiment one or more control or reference compounds 5 M are tested simultaneously with the test compounds one compound propoxycaine with low plasma stability and another compound propantheline with intermediate plasma stability.

Samples are reconstituted in acetonitrile methanol water 1 1 2 v v v and analyzed via RP HPLC MS MS using selected reaction monitoring SRM . The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler a mixed mode C12 2 20 mm column and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC MS MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 60 minutes relative to the amount remaining at time zero expressed as percent is reported as plasma stability. In case of half life determination the half life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining vs. time assuming first order kinetics.

PI3K Akt mTor signaling is measured in blood cells using the phosflow method . 2007 434 131 54 . This method is by nature a single cell assay so that cellular heterogeneity can be detected rather than population averages. This allows concurrent distinction of signaling states in different populations defined by other markers. Phosflow is also highly quantitative. To test the effects of one or more compounds provided herein unfractionated splenocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with anti CD3 to initiate T cell receptor signaling. The cells are then fixed and stained for surface markers and intracellular phosphoproteins Inhibitors provided herein inhibit anti CD3 mediated phosphorylation of Akt S473 and S6 whereas rapamycin inhibits S6 phosphorylation and enhances Akt phosphorylation under the conditions tested.

Similarly aliquots of whole blood are incubated for 15 minutes with vehicle e.g. 0.1 DMSO or kinase inhibitors at various concentrations before addition of stimuli to crosslink the T cell receptor TCR anti CD3 with secondary antibody or the B cell receptor BCR using anti kappa light chain antibody Fab 2 fragments . After approximately 5 and 15 minutes samples are fixed e.g. with cold 4 paraformaldehyde and used for phosflow. Surface staining is used to distinguish T and B cells using antibodies directed to cell surface markers that are known to the art. The level of phosphorylation of kinase substrates such as Akt and S6 are then measured by incubating the fixed cells with labeled antibodies specific to the phosphorylated isoforms of these proteins. The population of cells are then analyzed by flow cytometry.

Murine bone marrow cells freshly transformed with a p190 BCR Abl retrovirus herein referred to as p190 transduced cells are plated in the presence of various drug combinations in M3630 methylcellulose media for about 7 days with recombinant human IL 7 in about 30 serum and the number of colonies formed is counted by visual examination under a microscope.

Alternatively human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are obtained from Philadelphia chromosome positive Ph and negative Ph patients upon initial diagnosis or relapse. Live cells are isolated and enriched for CD19 CD34 B cell progenitors. After overnight liquid culture cells are plated in methocult GF H4435 Stem Cell Technologies supplemented with cytokines IL 3 IL 6 IL 7 G CSF GM CSF CF Flt3 ligand and erythropoietin and various concentrations of known chemotherapeutic agents in combination with either compounds of the present disclosure. Colonies are counted by microscopy 12 14 days later. This method can be used to test for evidence of additive or synergistic activity.

Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a source in two doses about 4 hr apart with approximately 5Gy each. About 1 hr after the second radiation dose mice are injected i.v. with about 1 10leukemic cells e.g. Ph human or murine cells or p190 transduced bone marrow cells . These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of about 5 10normal bone marrow cells from 3 5 week old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs are harvested for analysis. Kinase inhibitor treatment begins about 10 days after leukemic cell injection and continues daily until the mice become sick or a maximum of approximately 35 days post transplant. Inhibitors are given by oral lavage.

Peripheral blood cells are collected approximately on day 10 pre treatment and upon euthanization post treatment contacted with labeled anti hCD4 antibodies and counted by flow cytometry. This method can be used to demonstrate that the synergistic effect of one or more compounds provided herein in combination with known chemotherapeutic agents can reduce leukemic blood cell counts as compared to treatment with known chemotherapeutic agents e.g. Gleevec alone under the conditions tested.

Mice lacking the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIb that opposes PI3K signaling in B cells develop lupus with high penetrance. Fc RIIb knockout mice R2KO Jackson Labs are considered a valid model of the human disease as some lupus patients show decreased expression or function of Fc RIIb S. Bolland and J. V. Ravtech 2000. 12 277 285 .

The R2KO mice develop lupus like disease with anti nuclear antibodies glomerulonephritis and proteinurea within about 4 6 months of age. For these experiments the rapamycin analogue RAD001 available from LC Laboratories is used as a benchmark compound and administered orally. This compound has been shown to ameliorate lupus symptoms in the B6.Sle1z.Sle3z model T. Wu et al. 117 2186 2196 .

The NZB W F1 mice spontaniously develop a systemic autoimmune disease with that is a model of lupus. The mice are treated starting at 20 weeks of age for a profilactic model and at 23 weeks of age for a therapeutic model. Blood and urine samples are obtained at approximately throughout the testing period and tested for antinuclear antibodies in dilutions of serum or protein concentration in urine . Serum is also tested for anti ssDNA and anti dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. Glomerulonephritis is assessed in kidney sections stained with H E at the end of the study or survival can be an endpoint. For example the proteozome inhibitor Bortezimib is effective at blocking disease in the NZB W model in both the profilactic and therapeutic model with reductions in auto antibody production kidney damage and improvements in survival 14 748 755 2008 .

Lupus disease model mice such as R2KO BXSB or MLR lpr are treated at about 2 months old approximately for about two months. Mice are given doses of vehicle RAD001 at about 10 mg kg or compounds provided herein at approximately 1 mg kg to about 500 mg kg. Blood and urine samples are obtained at approximately throughout the testing period and tested for antinuclear antibodies in dilutions of serum or protein concentration in urine . Serum is also tested for anti ssDNA and anti dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. Animals are euthanized at day 60 and tissues harvested for measuring spleen weight and kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis is assessed in kidney sections stained with H E. Other animals are studied for about two months after cessation of treatment using the same endpoints.

This established art model can be employed to demonstrate that the kinase inhibitors provided herein can suppress or delay the onset of lupus symptoms in lupus disease model mice.

Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a ray source. About 1 hr after the radiation dose mice are injected with about 1 106 leukemic cells from early passage p190 transduced cultures e.g. as described in 2005 August 161 1 51 6 . These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of approximately 5 10normal bone marrow cells from 3 5 wk old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs harvested for flow cytometry and or magnetic enrichment. Treatment begins on approximately day 10 and continues daily until mice become sick or after a maximum of about 35 days post transplant. Drugs are given by oral gavage p.o. . In a pilot experiment a dose of chemotherapeutic that is not curative but delays leukemia onset by about one week or less is identified controls are vehicle treated or treated with chemotherapeutic agent previously shown to delay but not cure leukemogenesis in this model e.g. imatinib at about 70 mg kg twice daily . For the first phase p190 cells that express eGFP are used and postmortem analysis is limited to enumeration of the percentage of leukemic cells in bone marrow spleen and lymph node LN by flow cytometry. In the second phase p190 cells that express a tailless form of human CD4 are used and the postmortem analysis includes magnetic sorting of hCD4 cells from spleen followed by immunoblot analysis of key signaling endpoints p Akt T308 and S473 pS6 and p4EBP 1. As controls for immunoblot detection sorted cells are incubated in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors of the present disclosure inhibitors before lysis. Optionally phosflow is used to detect p Akt S473 and pS6 S235 236 in hCD4 gated cells without prior sorting. These signaling studies are particularly useful if for example drug treated mice have not developed clinical leukemia at the 35 day time point. Kaplan Meier plots of survival are generated and statistical analysis done according to methods known in the art. Results from p190 cells are analyzed separated as well as cumulatively.

Samples of peripheral blood 100 200 l are obtained weekly from all mice starting on day 10 immediately prior to commencing treatment. Plasma is used for measuring drug concentrations and cells are analyzed for leukemia markers eGFP or hCD4 and signaling biomarkers as described herein.

This general assay known in the art can be used to demonstrate that effective therapeutic doses of the compounds provided herein can be used for inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells.

Matrigel containing test compounds are injected subcutaneously or intraocularly where it solidifies to form a plug. The plug is recovered after 7 21 days in the animal and examined histologically to determine the extent to which blood vessels have entered it. Angiogenesis is measured by quantification of the vessels in histologic sections. Alternatively fluorescence measurement of plasma volume is performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC labeled dextran 150. The results are expected to indicate one or more compounds provided herein that inhibit angiogenesis and are thus expected to be useful in treating ocular disorders related to aberrant angiogenesis and or vascular permeability.

A pocket is made in the cornea and a plug containing an angiogenesis inducing formulation e.g. VEGF FGF or tumor cells when introduced into this pocket elicits the ingrowth of new vessels from the peripheral limbal vasculature. Slow release materials such as ELVAX ethylene vinyl copolymer or Hydron are used to introduce angiogenesis inducing substances into the corneal pocket. Alternatively a sponge material is used.

The effect of putative inhibitors on the locally induced e.g. sponge implant angiogenic reaction in the cornea e.g. by FGF VEGF or tumor cells . The test compound is administered orally systemically or directly to the eye. Systemic administration is by bolus injection or more effectively by use of a sustained release method such as implantation of osmotic pumps loaded with the test inhibitor. Administration to the eye is by any of the methods described herein including but not limited to eye drops topical administration of a cream emulsion or gel intravitreal injection.

The vascular response is monitored by direct observation throughout the course of the experiment using a stereomicroscope in mice. Definitive visualization of the corneal vasculature is achieved by administration of fluorochrome labeled high molecular weight dextran. Quantification is performed by measuring the area of vessel penetration the progress of vessels toward the angiogenic stimulus over time or in the case of fluorescence histogram analysis or pixel counts above a specific background threshold.

The results can indicate one or more compounds provided herein inhibit angiogenesis and thus can be useful in treating ocular disorders related to aberrant angiogenesis and or vascular permeability.

The assay plate is prepared by placing a collagen plug in the bottom of each well with 5 10 cell spheroids per collagen plug each spheroid containing 400 500 cells. Each collagen plug is covered with 1100 l of storage medium per well and stored for future use 1 3 days at 37 C. 5 CO . The plate is sealed with sealing. Test compounds are dissolved in 200 l assay medium with at least one well including a VEGF positive control and at least one well without VEGF or test compound as a negative control. The assay plate is removed from the incubator and storage medium is carefully pipeted away. Assay medium containing the test compounds are pipeted onto the collagen plug. The plug is placed in a humidified incubator for 37 C. 5 CO 24 48 hours. Angiogenesis is quantified by counting the number of sprouts measuring average sprout length or determining cumulative sprout length. The assay can be preserved for later analysis by removing the assay medium adding 1 ml of 10 paraformaldehyde in Hanks BSS per well and storing at 4 C. The results are expected to identify compounds that inhibit angiogenesis in various cell types tested including cells of ocular origin.

The compounds as provided herein can present synergistic or additive efficacy when administered in combination with agents that inhibit IgE production or activity. Agents that inhibit IgE production include for example one or more of TEI 9874 2 4 6 cyclohexyloxy 2 naphtyloxy phenylacetamide benzoic acid rapamycin rapamycin analogs i.e. rapalogs TORC1 inhibitors TORC2 inhibitors and any other compounds that inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2. Agents that inhibit IgE activity include for example anti IgE antibodies such as Omalizumab and TNX 901.

One or more of the subject compounds capable of inhibiting PI3K can be efficacious in treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders AIID for example rheumatoid arthritis. If any of the compounds causes an undesired level of IgE production one can choose to administer it in combination with an agent that inhibits IgE production or IgE activity. Additionally the administration of PI3K or PI3K inhibitors as provided herein in combination with inhibitors of mTOR can also exhibit synergy through enhanced inhibition of the PI3K pathway. Various in vivo and in vitro models can be used to establish the effect of such combination treatment on AIID including but not limited to a in vitro B cell antibody production assay b in vivo TNP assay and c rodent collagen induced arthritis model.

Mice are euthanized and the spleens are removed and dispersed through a nylon mesh to generate a single cell suspension. The splenocytes are washed following removal of erythrocytes by osmotic shock and incubated with anti CD43 and anti Mac 1 antibody conjugated microbeads Miltenyi Biotec . The bead bound cells are separated from unbound cells using a magnetic cell sorter. The magnetized column retains the unwanted cells and the resting B cells are collected in the flow through. Purified B cells are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or an anti CD40 antibody and interleukin 4 Stimulated B cells are treated with vehicle alone or with PI3K inhibitors as provided herein with and without mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin rapalogs or mTORC1 C2 inhibitors. The results are expected to show that in the presence of mTOR inhibitors e.g. rapamycin alone there is little to no substantial effect on IgG and IgE response. However in the presence of PI3K and mTOR inhibitors the B cells are expected to exhibit a decreased IgG response as compared to the B cells treated with vehicle alone and the B cells are expected to exhibit a decreased IgE response as compared to the response from B cells treated with PI3K inhibitors alone.

Mice are immunized with TNP Ficoll or TNP KHL and treated with vehicle a PI3K inhibitor an mTOR inhibitor for example rapamycin or a PI3K inhibitor in combination with an mTOR inhibitor such as rapamycin. Antigen specific serum IgE is measured by ELISA using TNP BSA coated plates and isotype specific labeled antibodies. It is expected that mice treated with an mTOR inhibitor alone exhibit little or no substantial effect on antigen specific IgG3 response and no statistically significant elevation in IgE response as compared to the vehicle control. It is also expected that mice treated with both PI3K inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor exhibit a reduction in antigen specific IgG3 response as compared to the mice treated with vehicle alone. Additionally the mice treated with both PI3K inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor exhibit a decrease in IgE response as compared to the mice treated with PI3K inhibitor alone.

Female Lewis rats are anesthetized and given collagen injections prepared and administered as described previously on day 0. On day 6 animals are anesthetized and given a second collagen injection. Caliper measurements of normal pre disease right and left ankle joints are performed on day 9. On days 10 11 arthritis typically occurs and rats are randomized into treatment groups. Randomization is performed after ankle joint swelling is obviously established and there is good evidence of bilateral disease.

After an animal is selected for enrollment in the study treatment is initiated. Animals are given vehicle PI3K inhibitor or PI3K inhibitor in combination with rapamycin. Dosing is administered on days 1 6. Rats are weighed on days 1 7 following establishment of arthritis and caliper measurements of ankles taken every day. Final body weights are taken on day 7 and animals are euthanized.

The combination treatment using a compound as provided herein and rapamycin can provide greater efficacy than treatment with PI3K inhibitor alone.

Certain compounds provided herein e.g. Compounds 5 38 103 and 106 were tested in the rat Collagen Induced Arthritis Model using procedures substantially similar to those described above and all of the tested compounds demonstrated ECvalues of less than 50 mg kg.

DTH was induced by sensitizing 60 BALB c male mice on day 0 and day 1 with a solution of 0.05 2 4 dinitrofluorobenzene DNFB in a 4 1 acetone olive oil mixture. Mice were gently restrained while 20 L of solution was applied to the hind foot pads of each mouse. The hind foot pads of the mice were used as they represent an anatomical site that can be easily isolated and immobilized without anesthesia. On day 5 mice were administered a single dose of vehicle a compound provided herein at 10 3 1 or 0.3 mg kg or dexamethasone at a dose of 5 mg kg by oral gavage. Thirty minutes later mice were anaesthetized and a solution of 0.25 DNFB in a 4 1 acetone olive oil solution was applied to the left inner and outer ear surface. This application resulted in the induction of swelling to the left ear and under these conditions all animals responded to this treatment with ear swelling. A vehicle control solution of 4 1 acetone olive oil was applied to the right inner and outer ear. Twenty four hours later mice were anaesthetized and measurements of the left and right ear were taken using a digital micrometer. The difference between the two ears was recorded as the amount of swelling induced by the challenge of DNFB. Drug treatment groups were compared to vehicle control to generate the percent reduction in ear swelling. Dexamethasone is routinely used as a positive control as it has broad anti inflammatory activity.

All injections are performed under anesthesia. 60 female Lewis rats 150 170 are anesthetized by inhalation isoflurane using a small animal anesthesia machine. The animals are placed in the induction chamber until anesthetized by delivery of 4 5 isoflurane in Oand then held in that state using a nose cone on the procedure table. Maintenance level of isoflurane is at 1 2 . Animals are injected intraperitoneally i.p. with a single injection of purified PG PS 10S Group A D58 strain concentration 25 g g of bodyweight suspended in sterile 0.85 saline. Each animal receives a total volume of 500 microliters administered in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen using a 1 milliliter syringe with a 23 gauge needle. Placement of the needle is critical to avoid injecting the PG PS 10S into either the stomach or caecum. Animals are under continuous observation until fully recovered from anesthesia and moving about the cage. An acute response of a sharp increase in ankle measurement typically 20 above baseline measurement can peak in 3 5 days post injection. Treatment with test compounds can be PO SC IV or IP. Rats are dosed no more than two times in a 24 hour time span. Treatment can begin on day 0 or any day after that through day 30. The animals are weighed on days 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and beginning again on day 12 30 or until the study is terminated. Paw ankle diameter is measured with a digital caliper on the left and right side on day 0 prior to injection and again on day 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7. On day 12 measurements begin again and continue on through day 30. At this time animals can be anesthetized with isoflurane as described above and terminal blood samples can be obtained by tail vein draws for the evaluation of the compound blood levels clinical chemistry or hematology parameters. Animals are them euthanized with carbon dioxide overdose. A thoracotomy can be conducted as a means of death verification.

Each rat receives a total volume of 10 microliters administered into the tibiotalar joint space using a 1 milliliter syringe with a 27 gauge needle. Animals are under continuous observation until fully recovered from anesthesia and moving about the cage. Animals that respond 2 3 days later with a sharp increase in ankle measurement typically 20 above baseline measurement on the initial i.a. injection are included in the study. On day 14 all responders are anesthetized again using the procedure previously described. Animals receive an intravenous I.V. injection of PG PS concentration 250 uL mL . Each rat receives a total volume of 400 microliters administered slowly into the lateral tail vein using a 1 milliliter syringe with a 27 gauge needle. Baseline ankle measurements are measured prior to IV injection and continue through the course of inflammation or out to day 10. Treatment with test compounds will be PO SC IV or IP. Rats are dosed no more than two times in a 24 hour time span. Treatment can begin on day 0 or any day after that through day 24. The animals are weighed on days 0 1 2 3 4 5 and beginning again on day 14 24 or until the study is terminated.

Efficacy of a compound provided herein in treating preventing and or managing asthma can be assessed using an conventional animal models including various mice models described in for example Nials et al. 1 4 5 213 220 2008 .

Several models are known in the art and any of such models can be used. Although various allergens can be used to induce asthma like conditions the principle is consistent throughout the methods. Briefly asthma like conditions are induced through multiple systemic administration of the allergen e.g. ova house dust mite extracts and cockroach extracts in the presence of an adjuvant such as aluminum hydroxide. Alternatively an adjuvant free system can be used but it usually requires a higher number of exposures to achieve suitable sensitization. Once induced animals exhibit many key features of clinical asthma such as elevated levels of IgE airway inflammation goblet cell hyperplasia epithelial hypertrophy AHR ro specific stimuli and early and late phase bronchoconstriction. Potential efficacy of a compound thus can be assessed by determining whether one or more of these clinical features are reversed or mitigated.

Chronic allergen challenge models aim to reproduce more of the features of the clinical asthma such as airway remodeling and persistent AHR than acute challenge models. While allergens similar to those used in acute allergen challenge models can be used in chronic allergen challenge models animals are subjected to repeated exposure of the airways to low levels of allergen for a period of up to 12 weeks. Once induced animals exhibit key features of human asthma such as allergen dependent sensitization a Th2 dependent allergic inflammation characterized by eosinophillic influx into the airway mucosa AHR and airway remodeling as evidenced by goblet cell hyperplasia epithelial hypertrophy subepithelial or peribronchiolar fibrosis. Potential efficacy of a compound thus can be assessed by determining whether one or more of these clinical features are reversed or mitigated.

Efficacy of a compound provided herein in treating preventing and or managing psoriasis can be assessed using an conventional animal models including various animal models described in for example Boehncke et al. 25 596 605 2007 .

As an example the mouse model based on adoptive transfer of CD4CD45RBT cells described in Hong et al. 162 7480 7491 1999 can be made. Briefly female BALB cBY donor and C.B. 17 Prkdc scid scid recipient mice are housed in a specific pathogen free environment and are used between 6 and 8 weeks of age. CD4 T cells are enriched from BALB cBy splenocytes using a mouse CD4 enrichment kit. The cells are then labeled with PE conjugated anti CD4 FITC conjugated anti CD45RB and APC conjugated anti CD25 antibodies. Cells are sorted using a cell sorter. CD4CD45RBCD25 cells are collected. Cells are resuspended in saline and 4 10cells mouse are injected i.p. into C.B. 17 Prkdc scid scid mice. Mice may be dosed with LPS cytokines or antibodies as necessary. Mice are monitored for external signs of skin lesions twice each week. After the termination ear back skin lymph nodes and spleen may be collected for further ex vivo studies.

A compound s efficacy in treating scleroderma can be tested using animal models. An exemplary animal model is a mouse model for scleroderma induced by repeated local injections of bleomycin BLM described for example in Yamamoto et al. 112 456 462 1999 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. This mouse model provides dermal sclerosis that closely resembles systemic sclerosis both histologically and biochemically. The sclerotic changes observed in the model include but are not limited to thickened and homogenous collagen bundles and cellular filtrates gradual increase in number of mast cells degranulation of mast cells elevated histamine release increase in hydroxyproline in skin presence of anti nuclear antibody in serum and strong expression of transforming growth factor 2 mRNA. Therefore efficacy of a compound in treating scleroderma can be assessed by monitoring the lessening of one or more of these changes.

Briefly the following exemplary procedures can be used to generate the mouse model for scleroderma Specific pathogen free female BALB C mice and C3H mice of 6 weeks old weighing about 20 g are purchased and maintained with food and water ad libitum. BLM is dissolved in PBS at differing concentrations and sterilized with filtration. Aliquots of each concentration of BLM or PBS are injected subcutaneously into the shaved back of the mice daily for 1 4 weeks with a needle. Alternatively mice are injected every other day.

Histolopathological and biochemical changes induced can be assessed using any methods commonly practiced in the field. For example histopathological changes can be assessed using a standard avidine biotin peroxidase technique with anti L3T4 monoclonal antibody anti Lyt2 monoclonal antibody anti mouse pan tissue fixed macrophage antibody anti stem cell factor monoclonal antibody anti transforming growth factor polyclonal antibody and anti decorin antibody. Cytokine expression of cellular infiltrates can be assessed by using several anti cytokine antibodies. Hydroxyproline level can be assessed by hydrolyzing skin pieces with hydrochloric acid neutralizing with sodium hydroxide and colorimetrically assessing the hydrolates at 560 nm with p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. Pepsin resistant collagen can be assessed by treating collagen sample extracted from biopsied tissues and analyzing by polyacrylamide stacking gel electrophoresis. Mast cells can be identified by toluidine blue and cells containing matachromatic granules can be counted under high magnification of a light microscope. Serum levels of various cytokines can be assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and mRNA levels of the cytokines can be assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Autoantibodies in serum can be detected using 3T3 fibroblasts as the substrate for the screening.

A compound s efficacy in treating myositis e.g. dermatomyositis can be tested using animal models known in the art. One such example is the familial canine dermatomyositis model described in Hargis et al. 120 2 323 325 1985 . Another example is the rabbit myosin induced mouse model described in Phyanagi et al. 60 10 3118 3127 2009 .

Briefly 5 week old male SJL J mice are used. Purified myosin from rabbit skeletal muscle 6.6 mg ml is emulsified with an equal amount of Freund s complete adjuvant and 3.3 mg ml . The mice are immunized repeatedly with emulsified rabbit myosin. Once myositis is induced inflammatory cell filtration and necrotic muscle fiber should be evident in the model. In the muscles of animals CD4 T cells are mainly located in the perimysum and CD8 T cells are mainly located in the endomysium and surround non necrotic muscle fibers. TNF IFN and perforin are up regulated and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 is increased in the muscles.

To assess the efficacy of a compound following administration of the compound through adequate route at specified dose the mice are killed and muscle tissues are harvested. The muscle tissue is immediately frozen in chilled isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen and then cryostat sections are prepared. The sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin for counting of number of infiltrated cells. Three sections from each mouse are prepared and photomicrographs are obtained. For immunohistochemical tests cryostat sections of muscle are dried and fixed in cold acetone at 20 C. The slides are rehydrated in PBS and then endogeneous peroxide activity is blocked by incubation in 1 hydrogen peroxide. The sections are incubated overnight with rat anti mouse CD4 monoclonal antibody rat anti mouse CD8 monoclonal antibody rat anti mouse F4 80 monoclonal antibody or normal rat IgG in antibody diluent. The samples are washed with PBS and incubated with biotin conjugated rabbit anti rat IgG pretreated with 5 normal mouse serum. After washing with PBS the samples are incubated with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase. After washing PBS diaminobenzidine is used for visualization.

A compound s efficacy in treating Sj gren s syndrome can be tested using animal models known in the art for example those described in Chiorini et al. 33 190 196 2009 . Examples include mouse model spontaneously developed in first filial generation of NZB mice crossed to NZW mice see e.g. Jonsson et al. 42 93 101 1987 mouse model induced by i.p. injection of incomplete Freund s adjuvant id. Deshmukh et al. 38 42 27 2009 NOD mouse models wherein Sj gren s phenotype is developed by specific genotypes see e.g. Cha et al. 46 1390 1398 2002 Kong et al. 16 675 681 1998 Podolin et al. 178 793 803 1993 and Rasooly et al. 81 287 292 1996 mouse model developed in spontaneous lpr mutation mouse model developed in Id3 knock out mice see e.g. Li et al. 21 551 560 2004 mouse model developed in PI3K knock out mice see e.g. Oak et al. 103 16882 16887 2006 mouse model developed in BAFF over expressing transgenic mice see e.g. Groom et al. 109 59 68 2002 mouse model induced by injection of Ro antigen into BALB c mice see e.g. Oh Hora et al. 9 432 443 2008 mouse model induced by injection of carbonic anhydrase II see e.g. Nishimori et al. 154 4865 4873 1995 mouse model developed in IL 14 over expressing transgenic mice see e.g. Shen et al. 177 5676 5686 2006 and mouse model developed in IL 12 expressing transgenic mice see e.g. McGrath Morrow et al. 291 L837 846 2006 .

The Arthus reaction is a type 3 immune response to immune complexes and thus can be a mechanistic model supporting therapeutic hypothesis for immune complex mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis lupus and other autoimmune diseases. For example PI3K and deficient mice can be used as experimental models of the Arthus reaction and provide assessment of therapeutic potential of a compound as to the treatment of immune complex mediated diseases. The Arthus reaction can be induced using the following exemplary procedures as described in Konrad et al. 2008 283 48 33296 33303.

PI3K and PI3K deficient mice are maintained under dry barrier conditions. Mice are anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and the trachea is cannulated. Appropriate amount of protein G purified anti OVA IgG Ab is applied and appropriate amount of OVA antigen is given intravenously. For PI3K blocking experiments wortmanin is given intratracheally together with the application of anti OVA igG. Mice are killed at 2 4 hours after initiation of inflammation and desired follow up assessments can be performed using methods known in the art.

A compound s ability in selectively inhibiting PI3K can be assessed using RAJI cells i.e. B lymphocyte cells derived from lymphoma patients. Briefly serum starved RAJI cells are stimulated with anti human IgM thereby causing signaling through the B cell receptors as described in for example He et al. 2009 33 798 802. B cell receptor signaling is important for the activation differentiation and survival of B cells and certain B cell derived cancers. Reduction of phospho AKT is indicative of compounds that may inhibit B cell proliferation and function in certain diseases. By monitoring the reduction of phospho AKT in stimulated RAJI cells using for example phospho AKT antibodies a compound s potential efficacy in selectively inhibiting PI3K can be assessed.

Certain compounds provided herein e.g. Compounds 5 38 103 105 106 107 108 and 109 were tested in RAJI cell model using procedures as described above. It was found that ICvalues for phospho AKT are as follows Compounds 5 38 103 105 106 107 108 and 109 in the range of less than 100 nM.

A compound s ability in selectively inhibiting PI3K can be assessed using RAW264.7 macrophages. Briefly serum starved PAW264.7 cells are stimulated with a known GPCR agonist C5a. See e.g. Camps et al. 2005 11 9 936 943 . Cells can be treated with test compounds prior to simultaneously with or subsequent to the stimulation by C5a. RAW 264.7 cells respond to the complement component fragment C5a through activation of the C5a receptor and the C5a receptor activates macrophages and induces cell migration. Test compounds ability to inhibit C5a mediated AKT phosphorylation is indicative of selective inhibition of PI3K . Thus by monitoring the reduction of phospho AKT in stimulated RAW 264.7 cells using for example phospho AKT antibodies a compound s potential efficacy in selectively inhibiting PI3K can be assessed.
