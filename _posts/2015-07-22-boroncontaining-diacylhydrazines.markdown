This invention is in the fields of biotechnology genetic engineering gene expression and medicinal chemistry. The invention provides novel boron containing diacylhydrazines and the use of these compounds in nuclear receptor based inducible gene expression systems.

In the field of genetic engineering precise control of gene expression is a valuable tool for studying manipulating and controlling development and other physiological processes. Gene expression is a complex biological process involving a number of specific protein protein interactions. In order for gene expression to be triggered such that it produces the RNA necessary as the first step in protein synthesis a transcriptional activator must be brought into proximity of a promoter that controls gene transcription. Typically the transcriptional activator itself is associated with a protein that has at least one DNA binding domain that binds to DNA binding sites present in the promoter regions of genes. Thus for gene expression to occur a protein comprising a DNA binding domain and a transactivation domain located at an appropriate distance from the DNA binding domain must be brought into the correct position in the promoter region of the gene.

The traditional transgenic approach utilizes a cell type specific promoter to drive the expression of a designed transgene. A DNA construct containing the transgene is first incorporated into a host genome. When triggered by a transcriptional activator expression of the transgene occurs in a given cell type.

Another means to regulate expression of foreign genes in cells is through inducible promoters. Examples of the use of such inducible promoters include the PR1 a promoter prokaryotic repressor operator systems immunosuppressive immunophilin systems and higher eukaryotic transcription activation systems such as steroid hormone receptor systems and are described below.

The PR1 a promoter from tobacco is induced during the systemic acquired resistance response following pathogen attack. The use of PR1 a may be limited because it often responds to endogenous materials and external factors such as pathogens UV B radiation and pollutants. Gene regulation systems based on promoters induced by heat shock interferon and heavy metals have been described Wurn et al. 83 5414 5418 1986 Arnheiter et al. 62 51 61 1990 Filmus et al. 20 27550 27560 1992 . However these systems have limitations due to their effect on expression of non target genes. These systems are also leaky.

Prokaryotic repressor operator systems utilize bacterial repressor proteins and the unique operator DNA sequences to which they bind. Both the tetracycline Tet and lactose Lac repressor operator systems from the bacterium have been used in plants and animals to control gene expression. In the Tet system tetracycline binds to the TetR repressor protein resulting in a conformational change that releases the repressor protein from the operator which as a result allows transcription to occur. In the Lac system a lac operon is activated in response to the presence of lactose or synthetic analogs such as isopropyl b D thiogalactoside. Unfortunately the use of such systems is restricted by unstable chemistry of the ligands i.e. tetracycline and lactose their toxicity their natural presence or the relatively high levels required for induction or repression. For similar reasons utility of such systems in animals is limited.

Immunosuppressive molecules such as FK506 rapamycin and cyclosporine A can bind to immunophilins FKBP12 cyclophilin etc. Using this information a general strategy has been devised to bring together any two proteins simply by placing FK506 on each of the two proteins or by placing FK506 on one and cyclosporine A on another one. A synthetic homodimer of FK506 FK1012 or a compound resulted from fusion of FK506 cyclosporine FKCsA can then be used to induce dimerization of these molecules Spencer et al. 262 1019 24 1993 Belshaw et al. 93 4604 7 1996 . Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to FKBP12 and VP16 activator domain fused to cyclophilin and FKCsA compound were used to show heterodimerization and activation of a reporter gene under the control of a promoter containing Gal4 binding sites. Unfortunately this system includes immunosuppressants that can have unwanted side effects and therefore limits its use for various mammalian gene switch applications.

Higher eukaryotic transcription activation systems such as steroid hormone receptor systems have also been employed. Steroid hormone receptors are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and are found in vertebrate and invertebrate cells. Unfortunately use of steroidal compounds that activate the receptors for the regulation of gene expression particularly in plants and mammals is limited due to their involvement in many other natural biological pathways in such organisms. In order to overcome such difficulties an alternative system has been developed using insect ecdysone receptors EcR .

Growth molting and development in insects are regulated by the ecdysone steroid hormone molting hormone and the juvenile hormones Dhadialla et al. 43 545 569 1998 . The molecular target for ecdysone in insects consists of at least ecdysone receptor EcR and ultraspiracle protein USP . EcR is a member of the nuclear steroid receptor super family that is characterized by signature DNA and ligand binding domains and an activation domain Koelle et al. 67 59 77 1991 . EcR receptors are responsive to a number of steroidal compounds such as ponasterone A and muristerone A. Non steroidal compounds with ecdysteroid agonist activity have been described including the commercially available insecticides tebufenozide and methoxyfenozide that are marketed by Rohm and Haas Company see WO 96 27673 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 530 028 . Both analogs have exceptional safety profiles in other organisms.

The insect ecdysone receptor EcR heterodimerizes with Ultraspiracle USP the insect homologue of the mammalian retinoid X receptor RXR and binds ecdysteroids and ecdysone receptor response elements to activate transcription of ecdysone responsive genes. The EcR USP ligand complexes play important roles during insect development and reproduction. The EcR has five modular domains A B transactivation C DNA binding heterodimerization D Hinge heterodimerization E ligand binding heterodimerization and transactivation and F transactivation domains. Some of these domains such as A B C and E retain their function when they are fused to other proteins.

Tightly regulated inducible gene expression systems or gene switches are useful for various applications such as gene therapy large scale production of proteins in cells cell based high throughput screening assays functional genomics and regulation of traits in transgenic plants and animals.

The first version of an EcR based gene switch used EcR DmEcR and RXR MmRXR and showed that these receptors in the presence of steroid ponasterone A transactivate reporter genes in mammalian cell lines and transgenic mice Christopherson et al. 89 6314 6318 1992 No et al. 93 3346 3351 1996 . Later Suhr et al. 95 7999 8004 1998 showed that non steroidal ecdysone agonist tebufenozide induced high level of transactivation of reporter genes in mammalian cells through EcR BmEcR in the absence of exogenous heterodimer partner.

WO 97 38117 and WO99 58155 disclose methods for modulating the expression of an exogenous gene in which a DNA construct comprising the exogenous gene and an ecdysone response element is activated by a second DNA construct comprising an ecdysone receptor that in the presence of a ligand therefore and optionally in the presence of a receptor capable of acting as a silent partner binds to the ecdysone response element to induce gene expression. The ecdysone receptor of choice was isolated from . Typically such systems require the presence of the silent partner preferably retinoid X receptor RXR in order to provide optimum activation. In mammalian cells insect ecdysone receptor EcR heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor RXR and regulates expression of target genes in a ligand dependent manner. WO 99 02683 discloses that the ecdysone receptor isolated from the silk moth is functional in mammalian systems without the need for an exogenous dimer partner.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 265 173 B1 discloses that various members of the steroid thyroid superfamily of receptors can combine with ultraspiracle receptor USP or fragments thereof comprising at least the dimerization domain of USP for use in a gene expression system. U.S. Pat. No. 5 880 333 discloses a EcR and ultraspiracle USP heterodimer system used in plants in which the transactivation domain and the DNA binding domain are positioned on two different hybrid proteins. Unfortunately these USP based systems are constitutive in animal cells and therefore are not effective for regulating reporter gene expression.

In each of these cases the transactivation domain and the DNA binding domain either as native EcR as in WO 99 02683 or as modified EcR as in WO 97 38117 were incorporated into a single molecule and the other heterodimeric partners either USP or RXR were used in their native state.

Drawbacks of the above described EcR based gene regulation systems include a considerable background activity in the absence of ligands and non applicability of these systems for use in both plants and animals see U.S. Pat. No. 5 880 333 . Therefore a need exists in the art for improved EcR based systems to precisely modulate the expression of exogenous genes in both plants and animals. Such improved systems would be useful for applications such as gene therapy large scale production of proteins and antibodies cell based high throughput screening assays functional genomics and regulation of traits in transgenic animals. For certain applications such as gene therapy it may be desirable to have an inducible gene expression system that responds well to synthetic non steroid ligands and at the same time is insensitive to the natural steroids. Thus improved systems that are simple compact and dependent on ligands that are relatively inexpensive readily available and of low toxicity to the host would prove useful for regulating biological systems.

It has been shown that an ecdysone receptor based inducible gene expression system in which the transactivation and DNA binding domains are separated from each other by placing them on two different proteins results in greatly reduced background activity in the absence of a ligand and significantly increased activity over background in the presence of a ligand see WO 01 70816 A1 . This two hybrid system is a significantly improved inducible gene expression modulation system compared to the two systems disclosed in applications WO 97 38117 and WO 99 02683. The two hybrid system exploits the ability of a pair of interacting proteins to bring the transcription activation domain into a more favorable position relative to the DNA binding domain such that when the DNA binding domain binds to the DNA binding site on the gene the transactivation domain more effectively activates the promoter see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 283 173 . Briefly the two hybrid gene expression system comprises two gene expression cassettes the first encoding a DNA binding domain fused to a nuclear receptor polypeptide and the second encoding a transactivation domain fused to a different nuclear receptor polypeptide. In the presence of ligand the interaction of the first polypeptide with the second polypeptide effectively tethers the DNA binding domain to the transactivation domain. Since the DNA binding and transactivation domains reside on two different molecules the background activity in the absence of ligand is greatly reduced.

A two hybrid system also provides improved sensitivity to non steroidal ligands for example diacylhydrazines when compared to steroidal ligands for example ponasterone A PonA or muristerone A MurA . That is when compared to steroids the non steroidal ligands provide higher activity at a lower concentration. Furthermore the two hybrid system avoids some side effects due to overexpression of RXR that often occur when unmodified RXR is used as a heterodimer receptor partner. In one two hybrid system native DNA binding and transactivation domains of EcR or RXR are eliminated and as a result these hybrid molecules have less chance of interacting with other steroid hormone receptors present in the cell resulting in reduced side effects.

In addition a host cell may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted polynucleotide or modifies and processes the polypeptide product in the specific fashion desired. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the translational and post translational processing and modification e.g. glycosylation cleavage e.g. of signal sequence of proteins. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the desired modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. For example expression in a bacterial system can be used to produce a non glycosylated core protein product. However a polypeptide expressed in bacteria may not be properly folded. Expression in yeast can produce a glycosylated product. Expression in eukaryotic cells can increase the likelihood of native glycosylation and folding of a heterologous protein. Moreover expression in mammalian cells can provide a tool for reconstituting or constituting the polypeptide s activity. Furthermore different vector host expression systems may affect processing reactions such as proteolytic cleavages to a different extent.

In one embodiment the host cell comprises two or more orthogonal gene switches. Two or more individually operable gene regulation systems are said to be orthogonal when a modulation of each of the given gene switches by its respective ligand results in a measurable change in the magnitude of expression of the gene that is regulated by that gene switch and b the change is statistically significantly different than the change in expression of all other gene switches that are in the host cell. In one embodiment regulation of each individually operable gene switch system effects a change in gene expression at least 2 fold 3 fold 4 fold 5 fold 10 fold 20 fold 50 fold 70 fold 100 fold 200 fold 300 fold 400 fold or 500 fold greater than all of the other operable gene switches in the host cell. Non limiting examples of orthogonal gene switch systems are set forth in U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2002 0110861 A1.

The reagent was incubated with the cells for 10 120 minutes prior to reading on a Molecular Devices Spectramax L luminometer. The assay reagents were prepared as per the manufacturer s instructions.

The Luciferase expression data was normalized to the baseline signal from cells treated with DMSO alone. The ratio of signal from treated cells to vehicle treated cells was plotted and non linear regress was performed using Graph Pad Prism software. EC log ECand Hill slope data was generated. Reporter gene expression e.g. luciferase expression serves as a proxy for the expression of a gene of interest. See e.g. US 2009 0123441 and WO 2011 119773.

The pharmacokinetics of representative Compounds of the Disclosure Chart 1 and representative DAHs that do not contain a boron atom Chart 2 were determined according to the following protocol 

Female Sprague Dawley rats were fasted for at least 8 hours overnight prior to oral dosing of the compound via gavage 10 mg kg vehicle 2 mg mL of Capryol 90 Triacetin 1 1 v v 3 animals compound and weighed prior to dosing. The correct volume of the appropriate formulation was administered based on that day s animal body weight. Body weight dose volume and dosing time was recorded for each animal. Animals were not fed for at least 4 hours following activator ligand administration.

Approximately 200 L blood sample was collected from the catheter sample points in EDTA tubes at each time point from each animal. The exact time of blood collection was recorded for each animal. Blood samples were held at 4 C. wet ice starting immediately after collection and were centrifuged within 15 minutes from the collection for 12 minutes at 2500 rpm. After centrifugation plasma samples were stored at 80 C. until assay. Sample times were as follows Day 0 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 6 and 8 hours Day 1 24 hours.

LC MS MS Method Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with protein precipitation method was used to quantify the compound in rat plasma samples collected from all animals dosed with the ligand. Linearity range was from 1 ng mL to 1000 ng mL with correlation coefficient for calibration curves above 0.99 and analyte quantified within 15 of target at all calibrator concentrations.

The following PK parameters of the compound in plasma were calculated using non compartmental method of WinNonlin software Version 5.3 or higher maximum concentration C time of maximum concentration T half life t area under the curve from time zero to the last sample AUC and oral clearance.

Descriptive statistics mean standard deviation SD coefficient of variation CV median minimum and maximum were used to summarize the PK parameters for the compound in all groups data not shown .

The plasma ligand concentration was calculated by extrapolating the area under the curve values for the samples from the standard curve generated by the Analyst software program. The ng mL values for the plasma samples representing all the animals were used to generate the pharmacokinetic PK parameters. As shown in Table 3 Compounds of the Disclosure have unexpectedly higher Cand Tvalues and unexpectedly lower clearance values than the DAHs that do not contain a boron atom.

The fLUC expression following intramuscular IM injection of Ad RTS fLUC and representative Compounds of the Disclosure by oral gavage in female CD1 mice was determined according to the following protocol 

Compounds were formulated at a concentration of 20 mg mL in Capryol90 Triacetin 1 1 v v and orally administered by oral gavage at 100 mg kg dose.

Ad RTS fLUC starting concentration of 1.1 10vp mL was stored in A195 storage buffer 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 0.1 mM EDTA 1 mM MgCl 10 mM Histidine 75 mM NaCl 5 sucrose 0.02 Ps 80 and 0.5 EtOH Evans et al. 1997 . The routes of administration for Ad RTS fLUC in this study were via IM on the right and left gastroc gastrocnemius muscle.

On Study Day 1 mice received a dose of 1 10vp 100 l total of Ad RTS fLUC IM on the right and left gastroc muscles with 50 l each.

A single administration of the test compound was administered by oral gavage based upon body weight to the designated groups starting 24 hrs after the last set of Ad RTS fLUC injection on Day 0.

IVIS was performed 6 24 and 48 hours after the last gavage dosing on Day 0. Once the animal was properly anesthetized 150 mg kg of luciferin diluted in PBS was administered by IP route. The animals were placed in a nosecone on the IVIS surface. The imaging parameters and calibration curve were determined empirically Caliper Life Sciences Living Image Software . Images were acquired within approximately 15 minutes post injection. After imaging animals were returned to their cage and monitored until completely recovered from anesthesia.

Data analysis and image reconstruction were performed using the Living Image Software Version 4.0. Luminescent levels were quantified by measuring individual region of interest ROI markers manually drawn around the area of interest. These markers isolate the ROI filtering out any unwanted level of expression. Using the software correction tools background noise and pixilated bleed over was removed to reduce variability. Surface radiance levels light intensity emitted from the tissue surface were measured by the amount of photon particles per second p sec emitted by the ROI. These values are expressed as Max Radiance or Total Flux.

The IVIS data was summarized and compared among the treatment groups to evaluate fLUC inducibility. The results are presented in . The data show that representative Compounds of the Disclosure activate the Rheoswitch in vivo. The placebo data depicted in were taken from a similar study.
