This present application is continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 463 287 titled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SR IOV PASS THRU VIA AN INTERMEDIARY DEVICE filed May 3 2012 which claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 482 553 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR SR IOV PASS THRU VIA AN INTERMEDIARY DEVICE and filed May 4 2011 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks and virtualized environments. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for performance scalability in a virtualized environment using SR IOV technology.

XenServer is an enterprise class server virtualization platform. In XenServer multiple virtual machines can be created. Each virtual machine can run operating systems like FreeBSD Windows and Linux. All the virtual machines can run simultaneously. XenServer helps in the reducing the number of physical servers in the IT and datacenter infrastructures. The benefits of virtualization are several. Some of them are less number of physical servers are required less power consumption and less rack space in the data center.

For virtual machines to communicate with other virtual machines or external hosts the virtual machines need network interfaces or network interface cards NICs . In an example embodiment of a virtualized environment using XenServer XenServer provides two types of Networks interfaces para virtualized NICs referred to as PV NICs and emulated NICs referred to as VNICs or virtual NICS . When a virtual machine VM transmits a packet on a VNIC XenServer Domain0 receives the packet and forwards the packet on a real physical NIC Domain0 is a special VM in XenServer Similarly when XenServer receives a packet the VM forwards the packet to the appropriate VNIC and the VM to which the VNIC belongs receives the packet. Realize that XenServer is involved in both transmit and receive path of a packet. This architecture has benefits. For example if the VNIC emulates a network device for which the guest VM already has a driver the guest VMs can run on XenServer without any modification and use existing network drivers. Also this architecture hides the actual networking hardware from the guest VM. As long as the guest VM has driver for the VNIC the guest VM doesn t care what networking hardware is present on the actual server.

However if a virtual machine requires very high networking performance the XenServer networking architecture may become a bottleneck as all the RX receive TX transmit packets need to go through XenServer Domain0. In some embodiment Domain0 can run on only one CPU and this limits the networking performance. Some embodiments of XenServer can process approximately 3 gbps of network traffic varies based on the CPU speed . If multiple instances of a virtual packet processing engine are run on the XenServer the aggregate throughput will be around 3 gbps. This throughput may be very low compared to hardware based versions of the packet processing engine.

SR IOV technology may be used in the virtualized environment and packet processing engines to address the above identified IO bottleneck problem. The SR IOV specification is a standard for a type of PCI pass through which natively shares a single device to multiple guests. SR IOV reduces hypervisor involvement by specifying virtualization compatible memory spaces interrupts and DMA streams. SR IOV improves device performance for virtualized guests. SR IOV allows a PCIe device to appear to be multiple separate physical PCIe devices.

With SR IOV technology XenServer can create virtual functions devices from a physical device and these virtual devices can be assigned to virtual machines Once a virtual machine has a virtual device assigned the virtual machine can receive and transmit packets from the virtual device without the intervention of XenServer. The virtual machine may require a driver for the virtual device. In an example embodiment Intel 82599 NICs are used in the device and are SR IOV capable. If SR IOV is enabled on XenServer the Intel 82599 device driver in XenServer creates virtual functions and these virtual functions appear as PCI devices in the system.

The present solution is directed to an intermediary device having a virtualized environments operating a plurality of packet processing engines to process and accelerate network traffic traversing the intermediary device. that supports multi tenancy and scalable performance while being easy to provision and having elasticity. Multi tenancy of the device may be achieved via virtualization technologies such as running multiple instances of a virtualized packet processing engine on a hypervisor. Performance scalability may be achieved using SR IOV technology and the pass thru techniques described herein. Provision of the device is made simpler or easy via a Service Virtual Machine VM . The device may be elastic in that the device has the ability to upgrade or downgrade capacity without requiring a reboot of the device. This elasticity may be implemented using a dynamic rate limiting technology.

Illustrated in are some embodiments of work task load or network traffic distribution across one or more processor cores according to a type of parallelism or parallel computing scheme such as functional parallelism data parallelism or flow based data parallelism. In brief overview illustrates embodiments of a multi core system such as an appliance with n cores a total of cores numbers through N. In one embodiment work load or network traffic can be distributed among a first core A a second core B a third core C a fourth core D a fifth core E a sixth core F a seventh core G and so on such that distribution is across all or two or more of the n cores N hereinafter referred to collectively as cores . There may be multiple VIPs each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. There may be multiple packet engines each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. Any of the approaches used may lead to different varying or similar work load or performance level across any of the cores. For a functional parallelism approach each core may run a different function of the functionalities provided by the packet engine a VIP or appliance . In a data parallelism approach data may be paralleled or distributed across the cores based on the Network Interface Card NIC or VIP receiving the data. In another data parallelism approach processing may be distributed across the cores by distributing data flows to each core.

In further detail to in some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores according to functional parallelism . Functional parallelism may be based on each core performing one or more respective functions. In some embodiments a first core may perform a first function while a second core performs a second function. In functional parallelism approach the functions to be performed by the multi core system are divided and distributed to each core according to functionality. In some embodiments functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to functional parallelism can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input output management NW I O A secure sockets layer SSL encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol TCP functions C. This may lead to a work performance or computing load based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core may perform SSL offloading while core may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core B may handle SSL offloading while Core D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP A VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core A because the load A on Core is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core A the amount of load A on Core A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core D because Core D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

In some instances the packet engine s A N can be configured to carry out the any of the functional and or data parallelism schemes illustrated in .

Each core A N in one embodiment can be associated with a particular packet engine such that load balancing can be carried out by the packet engine. Load balancing may in this embodiment require that each packet engine A N associated with a core communicate with the other packet engines associated with cores so that the packet engines A N can collectively determine where to distribute load. One embodiment of this process can include an arbiter that receives votes from each packet engine for load. The arbiter can distribute load to each packet engine A N based in part on the age of the engine s vote and in some cases a priority value associated with the current amount of load on an engine s associated core .

A core may have or use memory that is shared or assigned to multiple cores. The memory may be considered public or shared memory that is accessible by more than one core. A core may use any combination of private and public memory. With separate address spaces for each core some level of coordination is eliminated from the case of using the same address space. With a separate address space a core can perform work on information and data in the core s own address space without worrying about conflicts with other cores. Each packet engine may have a separate memory pool for TCP and or SSL connections.

For example one device may comprise two or more cores and another device may comprise two or more cores. For example a multi core system may include a cluster of computing devices a server farm or network of computing devices. In some embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of cores the functionality may be deployed on a plurality of processors such as a plurality of single core processors.

In one embodiment the cores may be any type and form of processor. In some embodiments a core can function substantially similar to any processor or central processing unit described herein.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet. In other embodiments the RSS module may employ a different RSS scheme than the MICROSOFT scheme. For example the MICROSOFT RSS scheme may apply to a maximum of 64 processors or cores. In embodiments where a greater number of cores are used the RSS module may employ a different RSS scheme configured to distribute packets across any number of cores up to 128 256 512 or any other number.

The RSS module can apply any type and form of hash function such as the Toeplitz hash function. The hash function may be applied to the hash type or any of the sequence of values. The hash function may be a secure hash of any security level or one that is otherwise cryptographically secure. The hash function may use a hash key. The size of the key is dependent upon the hash function. For the Toeplitz hash the size may be 40 bytes for IPv6 and 16 bytes for IPv4.

In many embodiments the hash key may be generated or selected when the appliance boots. In other embodiments the hash key may be generated or selected once per week once per day once per hour or any other interval of time.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 or 128 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values. The following are example of hash types that may be used by RSS 

The hash result or any portion thereof may used to identify a core or entity such as a packet engine or VIP for distributing a network packet. In some embodiments one or more hash bits or mask are applied to the hash result. The hash bit or mask may be any number of bits or bytes. A NIC may support any number of bits such as six or seven bits. The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number may be between 1 and 7 inclusive. In other embodiments the number may be higher such as 8 bits or more. In many embodiments the number of bits of the mask may be selected based on the number of processors or cores in a system. For example 6 bits may be used in a system supporting less than 2 6 or 64 processors or cores while 7 bits may be used in a system supporting up to 2 7 or 128 processors or cores.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. Any portion of the hash result or the hast result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. The indirection table may comprise any number of buckets that may be indexed by a hash mask such as 2 to 128 buckets. Each bucket may comprise a range of index values that identify a core or processor. In some embodiments the flow controller and or RSS module may rebalance the network rebalance the network load by changing the indirection table.

In some embodiments the multi core system does not include a RSS driver or RSS module .

In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

F. Systems and Methods for SR IOV Pass Thru in an Intermediary Device Operating Virtualized Packet Processing Engines

Referring now to an embodiment of networking in a virtualized environment of an appliance or device is depicted. The virtualized environment may comprise any embodiments of the virtualized environment described herein such as in connection with . In some embodiments the virtualized environment may include any embodiments of XenServer manufactured and or provided by Citrix Systems Inc. of Ft. Lauderdale Fla. For example XenServer may be installed on a physical server and may run multiple operating systems and virtual machines VM A N. The virtualized environment such as in XenServer may have a special quest guest operating system or VM A referred to as Domain 0. This first guest operating system may boot automatically when the hypervisor boots and receives special management privileges and direct access to all physical hardware by default. A service VM may be used to provide management and provisioning of the virtualized environment and any portions thereof such as the VMs.

The virtualized environment may run or operate a plurality of virtualized packet processing engines or virtual machines of the packet processing engine such as any embodiments of the virtual ADC appliance or packet engine described in For virtual machines to communicate with other virtual machines or external hosts the VMs use virtualized or emulated network interfaces or network interface cards A N. The virtualized environment may provide two types of networks interfaces A N para virtualized NICs PV NICs and emulated NICs referred to as VNICs . In some embodiments the virtualized packet processing engines VPPE or ADC may use either of these types of network interfaces. In some embodiments the VPPE may use PV NICs. When a virtual machine transmits a packet on a VNIC virtualized environment Domain0 receives the packet and forwards the packet on a real physical NIC A N. Similarly when the virtualized environment such as XenServer receives a packet the virtualized environment forwards the packet to the appropriate VNIC and the VM to which the VNIC belongs receives the packet.

In the virtualized environment such as XenServer is involved in both transmit and receive path of a packet. This architecture has some benefits. For example if the VNIC emulates a network device for which the guest VM already has a driver the guest VMs can run on XenServer without any modification and use existing network drivers. Also this architecture hides the actual networking hardware from the guest VM. As long as the guest VM has driver for the VNIC the guest VM doesn t care what networking hardware is present on the actual server. SR IOV technology may be used to address potential bottlenecks with the virtualized environment being in the receive and transmit path and because Domain 0 may only run on one CPU or be limited in scalability.

Single Root I O Virtualization SR IOV is a PCI device virtualization technology that allows a single PCI device to appear as multiple PCI devices on the physical PCI bus. The actual physical device is known as a Physical Function PF while the others are known as Virtual Functions VF . The purpose of this is for the hypervisor to directly assign one or more of these VFs to a Virtual Machine VM using SR IOV technology the guest can then use the VF as any other directly assigned PCI device

With SR IOV technology the virtualized environment such as XenServer can create virtual functions devices A N generally referred to as from a physical device. These virtual devices can be assigned to virtual machines Once a virtual device is assigned to the virtual machine the virtual machine can receive and transmit packets from the virtual device without the intervention of the virtualized environment such as XenServer. The virtual machine uses a driver for the virtual device. In some embodiments the physical NICs of the device may support SR IOV. For example the device may use Intel 82599 NICs which are SR IOV capable. If SR IOV is enabled on the virtualized environment the Intel 82599 device driver in the virtualized environment creates virtual functions and these virtual functions appear as PCI devices in the system.

The following is example embodiment of portions of output from executing the command lspci n to show the physical functions devices and virtual devices functions . lspci n shows the bus device and function Vendor id and device id.

The first two lines of the output are physical functions device id 10fb . The remaining lines of the output are virtual functions device id 10ed . By way of example the following line 10 00.0 0200 8086 10fb rev 01 identified bus 10 device 00 function 0 vendor id 8086 device id 10fb.

In the example embodiment the SR IOV enabled NIC such as the Intel 82599 device can support up to 63 virtual functions. In some aspects the number of virtual functions the device supports indicates the number of VMs that can efficiently share the device simultaneously or otherwise have a corresponding virtual function.

In view of the assignment of virtual functions to virtual machines will be discussed. The virtualized environment may have one or more commands via a command line interface or graphical user interface for assigning virtual functions to virtual machines. In the embodiments of XenServer for example a virtual function can be assigned to a virtual machine using the following command 

In the above command PCI devices 10 10.3 and 10 10.4 are assigned to a VM specified by the uuid parameter. The command is flexible and more PCI devices can be assigned by appending the PCI devices to the pci parameter. If a device is assigned to a VM and the VM is started the assigned device will appear as PCI device in the VM.

Not all devices in the device or appliance of the virtualized environment may support SR IOV. For example Cavium made or manufactured SSL devices used in the hardware version of the appliance are not SR IOV capable. In some embodiments Intel VT d technology allows the hypervisor to pass a PCI device to a virtual machine. Once a device is passed to a Virtual Machine VM no other VM can use that device. The virtualized environment such as XenServer may support PCI pass through. A difference between a SR IOV capable device and a non SR IOV capable device is that a SR IOV device can be shared by multiple VMs at the same time where as a non SR IOV capable device can be used by only one VM. The command used to assign a virtual function to a virtual machine can be used to assign a PCI device pass through to a VM also. In an example embodiment of an appliance or device having a total of 16 Cavium SSL chips these SSL chips can be assigned to 16 different virtualized packet processing engine VPPE or VPX instances.

In a brief summary of the above the virtualized environment such as XenServer can run several virtual machines simultaneously. In some embodiments XenServer network performance is limited as all the network traffic needs to go through XenServer Dom0. XenServer has support for SR IOV. SR IOV virtual devices appear as PCI devices in the XenServer and XenServer has a command and infrastructure to assign these devices to virtual machines. The virtual devices assigned to a virtual machine will appear as a PCI device in the virtual machine. Virtual machine use a device driver for the virtual device and the virtual device RX TX packets are not processed by XenServer e.g. Domain0 . PCI devices that don t support SR IOV can also be assigned to a virtual machine and other virtual machines can t use that PCI device.

In view of further embodiments of the present solution with a virtualized environment such as XenServer several virtualized packet processing engine VPX instances can be run on a single physical server or physical appliance. XenServer provides CPU and memory isolation for each VPX instance. Also the virtualized packet processing engine software versions can be different on different VPX instances. Each instance can be upgraded and downgraded independently. The device having the virtualized environments of and B support and provide multi tenancy as multiple VPX instances can be run on the virtualized environment.

In some embodiments a device driver is added in the VPX to support the virtual function device from the SR IOV implementation such as the Intel 82599 virtual function device. A driver may be designed constructed or configured in the VPX virtualized packet processing engine to support any virtual function of an SR IOV enabled or support device. This device driver may be similar to other packet processing engine device drivers. In some embodiments of the driver link parameters like speed duplex mode flow control can t be changed from the VPX. In some embodiments the driver recognizes the link up down events. In some embodiments the maximum tagged VLAN ids supported per interface on the system is 63. For example only 63 unique tagged VLAN ids may be used across the VPXs running on the system on a particular interface. In some embodiments if a VPX is using link aggregation then all other VPXs running on that system must have similar link aggregation configuration. In some embodiments LACP Link Aggregation Control Protocol is not supported while in other embodiments LACP is supported. In some embodiments the 82599 Virtual Functions do not support promiscuous mode while in other embodiments the 82599 Virtual Functions do support promiscuous mode. In some embodiments the VMACs are not supported as the interface can t be put in promiscuous mode. To support VMACs in some embodiments XenServer physical function PF driver supports multiple MAC addresses for the VF. In some embodiments XenServer PF driver needs to put the VF in multicast promiscuous mode to support IPv6.

In some embodiments the device or appliance may use the Intel 82576 device 1 gbps . The Intel 82576 device supports SR IOV. A driver may be designed constructed or configured in the VPX virtualized packet processing engine to support the Intel 82576 virtual function devices.

A dynamic rate limiting feature is implemented in the VPX to change the rate limits throughput and packets per sec dynamically without requiring a VPX reboot. This dynamic rate limiting feature provides elasticity to embodiments of the appliance.

In some embodiments the virtualized environment of may provide SSL offloading. With a virtualized environment such as XenServer a PCI device can be assigned PCI device pass through to a virtual machine. For example XenServer has a feature which lets a PCI device pass through to an unprivileged domain Only the unprivileged domain may have access to this specific PCI device. The privileged domain may bind to the PCI device with a dummy drive that stops the dom0 from accessing the PCT device as well. The hardware may have a plurality of SSL chips and PCI device pass through feature is used to pass to a SSL chip to a VPX. With a SSL chip passed to VPX the system can offload the SSL processing to the hardware and accelerate the SSL traffic. In some embodiments the VPX may use a Cavium SSL driver that may be used without any modifications.

In some embodiments a service VM is provided for ease of provisioning Whatever runs on the device or appliance should be controlled for optimal performance and maintainability. The virtualized environment may have a command center such as XenCenter for XenServer through which an end user can provision arbitrary virtual machine. In some embodiments the virtualized environments command tool such as XenServer will not be allowed to control the appliance or device. In some embodiments a Service VM is designed and constructed to manage the appliance instead. The Service VM runs as a virtual machine on the appliance and provides http s interface for the appliance management to administrator. The Service VM may be preinstalled on the appliance along with the virtualized environment software. The Service VM may be automatically started when the appliance is powered on.

The Service VM provides several functionalities for the management of the appliance. In some embodiments the Service VM creates or provisions the VPX VM instances. When a VPX VM is created the Service VM will assign a virtual function from each of the ports available on the system. The interface numbering of the ports in the VPX will match with the interface numbering displayed on the hardware. When a VPX instance is created the administrator can pass through a SSL chip to the VPX instance. If a SSL chip is assigned to a VPX instance VPX can offload the SSL processing to the hardware. The Service VM provides for the start shutdown reboot of VPXs removal of a VPX instance and shutdown and reboot of the appliance. The Service VM allows the administrator to specify each VPX instance capacity limits and allows port administration specifying the link speeds flow control parameters etc The Service VM allows upload of VPX images for later provisioning and allows for the upgrade of Service VM software. Service VM shows the list of VPXs provisioned. The Service VM shows the CPU and memory usage statistics

In some embodiments the appliance may support a plurality of VPX instances. At In some embodiments 16 20 VPX instances may run on a predetermined hardware such as a hardware platform with 2 or more Westmere CPUs Xeon X5680 . Each processor may have 6 CPU cores. The total number of CPU cores may be 12. In some embodiments hyper threading may be enabled on the platform and the total number of CPU cores become 24. The XenServer Dom0 may be on CPU0 and a CPU is reserved for Service VM. In some embodiments 22 CPUs will be left for VPXs. In some embodiments a multi core VPX nCore requires 2 virtual or vcpus vcpu0 is management cpu and vpcu1 is packet engine cpu. VPX running on such a platform may have a dedicated CPU for packet engine vcpu. If the platform is running 16 VPXs Out of 22 CPUs 16 CPUs will be reserved for packet engines. The remaining 6 CPUs can be shared by management vcpus of the VPXs. If the platform is running 20 VPXs Out of 22 CPUs 20 CPUs will be reserved for packet engines. The remaining 2 CPUs can be shared by management vcpus of the VPXs. Service VM may balance the load on the 2 Westmere processors for optimal performance. Also Service VM takes care of CPU allocation to the VMs when they are started.

In some embodiments the appliance may come with a license that limits the number of VPXs supported and the total capacity of the system throughput and packets per sec . The number of VPX instances supported is based on the number of packs in the license. One pack enables up to 5 VPX instances. Two packs enables a total of up to 10 VPX instances. With a 20 gbps throughput license the appliance administrator can create any number of VPXs up to the max supported by the number of packs and the throughput can be split among those VPX instances. Example scenario 1 if the license is for 20 gbps throughput and 1 pack the customer can create 4 VPX instances and assign each VPX a 5 gbps throughput limit. If another VPX is provisioned the customer can dynamically change the throughput limits such that each VPX instance throughput limit is 4 gbps. The customer can t provision more than 5 VMs. Example scenario 2 if the license is for 20 gbps throughput and 1 pack the customer can create 4 VPX instances and assign each VPX a 5 gbps throughput limit. If another VPX is provisioned the customer can dynamically reduce the throughput of one VPX instance to 3 gbps and assign 2 gbps license to the newly provisioned VPX instance. The customer can t provision more than 5 VMs. Example scenario 3 if the license is for 20 gbps throughput and 2 packs the customer can create 5 VPX instances and assign each VPX a 4 gbps throughput limit. The customer can provision another 5 VPX instances and reduce the throughput limits such that each VPX handles 2 gbps of traffic.

In some embodiments a device intermediary to a plurality of clients and a plurality of severs executes each virtual machine as one of a virtualized packet processing engine or a virtualized application delivery controller.

The device such as appliance may have one or more physical network interfaces or NICs via which network packets are received and transmitted onto a network or networks . These physical NICs may be SR IOV based or otherwise support SR IOV implementation and technology. These physical NICs may be SR IOV enabled. Each of the virtual machines may have one or more virtual network interfaces A virtual machine may use the virtual network interface to access the virtualized network interface provided by the virtualized environment. In some embodiments the virtual network interface may be an emulated network interface card. In some embodiments the virtual network interface may be a para virtualized network interface card.

At step a plurality of virtual devices or functions are created via a driver for the physical network interface. A SR IOV enabled physical NIC may support implement or provide virtual functions or virtual devices generally referred to as virtual functions or virtual devices . The virtual functions may provide an interface for a plurality of entities such as VMs to share the physical NIC simultaneously or concurrently. The driver may be a SR IOV based driver that implements and or provides the virtual functions. The driver may have an interface or API for creating such virtual functions. In some embodiments the driver is accessible via command line interface to create such functions. In some embodiments a service VM may provide a user interface to access the driver and establish or create these virtual functions. A user such as an administrator may create the virtual functions via a command line interface or service VM. In some embodiments the driver creates the virtual functions based on or responsive to a configuration of or for the driver or physical NIC.

Each physical NIC may support or provide a predetermined number of virtual functions. For example embodiments of the Intel 82599 device and corresponding driver can support up to 63 virtual functions. In some embodiments a virtual function is created for each VM. In some embodiments a virtual function is created for each virtual network interface of a VM. In some embodiments a first predetermined number of virtual functions is created by a first device driver of a first SR IOV enabled physical NIC. In some embodiments a second predetermined number of virtual functions is created by a second device driver of a second SR IOV enabled physical NIC. In some embodiments the virtual functions for the virtual network interface and or VMs on the device are created across a plurality of physical NICs. In some embodiments a predetermined number of virtual functions are created for each physical port of a physical NIC. Each virtual device may be created or established to appear act or be provided as PCI device to the virtualized environment. In some embodiments the virtual driver is created or established to support a promiscuous mode.

At step a virtual device is assigned to each virtual machine. In some embodiments the virtual device is assigned to a virtual machine via a command line interface. In some embodiments the virtual device is assigned to a virtual machine via service VM such as user interface of the service VM. A user such as an administrator may execute commands via a command line or service VM to assign a virtual device to a VM. In some embodiments a virtual device is assigned to a virtual machine that is an unprivileged domain. In some embodiments a virtual device is assigned to a virtual machine that is a privileged domain. In some embodiments the virtualized environment assigns each virtual device to a virtual machine that is identified by a global unique identifier. Each virtual machine may have a driver for the virtual device such as to access via the virtual network interface of the virtual machine.

At step the virtual machines transmit and receive network packets via the physical network interface using the virtual devices. By using the SR IOV enabled virtual function each virtual machine may communicate with the physical NIC and bypass the guest or domain 0 virtual machine of the virtualized environment. In some embodiments each VM may receive and transmit network packets via the physical network interface of the device without traversing a privileged domain of the virtualized environment. In some embodiments each VM may receive and transmit network packets via the physical network interface of the device without processing of the network packets by privileged domain of the virtualized environment.
