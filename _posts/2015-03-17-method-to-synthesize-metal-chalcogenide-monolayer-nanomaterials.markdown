This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 968 182 filed Mar. 20 2014 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to metal chalcogenides and in particular to a method to synthesize metal chalcogenide monolayer nanomaterials.

Synthetic routes to tungsten disulfide WS and molybdenum disulfide MoS nanomaterials e.g. two dimensional 2D monolayers are of interest for lubricants catalyst Li ion batteries semiconductors and photodiodes. Previous efforts to synthesize bulk WSnanomaterials involved chemical vapor deposition techniques fluidized bed reactors gas solid reactions laser ablation and spray pyrolysis. For the production of 2D metal sulfide monolayer nanomaterials synthesis have been limited to high temperature solid state routes sulfurization with HS gas vapor phase routes exfoliation and metathesis reaction routes with halide side products that can be detrimental to the application s performance properties. See Y. Feldman et al. 2 6 663 2000 C. Altavilla et al. 23 3879 2011 H. R. Gutierrez et al. 13 8 3447 2013 and Y. Yu et al. 2013 3 1866 DOI 10.1038 srep01866.

Therefore a need remains for a solution route for the synthesis of metal chalcogenide monolayer nanomaterials that is scalable less complex and easier to implement than other synthesis routes.

The present invention is directed to a novel solution route to 2D metal sulfide monolayer nanomaterials from the reaction between metal alkoxides M OR and hexamethyldisilathiane HTMS . According to the present invention both solution precipitation and solvothermal processing of M OR and HTMS can be used at low temperatures to produce 2D metal sulfide monolayers. This general reaction route can be extended to produce other metal chalcogenide ME E S Se Te nanomaterials by varying the M OR and E precursors. The synthesis route yields air stable layered nanomaterials. The method offers a scalable route that controls surface chemistry but does not require additional heating or processing under HS gas.

The present invention is directed to a novel solution route to 2D metal sulfide selenide or telluride monolayer nanomaterials from the reaction between metal alkoxides M OR and hexamethyldisilathiane HTMS or S Si CH or trioctylphoshine selenide or telluride. For example metal sulfide nanomaterials MS can be prepared from the reaction between M OR and HTMS in high boiling coordinating or non coordinating solvents. show exemplary solution routes for the synthesis of WS. shows an exemplary solution route to a metal chalcogenide nanomaterial using a metal alkoxide precursor and HTMS. In this example the production of the transition metal sulfide WScan be achieved by the solvothermal processing route using tungsten IV ethoxide and HTMS. show exemplary methods using a metal chloride precursor. shows the chalcogenide precursor materials. These methods can be extended to WEand MoEmore generally. Depending on the conditions used e.g. solvent time temperature the monolayer size and crystallinity can be controlled. For example the as prepared crystalline WSmonolayers can undergo formation of multilayer WSstructures after heat treatment under an inert atmosphere.

Eqs. 1 and 2 listed below show the general reaction routes used to produce metal chalcogenides from metal alkoxides 

As an example under an inert atmosphere a mixture of trioctylphosphine oxide TOPO 5.00 g 12.9 mmol and stoichiometric amounts of the appropriate M OR and S Si CH or TOP Se were added to the teflon liner of a 45 mL Parr Acid Digestion Bomb. The bomb was sealed in the glovebox placed in an oven and heated to 200 C. for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature the reaction was transferred into a glovebox and the nanoparticles were washed twice by dissolving the reaction mixture with toluene then precipitating the MEx nanoparticles with MeOH. The nanoparticles could be redispersed with toluene. Black powders were washed and isolated for both the WSand MoSereactions. Each was dispersible in toluene. Once isolated the powders were characterized with TEM EDS TGA DTA and XPS. These results are described below.

To help identify how these materials crystallize thermal analysis was performed under argon. This was done as annealing leads to a more layered structure. shows thermogravimetric and differential temperature analyses TGA DTA of the WSas synthesized via the W OEt route. The samples were ramped up to 850 C. and 10 C. min and held at 850 C. for 10 minutes under argon. A weight loss of 12 was observed in the 300 400 C. range resulting from the loss of organics or the TOPO surfactant. No decomposition of WSoccurred and as determined by PXRD. shows the patterns of WSbefore and after annealing. The intensity of the pattern is stronger after annealing. are TEMs of the WSafter annealing revealing that the randomized monolayers are now stacking on top of each other to produce the standard layered WS.

A similar approach can be used to synthesize the selenides. The TEM image in show similar monolayered materials were produced when TOP Se under similar conditions. EDS also confirmed the presence of Mo and Se.

The present invention has been described as a method to synthesize metal chalcogenide monolayer nanomaterials. It will be understood that the above description is merely illustrative of the applications of the principles of the present invention the scope of which is to be determined by the claims viewed in light of the specification. Other variants and modifications of the invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art.
