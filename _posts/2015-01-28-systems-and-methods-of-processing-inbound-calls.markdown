title: Systems and methods of processing inbound calls
abstract: Methods and systems for reducing the impact of fraudulent or spam calls are disclosed. One or more calls to a first phone address are received, the first phone address not currently associated with a communication for a customer prospect. The calling party phone addresses associated with the calls received prior to the association of the first phone address to the first communication are stored. Then the first phone address is associated to the first communication. A first call to the first phone address is received. Prior to answering the first call and at least partly in response to a determination that a calling party phone address of the first call matches one of the previously stored calling party phone address, the first call is identified as a spam or otherwise undesirable call candidate and may be rejected.

Any and all applications for which a foreign or domestic priority claim is identified in the Application Data Sheet as filed with the present application are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety under 37 CFR 1.57.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the reproduction by any one of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the patent and trademark office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present invention relates to systems and methods for facilitating communications between individuals and enterprises in the context of product and service promotions and customer service management and in particular to methods and systems for managing fraudulent calls associated with said communications.

Although there has been a significant shift in the past decade towards the purchase of goods and services online there are still a number of products purchased over the phone. However many of these over the phone purchases are prompted by advertisements and promotions on the Internet. For media buyers it is difficult to manage and measure the return on their investment for online offline and or mobile advertisements that result in calls. In many cases revenue is lost when a promotion results in a phone call that cannot be tracked back to the media buyer or web property carrying the advertisement.

Currently there are organizations that publish content of interest to an audience of web users. Many of these organizations and distribution partners termed affiliates or publishers generate revenue through advertisements displayed in association with their content. Typically the advertisements on a web page contain only a limited amount of information but include a link to advertiser web sites that provide further details often including a phone address e.g. a phone number . If a potential customer calls the phone address to make a purchase from the advertiser instead of making the purchase online conventionally it may be difficult or impossible to determine which advertisements resulted in that lead. Such sales lead tracking and Return On Investment ROI optimization is particularly challenging when there are multiple advertisements displayed on different online advertising channels while the sales transaction takes place in another medium e.g. wireline and wireless telephony . In the case where a single advertisement is associated with a designated phone address and a suitable call tracking solution the advertisement s performance may be easily determined all calls to the phone address and all sales that resulted from the calls are driven by the aforementioned ad. However it is rare that an advertising campaign only consists of a single ad and that the single ad is placed in a single advertising channel. A business with a series of online offline and or mobile promotions e.g. separate media outlets will not likely be able to determine which advertisements were the most effective if all of the advertisements drive calls to one phone address.

What is needed are voice fax and or video telephony capabilities integrated with marketing campaigns of varying complexity e.g. simple or sophisticated marketing campaigns which enable advertisers to determine and or credit online promotions with offline telephony experiences. In addition because these telephony experiences in association with campaigns may be subject to fraudulent communications certain embodiments described herein are provisioned and configured with appropriate fraud countermeasures.

Disclosed herein are systems and methods for facilitating communications between individuals and enterprises in the context of product and service promotions and customer service and in particular to methods and systems for detecting and eliminating fraudulent calls associated with said communications.

Further disclosed herein are techniques for marketing automation and telecommunications and in particular to methods and systems which can be utilized for tracking sales leads optimizing and organizing advertising campaigns where phone calls and optionally phone numbers are used creatively to track and manage ad spending. For example certain embodiments track phone calls driven by each advertisement and associate meaningful values to each call that identify the attributes of the traffic source.

A given embodiment may include some or all of the features functionality systems and methods described herein.

Methods and systems for reducing the impact of undesirable e.g. fraudulent or spam calls are disclosed. In an example aspect one or more calls to a first phone address are received wherein the first phone address is not currently associated with a communication for a customer prospect. The calling party phone addresses associated with the calls received prior to the association of the first phone address to the first communication are stored. Then the first phone address is associated to the first communication. A first call to the first phone address is received. Prior to answering the first call and at least partly in response to a determination that a calling party phone address of the first call matches one of the previously stored calling party phone address the first call is identified as a spam or otherwise undesirable call candidate and may be rejected. Optionally at least partly in response to detecting a modem tone during the first call the first call is identified as a spam call and the first call is rejected.

An example embodiment provides a method of computer implemented method of call processing the method comprising receiving over a network by a computing system one or more calls to a first phone address the first phone address not currently associated with a marketing campaign communication storing by the computing system one or more calling party phone addresses associated with the one or more received calls prior to the association of the first phone address to the marketing campaign communication associating the first phone address to the marketing campaign communication subsequent to the association of the phone address to the first marketing campaign communication receiving at the computing system a first call to the first phone address prior to answering the first call and at least partly in response to a determination by the computing system that a calling party phone address of the first call matches a stored calling party phone address included in the one or more calling party phone addresses associated with the one or more received calls prior to the association of the first phone address to the marketing campaign communication identifying by the computing system the first call as a spam call candidate and at least partly in response to detecting a modem tone by the computing system during the first call identifying by the computing system the first call as a spam call and rejecting by the computing system the first call and optionally the computer implemented method further comprising at least partly in response to detecting the modem tone storing an indication that future calls from the calling party phone address of the first call are to be blocked and optionally the computer implemented method further comprising receiving a second call to the first phone address associated with the marketing campaign communication and at least partly in response to determining that a calling party address of the second call is associated with a stored call block indication rejecting by the computing system the second call and optionally the computer implemented method further comprising at least partly in response to detecting a call termination of the first call occurring within a specified call period of time identifying the first call as a spam call candidate and optionally the computer implemented method further comprising at least partly in response to detecting during a second call to the first phone address associated with the marketing campaign communication a fax tone identifying by the computing system the second call as a spam call and optionally the computer implemented method further comprising at least partly in response to detecting during a second call to the first phone address associated with the marketing campaign communication a Dual Tone Multi Frequency DTMF tone by the computing system wherein the detected DTMF tone is an A B C or D type tone identifying by the computing system the second call as a spam call and optionally the computer implemented method further comprising at least partly in response to receiving a second call during a specified marketing campaign state identifying by the computing system the second call as a candidate spam call and optionally the computer implemented method further comprising at least partly in response to receiving a second call during a specified marketing campaign state identifying by the computing system the second call as a candidate spam call wherein the marketing campaign state comprises an indicator of a position of a customer prospect in a marketing campaign funnel.

An example embodiment provides a system comprising a computing device a network interface configured to be coupled to a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN non transitory media storing instructions readable by the computing device that when executed by the computing device cause the computing device to perform operations comprising associating a phone address to a communication wherein the communication is directed to a customer prospect subsequent to the association of the phone address with the communication receiving a first call to the first phone address prior to answering the first call generating a first score for the first call wherein the first score is calculated based at least in part on at least a first attribute of the received call prior to answering the first call rejecting the first call if the first score satisfies a first condition if the first score does not satisfy the first condition answering the first call subsequent to answering the first call generating a second score for the first call wherein the second score is generated based at least in part on a second attribute of the first call and identifying the first call as a spam call and rejecting the first call if the second score satisfies a second condition or if a third score generated based at least in part on the first score and the second score satisfies a third condition and optionally wherein the communication comprises a marketing communication associated with a marketing campaign and optionally the operations further comprising at least partly in response to identifying the first call as a spam call storing an indication that future calls from the calling party phone address of the first call are to be blocked and optionally the operations further comprising receiving a second call to the first phone address associated with the communication and at least partly in response to determining that a calling party address of the second call is associated with a stored call block indication rejecting by the computing system the second call and optionally wherein the second attribute of the first call comprises a length of the first call and optionally wherein the first attribute or the second attribute of the first call comprises detection of a fax tone and optionally wherein the first attribute or the second attribute of the first call comprises detection of Dual Tone Multi Frequency DTMF tone wherein the detected DTMF tone is a numeric DTMF tone or an A B C or D tone and optionally wherein the first attribute or the second attribute of the first call comprises receiving the first call during a specified campaign state and optionally wherein the first attribute or the second attribute of the first call comprises receiving the first call during a specified campaign state wherein a marketing campaign state comprises an indicator of a position of the customer prospect in a marketing campaign funnel.

An example embodiment provides a system comprising a computing device a network interface configured to be coupled to a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN non transitory media storing instructions readable by the computing device that when executed by the computing device cause the computing device to perform operations comprising receiving one or more calls to a first phone address the first phone address not currently associated with a communication for a customer prospect storing one or more calling party phone addresses associated with the one or more received calls prior to the association of the first phone address to the first communication associating the first phone address to the first communication subsequent to the association of the phone address to the first communication receiving a first call to the first phone address prior to answering the first call and at least partly in response to a determination that a calling party phone address of the first call matches a stored calling party phone address included in the one or more calling party phone addresses associated with the one or more received calls prior to the association of the first phone address to the first communication identifying the first call as a spam call candidate and at least partly in response to detecting a modem tone during the first call identifying the first call as a spam call and rejecting the first call and optionally wherein the communication comprises a marketing communication associated with a marketing campaign and optionally the operations further comprising at least partly in response to identifying the first call as a spam call storing an indication that future calls from the calling party phone address of the first call are to be blocked and optionally the operations further comprising receiving a second call to the first phone address associated with the communication and at least partly in response to determining that a calling party address of the second call is associated with a stored call block indication rejecting by the computing system the second call and optionally wherein the second attribute of the first call comprises a length of the first call and optionally wherein the first attribute or the second attribute of the first call comprises detection of a fax tone and optionally wherein the first attribute or the second attribute of the first call comprises detection of Dual Tone Multi Frequency DTMF tone wherein the detected DTMF tone is a numeric DTMF tone or an A B C or D tone and optionally wherein the first attribute or the second attribute of the first call comprises receiving the first call during a specified campaign state and optionally wherein the first attribute or the second attribute of the first call comprises receiving the first call during a specified campaign state wherein a marketing campaign state comprises an indicator of a position of the customer prospect in a marketing campaign funnel.

The terms campaign and marketing campaign as described herein are intended to encompass generally any business work flow process used to achieve a specific objective. Optionally a campaign includes as an attribute a collection of discreet events or steps e.g. the sending of an email message . The terms campaign and marketing campaign as used herein are intended to be used interchangeably. For example a campaign may include a marketing campaign to promote a good or service for sale. In another example campaign a marketing campaign is used to promote a company s brand. In yet another example a notification campaign is used to notify a customer user of a change in a company s terms and conditions. While the term campaign may be used herein with respect to certain embodiments for illustrative purposes other types of campaigns may be used as well

In addition currently there are various marketing channels that can be used to promote goods and services including for example blogs social networking web page visits search etc. Coincident with online marketing channel evolution is the emergence of software based tools that are focused on automating the marketing process within these various channels. This automation includes marketing campaign creation launch tracking and reporting. While early and generally rudimentary marketing automation tools were initially developed by a company internally to facilitate marketing of the products they developed more recently an industry of third party outsourced marketing automation tools has emerged providing tools that may be used in conjunction with certain online marketing channels and are capable of providing tracking and reporting. Disadvantageously the conventional marketing automation tools provided by these third parties are generally limited to the Internet medium provide little or no telephony integration and have failed to address the challenges posed by telephony integration.

What is needed is user and system friendly integration of voice fax and or video telephony into marketing automation software computing platforms. Conventionally for example a product manufacturer might use a marketing automation system to create an email marketing campaign. To add telephony features to the campaign the manufacturer conventionally manually creates a parallel and separate telephony campaign to work in conjunction with the defined email marketing campaign. The lack of an integrated campaign generally results in campaign errors cumbersome reporting and account access difficulties in monitoring and adapting active campaigns wasted effort and expense etc.

Systems and methods for a marketing automation system which includes integrated telephony are described herein. Optionally the marketing automation system is provided by a single provider to an end user. Optionally the marketing automation system is provided by a conventional marketing automation platform provider and the telephony features are provided by a separate applications provider and which may be configured to integrate with the marketing automation platform. In the latter case the telephony application optionally purchased or licensed separately is hosted and operates within the database and infrastructure of the conventional marketing automation platform. However the telephony features offered by the telephony application may be subject to fraudulent communications. Therefore certain example embodiments are provisioned and configured with appropriate fraud countermeasures as described herein.

In the course of providing integrated telephony including voice fax and or video service in the marketing of goods and services providers are likely to encounter unscrupulous individuals and organizations who will attempt to defraud the providers. For example fraudsters loosely associated with a rural Local Exchange Carrier or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier CLEC are known to originate fictitious calls to toll free phone numbers in order to share in the reciprocal compensation paid out by the network carriers completing the calls. A provider of automated marketing services with integrated telephony subject to this type of fraud will likely experience higher telecommunication service fees. In addition the fraudulent call traffic necessitates that the provider over provision its network and call processing sub systems to manage the unexpected calls. Lastly the inflated call traffic distorts the marketing conversion performance higher number of low quality calls of an operational marketing campaign and wastes the time of agents handling such fraudulent traffic.

Conventionally there are techniques that can be employed to reduce abusive calls. For example a larger number of repeat calls and or short duration calls from a specific calling party phone address as determined for example from call signaling information associated with a call are likely to indicate fraudulent calls. In this case a conventional system can be configured to block all calls from the originating calling party phone address. However changes to the telecommunication market including the introduction of VoIP calling have enabled calling parties to vary the calling party phone address for each call by modifying and or spoofing the calling party phone address. Thus defeating many of the conventional methods of reducing fraudulent calls.

What is needed are adequate counter measures to reduce and or eliminate the occurrence and reporting of spam dialing or fraudulent calls e.g. calls that are not from actual potential purchasers or users but are instead from malicious sources and may be from autodialers in marketing campaigns such as those that include voice fax and or video telephony marketing channels. Optionally a multi level system of detection and counter measures are used at different stages of a call and or series of calls to reduce and or eliminate as soon as possible the occurrence and reporting of spam dialing or fraudulent calls. In certain embodiments the overall goal is to differentiate between legitimate and undesirable fraudulent calls with the lowest rate of false positives and the lowest rate of false negatives. In other words filter as many undesirable calls as possible while minimizing or without filtering any legitimate calls. In certain embodiments there exist other constraints such as limiting the call length or caller interactions prior to connection transfer.

Certain embodiments described herein may perform computational calculations and data analysis within strict real time boundaries during a call. Other embodiments described herein may perform computational calculations and data analysis after a call is answered connected transferred and or completed. In certain embodiments the analysis may be delayed for example due to heavy call volume and limited computational resources and or unavailable data. Because call processing is inherently a real time operation there likely will be constraints on the scope of computation that is feasible. However calls are also inherently different than for example a web page load because the call including the call presentation can be managed over the course of some number of seconds. This enables the possibility of performing a multi stage filtering algorithm wherein a computationally inexpensive filter is applied during the 1 second of the call for example but additional filters are run at a later period e.g. 5 seconds and 10 seconds into the call with that much more keystroke and recorded audio data.

In certain embodiments described herein predictive models may be utilized. Traditional predictive scoring models in the recommender engine genre are based around the concept of having users and items in a system. The predictive scoring engine tries to predict what score the user will give the item on some arbitrary scale e.g. 1 to 5 . Such engines typically have a threshold value and if the item s predicted score is above the threshold value the item will be recommended to the user. The goal of such engines are to get the RMSE Root Mean Square Error to as low a value as possible in other words minimize the average distance error between the predicted score and the actual score once known . However the use of predictive scoring models can be expanded by relaxing ideas of what might constitute a user and an item. Optionally a user might be an imaginary meta user that is responsible for determining if a call is fraudulent or not. Optionally another user might be an imaginary meta user that is responsible for determining if a call is spam. The item might be a call. A call whose score crosses the threshold may be considered spurious and treated differently.

In certain embodiments described herein a combination of predictive models may be utilized to improve detection results. An example of this is the example published by Koren in his paper Factorization Meets the Neighborhood which combines a latent factor model and a neighborhood model with excellent results. Latent factor models are based on the idea that a thing be it a user or an item has inherent latent qualities factors and if those qualities can be represented by a numeric score they can become part of a calculation that gives an overall score to the thing . In certain embodiments the thing is a call and the way in which we translate the information we collect on calls into a vector of factor scores is domain specific and novel as further described herein. Examples of call data which can be converted into a vector of latent scores include but are not limited to detected dtmf tone combinations detected dtmf tone cadence detection of certain audio frequencies etc. Neighborhood models are based on the idea that things be they users or items in a system might be like other things in the system. Based on the scores assigned to those other things by the user derive a predicted score for the item in question. In certain embodiments the neighborhood of similar calls is utilized. Optionally the system determines via a mechanism for each call what other calls are in its neighborhood. This mechanism is referred to as a distance measurement. Preferred non domain specific distance measurements include Pearson and Hamming. In certain example embodiments the system determines domain specific knowledge to create a unique optimal measurement of distance between calls optionally including time window calculations.

Certain embodiments may be utilized with a variety of campaigns that integrate telephone and online aspects. For example a marketing campaign phone address may be published via an online channel e.g. a Web page a phone application etc. for users to call where the number may be associated with a call center that process user orders or requests for information for products or services that are the subject of the campaign. In an example embodiment the marketing automation system detects spam dialing e.g. a repeated occurrence of calls such as more than a specified threshold of calls to one or more numbers phone addresses associated with a marketing campaign including toll free numbers by analyzing the calling party phone address. Suspected spam dialing phone addresses may be placed in a temporary or permanent block call list and some or all subsequent calls from the suspected spam dialing source are blocked e.g. as an effective counter measure for repeated calls from the suspected dialing phone addresses . Optionally suspected spam dialing calls are automatically determined based at least in part on call frequency and or call length e.g. by identifying high frequency of short long and or nearly identical duration calls . For example spam indication thresholds may be set e.g. by an operator via a user interface where the system stores the settings in memory with respect to the frequency of calls and or the length of the calls so that calls above the frequency threshold within a specified period of time e.g. more than 5 calls in 3 days having a call length within a certain deviation of each other and or having a call length above or below a call length threshold are identified as spam. A window may be specified with respect to the variation in call length so that calls having a call length within the window are considered to have identical or nearly identical call durations. Optionally suspected spam dialing calls are manually placed in a temporary or permanent block call list recorded by the system in response to an agent e.g. a sales or customer service agent selecting a marketing automation platform user interface spam control in association with the handling of the call. Optionally a designation of an inbound call from a platform separate from the marketing automation platform for example a call center platform occurs via an application programming interface over a data network. Optionally agent designation of calls including fraud designations are sent retrieved to by the marketing automation platform automatically in configurable time period increments e.g. hourly daily nightly at a specified hour etc. or manually under an operator s control.

In an example embodiment call signaling associated with a call e.g. placed using a conventional telephone cell phone VoIP phone autodialer or otherwise is used at least in part to automatically determine if there is a calling party phone address indicative of spam dialing. Optionally the analysis includes determining if a common calling party phone address e.g. as determined from callerID information obtained from the call signaling information is being used in repeated calls which exceed a call count threshold over a configurable time period. Similarly the analysis includes determining if a common calling party phone address is being used in short calls e.g. calls less than a configurable specified time period e.g. 1 second 3 seconds 4 seconds etc. . Optionally the analysis includes determining if a small group of calling party phone addresses is being used in repeated calls and or short long or nearly identical duration calls. Optionally the analysis queries one or more phone address associated internal or external databases e.g. a Local Exchange Routing Guide LERG to determine if the calling party phone address is a valid phone address. For example a first database might be queried using the phone address to determine a phone type e.g. landline wireless etc. and then a second query using the phone type and some or all of the calling party phone address to determine the validity of the phone address. Optionally the analysis includes determining if the phone address includes an unusual number pattern e.g. by comparing the number pattern against suspicious number patterns in a suspicious number pattern data store or number patterns generated by a suspicious number pattern generator algorithm such as a consecutive sequence of the same number a number increment sequence for example by 1 2 3 etc. a number decrement sequence for example by 1 2 3 etc. or other such common number patterns e.g. which may be unlikely to occur by chance with respect to incoming calls . Optionally a count of the number of short long or nearly identical duration calls from the calling party phone address is compared against a configurable threshold and if the threshold has been exceeded the phone address is considered spam and placed in the temporary or permanent block call list. Optionally the call count for a repeat calling party phone address is reset to zero after a configurable time period e.g. 1 hour 1 day 1 week 1 month 1 year etc. then stored in memory and the phone address is removed from one of the call blocked lists or its status is otherwise changed to indicate calls from the phone address are not to be blocked. Optionally the calling party phone address for inbound calls are compared against the temporary or permanent block call lists and calls from phone addresses on the blocked call lists are not answered e.g. the call is never completed or the call is answered e.g. immediately answered and terminated e.g. immediately terminated . Optionally calls originating from phone addresses on temporary or permanent blocked call lists are subjected to additional fraudulent detection and prevention techniques as further described herein and a campaign promotion or affiliate associated with such calls may be inhibited from receiving credit for such calls. Optionally the system provides a user interface that enables a system operator to review display and or edit add or remove phone addresses or blocks of phone address the blocked call lists. Optionally the system tracks and provides a user interface that enables a system operator to review and display blocked incoming call counts by phone address blocks of phone addresses by campaign etc. Optionally blocked inbound calls are excluded or not reported to marketing managers in a marketing campaign. Optionally unblocked inbound calls identified as spam calls are excluded or not reported to marketing managers in a marketing campaign. Optionally blocked inbound calls are included or reported to marketing managers in a marketing campaign but are identified as blocked calls. Optionally unblocked inbound calls identified as spam calls are included or reported to marketing managers in a marketing campaign but are identified as spam calls.

In another example embodiment similar to the example embodiment above the marketing automation system detects spam dialing a repeated occurrence of calls of short duration or nearly identical duration to one or more phone addresses e.g. toll free numbers by analyzing the charge number field in addition to or instead of the callerID field. Suspected spam dialing phone addresses are placed in a temporary or permanent block call list and subsequent calls from the spam dialing source are blocked or terminated. In this example embodiment call signaling associated with the inbound call is used to determine if there is a charge number phone address indicative of spam dialing. In certain telephone network integration for examples a trunk interface SS7 integration or VoIP network SIP T integration the call processing platform can access a call signaling field conventionally labeled the charge number field. This field indicates a phone address for which billing associated with the call is to be applied and conventionally is provisioned by a telecommunications carrier. Unlike the calling party phone address in the callerID field which can be spoofed in some line side network configurations by unscrupulous characters the charge number field may not be accessible to these same characters. Therefore the same call analysis techniques described herein with respect to calling party phone address can be applied to the phone address located in the charge number field. As in the example embodiment above if the charge number phone address is indicative of spam the charge number phone address is placed on a temporary or permanent block call list. Optionally the charge number phone address for inbound calls is compared against the temporary or permanent block call list and calls to the blocked call list are not answered e.g. caller just hears ringing and call is never completed or the call is answered immediately and terminated immediately. Optionally as above blocked inbound calls are not reported in a marketing campaign.

In certain spam dialing scenarios machine based systems are used to generate the call traffic to phone addresses e.g. toll free numbers used in marketing campaigns. In many of these scenarios data and fax modem dialing technology are employed in the dialing systems. Optionally the marketing automation with integrated call processing system detects characteristics associated with spam modem dialing calls and takes appropriate call handling actions as further described below.

Incoming call characteristics before during or after answer associated with a machine based calling system include but are not limited to one or more of the following a data modem tone in the voice channel a fax modem tone in the voice channel the absence of speech in the voice channel after answer the detection of machine generated Dual Tone Multi Frequency DTMF tones A B C and or D the rapid detection of a plurality of DTMF tones in which the period between tones is less than a configurable threshold where the threshold can be configured to a time value which a user is unlikely to manually enter the detection of one or more unexpected DTMF tones the detection of a recurring pattern of DTMF tones across calls the detection of a recurring pattern of unexpected DTMF tones the detection of a busy tone the detection of ringing or other unexpected call progress or network tone announcements and the absence of speech in the voice channel in response to a verbal prompt directed to the caller e.g. hello after answer. In an example embodiment a call processing system or call processing subsystem as further described herein a call processing system can be a standalone system or can be a subsystem or component of a system which provides functions other than call processing including for example marketing automation campaign management receives inbound calls to the one or more phone addresses e.g. toll free numbers associated with a campaign or not associated with a campaign but stored in inventory . Optionally prior to forwarding transferring or bridging an inbound call to an operator e.g. a customer service agent or sales agent the call processing subsystem determines the likelihood of the inbound call originating from a spam dialer before taking certain actions such as blocking and or not answering the call. In an example embodiment the call processing sub system signals the receipt of an incoming call to the network e.g. PSTN and monitors the voice channel for the detection of a tone e.g. fax or data modem tone . Optionally if a tone is detected the call is not answered and information associated with the call e.g. call signaling information associated with the received call and or a recording of the speech channel is logged and or placed into a data store for post call analysis. Advantageously monitoring the incoming call s speech channel without answering the call enables the operator to avoid some or all of the network call termination answer costs associated with spam dialing calls. In another example embodiment the call processing subsystem answers the call and monitors the voice channel for the detection of a tone. Optionally if a modem tone is detected the answered call is terminated and information associated with the call e.g. call signaling information associated with the received call and or a recording of the speech channel is logged and or placed into a data store. Advantageously these answered spam calls are optionally terminated shortly after answer are not directed to an agent and are optionally not included in campaign call reports. Optionally as an alternative to simply terminating a spam call the call processing system may perform an action which might discourage future spam dialing to the called number including for example responding with a modem acknowledgement tone playing a voice response prompt playing a not in service announcement waiting an extended period prior to call termination after answer and or delaying answer. For example a not in service announcement might cause the spam dialing system to manually or automatically remove the called number e.g. a toll free number used in a one or more marketing campaign from their dialing list. Optionally the call processing sub system designates and or categorizes those numbers which have been spam dialed and for which a call handling action described above has been performed. Optionally the call processing sub system designates and or categorizes e.g. as spam calling numbers and or creates call blocking lists using phone address identifiers associated with the call signaling parameters of the inbound calls including but not limited to Automatic Number Identification ANI charger number redirecting phone address forwarding phone address privacy indicator etc. and applies subsequent call handling actions and reporting techniques as further described herein. Optionally data analysis of future inbound calling behavior of the categorized phone addresses can be used to determine the best or a preferred call handling treatment for reducing and or eliminating future spam dialing. In addition low spam categorized phone addresses optionally can be subsequently used in campaigns with less aggressive spam counter measures as further described herein as the categorized phone addresses may be less susceptible to future spam dialing . The calling party phone addresses associated with modem detected calls are optionally placed on temporary or permanently blocked call lists and subsequent calls from these phone addresses are subject to immediate call termination and or additional fraud counter measures.

In another example embodiment the call processing system answers the incoming call e.g. wherein the calling party will no longer hear ring back and listens on the incoming voice channel for speech and or background noise e.g. dog barking TV or radio audio street noise etc. a configurable period of time prior to extending e.g. transferring forwarding bridging connecting the call to an operator agent. Optionally recordings of the audio channel are stored in the system for post call data analysis including for example nightly and or off peak call volume periods. In this embodiment the detection of speech and or background noise e.g. using a sound analysis and or speech detection system are an indication the call is likely not a machine based dialer. Optionally as the call is transitioned to an operator agent prior to answer e.g. by the call center and or prior to agent answer detection of a live agent s speech as opposed to music on hold and or announcements if speech and or background noise are not detected prior to these events or before the expiration of the configurable time period other call handling actions call analysis call monitoring call prompting and or other fraud counter measures as described herein can be triggered.

In another example embodiment similar to the embodiment described above the call processing sub system acknowledges e.g. signals receipt of the call but does not answer the call for a configurable wait period of time. During the wait period the call processing system monitors the inbound voice channel for speech and or background noise. Optionally if speech and or background noise are detected the call is immediately directed e.g. before the expiration of the wait timer to an agent. Optionally in a call environment in which the call processing system continues participation in the call e.g. a bridge call environment an outbound call connection to an agent is initiated during the wait period to reduce the call hold time to the caller after the expiration of the wait period . Optionally if no speech and or background noise are detected at or prior to the expiration of the wait period the call is not answered and or additional fraud prevention steps as described herein are employed before extending the call to an agent.

In some cases the spam dialer plays a looping recorded announcement after dialing. In an example embodiment the call processing subsystem detects the recorded announcement as speech upon receipt of the call prior to answer. Optionally the announcement is recorded and stored in a data store of the call processing subsystem. Optionally at least a portion e.g. the initial portion of the voice channel content of subsequent calls is compared against one or more stored announcements. Optionally if there is a match the call is rejected or subjected to additional fraud counter measures e.g. the placement insertion of an IVR session after answer and before extending the call to an agent . The calling party phone addresses associated with looping recorded announcement calls are optionally placed on temporary or permanently blocked call lists and subsequent calls from these phone addresses are subject to immediate call termination and or additional fraud counter measures as similarly described elsewhere herein.

In some cases the spam dialer plays a recorded announcement on answer. In an example embodiment the call processing subsystem detects the recorded announcement as speech. Optionally the announcement on answer is recorded and stored in a data store of the call processing sub system. In an example embodiment the recorded announcement becomes a signature associated with inbound calls analogous to the user of calling party address described herein . Optionally a user interface control of the marketing automation platform is provided for display on a terminal to an agent that if selected by the agent indicates a high likelihood that the call was a fraudulent call e.g. no caller response once connected to an agent . Optionally the marketing automation platform stores information associated with the call including a recording of the announcement and a fraud flag or other indicator. Optionally the recorded announcement and or speech characteristics of the recorded announcement are placed on a temporary or permanent blocked call list and are subject to call handling such as the call termination techniques described herein. Optionally the marketing automation platform assigns different weightings in association with different stored announcement recordings based upon one or more factors optionally including but not limited to agent labeled fraud the time of day e.g. after hour calls are likely to receive a higher weighting the day of the week e.g. weekend and holiday calls if the enterprise is closed the stage of a campaign the network the call was placed from e.g. landline VoIP wireless . Optionally the marketing automation platform increases the weighting if a multiplicity of calls are made with the determined same announcement e.g. by comparing a recording of the announcement in the incoming call against a subset or all of the stored recordings on the block call lists and or by comparing speech characteristics or speech nuances of the announcement against the speech characteristics or speech nuances of the stored recordings on the block call lists . Optionally the marketing automation platform increases the weighting if a multiplicity of calls are made with the same announcement. Optionally the call processing subsystem marketing automation platform compares certain or each incoming call announcement against some or all stored potential fraudulent announcements on the block call lists. Optionally to manage computing resources and or improve response performance the call processing subsystem marketing automation platform compares certain or each incoming call announcement against a subset of potential fraudulent announcements on the block call lists. Optionally the announcement or a portion thereof is translated into text and the comparison only involves the subset of fraudulent announcements with similar or the same text. Optionally other speech characteristics determined from a speech pattern analysis of the incoming call announcement are used to select the subset for the comparison.

In another example embodiment the call processing subsystem processes and defeats machine based dialers by answering the call and prompting a spoken response from the caller. Optionally if speech is detected in the inbound voice channel the call is directed to an agent and if speech is not detected the call is terminated. In an optional variant of this example embodiment the call processing subsystem prompts the caller to speak a phrase which may include one or more words and speech recognition technology e.g. speaker independent voice recognition is used to determine if a spoken utterance by the caller matches the prompted phrase. If there is no caller speech or if the speech does not match the prompted phrase a determination may be made that the call is from a machine dialer and so is a spam call. In another optional variant the call processing sub system prompts the caller to enter keypress at least one touch tone digit on their keypad and if the correct digit is selected the call is considered valid not spam. Optionally on a configurable basis the system varies the prompted digit entry from call to call. Optionally if the correct prompted digit entry is not detected the call is terminated or the caller is prompted to try again optionally with the user prompted to enter the same or a different digit. Optionally if a single digit entry is configured for the call and multiple digits are detected the call is terminated or the caller is prompted to try again optionally with the user prompted to enter the same or a different digit. Optionally the voice prompting to the user is configured by the operator or system as an Interactive Voice Response IVR session. Optionally calls in which invalid digit entries are detected and or calls in which no tone is entered are placed on a temporary or permanently blocked call list or suspected fraud call lists. Optionally inbound calls from these numbers are blocked or subject to more aggressive fraud prevention counter measures including directed to a live operator specifically assigned to managing fraudulent calls and optionally not directly associated with the marketing of goods and service services .

In an example embodiment one or all of the spam dialing reduction techniques described above are used on a call. For example an inbound call can be received by the call processing sub system and monitored for speech for a wait period. If speech is detected during the wait period the call is directed to an agent. If speech is not detected during the wait period the call is answered and an IVR prompt session can be inserted and played to the caller. Upon receipt of a caller response and or a correct caller response the call is directed to an agent. If speech is not detected during the wait period and there is no caller response to the IVR session the call is terminated and or other fraud detection and or countermeasures are used.

In another example embodiment heuristics are used to determine if and when spam dialing reduction counter measures are to be used in a campaign. For example a campaign can be configured to initially begin with no spam dialing reduction counter measures. During the course of the campaign the system monitors the inbound call count and the duration of calls or employs other fraud detection filters described herein. If the number or percentage of short duration or nearly identical duration calls exceeds a first threshold count over a first period of time one or more spam dialing reduction counter measures described herein can be used. Optionally the call processing subsystem begins with those detection and or counter measures which cause the least call completion friction that is those detection and or counter measures which require little to no action on behalf of the caller and enable the call to be connected to an agent in a timely manner . Optionally the call processing subsystem automatically invokes more aggressive spam dialing reduction techniques until the problem is eliminated or the number and or percentage of short or nearly identical duration calls falls below a second specified threshold count over a second period of time optionally where the first and second threshold counts and the first and second periods are the same or are different . Optionally the call processing subsystem analytics determine over a series of call campaigns the optimal or preferred call percentage threshold levels and associated time periods and automatically preconfigures these prior to the campaign start. Optionally the call processing subsystem provides for display on a terminal editable optimal preferred call percentage threshold levels and associated time periods to marketing personnel operators via a user interface. Optionally the call processing subsystem analytics are different and selected based on anticipated characteristics of the campaign e.g. the number of stages types and number of media elements etc. the vertical market of the campaign e.g. insurance industry for profit education etc. and or the market segment e.g. Business to Business Business to Consumer etc. . Optionally the call processing sub system analytics are also dynamically varied during a campaign based at least in part upon the number and or types of calls including but not limited to the calling device carriers e.g. mobile vs. landline the mobile device types e.g. plain old cell phone smartphone tablet computer etc. the geographic location of the callers etc.

As described herein incoming caller data and call behavior are used to determine if the incoming call is a spam call. With respect to certain embodiments described herein the use of the term increased likelihood by itself or together with other factors may categorize the call as a definitive spam call and the call may be terminated and or other call handling treatment for suspected spam calls applied to the call as described herein. In certain embodiments information know about the called number at the time of the call is used to determine whether the call is a spam or misdialed number. For example if a called number is not actively assigned to a campaign the incoming call is highly likely to be a spam or misdialed call.

In certain embodiments the lack of information associated with a call signaling parameter is an indicator of a potential spam call. For example in response to a query of a name data base of a landline phone address which results in an unknown caller may indicate that the call has a higher likelihood of being a spam call than a phone address with a caller name. Optionally the text of the caller name is compared against a set of name rules wherein the rules infer a higher likelihood of the call being a spam call. For example a single letter name may indicate a potential spam call. Optionally incoming calls subsequently identified as spam using for example call behavior rules or called party attribution as described herein are categorized and or designated as spam and optionally placed on a call blocking list. Optionally the caller name if known is an attribute used in a call blocking list and is used in subsequent call comparisons.

In certain embodiments an incoming call is generated in response to an online interaction. Optionally if certain data associated with the online interaction is not presented in association with the call the likelihood of the call being spam is increased. For example if a query to a Web provider s persistent unique identifier e.g. Google AdID or Verizon Precision ID wherein a parameter of the query includes the calling party s phone address or other identifier of the caller received from the call signaling information and or one or more internal external data store queries indicates that an advertisement promotion e.g. an online web promotion and or a promotion within app e.g. a smartphone software application with the called number has recently been displayed to the caller then there is a high likelihood the call is not spam. Conversely if the query result indicate that an advertisement promotion has not been presented to the caller the likelihood of the call being spam is increased. In another example a call may be generated from within an online application. Optionally if data from a software application associated with a call origination e.g. a mobile device software application is not presented via a telephony network e.g. via a SIP message or a network data interface in association with the call the call has an increased likelihood of being a spam call.

In certain embodiments the designation of the type of call is an indicator or non indicator of the call potentially being a spam call. For example if the call is designated as a call from a mobile phone this may indicate a lower likelihood that the call is a spam call. In certain embodiments a determination of the telecom carrier owner of the phone address e.g. by querying a LERG data store may indicated a lower or higher likelihood of a fraudulent call. For example a call from an established carrier such as Verizon or AT T may be less likely to be associated with a fraud call then a call from a small Competitive Local Exchange Carrier CLEC .

Thus certain embodiments may be utilized with a variety of campaigns that integrate telephone and online aspects. Optionally in certain embodiments if a call to a marketing campaign phone address published via an online channel is identified as a spam or suspected spam call the associated online promotion will not receive credit for the call.

In an example process a producer advertiser may create a campaign and make the campaign available to an affiliate. The affiliate may then manually assign a phone number to the campaign and or the system may automatically assign a phone address e.g. phone number and integrate the phone number into the affiliate s web site e.g. post the number or provide a link associated with the number on a web page . A user consumer may then place a call to the phone number and is connected via the system to a call center associated with the advertiser. The call may be tracked and the affiliate is credited for the call. Optionally if the system determines that the call is a spam call using one or more of the techniques described herein the system inhibits or reverses the crediting of the call to the affiliate.

The creation launch tracking and analysis reporting of a marketing campaign involve a number of states. Examples of such states in the creation of an example marketing campaign program are discussed below with reference to example aspects of telephony integration. Methods and systems for detecting and eliminating fraudulent calls during a marketing campaign enable marketing personnel to improve the efficacy of campaigns and reduce campaign costs e.g. by not paying for fraudulent or misdialed calls .

Before a sales campaign can be launched it needs to be designed by for example a marketing manager. Campaign design includes but is not limited to establishing target sales objectives choosing campaign offline online media and channels defining campaign elements campaign messages etc. Optionally the defined campaign elements communications and or media elements include for example direct mail templates email templates web landing pages web forms web ads search video programs mobile ads social media microblogging social network account virtual events etc. The campaign definitions may be defined using one or more of the systems described herein which may present corresponding user interfaces to enable a user to provide such definitions which may also store such definitions. The system may also execute the campaign in whole or in part using such campaign definitions.

Optionally the defined campaign element communication and or media element are assigned a phone address automatically and or by a user operator via the marketing automation platform. Optionally the defined campaign element and or media element are assigned a phone address automatically by the marketing automation platform. Optionally the automatic assignment of a phone address to a campaign and or media element occurs at least partly in response to a triggering event or condition. Example triggering conditions may include but are not limited to the media elements described elsewhere herein with respect to lead scoring and or lead nurturing. For example a triggering event or condition may include the display of a web based landing page to a customer prospect or the download of an application or media by a customer prospect. The triggering event or condition of a number assignment and which type of phone address to use e.g. toll free or local can further be configured by an operator via a set of filters or additional conditions which are established based at least in part upon information collected known or accessible by the marketing automation platform about the customer prospect e.g. explicit and implicit attributes used in lead scoring and or a lead score as described elsewhere herein . For example in a marketing campaign if the customer prospect is known or determined to be younger than seventeen a customer prospect attribute a phone address may not be assigned a filter in an initial introductory email a media element or only a toll free number might be assigned a type of phone address . Optionally as further described herein the campaign media elements triggering events or conditions customer attributes lead scores etc. are used to fixedly or dynamically e.g. in substantially real time route inbound and outbound calls to configured destinations phone addresses.

Optionally in the campaign design stage the user also defines and or configures via the system dashboards and or reports to be used during the campaign and the system stores the defined dashboard or report definitions and or configurations. Optionally the user also plans for and defines one or more test offers optionally including A B testing. Optionally at this stage or at another stage the integration of voice and fax telephony services is included in the campaign definition. For example at this stage of the marketing funnel phone addresses are presented placed in the online and or offline media e.g. television advertisements radio advertisements newspapers etc. . Optionally phone services are included in initial emails to the target customers. Optionally phone services are used later in the funnel for example on a web landing page after the customer prospect has clicked on a link in one or more emails that causes the landing page to be presented to the user via a user browser hosted on a user terminal. Optionally inbound calls to displayed phone numbers addresses are routed to a call center or an inbound sales center through a call processing platform.

In the example embodiment below to better example the operational flow the states below are intended to highlight overview the operation of the system and not detail every operation of the system in an example marketing campaign. In the example embodiment below the merchant advertiser previously created an account in the system and configured a marketing campaign e.g. in a marketing automation system operating in conjunction with the system or as an integral part of the system .

In this example embodiment the server receives a call directed to a toll free number 800 333 1000 wherein the toll free number is allocated from a pool of numbers assigned to the system or the provider of system . Optionally the call is a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN call received for example by the system over an IP connection. Optionally a collection of conventional call signaling information associated with the call is received including for example call type landline cellular data forwarding calling party identification called party identification charge number call privacy indicator call jurisdiction etc.

As the phone address 800 333 1000 has not been placed into a campaign the server does not answer the call or rejects the call in a manner which does not result in a charge. The server logs information associated with the call event in a call detail data store including the call signaling call duration and whether other information was detected during the call e.g. modem tones dtmf tones voice etc. . Optionally the server repeats States and State for a plurality of received calls.

In response to an administrator user configuration action the toll free number 800 333 1000 phone address is placed by the system into a campaign. In this example embodiment the phone number is placed in an email announcing a 30 off storewide sale on July 4. Optionally the system or a separate marketing system sends the email to a list of prospective and or current account customers.

The server monitors the voice channel of the inbound call. The server queries the data store optionally as a single query or multiple queries to a single or multiple data stores to determine the routing of the call and certain status information of the calling party phone address. Optionally the query parameters include for example the calling and or called number in the call signaling information associated with the received call. The status query can include but is not limited to the receipt of a call by the system from 805 776 1230 prior to the toll free number 800 333 1000 being placed into the marketing campaign the receipt of a call by the system from 805 776 1230 prior to the toll free number 800 333 1000 being placed in association with a marketing communication e.g. an email communication display ad etc. associated with the marketing campaign if 805 776 1230 is currently on a spam call list of the current marketing campaign or any other current or previous marketing campaign if 805 776 1230 is currently marked as a likely fraudulent spam call on a third party data store etc. In response to the query the data store returns a phone address associated with a call center of the merchant advertiser and an indication that the call from 805 776 1230 is not likely spam.

The server answers the inbound call from 805 776 1230 and bridges the inbound call to the outbound call to the call center.

The server monitors the bridged call. Upon detection of a call termination event of either call leg the remaining call leg is terminated. Call detail information associated with the call is logged to the data store .

The system credits an affiliate for the bridged completed call and or charges an advertiser merchant for the bridged completed call.

The server monitors the voice channel of the inbound call. The server queries the data store to determine the routing of the call and certain status information of the calling party phone address. The data store returns a phone address associated with a call center of the merchant advertiser and an indication that a call from 805 776 1231 is a candidate spam call. In this example embodiment the calling party as determined from the calling party identification field had previously received a candidate spam designation in response to a call from the calling party to a phone address which had not been placed into a marketing campaign. Optionally certain additional call treatment is applied in calls flagged as candidate spam calls. For example additional internal or external data store queries may be invoked additional call processing resources e.g. speech to text tone recognizers etc. may be attached during the monitoring of the call etc.

The server answers the inbound call from 805 776 1231 and bridges the inbound call to the outbound call to the call center.

The server monitors the bridge call. Upon detection of a call termination event of either call leg the remaining call leg is terminated. Call detail information associated with the call is logged to the data store . If the duration of the call falls below a short duration call configurable variable e.g. 5 seconds 15 seconds 29 seconds etc. if the system had previously received one or more short duration call occurrences from 805 776 1231 and or if an indication is received from the call center that the call is spam e.g. an indication over a data connection linking the call center and the system or a received dtmf tone voice command in response to a call center call agent action the call is marked as spam. Other call attributes as described herein above may be detected during the call which result in the call being marked as a candidate spam call or spam call including but not limited to the detection on the inbound call leg of a fax tone the detection on the incoming call leg of a dtmf tone in the absence of any voice detection the detection of an A B C or D dtmf tone the detection of recorded announcement and or phrase which has previously been detected on a spam call the lack of voice or touch tone response to a system prompt the detection of a call in an unlikely state of the marketing campaign e.g. 30 days after the July 4sale event etc.

The system credits an affiliate for the bridged completed call and or charges an advertiser merchant for the bridged completed call.

The server monitors the voice channel of the inbound call. The server queries the data store to determine the routing of the call and certain status information of the calling party phone address. The data store returns a phone address associated with a call center of the merchant advertiser and an indication that a call from 805 776 1232 is not a candidate spam call or spam caller.

In the example embodiment below the states below are intended to highlight overview the operation of the system and not detail every operation of the system in an example marketing campaign. In the example embodiment below the merchant advertiser previously created an account in the system and configured a marketing campaign e.g. in a marketing automation system operating in conjunction with the system or as an integral part of the system .

In this example embodiment the server receives a call directed to a toll free number 800 555 1000 wherein the toll free number is allocated from a pool of numbers assigned to the system or the provider of system . Optionally the call is a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN call received for example by the system over an IP connection. Optionally conventional call signaling is received in association with the call.

As the phone address 800 555 1000 has not been placed into a campaign the server does not answer the call or rejects the call in a manner which does not result in a charge. The server logs information associated with the call event in a call detail data store including the call signaling call duration and whether other information was detected during the call e.g. modem tones dtmf tones voice etc. . Optionally the server repeats States and State for a plurality of received calls.

In response to an administrator user configuration action the toll free number 800 555 1000 phone address is placed by the system into a campaign. In this example embodiment the phone address is placed in an ad banner dynamically e.g. the assignment of a phone address such as a RingPool phone address in the context of each banner advertisement display request see also Example 3 herein below and or fixed within the advertisement announcing a 50 off storewide sale in December. Optionally the system or a separate marketing system displays the ad to a list of prospective and or current account customers in response to web requests search requests etc.

The server monitors the voice channel of the inbound call. The server queries the data store to determine the routing of the call. The data store returns a phone address associated with a call center of the merchant advertiser. In this example embodiment the server generates a first score for the 805 654 1230 call wherein the first score e.g. a numeric score color score green yellow red etc. etc. is based at least on one or more pre answer call attributes of the inbound call from 805 654 1230. Pre Answer call attributes include but are not limited to certain historical information associated with received calls from the calling party field the call signaling information received or lack thereof associated with the inbound call or information derived from the call signaling parameters call receipt time and date marketing campaign status and states calling party phone number pattern whether the calling party number is identified as spam determined calling party geography location privacy indicator state call receipt time of day call receipt day of week hours of call center operation call receipt on a holiday detection of a tone and type of tone e.g. fax modem dtmf and or other call parameters events and factors described herein in the specification.

The server determines if the first score for the 805 654 1230 call satisfies a first condition e.g. if a numeric score exceeds a configured amount or if a color score falls into a certain color range .

In this example embodiment the first condition is not satisfied the server originates an outbound call to the call center of the merchant advertiser.

The server answers the inbound call from 805 654 1230 and bridges the inbound call to the outbound call to the call center.

The server monitors the bridged call. The server generates a second score for the 805 654 1230 call wherein the second score e.g. a numeric score color score green yellow red etc. etc. is based at least on one or more post answer call attributes of the inbound call from 805 654 1230 or outbound call to the call center. Optionally a single score is kept with the score adjusted based at least in part on the occurrence of certain events. In this example embodiment certain post answer call attributes decrease or increase the second score for the 805 654 1230 call. Post answer call attributes include but are not limited to call duration call termination type e.g. inbound call termination outbound call termination tone detection call transfer voice detection speech phrase detection agent call designation received in the voice channel agent actions received via a data channel and other call occurrence events described herein and or implicit and explicit information determined from the occurrence of certain events.

In this example embodiment neither the second score for the 805 654 1230 call nor a combination of the first score and the second score optionally with a different weighting applied to the separate scores for the 805 654 1230 call satisfies a second condition during the course of the call. Thus the call is not categorized as spam.

Upon detection of a call termination event of either call leg the remaining call leg is terminated. Call detail information associated with the call is logged to the data store wherein the call detail information includes the first score the second score and the factors which caused the determination of the first score and the second score for the 805 654 1230 call.

The system credits an affiliate for the bridged completed call and or charges an advertiser merchant for the bridged completed call.

The server monitors the voice channel of the inbound call. The server queries the data store to determine the routing of the call. The data store returns a phone address associated with a call center of the merchant advertiser. In this example embodiment the server generates a first score for the 805 654 1231 call wherein the first score e.g. a numeric score color score green yellow red etc. etc. is based at least on one or more pre answer call attributes of the inbound call from 805 654 1231.

During the course of monitoring the voice channel of the inbound call the server detects a modem tone originating on the inbound call leg. In response to the detection of the modem tone the server recalculates the first score for the 805 654 1231 call.

The server determines if the recalculated first score for the 805 654 1231 call satisfies a first condition e.g. if a numeric score exceeds a configured amount or if a color score falls into a certain color range .

Call detail information associated with the call is logged to the data store . The calling phone number 805 654 1231 is marked as spam and stored in the data store .

In response to the spam determination the system does not credit an affiliate for the call and or does not charge the advertiser merchant for the call
