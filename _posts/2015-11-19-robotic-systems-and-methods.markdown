In one embodiment the robot is used to bring consumers retailers and technology partners together in ways that enhance the shopping experience. Specifically the robot can be used to capture data to allow customers to find and purchase products.

For example the robot can be used to make product catalogs available for search on web and mobile such as the integration of real time inventory feeds from retailers to offer product availability for each store. The robot can be used to capture offer and product availability information using the camera mounted on the robot .

For example the robot can further be used to assist product purchase and fulfillment. The robot can be used to deliver goods to a central location for fulfillment. For example in services such as hands free shopping and centralized fashion lounge the customers can try on clothing from several different retailers in one location after the robot collects the goods from different retailers in a shopping mall and delivery the collected goods to the current retailer location of the customer.

For example a customer may order the goods from retailers in a shopping mall via phone or internet and the robot can be used to collect the goods from the retailers and transport the goods to a logistics partner which further delivers the goods to the customer. Alternatively the collected goods can be placed in a centralized pickup location in the shopping mall where the customer can pick up the goods ordered from different retailers in the mall.

For example when the robot visits a retailer in a shopping mall a person in the retailer store may interact with the robot on behalf of the retailer. The touch screen provides a user interface that communicates to the persons items to be placed inside the storage space of the robot and or retrieved from the storage space . Thus the robot can transport goods from and or to the retailer.

Further the robot may receive offers and or product inventory information from the representative of the retailer. For example a computing device of the representative e.g. a smart phone a tablet computer a computer having a dock station can be used to transmit the information to the robot via a wireless or wired connection.

The robot may automatically obtain certain offers and or product inventory information via the camera taking photo images of postings inside the store and or the store front of the retailer.

In some embodiments the robot takes still images and or video images of the retailer location to provide an updated feed of the arrangement and display of goods in the retailer store. Thus the still images and the video images can be organized as a virtual tour of the retailer store accessible via internet.

In one embodiment a user may use a mobile computing device e.g. a smart phone a digital media player a tablet computer to do Hands Free Shopping in which the user does not have to carry the items to be purchased and or have been purchased around the shopping mall. The user may use the mobile computing device to select the items of interest for purchase. The mobile computing device e.g. having a mobile application running therein communicates the list of items purchased by the user to the computing system of the retailer or a centralized server for the shopping mall . Based on the list of items received from the mobile computing device the robot travels to the stores in the mall collects from the stores the items purchased by the user and transports the items at a convenience location for pickup such as in a pickup area in the parking lot.

In one embodiment the robot is used to capture images of offline information for the indexing of the offline information in the real world. For example the robot can be used to capture various types of data from product information and availability to safety and security hazards within the shopping mall.

A communication link provided by the cellular communications transceiver can be used for the communication between the robot and a remote server to process images retrieve data control the movement of the robot and or provide access to the storage spaces .

In one embodiment the robot has a position determination system configured to determine its position inside the shopping mall. The robot is configured to identify the retailer stores based on its location within the shopping mall and or beacon signals from the devices disposed in the retailer stores.

The robot includes a wireless local area network transceiver e.g. a WiFi transceiver . The robot can be used to measure the signal strength of access points for the wireless local area networks within the shopping mall and generate a heat map of WiFi strength.

In one embodiment the robot is configured to perform autonomous scheduling of mapping and docking without assistance from humans. For example the robot is programmed to un dock at a defined frequency collect record mall data re dock and upload new content to be consumed via API remotely.

In one embodiment the robot includes a reader for radio frequency identification RFID tags. The robot is configured to move into the retailer stores to scan RFID to obtain availability information items inside the store. For example the scanning of the RFID tags allow the robot to determine the presence of a particular item that is available for purchase at a particular location within a particular retailer store. The information is indexed for search such that a user can quickly locate the item for inspection.

In one embodiment the robot includes a personal area network transceiver e.g. Bluetooth transceiver to perform a wireless docking connection with a dock station when the robot is with a predetermined distance to a docking station. The robot may also move around the mall to measure Bluetooth signals and or detect Bluetooth devices within the mall and correlate the detected signals devices with the locations of the robot at the time of the detections to generate a map of Bluetooth signals devices within the mall.

In some embodiments the robot also includes a user interface for a customer to search for product availability information reserve products inspect a map of the mall and obtain instructions to a particular location of a particular retailer where an item of interest to the user is located.

In an intranet interconnects one or more dock station e.g. a server and a database . The database stores location data e.g. a digital map of the shopping mall a commercial district and camera data uploaded from the robots .

The robots are programmed to travel within a predetermined area the shopping mall a commercial district autonomously and capture camera data using their cameras . The camera data is location tagged for correlation with the retailer locations identified in the location data .

In one embodiment the robot has a memory configured to store the camera data before the data is updated to the database via the dock station . A robot may connect with the dock station via a wired connection e.g. via a USB connector or a wireless connection e.g. via Bluetooth or WiFi .

In the server provides a user interface e.g. via a web server or a mobile application that allows the users of the user devices . . . to access the camera data .

For example the 360 degree still or video images captured by the robot allows a user of the user device to view the shopping mall through the camera of the robot and thus obtain a virtual tour of the shopping mall. In one embodiment the user interface is configured to receive instructions from a user to approach one of a set of authorized locations within the shopping mall to obtain a still image or a real time video feed from the camera of the robot . The real time video when presented via a virtual reality display device provides a virtual reality experience in the shopping mall from a remote location. Thus the robot becomes a virtual representative of the user in the real world shopping mall where the user may explore the merchandises provided in the shopping mall and make selections and purchases. A representative of a store may assist the robot in completing certain operations such as picking up an item for inspection and purchase. The robot transports the purchased items to an centralized location for shipping to the customer. Optionally the customer may choose to travel to the centralized location to pick up the purchased items.

Further in one embodiment the server or the robot processes the camera data to obtain postings provided in a printed form on certain surfaces within the mall. For example the discount offers are recognized via OCR and or bar code and thus a discount offers can be communicated to the user devices in various forms such as advertisements search results a list of offers for browsing etc.

In one embodiment a robotic system is configure to provide a robot having a camera instruct the robot to travel within a predetermined area capture images within the predetermined area using the camera of the robot correlate the images with predetermined locations within the predetermined areas generate electronic content in associated with the predetermined locations based on an analysis of the images and provide the electronic content via a website.

In the location data and the mapping data of a shopping mall are used to guide the autonomous robot to scan the shopping mall. The location data may include floor plan and identification of stores. The mapping data may include previously captured video and or still photo images WiFi and or RFID signals. The robot scans the mall using the camera and or transceivers for WiFi Bluetooth beacons RFID etc. After the robot connects online the data captured along the traveling path of the robot is uploaded and processed in accordance with an API designed for uploading and processing the data collected by the robot along the path. Data pertinent to products sales inventory etc. that is recognized during server processing via the various signals e.g. Imagery OCR Bluetooth RFID etc. is correlated with the service presence and or location data to generate content that is published automatically via the API . For example the sales or products identified from the scanned data collected by the robot can be published to applications e.g. consumer mobile application via API integration.
