The present application is directed to embodiments of golf club heads particularly club heads that have adjustable components.

For a given type of golf club e.g. driver iron putter wedge the golfing consumer has a wide variety of variations to choose from. This variety is driven in part by the wide range in physical characteristics and golfing skill among golfers and by the broad spectrum of playing conditions that a golfer may encounter. For example taller golfers require clubs with longer shafts more powerful golfers or golfers playing in windy conditions or on a course with firm fairways may desire clubs having less shaft flex greater stiffness and a golfer may desire a club with certain playing characteristics to overcome a tendency in their swing e.g. a golfer who has a tendency to hit low trajectory shots may want to purchase a club with a greater loft angle . Variations in shaft flex loft angle and handedness i.e. left or right alone account for 24 variations of the TaylorMade r7 460 driver.

Having such a large number of variations available for a single golf club golfing consumers can purchase clubs with club head shaft combinations that suit their needs. However shafts and club heads are generally manufactured separately and once a shaft is attached to a club head usually by an adhesive replacing either the club head or shaft is not easily done by the consumer. Motivations for modifying a club include a change in a golfer s physical condition e.g. a younger golfer has grown taller an increase the golfer s skill or to adjust to playing conditions. Typically these modifications must be made by a technician at a pro shop. The attendant cost and time spent without clubs may dissuade golfers from modifying their clubs as often as they would like resulting in a less than optimal golfing experience. Thus there has been effort to provide golf clubs that are capable of being assembled and disassembled by the golfing consumer.

To that end golf clubs having club heads that are removably attached to a shaft by a mechanical fastener are known in the art. For example U.S. Pat. No. 7 083 529 to Cackett et al. hereinafter Cackett discloses a golf club with interchangeable head shaft connections. The connection includes a tube a sleeve and a mechanical fastener. The sleeve is mounted on a tip end of the shaft. The shaft with the sleeve mounted thereon is then inserted in the tube which is mounted in the club head. The mechanical fastener secures the sleeve to the tube to retain the shaft in connection with the club head. The sleeve has a lower section that includes a keyed portion which has a configuration that is complementary to the keyway defined by a rotation prevention portion of the tube. The keyway has a non circular cross section to prevent rotation of the sleeve relative to the tube. The keyway may have a plurality of splines or a rectangular or hexagonal cross section.

While removably attachable golf club heads of the type represented by Cackett provide golfers with the ability to disassemble a club head from a shaft it is necessary that they also provide club head shaft interconnections that have the integrity and rigidity of conventional club head shaft interconnection. For example the manner in which rotational movement between the constituent components of a club head shaft interconnection is restricted must have sufficient load bearing areas and resistance to stripping. Consequently there is room for improvement in the art.

Additionally the center of gravity CG of a golf club head is a critical parameter of the club s performance. Upon impact the position of the CG greatly affects launch angle and flight trajectory of a struck golf ball. Thus much effort has been made over positioning the center of gravity of golf club heads. To that end current driver and fairway wood golf club heads are typically formed of lightweight yet durable material such as steel or titanium alloys. These materials are typically used to form thin club head walls. Thinner walls are lighter and thus result in greater discretionary weight i.e. weight available for redistribution around a golf club head. Greater discretionary weight allows golf club manufacturers more leeway in assigning club mass to achieve desired golf club head mass distributions.

Golf swings vary among golfers. The mass properties e.g. CG location moment of inertia etc. and design geometry e.g. static loft of a given golf club may provide a high level of performance for a golfer having a relatively high swing speed but not for a golfer having a relatively slower swing speed.

It should therefore be appreciated that there is a need for golf club heads and golf clubs having designs that perform over a wide range of club head swing speeds. The present application fulfills this need and others.

Some embodiments of a golf club head comprises a body having a face a crown and a sole together defining an interior cavity the body having a channel located on the sole and extending generally from a heel end of the body to a toe end of the body. The minimum distance between a vertical plane intersecting a center of the face and a forward channel or track is less than about 50 mm over a full length of the channel. A weight member can be movably positioned within the channel such that a position of the weight member within the channel is able to be adjusted.

In some of these embodiments the distance between the vertical plane and the channel is less than about 40 mm over a full length of the channel. In still other embodiments the distance between the vertical plane and the channel is less than about 30 mm over a full length of the channel.

In some of these embodiments a ledge extends within the channel from the heel end of the body to the toe end of the body. The ledge can include a plurality of locking projections located on an exposed surface of the ledge. In some of these embodiments the weight member includes an outer member retained within the channel and in contact with the ledge an inner member retained within the channel and a fastening bolt that connects the outer member to the inner member.

In some of these embodiments the outer member has a length L extending generally in the heel to toe direction of the channel and each adjacent pair of locking projections are separated by a distance D along the ledge with L D.

In some of these embodiments a rotatably adjustable sole piece is secured to the sole at one of a plurality of rotational positions with respect to a central axis extending through the sole piece. The sole piece extends a different axial distance from the sole at each of the rotational positions. Adjusting the sole piece to a different one of the rotational positions changes the face angle of the golf club head independently of the loft angle of the golf club head when the golf club head is in the address position. In some of these embodiments a releasable locking mechanism is configured to lock the sole piece at a selected one of the rotational positions on the sole. The locking mechanism can include a screw adapted to extend through the sole piece and into a threaded opening in the sole of the club head body. In some of these embodiments the sole piece has a convex bottom surface such that when the sole piece is at each rotational position the bottom surface has a heel to toe curvature that substantially matches a heel to toe curvature of a leading contact surface of the sole.

The face includes a center face location that defines the origin of a coordinate system in which an x axis is tangential to the face at the center face location and is parallel to a ground plane when the body is in a normal address position a y axis extends perpendicular to the x axis and is also parallel to the ground plane and a z axis extends perpendicular to the ground plane wherein a positive x axis extends toward the heel portion from the origin a positive y axis extends rearwardly from the origin and a positive z axis extends upwardly from the origin. A maximum x axis position adjustment range of the weight member Max x is greater than 50 mm and a maximum y axis position adjustment range of the weight member Max y is less than 40 mm.

In some of these embodiments the weight member has a mass M and the product of M Max x is at least 250 g mm such as between about 250 g mm and about 4950 g mm.

In some of these embodiments the product of M Max y is less than 1800 g mm such as between about 0 g mm and about 1800 g mm.

In some of these embodiments a center of gravity of the body has a z axis coordinate CGz that is less than about 0 mm.

Some embodiments of a golf club head include a body having a face a crown and a sole together defining an interior cavity the body having a channel located on the sole and extending generally from a heel end of the body to a toe end of the body. A weight member can be movably positioned within the channel such that a position of the weight member within the channel is able to be adjusted thereby adjusting a location of a center of gravity of the body. The face includes a center face location that defines the origin of a coordinate system in which an x axis is tangential to the face at the center face location and is parallel to a ground plane when the body is in a normal address position a y axis extends perpendicular to the x axis and is also parallel to the ground plane and a z axis extends perpendicular to the ground plane wherein a positive x axis extends toward the heel portion from the origin a positive y axis extends rearwardly from the origin and a positive z axis extends upwardly from the origin. Adjustment of the weight member can provide a maximum x axis adjustment range of the position of the center of gravity Max CGx that is greater than 2 mm and a maximum y axis adjustment range of the center of gravity Max CGy that is less than 3 mm.

The following provides additional background information that may help further the understanding of the golf club head technology described within this description. Turning next to another embodiment of a golf club head includes several of the structures and features of the previous embodiments including a hollow body a crown sole skirt and a ball striking club face .

Club heads and many of their physical characteristics disclosed herein will be described using normal address position as the club head reference position unless otherwise indicated. illustrate one embodiment of a wood type golf club head at normal address position. illustrates a front elevation view of golf club head illustrates a top plan view of the golf club head and illustrates a side elevation view of the golf club head from the toe side. By way of preliminary description the club head includes a ball striking club face . At normal address position the club head is positioned on a plane above and parallel to a ground plane .

As used herein normal address position means the club head position wherein a vector normal to the club face substantially lies in a first vertical plane a vertical plane is perpendicular to the ground plane the centerline axis of the club shaft substantially lies in a second substantially vertical plane and the first vertical plane and the second substantially vertical plane substantially perpendicularly intersect.

A wood type golf club head such as the golf club head shown in includes a hollow body defining a crown portion a sole portion a skirt portion and a ball striking club face . The ball striking club face can be integrally formed with the body or attached to the body. The body further includes a heel portion a toe portion a front portion and a rear portion . The body further includes a hosel which defines a hosel bore adapted to receive a golf club shaft. In some embodiments a golf club shaft may be bonded to the body . Alternatively the club head may include an adjustable shaft connection system for coupling a shaft to the hosel such as the adjustable shaft connection systems described herein the details of which are not repeated here and not shown in for clarity. The club head also has a volume typically measured in cubic centimeters cm .

As used herein crown means an upper portion of the club head above a peripheral outline of the club head as viewed from a top down direction and rearward of the topmost portion of a ball striking surface of the ball striking club face . As used herein sole means a lower portion of the club head extending upwards from a lowest point of the club head when the club head is at the normal address position. In some implementations the sole extends approximately 50 to 60 of the distance from the lowest point of the club head to the crown . In other implementations the sole extends upwardly from the lowest point of the golf club head a shorter distance. Further the sole can define a substantially flat portion extending substantially horizontally relative to the ground when in normal address position or can have an arced or convex shape as shown in . As used herein skirt means a side portion of the club head between the crown and the sole that extends across a periphery of the club head excluding the striking surface from the toe portion around the rear portion to the heel portion . As used herein striking surface means a front or external surface of the ball striking club face configured to impact a golf ball. In some embodiments the striking surface can be a striking plate attached to the body using known attachment techniques such as welding. Further the striking surface can have a variable thickness. In certain embodiments the striking surface has a bulge and roll curvature discussed more fully below .

The body or any parts thereof can be made from a metal alloy e.g. an alloy of titanium an alloy of steel an alloy of aluminum and or an alloy of magnesium a composite material e.g. a graphite or carbon fiber composite a ceramic material or any combination thereof. The crown sole skirt and ball striking club face can be integrally formed using techniques such as molding cold forming casting and or forging. Alternatively any one or more of the crown sole skirt or ball striking club face can be attached to the other components by known means e.g. adhesive bonding welding and the like .

In some embodiments the striking face is made of a composite material while in other embodiments the striking face is made from a metal alloy e.g. an alloy of titanium steel aluminum and or magnesium ceramic material or a combination of composite metal alloy and or ceramic materials.

When at normal address position the club head is disposed at a lie angle relative to the club shaft axis as shown in and the club face has a loft angle as shown in . Referring to the lie angle refers to the angle between the centerline axis of the club shaft and the ground plane at normal address position. Referring to loft angle refers to the angle between a tangent line to the club face and a vector normal to the ground plane and passing thru the geometric center of the face at normal address position.

Referring to a club head origin coordinate system can be defined such that the location of various features of the club head including a club head center of gravity CG can be determined. A club head origin is illustrated on the club head positioned at the center of the striking surface .

The head origin coordinate system defined with respect to the head origin includes three axes a z axis extending through the head origin in a generally vertical direction relative to the ground when the club head is at the normal address position an x axis extending through the head origin in a toe to heel direction generally parallel to the striking surface e.g. generally tangential to the striking surface at the center and generally perpendicular to the z axis and a y axis extending through the head origin in a front to back direction and generally perpendicular to the x axis and to the z axis . The x axis and the y axis both extend in generally horizontal directions relative to the ground when the club head is at the normal address position. The x axis extends in a positive direction from the origin towards the heel of the club head . The y axis extends in a positive direction from the head origin towards the rear portion of the club head . The z axis extends in a positive direction from the origin towards the crown .

Generally the center of gravity CG of a golf club head is the average location of the weight of the golf club head or the point at which the entire weight of the golf club head may be considered as concentrated so that if supported at this point the head would remain in equilibrium in any position.

Referring to a CG is shown as a point inside the body of the club head . The location of the club CG can also be defined with reference to the club head origin coordinate system. For example and using millimeters as the unit of measure a CG that is located 3.2 mm from the head origin toward the toe of the club head along the x axis 36.7 mm from the head origin toward the rear of the club head along the y axis and 4.1 mm from the head origin toward the sole of the club head along the z axis can be defined as having a CGof 3.2 mm a CGof 36.7 mm and a CGof 4.1 mm.

The CG can also be used to define a coordinate system with the CG as the origin of the coordinate system. For example and as illustrated in the CG origin coordinate system defined with respect to the CG origin includes three axes a CG z axis extending through the CG in a generally vertical direction relative to the ground when the club head is at normal address position a CG x axis extending through the CG origin in a toe to heel direction generally parallel to the striking surface e.g. generally tangential to the striking surface at the club face center and generally perpendicular to the CG z axis and a CG y axis extending through the CG origin in a front to back direction and generally perpendicular to the CG x axis and to the CG z axis . The CG x axis and the CG y axis both extend in generally horizontal directions relative to the ground when the club head is at normal address position. The CG x axis extends in a positive direction from the CG origin to the heel of the club head . The CG y axis extends in a positive direction from the CG origin towards the rear portion of the golf club head . The CG z axis extends in a positive direction from the CG origin towards the crown . Thus the axes of the CG origin coordinate system are parallel to corresponding axes of the head origin coordinate system. In particular the CG z axis is parallel to z axis CG x axis is parallel to x axis and CG y axis is parallel to y axis .

As best shown in also show a projected CG point on the golf club head striking surface . The projected CG point is the point on the striking surface that intersects with a line that is normal to the tangent line of the ball striking club face and that passes through the CG . This projected CG point can also be referred to as the zero torque point because it indicates the point on the ball striking club face that is centered with the CG . Thus if a golf ball makes contact with the club face at the projected CG point the golf club head will not twist about any axis of rotation since no torque is produced by the impact of the golf ball.

In certain embodiments disclosed herein the projected CG point on the ball striking club face is located below the geometric center of the club face. In other words the projected CG point on the ball striking club face is closer to the sole of the club face than the geometric center. As a result and as illustrated in when the golf club is swung such that the club head impacts a golf ball at the club head s center the impact is off center from the projected CG point creating torque that causes the body of the golf club head to rotate or twist about the CG x axis which is normal to the page in . This rotation of the golf club head about the x axis is illustrated in by arrows . The rotation of the club face creates a z axis gear effect. More specifically the rotation of the club head about the CG x axis tends to induce a component of spin on the ball. In particular the backward rotation shown by arrows of the club head face that occurs as the golf ball is compressed against the club face during impact causes the ball to rotate in a direction opposite to the rotation of the club face much like two gears interfacing with one another. Thus the backward rotation of the club face during impact creates a component of forward rotation shown by arrows in the golf ball. This effect is termed the z axis gear effect. 

Because the loft of a golf club head also creates a significant amount of backspin in a ball impacted by the golf club head the forward rotation resulting from the z axis gear effect is typically not enough to completely eliminate the backspin of the golf ball but instead reduces the backspin from that which would normally be experienced by the golf ball.

In general the forward rotation or topspin component resulting from the z axis gear effect is increased as the impact point of a golf ball moves upward from or higher above the projected CG point on the ball striking club face. Additionally the effective loft of the golf club head that is experienced by the golf ball and that determines the launch conditions of the golf ball can be different than the static loft of the golf club head. The difference between the golf club head s effective loft at impact and its static loft angle at address is referred to as dynamic loft and can result from a number of factors. In general however the effective loft of a golf club head is increased from the static loft as the impact point of a golf ball moves upward from or higher than the projected CG point on the ball striking club face.

Lower center of gravity values can be attained by distributing club head mass to particular locations in the golf club head. Discretionary mass generally refers to the mass of material that can be removed from various structures providing mass and that can be distributed elsewhere for locating the club head center of gravity.

Club head walls provide one source of discretionary mass. A reduction in wall thickness reduces the wall mass and provides mass that can be distributed elsewhere. For example in some implementations one or more walls of the club head can have a thickness less than approximately 0.7 mm. In some embodiments the crown can have a thickness of approximately 0.65 mm throughout at least a majority of the crown. In addition the skirt can have a similar thickness whereas the sole can have a greater thickness e.g. more than approximately 1.0 mm . Thin walls particularly a thin crown provide significant discretionary mass.

To achieve a thin wall on the club head body such as a thin crown a club head body can be formed from an alloy of steel or an alloy of titanium. In other embodiments the thin walls of the club head body are formed of a non metallic material such as a composite material ceramic material thermoplastic or any combination thereof. For example in particular embodiments the crown and the skirt are formed of a composite material.

To lower the center of gravity within the club head body one or more portions of the sole can be formed of a higher density material than the crown and the skirt . For example the sole can be formed of metallic material such as tungsten or a tungsten alloy. The sole can also be shaped so that the center of gravity is closer or further from the golf ball striking club face as desired.

Golf club heads according to the disclosed technology can also use one or more weight plates weight pads or weight ports in order to lower the center of gravity to the desired CGlocation. For example certain embodiments of the disclosed golf club heads have one or more integral weight pads cast into the golf club head at predetermined locations e.g. in the sole of the golf club head that lower the club head s center of gravity. Also epoxy can be added to the interior of the club head through the club head s hosel opening to obtain a desired weight distribution. Alternatively one or more weights formed of high density materials e.g. tungsten or tungsten alloy can be attached to the sole. Such weights can be permanently attached to the club head. Furthermore the shape of such weights can vary and is not limited to any particular shape. For example the weights can have a disc elliptical cylindrical or other shape.

The golf club head can also define one or more weight ports formed in the body that are configured to receive one or more weights. For example one or more weight ports can be disposed in the sole . The weight port can have any of a number of various configurations to receive and retain any of a number of weights or weight assemblies such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 407 447 and 7 419 441 which are incorporated herein by reference. These and all other referenced patents and applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Furthermore where a definition or use of a term in a reference which is incorporated by reference herein is inconsistent or contrary to the definition of that term provided herein the definition of that term provided herein applies and the definition of that term in the reference does not apply.

Inclusion of one or more weights in the weight port s provides a customized club head mass distribution with corresponding customized moments of inertia and center of gravity locations. Adjusting the location of the weight port s and the mass of the weights and or weight assemblies provides various possible locations of center of gravity and various possible mass moments of inertia using the same club head.

In further embodiments one or more openings in the walls of the golf club head body are formed. For example the crown of the golf club head can include an opening. A lightweight panel can be positioned within each opening in order to close the opening. By selecting a material for the panels that is less dense than the material used to form the club head body the difference between the mass of the body material that would otherwise occupy the opening and the panel can be positioned elsewhere in the club head. For example by strategically selecting the number size and location of the openings the center of gravity of the golf club head can be lowered to a desired position within the club head body. The panels may comprise for example carbon fiber epoxy resin carbon fiber reinforced plastic polyurethane or quasi isotropic composites. The panels can be attached using adhesive or any other suitable technique.

In addition to redistributing mass within a particular club head envelope as discussed above the club head center of gravity location can also be tuned by modifying the club head external envelope. For example the club head body can be extended rearwardly and its overall height can be reduced. In specific embodiments for example the crown of the club head body is indented or otherwise includes an at least partially concave shape thereby distributing the weight of the crown lower into the club head body.

Referring to golf club head moments of inertia are typically defined about the three CG axes that extend through the golf club head center of gravity . For example a moment of inertia about the golf club head CG x axis can be calculated by the following equation 1 where y is the distance from a golf club head CG xz plane to an infinitesimal mass dm and z is the distance from a golf club head CG xy plane to the infinitesimal mass dm. The golf club head CG xz plane is a plane defined by the golf club head CG x axis and the golf club head CG z axis . The CG xy plane is a plane defined by the golf club head CG x axis and the golf club head CG y axis .

The moment of inertia about the CG x axis I is an indication of the ability of the golf club head to resist twisting about the CG x axis. A higher moment of inertia about the CG x axis I indicates a higher resistance to the upward and downward twisting of the golf club head resulting from high and low off center impacts with the golf ball.

In certain embodiments of the disclosed golf club heads the moment of inertia Iis at least 250 kg mm. For example in certain embodiments the moment of inertia Iis between 250 kg mmand 800 kg mm. It has been observed that for embodiments of the disclosed golf club heads in which the projected CG on the club head face is lower than the geometric center a lower moment of inertia can increase the dynamic loft and decrease the backspin experienced by a golf ball struck at the geometric center of the club. Thus in particular embodiments the moment of inertia Iis relatively low e.g. between 250 kg mmand 500 kg mm . In such embodiments the relatively low moment of inertia contributes to the reduction in golf ball spin thereby helping a golf ball obtain the desired high launch low spin trajectory e.g. a trajectory similar to that shown in . In still other embodiments the moment of inertia is less than 250 kg mm e.g. between 150 250 kg mmor between 200 250 kg mm . Adjusting the location of the discretionary mass in a golf club head using the methods described herein can provide the desired moment of inertia Iin embodiments of the disclosed golf club heads.

Delta 1 is a measure of how far rearward in the club head body the CG is located. More specifically Delta 1 is the distance between the CG and the hosel axis along the y axis in the direction straight toward the back of the body of the golf club face from the geometric center of the striking face . It has been observed that for embodiments of the disclosed golf club heads smaller values of Delta 1 result in lower projected CGs on the club head face. Thus for embodiments of the disclosed golf club heads in which the projected CG on the ball striking club face is lower than the geometric center reducing Delta 1 can lower the projected CG and increase the distance between the geometric center and the projected CG. Recall also that a lower projected CG creates a lower dynamic loft and more reduction in backspin due to the z axis gear effect. Although the club loft angle is static when the is large the CG of the golf club head is in a position to cause added loft to the club head during use. This occurs because at impact the offset CG of the golf club head from the shaft axis creates a moment of the golf club head about the x axis heel to toe axis that causes rotation of the golf club head about the x axis. The larger becomes the greater the moment arm to generate a moment about the x axis. Therefore if is particularly large greater rotation is seen of the golf club head about the x axis. The increased rotation leads to added loft at impact.

Thus for particular embodiments of the disclosed golf club heads the Delta 1 values are relatively small thereby reducing the amount of backspin on the golf ball and helping the golf ball obtain the desired high launch low spin trajectory e.g. a trajectory similar to that shown in . For example in certain embodiments the Delta 1 values are 25 mm or less e.g. in the range of 10 25 mm . Adjusting the location of the discretionary mass in a golf club head as described herein can provide the desired Delta 1 value. For instance Delta 1 can be manipulated by varying the mass in front of the CG closer to the face with respect to the mass behind the CG. That is by increasing the mass behind the CG with respect to the mass in front of the CG Delta 1 can be increased. In a similar manner by increasing the mass in front of the CG with the respect to the mass behind the CG Delta 1 can be decreased.

Embodiments of the disclosed golf club heads disclosed herein can have a variety of different volumes. For example certain embodiments of the disclosed golf club heads are for drivers and have a head volume of between 250 and 460 cmand a weight of between 180 and 210 grams. Other embodiments of the disclosed golf club heads may include fairway woods incorporating any one or more aspects of the disclosed technology and having a volume between about 130 and 220 cmand a weight of between about 190 and 225 grams whereas embodiments of so called hybrid woods incorporating any one or more aspects of the disclosed technology may have a volume between about 80 and 150 cmand a weight of between about 210 and 240 grams. Other embodiments of the disclosed golf club heads have a volume larger than 460 cm. If such a club head is desired it can be constructed as described herein by enlarging the size of the strike plate and the outer shell of the golf club head. Furthermore such large club heads allow for greater opportunity to achieve a lower CGin the golf club head. It should also be understood that golf club heads that have volumes or dimensions in excess of the current U.S.G.A. rules on clubs and ball are possible and contemplated by this disclosure.

Until recently conventional wisdom has been to move the center of gravity CG position of the clubhead rearward as this movement of the CG can increase the clubhead s moment of inertia in some designs. The golf club head described herein is an example of moving the CG position of the clubhead low and rearward. However there are several unexpected advantages of placing the weight in the forward position of the clubhead which results in a lower projection point of the center of gravity onto the face as compared to one where the CG is further back from the face. This in turn can reduce the effect of so called dynamic lofting which occurs during the golf swing when the is particularly large.

Although dynamic lofting may be desired in some situations and as such low and rearward CG may be a desired design element it can causes some negative effects on the resulting ball flight. First for each degree of added dynamic loft launch angle increases by 0.5 0.75 . Second for each degree of added dynamic loft spin rate increases by about 200 250 rpm.

An advantage of low forward CG is that the center of gravity projects closer to the center face which gives lower spin and more ballspeed for center face impacts. Also with low forward CG the club has less dynamic loft at impact which may require the golfer to use a club with higher static loft. For example a club with a CGz less than 2 mm and Delta 1 of less than 16 mm could require a higher loft than a standard CG position. In specific embodiments the static loft is between 11 and 19 . More preferably it could be advantageous to have a static loft between 14 and 17 for a driver with a volume greater than 400 cc. More preferably the Delta 1 would be less than 14 mm or even more preferably less than 12 mm. Also more preferably the CGz would be less than 3 mm or even more preferably less than 4 mm.

The increased spin rate is due to several factors. First the dynamic lofting simply creates higher loft and higher loft leads to more backspin. The second and more unexpected explanation is gear effect. The projection of a rearward CG onto the face of the golf club head creates a projection point above center face center face being the ideal impact location for most golf club heads . Gear effect theory states that when the projection point is offset from the strike location the gear effect causes rotation of the golf ball toward the projection point. Because center face is an ideal impact location for most golf club heads offsetting the projection point from the center face can cause a gear effect on perfectly struck shots. Thus loft of the golf club head causes the projection point to be above the center face or above the ideal strike location. This results in a gear effect on center strikes that causes the ball to rotate up the face of the golf club head generating even greater backspin. Backspin may be problematic in some designs because the ball flight will balloon or in other words rise too quickly and the distance of travel of the resultant golf shot will be shorter than for optimal spin conditions.

A further consideration with offsetting the CG such that the projection point is not aligned with center face is the potential loss of energy due to spin. Because of the aforementioned gear effect problem moving the projection point anywhere other than the ideal strike location reduces the energy transfer on ideal strikes as more energy is turned into spin. As such golf club heads for which the projection point is offset from the ideal strike location may experience less distance on a given shot than golf club heads for which the projection point is aligned with the ideal strike location assumed to be at center face .

In the embodiment shown each locking projection has a generally hemispherical shape.

In alternative embodiments the locking projections may be located on one or more other surfaces defined by the front ledge and or rear ledge . For example in some embodiments locking projections are located on an outward facing surface of the front ledge while in other embodiments the locking projections are located on an inward facing surface of one or both of the front ledge and rear ledge . In further embodiments the weight assembly is retained on the front and rear ledges without the use of locking projections.

In alternative embodiments the plurality of projections serve as markers or indices to help locate the position of the weight assembly along the channel but do not perform any locking function. Instead the weight assembly is locked into place at a selected position along the channel by tightening the bolt . In these embodiments the plurality of projections are sized of a width smaller than the width of the recesses in the washer such that the washer can move a limited amount when placed over one of the projections .

Turning next to additional details relating to the channel and front and rear ledges are shown in the illustrated embodiments in which the weight assembly is not included for clarity. In the embodiments shown the channel includes a front channel wall a rear channel wall and a bottom channel wall . The front rear and bottom channel walls collectively define an interior channel volume within which the weight assembly is retained. The front ledge extends rearward from the front channel wall into the interior channel volume and the rear ledge extends forward from the rear channel wall into the interior channel volume.

In the embodiments shown in the Figures the channel is substantially straight within the X Y plane see e.g. and generally tracks the curvature of the sole within the X Z and Y Z planes see e.g. . The channel is located in a forward region of the sole i.e. toward the front portion of the club head. For example in some embodiments the entire channel is located in a forward 50 region of the sole such as in a forward 40 region of the sole such as in a forward 30 region of the sole . The referenced forward regions of the sole are defined in relation to an imaginary vertical plane that intersects an imaginary line extending between the center of the face plate and the rearward most point on the rear portion of the club head. The imaginary vertical plane is also parallel to a vertical plane which contains the shaft longitudinal axis when the shaft is in the correct lie i.e. typically 60 degrees 5 degrees and the sole is resting on the playing surface the club is in the grounded address position . The imaginary line is assigned a length L. Accordingly the forward 50 region of the sole is the region of the sole located toward the front portion of the club head relative to the imaginary vertical plane where the imaginary vertical plane is located at a distance of 0.5 L from the center of the face plate . The forward 40 region of the sole is the region of the sole located toward the front portion of the club head relative to the imaginary vertical plane where the imaginary vertical plane is located at a distance of 0.4 L from the center of the face plate . The forward 30 region of the sole is the region of the sole located toward the front portion of the club head relative to the imaginary vertical plane where the imaginary vertical plane is located at a distance of 0.3 L from the center of the face plate .

In the embodiments shown the minimum distance between a vertical plane passing through the center of the face plate and the channel at the same x coordinate as the center of the face plate is between about 10 mm and about 50 mm such as between about 20 mm and about 40 mm such as between about 25 mm and about 30 mm. In the embodiments shown the width of the channel i.e. the horizontal distance between the front channel wall and rear channel wall adjacent to the locations of front ledge and rear ledge may be between about 8 mm and about 20 mm such as between about 10 mm and about 18 mm such as between about 12 mm and about 16 mm. In the embodiments shown the depth of the channel i.e. the vertical distance between the bottom channel wall and an imaginary plane containing the regions of the sole adjacent the front and rear edges of the channel may be between about 6 mm and about 20 mm such as between about 8 mm and about 18 mm such as between about 10 mm and about 16 mm. In the embodiments shown the length of the channel i.e. the horizontal distance between the heel end of the channel and the toe end of the channel may be between about 30 mm and about 120 mm such as between about 50 mm and about 100 mm such as between about 60 mm and about 90 mm.

The weight assembly and the manner in which the weight assembly is retained on the front and rear ledges within the channel are shown in more detail in . In the embodiments shown the weight assembly includes three components a washer a mass member and a fastening bolt . The washer is located within an outer portion of the interior channel volume engaging the outward facing surfaces of the front ledge and rear ledge . The mass member is located within an inner portion of the interior channel volume engaging the inward facing surfaces of the front ledge and rear ledge . The fastening bolt has a threaded shaft that extends through a center aperture of the washer and engages mating threads located in a center aperture of the mass member .

Each of the washer and the mass member may be formed of materials such as aluminum titanium stainless steel tungsten metal alloys containing these materials or combinations of these materials. The fastening bolt is preferably formed of titanium alloy or stainless steel. In the embodiments shown each of the washer and mass element has a length and width that ranges from about 8 mm to about 20 mm such as from about 10 mm to about 18 mm such as from about 12 mm to about 16 mm. The height of the washer and mass element embodiments shown in the Figures is from about 2 mm to about 8 mm such as from about 3 mm to about 7 mm such as from about 4 mm to about 6 mm.

The addition of the channel and an attached adjustable weight assembly can undesirably change the sound the club makes during impact with a ball. Accordingly one or more ribs are provided on the internal surface of the sole i.e. within the internal cavity of the club head . The ribs on the internal surface of the sole can be oriented in several different directions and can tie the channel to other strong structures of the club head body such as the sole of the body and or the skirt region between the sole and the crown. One or more ribs can also be tied to the hosel to further stabilize the sole. With the addition of such ribs on the internal surface of the sole the club head can produce higher sound frequencies when striking a golf ball on the face as discussed above in relation to the ribs associated with the adjustable sole plate port.

In some embodiments the weight assembly is installed into the channel by placing the weight assembly into an installation cavity located adjacent to the toe end of the channel. The installation cavity is a portion of the channel in which the front ledge and rear ledge do not extend thereby facilitating placement of the assembled weight assembly into the channel . Once placed into the installation cavity the weight assembly is shifted toward the heel end and into engagement with the front ledge and rear ledge . After the weight assembly is shifted completely out of the installation cavity an optional cap or plug see e.g. may be installed into the installation cavity to prevent removal of the weight assembly from the channel .

The embodiment shown in also includes an adjustable shaft attachment system for coupling a shaft to the hosel the system including various components such as a sleeve a washer a hosel insert and a screw more detail regarding the hosel and the adjustable shaft connection system can be found for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7 887 431 and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 13 077 825 12 986 030 12 687 003 12 474 973 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety . The shaft connection system in conjunction with the hosel can be used to adjust the orientation of the club head with respect to the shaft as described herein and in the patents and applications incorporated by reference. Some embodiments may comprise a composite face plate. Further details concerning the construction and manufacturing processes for the composite face plate are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 871 340 and U.S. Published Patent Application Nos. 2011 0275451 2012 0083361 and 2012 0199282. The composite face plate is attached to an insert support structure located at the opening at the front portion of the club head. Further details concerning the insert support structure are described in U.S. Pat. No. RE43 801.

The exemplary golf club heads described herein and shown in can include an adjustable sole piece and internal sole ribs an adjustable shaft attachment system a variable thickness face plate thin wall body construction movable weights inserted in weight ports and or any other club head features described herein. While this description proceeds with respect to the particular embodiments shown in these embodiments are only exemplary and should not be considered as a limitation on the scope of the underlying concepts. For example although the illustrated examples include many described features alternative embodiments can include various subsets of these features and or additional features.

Turning attention to another example of a golf club head golf club head will now be described. Golf club head includes several of the structures and features of the previous embodiments including a hollow body A a channel and a slidable weight assembly . The body A and thus the whole club head includes a front portion a rear portion a toe portion a heel portion a hosel a crown and a sole . The front portion forms an opening that receives a face plate which can be a variable thickness composite and or metal face plate as described herein.

The illustrated club head can also comprise an adjustable shaft connection system for coupling a shaft to the hosel . The adjustable shaft connection system may include various components such as without limitation a sleeve and a ferrule more detail regarding the hosel and the adjustable shaft connection system can be found for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7 887 431 and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 13 077 825 12 986 030 12 687 003 12 474 973 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety .

The club head is formed with a hosel opening or passageway that extends from the hosel through the club head and opens at the sole or bottom surface of the club head. The hosel opening may allow for passage of an attachment screw not shown that forms a part of the head shaft connection assembly discussed above. The shaft connection system in conjunction with the hosel can be used to adjust the orientation of the club head with respect to the shaft as described herein. The illustrated club head may also include an adjustable sole piece at a sole port or pocket as also described herein.

In the embodiments shown in the golf club head is provided with an elongated channel on a sole that extends generally from a heel end oriented toward a heel portion to a toe end oriented toward a toe portion . A front ledge and a rear ledge are located within the channel and a weight assembly is retained on the front and rear ledges within the channel . In the embodiment shown the channel is merged with the hosel opening that forms a part of the head shaft connection assembly discussed above.

In some embodiments channel may follow the curvature of the sole . This allows the slidable weight to maintain a low and forward position which in turn causes the CG to be lower and more forward. By positioning the weight assembly low and forward we have found this produces a ball flight with less backspin.

Further we have found that sliding the weight along the channel allows a golfer to better control his or her shot shape by repositioning the CGx of the club head. Moving the weight towards the toe of the club repositions the CGx to promote a fade bias. Likewise moving the weight towards the heel of the club repositions the CGx to promote a draw bias.

However we have found that repositioning the weight assembly can undesirably effect CGz. The effect on CGz is most pronounced when the weight assembly is in the extreme toe or heel position. In these extreme positions the CG projects higher on the face resulting in a tradeoff between shot shape control and low CG. Accordingly in some embodiments it may desirable to flatten the channel so that sliding the weight has less impact on CGz.

As shown in the sole of the club head includes a toe side winglet and a heel side winglet . These built up portions of the sole allow the channel radius of curvature in the heel toe direction to be different than that of the sole. Typically the sole has a relatively rounded e.g. 50 100 mm heel toe radius and it could be desirable to have a larger radius e.g. 100 150 mm of curvature for the channel to maintain the weight at a lower vertical height when the weight s are in the heel and toe positions. This helps maintain a consistently low CGz as the weight assembly slides along the channel.

In some embodiments the front and rear channel ledges may have radii in the range of 50 mm 400 mm and a channel ledge thickness between 0.5 mm to 3.0 mm. In other embodiments the front and rear channel ledges may be flat. In other embodiments the front and rear channel ledges may include a combination of flat and rounded sections. As discussed above a flatter channel or one with a large radius allows movement along the channel with less impact to CGz. This allows the CG to remain low and forward which allows for a CG that projects lower on the striking face.

Turning next to additional details relating to the channel and front and rear ledges are shown in the illustrated embodiments in which the weight assembly is not included for clarity. In the embodiments shown the channel includes a front channel wall a rear channel wall and a bottom channel wall . The front rear and bottom channel walls collectively define an interior channel volume within which the weight assembly is retained. The front ledge extends rearward from the front channel wall into the interior channel volume and the rear ledge extends forward from the rear channel wall into the interior channel volume. As shown channel may be an enclosed structure except for the open portion that weight assembly slides along. The channel may be an as cast feature or a machined feature.

In the embodiments shown in the channel is located in a forward region of the sole i.e. toward the front portion of the club head. For example in some embodiments the entire channel is located in a forward 50 region of the sole such as in a forward 40 region of the sole such as in a forward 30 region of the sole . The referenced forward regions of the sole are defined in relation to an imaginary vertical plane that intersects an imaginary line extending between the center of the face plate and the rearward most point on the rear portion of the club head. The imaginary vertical plane is also parallel to a vertical plane which contains the shaft longitudinal axis when the shaft is in the correct lie i.e. typically 60 degrees. .5 degrees and the sole is resting on the playing surface the club is in the grounded address position . The imaginary line is assigned a length L. Accordingly the forward 50 region of the sole is the region of the sole located toward the front portion of the club head relative to the imaginary vertical plane where the imaginary vertical plane is located at a distance of 0.5 L from the center of the face plate . The forward 40 region of the sole is the region of the sole located toward the front portion of the club head relative to the imaginary vertical plane where the imaginary vertical plane is located at a distance of 0.4 L from the center of the face plate . The forward 30 region of the sole is the region of the sole located toward the front portion of the club head relative to the imaginary vertical plane where the imaginary vertical plane is located at a distance of 0.3 L from the center of the face plate .

In the embodiments shown the distance between the CG of the weight assembly and a first vertical plane passing through the center of the face plate at the same x coordinate as the center of the face plate may be between about 5 mm and about 50 mm such as between about 10 mm and about 40 mm such as between about 25 mm and about 30 mm. In the embodiments shown the width of the channel i.e. the horizontal distance between the front channel wall and rear channel wall adjacent to the locations of front ledge and rear ledge may be between about 8 mm and about 20 mm such as between about 10 mm and about 18 mm such as between about 12 mm and about 16 mm. In the embodiments shown the depth of the channel i.e. the vertical distance between the bottom channel wall and an imaginary plane containing the regions of the sole adjacent the front and rear edges of the channel may be between about 6 mm and about 20 mm such as between about 8 mm and about 18 mm such as between about 10 mm and about 16 mm. In the embodiments shown the length of the channel i.e. the horizontal distance between the heel end of the channel and the toe end of the channel may be between about 30 mm and about 120 mm such as between about 50 mm and about 100 mm such as between about 60 mm and about 90 mm.

The weight assembly and the manner in which the weight assembly is retained on the front and rear ledges within the channel are shown in more detail in and A D. In the embodiments shown the weight assembly includes three components a washer a mass member and a fastening bolt . The washer is located within an outer portion of the interior channel volume engaging the outward facing surfaces of the front ledge and rear ledge . The mass member is located within an inner portion of the interior channel volume engaging the inward facing surfaces of the front ledge and rear ledge . The fastening bolt has a threaded shaft that extends through a center aperture of the washer and engages mating threads located in a center aperture of the mass member . This is a tension system for securing the weight assembly. Alternatively the washer could have the mating threads in a center aperture and the fastening bolt could go through a center aperture of the mass member and be tightened by a drive on the exposed outer surface of the bolt. In this embodiment the head of the bolt would be captured on the inner surface of the mass member holding it in place during tightening.

In some embodiments the washer may be heavier than mass member and vice versa. Or the washer and the mass member may have similar masses. An advantage of making the washer heavier than the mass member is an even lower CG. The washer and or mass member may have a mass in the range of 1 g to 50 g.

As shown in and similar to the weight assembly discussed in relation to club head the washer includes an inward facing surface and an outward facing surface . The washer may include a plurality of locking notches either protrusions and or indentations located along the inward facing surface of the washer such that the locking notches are adapted to engage locking projections either protrusions and or indentations located on the rear ledge when the weight assembly is retained within the channel .

The washer may further include a raised center ridge on the inward facing surface . The raised center ridge has a width dimension that is slightly smaller than the separation distance between the front ledge and rear ledge such that the center ridge is able to slide in the heel to toe direction within the channel while being laterally restrained by the front and rear ledges .

An embodiment of the mass member is shown in . The mass member includes an inward facing surface and outward facing surface and a center ridge extending through the outward facing surface . The raised center ridge has a width dimension that is slightly smaller than the separation distance between the front ledge and rear ledge such that the center ridge is able to slide in the heel to toe direction within the channel while being laterally restrained by the front and rear ledges . The mass member also has a threaded central aperture through which the threaded shaft of the fastening bolt is located.

In some embodiments the washer is heavier than the mass member. This allows for the CG to be even lower. Additionally this allows for the heavier piece e.g. washer to be removed and replaced with a different weight in fewer steps. Simply unscrewing the fastening bolt allows for removal of the washer which can be replaced with a heavier or lighter weight depending on user preferences. This is an important improvement over other designs that typically have an additional step involved to remove or replace a weight. For example other designs typically have something e.g. a cap or plug installed in along or adjacent a sliding weight track to prevent removal of a weight. Other designs require at least one additional step to remove the weight because this secondary object prevents the direct removal of the weight. Furthermore these designs typically do not allow for full use of the sliding weight track because the item preventing removal of the weight typically hinders full use of the sliding weight track in some way. This design however in some embodiments may allow for full use of the channel with substantially no unusable portions.

Another concern with these alternative designs is failure of the part retaining the weight such that the part fails to maintain engagement with the club head during a round of golf. In some instances this can result in a player s disqualification from a tournament. Accordingly this design improves upon earlier designs by eliminating the additional piece eliminating an additional step for weight removal providing substantially full use of the channel and eliminating the possibility of the failure described herein.

In some embodiments the weight assembly is installed into the channel by placing the weight assembly into an installation cavity located adjacent to the heel end of the channel . The installation cavity is a portion of the channel in which the front ledge and rear ledge extend thereby allowing for full use of the channel with substantially no unusable portions along the channel. Once placed into the installation cavity the weight assembly may be engaged with the front ledge and rear ledge or the weight assembly may be shifted to another position along the channel and then engaged with the front ledge and rear ledge .

Alternatively as shown in the weight assembly may be installed into the channel by first placing the mass member into the installation cavity located adjacent to the heel end of the channel then passing the fastening bolt through the center aperture of the washer and engaging the mating threads located on the mass member .

As shown in placing the mass member into the installation cavity may require first angling the mass member relative to the channel see and then inserting the mass member a sufficient distance underneath the rear ledge such that the mass member may rotate into position within the channel see . If the mass member is not inserted a sufficient distance it may not be able to rotate into position within the channel due to a possible interference with the front ledge of the channel . Once the mass member is rotated into position then the washer may be attached to the mass member using the fastening bolt . shows the how the mass member may transition slightly towards the front ledge when slid along the channel.

Similarly the entire weight assembly A may be installed using the same method as just described. First the fastening bolt must loosely be holding the assembly together next the entire assembly must be at an angle relative to the channel for insertion then inserted into the channel such that the mass member and the washer sandwich a portion of the rear ledge next the assembly may be rotated into position adjusted so that the weight assembly is sandwiching both the front and rear ledges between the mass member and the washer then the weight assembly may be slid to the desire position along the channel and finally the fastening bolt may be tightened so as to securely engage the channel.

In some embodiments the installation cavity may include a recessed or indented surface to facilitate installation of the mass member within the channel . As shown the recessed surface may be located between the rear ledge and the bottom channel wall . Additionally or alternatively the installation cavity and recessed surface may be located at a toe end of the channel . Additionally or alternatively the recessed surface may extend an entire length of the channel allowing for installation along the entire length of the channel. Additionally or alternatively the recessed surface may be located between the front ledge and the bottom channel wall .

The recess whether it extends the entire length of the channel or just a portion of the channel should be sized appropriately to accept the mass member or weight assembly. Typically this can be accomplished by making the channel dimensions slightly larger than the mass member so that mass member can slide with little resistance within the channel. In the embodiments shown the mass member is rectangular in shape with some thickness however the mass member could take the form of other geometric shapes and still engage the channel. For example the mass member could be frusto conical circular triangular trapezoidal hexagonal or some other shape.

As already discussed this method of installation allows for full use of the channel because the installation cavity is incorporated into the useable portion of the channel . Additionally in some embodiments to remove the weight assembly the club head mass member or weight assembly must be rotated. This prevents the mass member or weight assembly from unintentionally disengaging from the channel.

The mass member may be removed from the channel in many different ways the following description is one way in which a user may remove the mass member from the channel but is not the only way and is design dependent. To remove the mass member from the channel a user may rotate the club so that the sole is facing upwards e.g. towards the sky and the toe of the club is facing the user next the user may unscrew the bolt removing the bolt and the washer next the mass member should be positioned within the installation cavity then the user may slowly rotate the club clockwise until the mass member falls out. Depending on the channel and installation cavity design the mass member may fall out of the channel once the channel makes an angle of about 90 degrees or less with a horizontal plane e.g. the ground. This description is specific to a channel having an installation cavity along only a portion of the channel and the installation cavity is along the rearward ledge.

To use the adjustable weight system shown in the Figures a user may use an engagement end of a tool such as the torque wrench described herein to loosen the fastening bolt of the weight assembly . Once the fastening bolt is loosened the weight assembly may be adjusted toward the toe portion or the heel portion by sliding the weight assembly in the desired direction within the channel . Once the weight assembly is in the desired location the fastening bolt is tightened until the clamping force between the washer and the mass member upon the front ledge and or rear ledge is sufficient to restrain the weight assembly in place.

The addition of the channel and an attached adjustable weight assembly can undesirably change the sound the club makes during impact with a ball. Accordingly as shown in one or more ribs may be provided on the internal surface of the sole and or crown i.e. within the internal cavity of the club head . The ribs on the internal surface of the sole can be oriented in several different directions and can tie the channel to other strong structures of the club head body such as the sole of the body and or the skirt region between the sole and the crown. One or more ribs can also be tied to the hosel to further stabilize the sole. Additionally or alternatively the ribs may go across the channel and may or may not connect to the front lower portion of the face or face lip. With the addition of such ribs on the internal surface of the sole the club head can produce higher sound frequencies preferably greater than 2500 Hz more preferably greater than 3000 Hz most preferably greater 3400 Hz when striking a golf ball on the face as discussed above in relation to the ribs associated with the adjustable sole plate port.

Turning attention to another example of a golf club body golf club head B will now be described. Golf club head B includes many similar or identical features to golf club head combined in unique and distinct ways. Thus for the sake of brevity each feature of golf club head B will not be redundantly explained. Rather key distinctions between golf club head B and golf club head will be described in detail and the reader should reference the discussion above for features substantially similar between the two golf club heads.

As shown in the body B and thus the whole club head B includes a front portion a rear portion a toe portion a heel portion a hosel a crown and a sole . Golf club head B may include a channel B that may be open at one or both ends allowing for a weight assembly B to freely slide into position along the channel B. Similar to the other embodiments already discussed the channel B may merge with the hosel opening B. The weight assembly may include a slidable weight and a set screw not shown . Tightening the set screw secures the weight assembly B within the channel B. The set screw presses against the channel going into compression and thereby compressing the slidable weight against the rearward portion of the channel. This is a compression system for securing the weight assembly. Additionally or alternatively the open channel may include a bumper affixed to aperture to prevent the weight assembly from sliding out of the channel. This might be important if the set screw loosens during use.

Additionally or alternatively the channel B may be closed off at the heel and toe ends and instead include an installation cavity similar to that discussed above in regard to channel . The slidable weight could then be designed more similar to the mass member discussed above. Once the slidable weight was installed in the channel then the screw could be tightened which would cause the screw to compress against the bottom of the channel and correspondingly cause the slidable weight to compress against the channel ledges thereby securing the weight in place.

As discussed above the channel provides a user with the ability to adjust the club head CG so as to promote either a fade or draw bias. The channel is not necessarily straight and may have some curvature. The curvature may match either the front portion or rear portion of the club head. Or the curvature may take another form such as a partial or full circular shape.

The illustrated club head can also comprise an adjustable shaft connection system for coupling a shaft to the hosel such as the adjustable shaft connection systems described above the details of which are not repeated here and not shown for clarity.

The following discussion provides important background for understanding the embodiments shown in . Low and forward center of gravity in a wood type golf club head is advantageous for the variety of reasons discussed above. Moreover the combination of high launch and low spin is particularly desirable from wood type golf club heads.

Having a low and forward center of gravity location in wood type golf club heads aids in achieving the ideal launch conditions by reducing spin and increasing launch angle. In certain situations however low and forward center of gravity can reduce the moment of inertia of a golf club head if a substantial portion of the mass is concentrated in one region of the golf club head. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 731 603 filed Sep. 27 2007 entitled Golf Club Head increasing moment of inertia can be beneficial to improve stability of the golf club head for off center contact. For example when a substantial portion of the mass of the golf club head is located low and forward the center of gravity of the golf club head can be moved substantially. However moment of inertia is a function of mass and the square of the distance from the mass to the axis about which the moment of inertia is measured. As the distance between the mass and the axis of the moment of inertia changes the moment of inertia of the body changes quadratically. As such golf club heads with mass concentrated in one area can have particularly low moments of inertia in some cases.

Particularly low moments of inertia can be detrimental in some cases. Particularly with respect to poor strikes and or off center strikes low moment of inertia of the golf club head can lead to twisting. With respect to moment of inertia along the center of gravity x axis low moment of inertia can change flight properties for off center strikes. In the current discussion when the center of gravity is particularly low and forward in the golf club head strikes that are substantially above the center of gravity lead to a relatively large moment arm and potential for twisting. If the moment of inertia of the golf club head about the center of gravity x axis hereinafter the I is particularly low high twisting can result in energy being lost in twisting rather than being transferred to the golf ball to create distance. As such although low and forward center of gravity is beneficial for creating better launch conditions poor implementation may result in a particularly unforgiving golf club head in certain circumstances.

A low and forward center of gravity location in the golf club head results in favorable flight conditions because the low and forward center of gravity location results in a projection of the center of gravity normal to a tangent face plane see discussion of tangent face plane and center of gravity projection as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 839 727 entitled Golf Club filed Mar. 15 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . During impact with the ball the center of gravity projection determines the vertical gear effect that results in higher or lower spin and launch angle. Although moving the center of gravity low in the golf club head results in a lower center of gravity projection due to the loft of the golf club head moving the center of gravity forward also can provide a lower projection of the center of gravity. The combination of low and forward center of gravity is a very efficient way to achieve low center of gravity projection. However forward center of gravity can cause the Ito become undesirably low. Mass distributions which achieve low CG projection without detrimental effect on moment of inertia in general and I specifically would be most beneficial to achieve both favorable flight conditions and more forgiveness on off center hits. A parameter that helps describe the effectiveness of the center of gravity projection is the ratio of CG the vertical distance of the center of gravity as measured from the center face along the z axis to CG the distance of the center of gravity as measured rearward from the center face along the y axis . As the CG CGratio becomes more negative the center of gravity projection would typically become lower resulting in improved flight conditions.

As such the following golf club head embodiments aim to provide golf club heads having the benefits of a large negative number for CG CG indicating a low CG projection without substantially reducing the forgiveness of the golf club head for off center particularly above center strikes indicating a higher I . To achieve the desired results weight may be distributed in the golf club head in a way that promotes the best arrangement of mass to achieve increased I but the mass is placed to promote a substantially large negative number for CG CG.

As illustrated by CG CGprovides a measure of how low the CG projects on the face of the golf club head. Although CG CGmay be various numbers the chart of displays the same golf club head geometry with one mass and with split masses. For the single mass a single mass was varied throughout the golf club head to achieve varying MOIs from very far forward to very far rearward. With split masses two masses were placed on the periphery of the golf club head and the amount of mass was varied from all mass at the front to all mass at the back. As can be seen the single mass and split mass curves approach each other at their ends. This is because as split mass becomes more heavily unbalanced to one end or the other its distribution approaches that of a single mass. However it is important to note that with the split masses higher MOI can be achieved with a lower CG CGratio. Effectively this means that CG projection can be moved lower in the golf club head while maintaining relatively high MOI. The effectiveness of this difference will be determined by the specific geometry of each golf club head and the masses utilized.

Additionally U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 839 727 discusses that knowing the CGy distance allows the use of a CG effectiveness product to describe the location of the CG in relation to the golf club head space. The CG effectiveness product is a measure of the effectiveness of locating the CG low and forward in the golf club head. The CG effectiveness product CG is calculated with the following formula and in the current embodiment is measured in units of the square of distance mm 

With this formula the smaller the CG the more effective the club head is at relocating mass low and forward. This measurement adequately describes the location of the CG within the golf club head without projecting the CG onto the face. As such it allows for the comparison of golf club heads that may have different lofts different face heights and different locations of the center face. It should be understood that z and Z up may be used interchangeably. The CG effectiveness product will vary depending on the volume of the club head. In general a smaller club head volume such as below 250 cc will have a smaller CG effectiveness product. Similarly a larger club head volume such as greater than For the embodiments discussed herein with a club head volume less than 250 cc CGmay range from about 12 mm to about 20 mm and z may range from about 12 mm to about 18 mm. As such the CGof an embodiment with a club head volume less than 250 cc ranges from about 144 mmto about 360 mm. More specifically for a club head with a volume less than 200 cc the CGmay range from about 180 mmto about 300 mm. For the embodiments discussed herein with a club head volume greater than 250 cc CGmay range from about 20 mm to about 32 mm and z may range from about 20 mm to about 30 mm. As such the CGof an embodiment with a club head volume less than 250 cc ranges from about 400 mmto about 960 mm. More specifically for a club head with a volume greater than 400 cc the CGmay range from about 690 mmto about 750 mm.

Turning attention to another example of a golf club head golf club head D will now be described. Golf club head D includes many similar or identical features to golf club head combined in unique and distinct ways. Thus for the sake of brevity each feature of golf club head D will not be redundantly explained. Rather key distinctions between golf club head D and golf club head will be described in detail and the reader should reference the discussion above for features substantially similar between the two golf club heads.

The body D and thus the whole club head D includes a front portion a rear portion a toe portion a heel portion a hosel a crown and a sole . Golf club head D includes a channel similar to the channels discussed previously and additionally includes one or more forward weight ports A and one or more rearward weight ports B not shown on the sole. The one or more weight ports may be capable of accommodating one or more weights ranging from 1 g to 50 g. Additionally the weight for the weight port may be compatible and interchangeable with the washer that forms part of the weight assembly used with the channel . Additionally or alternatively the weight for the weight port may be compatible and interchangeable with the weight assembly used with the channel .

Turning to Section A shows a cross section view of the weight port and an installed washer D which may be circular triangular or rectangular or some other shape. As shown the bolt bolts to a threaded hole in the sole thereby securing the washer . A rubber washer or grommet may be used to keep the bolt and washer together when the weight is removed from the club head. Gap may be included to prevent the rubber washer from being compressed during tightening of bolt which could lead to loss of preload. If the washer is circular the bolt and the washer may be integrated into one unitary piece and do not need to be separate.

The threaded hole may be a through bore or blind bore. If the hole is a through bore a cap may be affixed to the underside of the sole before attaching either the crown or face plate to the golf club head. The cap may be affixed by gluing screwing pressing or welding it onto the sole or other similar methods and combinations. A through bore is easier to manufacture and could provide some cost savings over a blind bore. Capping of the hole may be desirable to avoid water intrusion into the club head and or to avoid possible USGA rule violations.

If there is a bonded on component to the head such as a crown sole or face it is easier to gain access to apply the cap to the backside of the through bore as oppose to a fully welded metallic head.

The illustrated club head can also comprise an adjustable shaft connection system for coupling a shaft to the hosel such as the adjustable shaft connection systems described herein the details of which are not repeated here and not shown in for clarity.

The weight port may allow a user to increase the overall MOI of the golf club head and correspondingly the spin imparted to the ball. For example by placing a heavy weight e.g. 10 30 grams in the rear of the club and using a light weight washer e.g. 1 5 grams in the front of the club the MOI is increased and the CG is moved rearward which would result in increased spin due to dynamic lofting effects. Although moving weight to the rear of the club would increase golf ball spin some users may prefer a high MOI club that resists twisting over a club that produces a lower spinning ball. Additionally some users may prefer a more traditional ball flight as shown in over the low and boring ball flight shown in that is produced by a low and forward CG golf club. Providing one or more weight ports on a rearward portion of the sole allows a user the option to select between a high MOI club with more spin producing a more traditional ball flight or a club with less spin producing a more boring ball flight.

Unexpectedly this combination produces a club exhibiting a higher MOI without drastically increasing the spin. Traditionally a high MOI has been accomplished by moving all of the weight to the rear of the club head. However this not only increases MOI but also unfavorably increases backspin. The increase in spin is due to an increase in delta 1 which causes a greater gear effect due to where the CG projects onto the face. By deviating from tradition and placing some weight at the front and some at the rear of the club head we achieved both a higher MOI and a lower spinning driver due to a smaller delta 1. The smaller delta 1 and increased MOI are due to the two weights being on opposing sides of the CG.

For example rather than placing 30 grams at the rear of the club 15 grams may be put at the rear and 15 grams at the front of the club or some other combination depending on user preferences. Additionally the weight ports also allow for swing weight adjustment.

For the preceding embodiments the golf club heads C and D may additionally or alternatively include an interchangeable or adjustable shaft attachment system for coupling a shaft to the hosel using the hosel opening .

Incorporating an adjustable shaft attachment system may allow a player to adjust the club head static loft either higher or lower. Additionally or alternatively such a system allows a player to easily interchange shafts depending on preference and swing parameters. For example a user hitting a club head with a low and forward CG would generally want to increase the club head loft to launch the golf ball higher and achieve optimum distance. However if the CG is moved rearward to increase MOI then the launch angle is going to be higher due to dynamic lofting and backspin will be increased. In this instance a user may want to decrease the loft of the club to achieve optimum distance by reducing the effective loft and the amount of backspin. Alternatively some users prefer a certain ball flight regardless of optimum distance. Providing an adjustable shaft system allows for greater accommodation of various users preferences.

Turning attention to another example of a golf club head golf club head E will now be described. Golf club head E includes many similar or identical features to golf club head combined in unique and distinct ways. Thus for the sake of brevity each feature of golf club head E will not be redundantly explained. Rather key distinctions between golf club head E and golf club head will be described in detail and the reader should reference the discussion above for features substantially similar between the two golf club heads.

The body E and thus the whole club head E includes a front portion a rear portion a toe portion a heel portion a hosel a crown and a sole . Golf club head E includes a rearward track E similar to the channels discussed previously however this channel extends rearward away from the face. In the embodiment shown the two channels merge to make a T shaped channel. The rearward track allows for adjustment of the MOI of the club head by sliding the weight assembly E rearward along the channel E. Having two channels allows for adjustment of MOI and shot shape. Weight assemblies and E may be interchangeable. Additionally or alternatively weight assemblies may be used in the forward channel heel toe or rearward track E.

Due to the curvature of the sole the rearward track E may also be slightly curved. shows two cross section views of the forward and rearward track geometry as well as the weight assembly. Section B is taken through the forward channel and Section A is taken through the rearward track E. Section B is the same geometry as discussed and shown in earlier figures. However as shown in Section A the washer and mass member have a slight curvature to accommodate for the curvature of the sole. In other words the washer and mass member may be relatively flat in one direction and have some curvature in another direction. This allows for the weight assemblies and E to slide between the forward and rearward tracks and be interchangeable. Additionally the curvature of the washer and the mass member may be modified to accommodate for alternative channel geometry such as for a curved channel.

Functionally the two weight assemblies perform in the same manner as discussed above. As shown in Section A of tightening bolt causes the weight assembly to clamp onto a heel side channel ledge and a toe side channel ledge . Additionally weight assembly E may include locking projections similar to those discussed above to further secure the weight assembly against the high G forces experienced during impact.

Similar to the forward channel the rearward track E may have some curvature and is not required to be straight. In some embodiments the reward channel E may be angled relative to the forward channel . For example the entire channel may look more like a 7 seven rather than a T shape due to the angle of the rearward track.

The illustrated club head can also comprise an adjustable shaft connection system for coupling a shaft to the hosel such as the adjustable shaft connection systems described herein the details of which are not repeated here and not shown for clarity.

The rearward track may allow for a weight to travel up to 125 mm rearward of the center face. The second weight may be inserted in the same manner as previously discussed with regard to the heel and toe channel . Additionally or alternatively the rearward track may include an insertion cavity or be open at the rearward end allowing for a weight to be slid into position within the channel E. Additionally or alternatively both weight assemblies may be installed at this opening.

Turning attention to golf club head F includes a rearward track F similar to the channels discussed previously however this channel does not merge with the forward channel. This allows for adjustment of the MOI of the club head by sliding the weight assembly F rearward along the channel F. Having forward and rearward channels allows for adjustment of MOI and shot shape. Weight assemblies and F may be interchangeable. Additionally or alternatively weight assemblies may be used in the forward channel heel toe or rearward track F.

Turning attention to another example of a golf club head golf club head will now be described. The most significant distinction between golf club head and golf club head A F is the volume. Golf club head has a volume range of between 110 cmto 250 cm whereas golf club head A F has a volume range of between 250 cmto 500 cm.

Golf club head A includes several of the structures and features of the previous embodiments including a hollow body A a channel and a slidable weight assembly . The body A and thus the whole club head includes a front portion a rear portion a toe portion a heel portion a hosel a crown and a sole . The front portion forms an opening that receives a face plate which can be a variable thickness composite and or metal face plate as described herein.

Turning attention to various configurations of golf club heads having multiple weight assemblies installed in the front and or rear channels are shown. Golf club head includes many similar or identical features to golf club head combined in unique and distinct ways. Thus for the sake of brevity each feature of golf club head will not be redundantly explained. Rather key distinctions between golf club head and golf club head will be described in detail and the reader should reference the discussion above for features substantially similar between the two golf club heads.

Golf club head includes a hollow body A a channel and a slidable weight assembly . The body A and thus the whole club head includes a front portion a rear portion a toe portion a heel portion a hosel a crown and a sole . The front portion forms an opening that receives a face plate which can be a variable thickness composite and or metal face plate as described herein.

The illustrated club head can also comprise an adjustable shaft connection system for coupling a shaft to the hosel via the hosel opening . The adjustable shaft connection system may also be used for adjusting loft and lie of golf club head A. Additionally club head may also include an adjustable sole piece at a sole port. These features are described in more detail in the patents incorporated by reference.

Similar to the above embodiments golf club head includes an elongated channel on a sole that extends generally from a heel end oriented toward a heel portion to a toe end oriented toward a toe portion . A front ledge and a rear ledge are located within the channel and one or more weight assemblies may be retained on the front and rear ledges within the channel . Weight assemblies may be installed into channel in similar fashion to that already described herein. In the embodiment shown the channel is merged with the hosel opening that forms a part of the head shaft connection assembly discussed above.

In each of the embodiments discussed throughout this description multiple weight assemblies may be used in the forward channel and or rearward track. For example golf club heads and may include multiple weight assemblies in the forward and or rearward tracks.

Using more than one weight assembly may increase the overall adjustability of the club head. For example additional weight assemblies may be used to further lower the golf club head CG adjust the swing weight adjust spin and or adjust the inertia of the golf club head.

As shown in golf club head A includes a second weight assembly in the forward channel which provides additional adjustability. For example a user may position a first weight assembly in the extreme heel position and the second weight assembly in the extreme toe position thereby increasing the moment of inertia about the y axis I and z axis I of the golf club head. This configuration may produce what some would consider a more forgiving golf club head due to the increased inertia mainly about the z axis. Alternatively a user may position both weights in a center position which would lower the CG of the golf club head resulting in reduced golf ball spin.

Although two weight assemblies are shown the channel may hold additional weight assemblies such as three or more four or more five or more six or more and or seven or more weight assemblies. Multiple weight assemblies would produce a heavier golf club head with a lower CG. Alternatively some users may prefer a lighter golf club head in which case the weight assemblies may be completely removed from the channel leaving the channel empty.

Turning to another example of how multiple weight assemblies may be used with the embodiments discussed above is shown. This configuration may allow a user to position more weight in the rear of the club which may increase the MOI of the golf club head in the x axis and z axis directions. Additionally this may increase spin which may be a preferable ball flight for some users over the more boring ball flight produced from a lower spinning club.

The additional weight assemblies may range in weight from 1 g to 50 g. Each weight assembly may include indicia to indicate its weight. For example the weight assemblies may be marked with letters numbers patterns or color coded to indicate weight or any combination thereof. The washer and or the mass member may each include weight identifying indicia.

In some implementations an adjustable mechanism is provided on the sole to decouple the relationship between face angle and hosel shaft loft i.e. to allow for separate adjustment of square loft and face angle of a golf club. For example some embodiments of the golf club head include an adjustable sole portion that can be adjusted relative to the club head body to raise and lower the rear end of the club head relative to the ground. Further detail concerning the adjustable sole portion is provided in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011 0312347 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Additionally as described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 686 677 filed Nov. 27 2012 entitled Golf Clubs and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety a rotatably adjustable sole piece ASP may be included in some of the embodiments which may be beneficial for adjusting the face angle.

A rotatably adjustable sole piece may be secured to the sole at one of a plurality of rotational positions with respect to an axis that may be centrally located extending through the sole piece. The sole piece may extend a different axial distance from the sole at each of the rotational positions. Adjusting the sole piece to a different one of the rotational positions may change the face angle of the golf club head independently of the loft angle of the golf club head when the golf club head is in the address position. In some of these embodiments a releasable locking mechanism is configured to lock the sole piece at a selected one of the rotational positions on the sole. The locking mechanism may include a screw adapted to extend through the sole piece and into a threaded opening in the sole of the club head body. In some of these embodiments the sole piece has a convex bottom surface such that when the sole piece is at each rotational position the bottom surface has a heel to toe curvature that substantially matches a heel to toe curvature of a leading contact surface of the sole.

Some embodiments of a golf club head comprise a rotatably adjustable sole piece configured to be secured to the sole at three or more rotational positions with respect to a central axis extending through the sole piece wherein the sole piece extends a different axial distance from the sole at each of the rotational positions. The adjustable sole piece can be generally triangular square pentagonal circular or some other shape and can be secured to the sole at three or more discrete selectable positions. The adjustable sole piece can include an annular side wall that includes three or more wall segments that are substantially symmetrical with one another relative to the central axis of the sole piece. In some embodiments adjusting the rotational position of the sole piece changes the face angle of the golf club head independently of the loft angle of the golf club head when the golf club head is in the address position.

The golf club head may further include a recessed sole port in the sole of the golf club head. The rotatably adjustable sole piece can be adapted to be at least partially received within the sole port. The sole piece can comprise a central body having a plurality of surfaces adapted to contact the sole port the surfaces being offset from each other along a central axis extending through the central body. The sole piece can be positioned at least partially within the sole port at three or more rotational and axial positions with respect to the central axis. At each rotational position at least one of the surfaces of the central body contacts the sole port to set the axial position of the sole piece. The sole port and the sole piece can each be generally triangular square pentagonal circular or some other shape when viewed from the bottom of the golf club head.

In some embodiments the golf club body may further comprises an adjustable sole piece that can be secured to a sole of the club head at three or more four or more five or more six or more and or seven or more different discrete rotational and axial positions with respect to an axis extending through sole piece wherein the face angle of the club head is different at each position of the sole piece. In some embodiments the sole piece comprises an outer wall that includes a plurality of notches that are configured to engage with corresponding ridges on the sole of the club head body to prevent the sole piece from rotating when the sole piece is secured to the sole. In some embodiments adjusting the sole piece between the different discrete rotational and axial positions does not cause a substantial change in the square loft angle of the club head. In some embodiments adjusting the sole piece between the different discrete rotational and axial positions allows the face angle of the club head to be adjusted over a range of at least 8 . In some embodiments the sole piece has a convex bottom surface such that when the sole piece is at each rotational position the bottom surface has a heel to toe curvature that substantially matches the heel to toe curvature of a leading surface portion of the sole. In some embodiments sole piece comprises a generally cylindrical stepped wall that comprises a plurality of wall sections in an angular array around the central axis wherein the wall sections comprise at least 3 at least 4 at least 5 at least 6 and or at least 7 trios of upper surfaces each trio of upper surfaces being configured to mate with the sole port of the body to set the sole piece at a different axial position relative to the sole.

In some embodiments the adjustable sole piece ASP may be incorporated into a weight and possibly into a movable weight. For example as shown in golf club head B includes a rearward weight port and a forward weight port with an installed ASP . As shown within the exposed rearward weight port is a raised platform that may be geometrically centered in the weight port. The platform may include a center post and two or more flared protrusions projections or ears extending from opposite sides of the center post designed to engage the ASP. As shown in the platform includes three protrusions but more or less protrusions may be used to engage the ASP.

Similarly the forward weight port may also include a similar platform for engaging the ASP so that the ASP may be interchangeable between the forward and rearward weight ports. Also as shown in the weight assembly the adjustable sole piece and adjustable hosel screw may all include a socket with lobes that may be engaged by a single tool such as for example a screwdriver Torx wrench or allan wrench.

Weight ports can be generally described as a structure coupled to the golf club head crown golf club head skirt golf club head sole or any combination thereof that defines a recess cavity or hole on about or within the golf club head. The weight port bottom defines a threaded opening for attachment of the weights . The threaded opening is configured to receive and secure a threaded body of the weight assembly . The threaded body may range from M2 M10 with the preferred embodiment having M5 0.8 threads. The threaded opening may be further defined by a boss extending either inward or outward relative to the weight port. Preferably the boss has a length at least half the length of the body of the screw and more preferably the boss has a length 1.5 times a diameter of the body of the screw. Alternatively the threaded opening may be formed without a boss.

As discussed in more detail in the applications referenced above rotating the ASP causes different portions of the ASP to engage the protrusions which in turn causes the ASP to extend different axial distances from the sole. Each axial distance corresponds to a change in face angle. In one embodiment the ASP includes a plurality of steps at various heights which engage the protrusions and allow for the axial distance adjustment.

Although not specifically shown the forward weight port may also include protrusions designed to engage the ASP. This allows for a combined ASP and movable weight. In the forward position the user may alter the face angle and achieve a low spinning driver due to the forward weight. Additionally or alternatively a user may move the combination ASP and weight to the rearward port and thereby increase MOI increase spin and maintain the same face angle adjustability. Notably the face adjustments may be made independent of loft and or lie adjustments.

In some embodiments both the forward and rearward weight ports may be designed to engage an ASP and the forward and rearward ASPs may work collaboratively to adjust the face angle. In other embodiments the face angle may be adjusted by a single ASP that is either located in the forward or rearward weight port. A light weight such as for example 1 gram may be used to cover either the forward or rearward weight port that is not in use.

Although a plurality of protrusions within a weight port are shown for engaging the ASP many other designs exist that would also alter the face angle. For example a wedge or trapezoid shape may be used instead. Rotating a wedge about an axis may cause changes in the face angle due to the varying distances of the wedge in contact with the ground.

The ASP may range in size and weight. The ASP may range in weight from 1 g to 50 g. Each combination weight and ASP may include indicia to indicate its weight such as letters numbers patterns or color coded to indicate weight or any combination thereof. Additionally or alternatively each combination weight and ASP may include indicia to indicate adjustment to the face angle such as neutral open and closed.

The ASP may allow for a range of adjustments between the open and closed positions allowing for a user to vary the amount the face is opened or closed. The ASP can change the face angle of the golf club head about 0.5 to about 12 degrees. For example a user may adjust the face angle from neutral to 2 open or 4 open.

The multiple weight ports and ASP combined with a sliding weight in a weight track provides additional adjustability. The weight assembly as shown includes a window which can be used to highlight various indicia along the sliding weight track. The indicia may indicate various degrees of draw or fade bias. The golf club head also includes an adjustable hosel and a screw for securing the adjustable hosel. The adjustable hosel may also be referred to as a FCT hosel which stands for Flight Control Technology. Flight Control Technology allows for adjustment of loft lie and or face angle. The adjustable hosel may allow a user to adjust the loft and or lie of the golf club head.

Turning to another embodiment of golf club head C is shown that is similar in most regards to the golf club head B embodiment shown in . A significant difference is golf club head C includes an aft winglet . The aft winglet deviates from the curvature of the sole and provides a CG lowering platform. The platform may simply be additional sole or it may be designed to accept either a weight or a combination ASP and weight. As best shown in the aft winglet deviates from the sole and provides a platform to further lower the CG.

The extended sole that is created from the aft winglet helps maximize MOI especially in the case of it holding an additional weight or ASP weight. Additionally because aft winglet deviates from the sole any additional weight placed there would minimally impact the CG projection onto the face. Additionally because the winglet there is less disruption to the aerodynamics of the club than there would be if the entire sole was lower. Moreover if the entire sole was lowered it would increase the overall volume of the head and may run up against the current USGA volume limitations.

Some current approaches to reducing structural mass of a metalwood club head are directed to making at least a portion of the club head of an alternative material. Whereas the bodies and face plates of most current metalwoods are made of titanium alloy several club heads are available that are made at least in part of components formed from either graphite epoxy composite or other suitable composite material and a metal alloy. Graphite composites have a density of about 1.5 g cm compared to titanium alloy which has a density of about 4.5 g cm which offers tantalizing prospects for providing more discretionary mass in the club head. For example considerable weight savings may be had by making the crown sole and or face plate of composite materials.

Composite materials that are useful for making metalwood club head components often include a fiber portion and a resin portion. In general the resin portion serves as a matrix in which the fibers are embedded in a defined manner. In a composite for club heads the fiber portion may be configured as multiple fibrous layers or plies that are impregnated with the resin component.

For example in one group of such club heads a portion of the body is made of carbon fiber graphite epoxy composite and a titanium alloy is used as the primary face plate material. Other club heads are made entirely of one or more composite materials. The ability to utilize lighter composite materials in the construction of the face plate can also provide some significant weight and other performance advantages

To date there have been relatively few golf club head constructions involving a polymeric material as an integral component of the design. Although such materials possess the requisite light weight to provide for significant weight savings it is often difficult to utilize these materials in areas of the club head subject to the stresses resulting from the high speed impact of the golf ball.

Any polymeric material used to construct the crown should exhibit high strength and rigidity over a broad temperature range as well as good wear and abrasion behavior and be resistant to stress cracking. Such properties include

In some embodiments the crown may be formed from a composite material such as a carbon composite made of a composite including multiple plies or layers of a fibrous material e.g. graphite or carbon fiber including turbostratic or graphitic carbon fiber or a hybrid structure with both graphitic and turbostratic parts present. Examples of some of these composite materials for use in the metalwood golf clubs and their fabrication procedures are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 442 348 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 267 620 Ser. No. 10 831 496 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 140 974 Ser.

The composite material may be manufactured according to the methods described at least in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 825 138 the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

Also included is a polyphenylene sulfide PPS formulation which is 30 Carbon Fiber Filled and available commercially from RTP Company under the trade name RTP 1385 UP.

In other embodiments the crown is formed as a two layered structure comprising an injection molded inner layer and an outer layer comprising a thermoplastic composite laminate. The injection molded inner layer may be prepared from the thermoplastic polymers with preferred materials including a polyamide PA or thermoplastic urethane TPU or a polyphenylene sulfide PPS . Typically the thermoplastic composite laminate structures used to prepare the outer layer are continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic resins. The continuous fibers include glass fibers both roving glass and filament glass as well as aramid fibers and carbon fibers. The thermoplastic resins which are impregnated into these fibers to make the laminate materials include polyamides including but not limited to PA PA6 PA12 and PA6 polypropylene PP thermoplastic polyurethane or polyureas TPU and polyphenylene sulfide PPS .

The laminates may be formed in a continuous process in which the thermoplastic matrix polymer and the individual fiber structure layers are fused together under high pressure into a single consolidated laminate which can vary in both the number of layers fused to form the final laminate and the thickness of the final laminate. Typically the laminate sheets are consolidated in a double belt laminating press resulting in products with less than 2 percent void content and fiber volumes ranging anywhere between 35 and 55 percent in thicknesses as thin as 0.5 mm to as thick as 6.0 mm and may include up to 20 layers. Further information on the structure and method of preparation of such laminate structures is disclosed in European patent No. EP1923420B1 issued on Feb. 25 2009 to Bond Laminates GMBH the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.

The composite laminates structure of the outer layer may also be formed from the TEPEX family of resin laminates available from Bond Laminates which preferred examples are TEPEX dynalite 201 a PA66 polyamide formulation with reinforcing carbon fiber which has a density of 1.4 g cm a fiber content of 45 vol a Tensile Strength of 785 MPa as measured by ASTM D 638 a Tensile Modulus of 53 GPa as measured by ASTM D 638 a Flexural Strength of 760 MPa as measured by ASTM D 790 and a Flexural Modulus of 45 GPa as measured by ASTM D 790.

Another preferred example is TEPEX dynalite 207 a polyphenylene sulfide PPS based formulation with reinforcing carbon fiber which has a density of 1.6 g cm a fiber content of 45 vol a Tensile Strength of 710 MPa as measured by ASTM D 638 a Tensile Modulus of 55 GPa as measured by ASTM D 638 a Flexural Strength of 650 MPa as measured by ASTM D 790 and a Flexural Modulus of 40 GPa as measured by ASTM D 790.

There are various ways in which the multilayered composite crown may be formed. In some embodiments the outer layer is formed separately and discretely from the forming of the injection molded inner layer. The outer layer may be formed using known techniques for shaping thermoplastic composite laminates into parts including but not limited to compression molding or rubber and matched metal press forming or diaphragm forming.

The inner layer may be injection molded using conventional techniques and secured to the outer crown layer by bonding methods known in the art including but not limited to adhesive bonding including gluing welding preferable welding processes are ultrasonic welding hot element welding vibration welding rotary friction welding or high frequency welding Plastics Handbook Vol. 3 4 pages 106 107 Carl Hanser Verlag Munich Vienna 1998 or calendaring or mechanical fastening including riveting or threaded interactions.

Before the inner layer is secured to the outer layer the outer surface of the inner layer and or the inner of the outer layer may be pretreated by means of one or more of the following processes disclosed in more detail in Ehrenstein Handbuch Kunststoff Verbindungstechnik Carl Hanser Verlag Munich 2004 pages 494 504 

In an especially preferred method of preparation a so called hybrid molding process may be used in which the composite laminate outer layer is insert molded to the injection molded inner layer to provide additional strength. Typically the composite laminate structure is introduced into an injection mold as a heated flat sheet or preferably as a preformed part. During injection molding the thermoplastic material of the inner layer is then molded to the inner surface of the composite laminate structure the materials fuse together to form the crown as a highly integrated part. Typically the injection molded inner layer is prepared from the same polymer family as the matrix material used in the formation of the composite laminate structures used to form the outer layer so as to ensure a good weld bond.

In addition to being formed in the desired shape for the aft body of the club head a thermoplastic inner layer may also be formed with additional features including one or more stiffening ribs to impart strength and or desirable acoustical properties as well as one or more weight ports to allow placement of additional tungsten or other metal weights.

The thickness of the inner layer is typically of from about 0.25 to about 2 mm preferably of from about 0.5 to about 1.25 mm.

The thickness of the composite laminate structure used to form the outer layer is typically of from about 0.25 to about 2 mm preferably of from about 0.5 to about 1.25 mm even more preferably from 0.5 to 1 mm.

As described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6 623 378 filed Jun. 11 2001 entitled METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING AND GOLF CLUB HEAD and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety the crown or outer shell may be made of a composite material such as for example a carbon fiber reinforced epoxy carbon fiber reinforced polymer or a polymer. Additionally U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10 316 453 and 10 634 023 describe golf club heads with lightweight crowns. Furthermore U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 974 437 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 608 591 describes golf club heads with lightweight crowns and soles.

Composite materials used to construct the crown should exhibit high strength and rigidity over a broad temperature range as well as good wear and abrasion behavior and be resistant to stress cracking. Such properties include 

Composite materials that are useful for making club head components comprise a fiber portion and a resin portion. In general the resin portion serves as a matrix in which the fibers are embedded in a defined manner. In a composite for club heads the fiber portion is configured as multiple fibrous layers or plies that are impregnated with the resin component. The fibers in each layer have a respective orientation which is typically different from one layer to the next and precisely controlled. The usual number of layers for a striking face is substantial e.g. forty or more. However for a sole or crown the number of layers can be substantially decreased to e.g. three or more four or more five or more six or more examples of which will be provided below. During fabrication of the composite material the layers each comprising respectively oriented fibers impregnated in uncured or partially cured resin each such layer being called a prepreg layer are placed superposedly in a lay up manner. After forming the prepreg lay up the resin is cured to a rigid condition. If interested a specific strength may be calculated by dividing the tensile strength by the density of the material. This is also known as the strength to weight ratio or strength weight ratio.

In tests involving certain club head configurations composite portions formed of prepreg plies having a relatively low fiber areal weight FAW have been found to provide superior attributes in several areas such as impact resistance durability and overall club performance. FAW is the weight of the fiber portion of a given quantity of prepreg in units of g m. FAW values below 100 g m and more desirably below 70 g m can be particularly effective. A particularly suitable fibrous material for use in making prepreg plies is carbon fiber as noted. More than one fibrous material can be used. In other embodiments however prepreg plies having FAW values below 70 g mand above 100 g mmay be used. Generally cost is the primary prohibitive factor in prepreg plies having FAW values below 70 g m.

In particular embodiments multiple low FAW prepreg plies can be stacked and still have a relatively uniform distribution of fiber across the thickness of the stacked plies. In contrast at comparable resin content R C in units of percent levels stacked plies of prepreg materials having a higher FAW tend to have more significant resin rich regions particularly at the interfaces of adjacent plies than stacked plies of low FAW materials. Resin rich regions tend to reduce the efficacy of the fiber reinforcement particularly since the force resulting from golf ball impact is generally transverse to the orientation of the fibers of the fiber reinforcement. The prepreg plies used to form the panels desirably comprise carbon fibers impregnated with a suitable resin such as epoxy. An example carbon fiber is 34 700 carbon fiber available from Grafil Sacramento Calif. having a tensile modulus of 234 Gpa 34 Msi and a tensile strength of 4500 Mpa 650 Ksi . Another Grafil fiber that can be used is TR50S carbon fiber which has a tensile modulus of 240 Gpa 35 Msi and a tensile strength of 4900 Mpa 710 ksi . Suitable epoxy resins are types 301 and 350 available from Newport Adhesives and Composites Irvine Calif. . An exemplary resin content R C is between 33 and 40 preferably between 35 and 40 more preferably between 36 and 38 .

Each of the golf club heads discussed throughout this application may include a separate crown sole and or face that may be a composite such as for example a carbon fiber reinforced epoxy carbon fiber reinforced polymer or a polymer crown sole and or face. Alternatively the crown sole and or face may be made from a less dense material such as for example Titanium or Aluminum. As an example shows a top view of golf club head F with a composite crown and shows a section view detailing the geometry. As shown in the sole face and a portion of the crown may all be cast from either steel 8.05 g cm or titanium 4.43 g cm while a majority of the crown may be made from a less dense material such as for example a material having a density of about 1.5 g cmor some other material having a density less than about 4.43 g cm. In other words the crown could be some other metal or a composite. Additionally or alternatively the face may be welded in place rather than cast as part of the sole.

By making the crown sole and or face out of a less dense material it may provide cost savings or it may allow for weight to be redistributed from the crown sole and or face to other areas of the club head such as for example low and or forward.

U.S. Pat. No. 8 163 119 discloses composite articles and methods for making composite articles which is incorporated by reference herein in the entirety. This patent discloses the usual number of layers for a striking plate is substantial e.g. fifty or more. However improvements have been made in the art such that the layers may be decreased to between 30 and 50 layers. As already discussed for a sole and or crown the layers can be substantially decreased down to three four five six seven or more layers.

The tables below provide examples of possible layups. These layups show possible crown and or sole construction using unidirectional plies unless noted as woven plies. The construction shown is for a quasi isotropic layup. A single layer ply has a thickness of ranging from about 0.065 mm to about 0.080 mm for a standard FAW of 70 gsm with about 36 to about 40 resin content. The thickness of each individual ply may be altered by adjusting either the FAW or the resin content and therefore the thickness of the entire layup may be altered by adjusting these parameters.

The Area Weight AW is calculated by multiplying the density times the thickness. For the plies shown above made from composite material the density is about 1.5 g cmand for titanium the density is about 4.5 g cm. Depending on the material used and the number of plies the composite crown and or sole thickness ranges from about 0.195 mm to about 0.9 mm preferably from about 0.25 mm to about 0.75 mm more preferably from about 0.3 mm to about 0.65 mm even more preferably from about 0.36 mm to about 0.56 mm. It should be understood that although these ranges are given for both the crown and sole together it does not necessarily mean the crown and sole will have the same thickness or be made from the same materials. In certain embodiments the sole may be made from either a titanium alloy or a steel alloy. Similarly the main body of the club may be made from either a titanium alloy or a steel alloy. The titanium will typically range from 0.4 mm to about 0.9 mm preferably from 0.4 mm to about 0.8 mm more preferably from 0.4 mm to about 0.7 mm even more preferably from 0.45 mm to about 0.6 mm. In some instances the crown and or sole may have non uniform thickness such as for example varying the thickness between about 0.45 mm and about 0.55 mm.

A lot of discretionary mass may be freed up by using composite material in the crown and or sole especially when combined with thin walled titanium construction 0.4 mm to 0.9 mm in other parts of the club. The thin walled titanium construction increases the manufacturing difficulty and ultimately that fewer parts are cast at a time. In the past 100 plus heads could be cast at a single time however due to the thin and thinner wall construction less heads are cast per cluster to achieve the desired combination of high yield and low material usage.

As discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 513 296 herein incorporated by reference in the entirety an important strategy for obtaining more discretionary mass is to reduce the wall thickness of the club head. For a typical titanium alloy metal wood club head having a volume of 460 cm i.e. a driver and a crown area of 100 cm the thickness of the crown is typically about 0.8 mm and the mass of the crown is about 36 g. Thus reducing the wall thickness by 0.2 mm e.g. from 1 mm to 0.8 mm can yield a discretionary mass savings of 9.0 g.

The following examples will help to illustrate the possible discretionary mass savings by making a composite crown rather than a titanium alloy crown. For example reducing the material thickness to about 0.73 mm yields an additional discretionary mass savings of about 25.0 g over a 0.8 mm titanium alloy crown. For example reducing the material thickness to about 0.73 mm yields an additional discretionary mass savings of about 25 g over a 0.8 mm titanium alloy crown or 34 g over a 1.0 mm titanium alloy crown. Additionally a 0.6 mm composite crown yields an additional discretionary mass savings of about 27 g over a 0.8 mm titanium alloy crown. Moreover a 0.4 mm composite crown yields an additional discretionary mass savings of about 30 g over a 0.8 mm titanium alloy crown. The crown can be made even thinner yet to achieve even greater weight savings for example about 0.32 mm thick about 0.26 mm thick about 0.195 mm thick. However the crown thickness must be balanced with the overall durability of the crown during normal use and misuse. For example an unprotected crown i.e. one without a head cover could potentially be damaged from colliding with other woods or irons in a golf bag.

As discussed in the patents referenced above and as best seen in the outer shell or composite crown preferably is attached to a strike sole plate combination . To improve the strength of the connection between the composite crown and the strike sole plate combination the composite crown and the strike sole plate combination preferably include interlocking joints which is additionally shown in .

In the illustrated embodiment the joint comprises mating sections A B formed on the composite crown and the strike sole plate combination respectively. Each mating section A B preferably includes abutment surfaces A B that is transverse to the outer surface of the composite crown . More preferably the abutment surface lies substantially normal to the outer surface of the composite crown . The abutment A B surfaces help to align the composite crown with the strike sole plate combination and to prevent lateral movement of these two components with respect to each other.

Each mating section B preferably includes an attachment surface at least two 2 times and preferably four 4 times as wide as the thickness of the composite crown . For example the ledge length or length of mating section B may range from about 3 mm to about 8 mm preferably from about 4 mm to about 7 mm more preferably from about 5.5 mm to about 6.5 mm. Additionally the mating section A may range in thickness from about 0.3 mm to about 2 mm preferably from about 0.5 mm to about 1.2 mm more preferably from about 0.6 mm to about 1.0 mm even more preferably from about 0.6 mm to about 0.8 mm.

The attachment surfaces preferably provide a surface for an adhesive and are generally parallel to the outer surface of the composite crown and midway between the inner surface and outer surface of the composite crown . This arrangement is preferred because it permits a longer attachment surface and thicker mating sections A B which increases the strength of the joint and the bond between the composite crown with the strike sole plate combination respectively. The attachment surfaces may extend along the entire perimeter of the composite crown 360 degrees . Alternatively instead of a lap joint as shown the composite crown may overlay the club body and then be polished for fit and finish.

The mating sections A B preferably extend completely along the interface between the composite crown with the strike sole plate combination . However it should be appreciated that in a modified arrangement the mating sections A B could extend only partially along the interface between the composite crown with the strike sole plate combination . In the illustrated arrangement each piece A B includes two abutment surfaces A B which are separated by the attachment surfaces. That is the abutment surfaces and the attachment surfaces form interlocking steps. However it should be appreciated that the mating sections can be formed into a variety of other shapes giving due consideration to the preference of providing a secure connection between the composite crown with the strike sole plate combination . For example the mating sections A B can comprise an interlocking tongue and groove arrangement or a matching inclined surface arrangement each of which includes abutment surfaces and attachment surfaces.

To permanently secure the composite crown with the strike sole plate combination an adhesive such as for example an epoxy is applied to one or both of the mating sections A B preferably along the attachment surfaces. In a modified arrangement the composite crown with the strike sole plate combination by fasteners that can extend through the joint . In some embodiments the strike sole plate combination may include bumps or pads to help locate the crown. The bumps provide a bond gap and help with achieving a flush fit. The bumps or pads range from about 0.1 mm to about 0.4 mm in height preferably about 0.15 mm in height. Alternatively but similarly spacers may be used that will also help to achieve a flush fit between the crown and the strike sole plate combination . Another advantage of using either spacers or bumps is less grinding is required due to variations in the strike sole plate combination and variations in the composite crown .

Turning to an exploded view is shown of the composite crown with the strike sole plate combination . Also visible in this view is the adjustable loft lie and or face angle FCT hosel .

Overall by using a composite crown and thin wall sections the mass savings are at least 25 g such as at least 30 g such as at least 35 g such as at least 40 g such as at least 45 g such as at least 50 g such as at least 55 g. Much of this weight was put back into the club head in the form of front and rear sliding weight tracks or the T track for short. Incorporating the front and rear sliding weight tracks into the sole not only required large amounts of mass for the structure but required additional mass to improve the sound of the club above 2900 Hz.

The sound of the club can improved in several ways. One way is to increase the wall thickness however a more efficient use of discretionary mass is to use ribs. By proper rib placement the first mode frequency can be increased from well below 2900 Hz to at least 2900 Hz such as at least 3000 Hz such as at least 3100 Hz such as at least 3200 Hz such as at least 3300 Hz such as at least 3400 Hz such as at least 3500 Hz such as at least 3600 Hz.

As shown in several ribs are visible with the crown removed. shows the crown completely removed and is used to generate the cross section view shown in . Turning to the backside of face plate is shown with an optional variable face thickness or VFT concentric circles additionally the structure for the front and rearward sliding weight tracks and F are visible. As shown several ribs are attached to the weight tracks. This is to stiffen the overall structure and increase the first mode frequency to at least 3400 Hz.

Each rib has an associated mass and an associated benefit in terms of frequency Hz improvement. Accordingly fewer ribs may be used to reduce the overall club weight however the first mode frequency will be impacted and in most cases will decrease. A sample rib pattern is shown in which is similar to that shown in . Table 14 below shows the impact of selectively removing a single rib at a time. For example removing rib 13 causes a 404 Hz detriment to the first mode frequency from 3411 Hz to 3006 Hz whereas removing rib 5 improved the first mode frequency by 34 Hz. There is an array of satisfactory designs one that was chosen was to remove ribs 5 11 and 17 to achieve a first mode frequency of 3421 Hz.

Notably the strike or face plate may be cast as one piece along with the other structure including the sole plate as discussed in the patents referenced above or the face plate may be welded to the golf club body. A single cast structure has some cost savings however a separate welded face allows for greater customization.

In some implementations a channel slot or some other member may be provided to increase the coefficient of restitution of the golf club head. For example some embodiments of the golf club head may include a channel a slot or other member that increases or enhances the perimeter flexibility of the striking face of the golf club head in order to increase the coefficient of restitution COR and or characteristic time of the golf club head.

In some instances the channel slot or other mechanism is located in the forward portion of the sole of the club head adjacent to or near to the forwardmost edge of the sole. Further detail concerning these features that increase or enhance COR of the golf club head is provided in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 13 338 197 13 469 031 13 828 675 filed Dec. 27 2011 May 10 2012 and Mar. 14 2013 respectively all entitled FAIRWAY WOOD CG PROJECTION and incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Additional detail concerning these features that increase or enhance COR can also be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 839 727 filed Mar. 15 2013 entitled GOLF CLUB WITH COEFFICIENT OF RESTITUTION FEATURE and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

In some instances the channel slot or other mechanism is located in the forward portion of the crown of the club head adjacent to or near to the forwardmost edge of the crown. Further detail concerning these features is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 8 235 844 filed Jun. 1 2010 entitled Hollow golf club head and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety U.S. Pat.

No. 8 241 144 filed Dec. 14 2011 entitled Hollow golf club head having crown stress reducing feature and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Turning attention to golf club head A includes many similar or identical features to golf club head combined in unique and distinct ways. Thus for the sake of brevity each feature of golf club head A will not be redundantly explained. Rather key distinctions between golf club head A and golf club head will be described in detail and the reader should reference the discussion above for features substantially similar between the two golf club heads.

Golf club head includes several of the structures and features of the previous embodiments including a hollow body A a forward channel a rearward track F and a slidable weight assembly . The body A and thus the whole club head includes a front portion a rear portion a toe portion a heel portion a hosel a crown and a sole . The front portion forms an opening that receives a face plate which can be a variable thickness composite and or metal face plate as described herein. The illustrated club head can also comprise an adjustable shaft connection system for coupling a shaft to the hosel via a hosel opening .

As shown in the rearward weight track F may be at an angle relative a vertical plane intersecting a center of a face plate . The particular angle of the rearward weight track F would depend on the golf club head geometry. In some embodiments angling the track may help reduce any draw or fade bias compared to a track parallel the y axis of golf club head especially when shifting the weight along the rearward track F. Angle is between about 0 degrees and about 180 degrees such as between about 20 degrees and about 160 degrees such as between about 40 degrees and about 140 degrees such as between about 60 degrees and about 120 degrees such as between about 70 degrees and about 110 degrees.

As shown in golf club head A includes an aft winglet . The aft winglet deviates from the curvature of the sole and provides a CG lowering platform. As best shown in the aft winglet deviates from the sole and provides a platform to further lower the CG when sliding the slidable weight assembly rearward.

A rearward weight track provides a user with additional adjustability. As discussed above moving the weight closer to the striking face may produce a lower spinning ball due to a lower and more forward CG. This would also allow a user to increase club head loft which in general higher lofted clubs are considered to be easier to hit. Moving the weight rearward towards the rear of the club allows for increased MOI and a higher spinning ball. Clubs with higher MOI are generally considered easier to hit. Accordingly the rearward weight track allows for at least both spin and MOI adjustment.

In the embodiments shown and as most clearly seen in the forward channel is offset from the face by a forward channel offset distance which is the minimum distance between a first vertical plane passing through the center of the face plate and the forward channel at the same x coordinate as the center of the face plate is between about 5 mm and about 50 mm such as between about 10 mm and about 40 mm such as between about 25 mm and about 30 mm. Similarly the rearward track is offset from the face by a rearward track offset distance which is the minimum distance between a first vertical plane passing through the center of the face plate and the rearward track F at the same x coordinate as the center of the face plate is between about 12 mm and about 50 mm such as between about 15 mm and about 40 mm such as between about 20 mm and about 30 mm.

In the embodiments shown both the forward channel and rearward track F have a certain channel track width respectively. Channel track width may be measured as the horizontal distance between a first channel wall and a second channel wall. For both the forward channel and rearward track widths and may be between about 5 mm and about 20 mm such as between about 10 mm and about 18 mm such as between about 12 mm and about 16 mm. In the embodiments shown the depth of the channel or track i.e. the vertical distance between the bottom channel wall and an imaginary plane containing the regions of the sole adjacent the front and rear edges of the channel may be between about 6 mm and about 20 mm such as between about 8 mm and about 18 mm such as between about 10 mm and about 16 mm.

In the embodiments shown both the forward channel and rearward track F have a certain channel track length respectively. Channel track length may be measured as the horizontal distance between a third channel wall and a fourth channel wall. For both the forward channel and rearward track lengths and may be between about 30 mm and about 120 mm such as between about 50 mm and about 100 mm such as between about 60 mm and about 90 mm.

Additionally or alternatively the length of the channel may be a percentage of the striking face length. For example the channel may be between about 30 and about 100 of the striking face length such as between about 50 and about 90 such as between about 60 and about 80 mm of the striking face length.

Additionally or alternatively the forward weight may be interchangeable with the sliding weight and or the weight may be interchangeable with other weights installed in weight ports. Either the forward weight or sliding weight may range from 1 g to 50 g. The range of weights allows for swing weight adjustability greater MOI adjustment and or spin adjustment among other things.

The slot shown in may be a through slot as discussed above and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 839 727 filed Mar. 15 2013 entitled GOLF CLUB WITH COEFFICIENT OF RESTITUTION FEATURE . The slot may include a slot width a slot length and slot perimeter .

In the embodiments shown the slot width may be between about 5 mm and about 20 mm such as between about 10 mm and about 18 mm such as between about 12 mm and about 16 mm or it may be larger or smaller. The slot length may be between about 30 mm and about 120 mm such as between about 50 mm and about 100 mm such as between about 60 mm and about 90 mm or it may be larger or smaller. The slot perimeter may be between about 70 mm and about 280 mm such as between about 120 mm and about 240 mm such as between about 160 mm and about 200 mm or it may be larger or smaller.

In the embodiments shown a distance between a vertical plane intersecting the center of the face plate and the slot at the same x coordinate as the center of the face plate may be between about 5 mm and about 25 mm such as between about 8 mm and about 18 mm such as between about 10 mm and about 15 mm.

Additionally or alternatively the length of the slot may be a percentage of the striking face length. For example the slot may be between about 30 and about 100 of the striking face length such as between about 50 and about 90 such as between about 60 and about 80 mm of the striking face length.

The slot may be made up of curved sections or several segments that may be a combination of curved and straight segments. The slot may be machined or cast into the head. Although shown in the sole of the club the slot may be incorporated into the crown of the club.

The slot or channel may be filled with a material to prevent dirt and other debris from entering the slot or channel and possibly the cavity of the club head in the case of a through slot. The filling material may be any relatively low modulus materials including polyurethane elastomeric rubber polymer various rubbers foams and fillers. The plugging material should not substantially prevent deformation of the golf club head when in use as this would counteract the perimeter flexibility.

The geometry of the rearward track is similar to the geometry of the forward track. Additionally the method of installing the weight in the rearward track is similar to the method already discussed above with respect to the forward track. Notably the rearward track geometry and the weight geometry must be designed to accommodate for the curvature of the sole.

As discussed above the forward channel may provide additional perimeter flexibility. However perimeter flexibility may be impacted due to the interaction with the installed weight assembly . As shown in there is almost no gap between the front channel wall and the weight assembly . In some instances it has been found that the weight assembly can act as a bridge across the channel transferring load across the weight assembly to an aft portion of the club head. This limits how high the perimeter flexibility can be due to the weight assembly creating a localized area of rigidity. As a result in some instances the coefficient of restitution COR and or characteristic time of the golf club head may vary along the channel depending on the weight position within the channel. Accordingly it is desirable to limit or eliminate the possible impact of the weight assembly on perimeter flexibility to obtain a more constant COR CT along the channel independent of the weight position.

Multiple approaches exist for limiting or eliminating the effect of the installed weight assembly on the perimeter flexibility. The following are examples of possible solutions to the problem.

A first approach is to secure the weight assembly solely to the aft or rear channel ledge . This configuration is shown in . A protrusion on the forward end of one or both of the washer and mass member can be designed in order to maintain planer contact between the rear channel ledge and the weight assembly clamping surfaces during tightening. This would eliminate any interaction of the weight assembly with the perimeter flexibility. However the weight assembly would be unsupported at one end resulting in a cantilever beam which would be more susceptible to loosening over time and or experiencing vibrational ringing during impact.

One method to help insure the cantilevered weight would not rotate during tightening or use is to optionally include a ridge that extends transverse to the rear channel ledge that would have a mating groove on one side of the weight assembly as shown in . This mating ridge groove system would minimize rotation during tightening and thus insure that an engineered gap between the forward part of the weight assembly and the channel remains large enough to not have contact and increase the stiffness after tightening or use.

A second approach is to limit the interaction of the weight assembly with the channel. This can be done by having a majority of the clamping force transferred to the rear channel ledge i.e. metal to metal contact and by providing a gap between the front channel ledge and the weight assembly . The reduced clamping load on the forward channel ledge combined with the gap allows the channel to deflect more during impact. However a portion of the weight assembly may still be supported by the front channel ledge. The portion of the weight assembly that is supported by the front channel ledge would include a softer material i.e. lower hardness than the metals used in the weight assembly that would reduce transverse deflections and vibrations without substantially adding front back stiffness across the channel. This configuration is shown in .

A protrusion on the forward end of one or both of the washer and mass member can be designed in order to maintain planer contact between the aft ledge and the weight assembly clamping surfaces during tightening which would bottom out before significant clamping pressure develops on the softer material. This approach could also benefit from the anti rotation ridge and groove system described herein and shown in .

Although the following discussion cites features related to golf club head and its variations e.g. A F the many design parameters discussed below substantially apply to golf club heads and due to the common features of the club heads. With that in mind in some embodiments of the golf clubs described herein the location position or orientation of features of the golf club head such as the golf club head and can be referenced in relation to fixed reference points e.g. a golf club head origin other feature locations or feature angular orientations. The location or position of a weight or weight assembly such as the weight assembly A F A F is typically defined with respect to the location or position of the weight s or weight assembly s center of gravity. When a weight or weight assembly is used as a reference point from which a distance i.e. a vectorial distance defined as the length of a straight line extending from a reference or feature point to another reference or feature point to another weight or weight assembly location is determined the reference point is typically the center of gravity of the weight or weight assembly.

The location of the weight assembly on a golf club head can be approximated by its coordinates on the head origin coordinate system. The head origin coordinate system includes an origin at the ideal impact location of the golf club head which is disposed at the geometric center of the striking surface see . As described herein the head origin coordinate system includes an x axis and a y axis. The origin x axis extends tangential to the face plate at the origin and generally parallel to the ground when the head is ideally positioned with the positive x axis extending from the origin towards a heel of the golf club head and the negative x axis extending from the origin to the toe of the golf club head. The origin y axis extends generally perpendicular to the origin x axis and parallel to the ground when the head is ideally positioned with the positive y axis extending from the head origin towards the rear portion of the golf club. The head origin can also include an origin z axis extending perpendicular to the origin x axis and the origin y axis and having a positive z axis that extends from the origin towards the top portion of the golf club head and negative z axis that extends from the origin towards the bottom portion of the golf club head.

As described herein in some of the embodiments of the golf club head described herein the channel extends generally from a heel end oriented toward the heel portion to a toe end oriented toward the toe portion with both the heel end and toe end being at or near the same distance from the front portion of the club head. As a result in these embodiments the weight assembly that is slidably retained within the channel is capable of a relatively large amount of adjustment in the direction of the x axis while having a relatively small amount of adjustment in the direction of the y axis. In some alternative embodiments the heel end and toe end may be located at varying distances from the front portion such as having the heel end further rearward than the toe end or having the toe end further rearward than the heel end . In these alternative embodiments the weight assembly that is slidably retained within the channel is capable of a relatively large amount of adjustment in the direction of the x axis while also having from a small amount to a larger amount of adjustment in the direction of the y axis.

For example in some embodiments of a golf club head having a weight assembly that is adjustably positioned within a channel the weight assembly can have an origin x axis coordinate between about 50 mm and about 65 mm depending upon the location of the weight assembly within the channel . In specific embodiments the weight assembly can have an origin x axis coordinate between about 45 mm and about 60 mm or between about 40 mm and about 55 mm or between about 35 mm and about 50 mm or between about 30 mm and about 45 mm or between about 25 mm and about 40 mm or between about 20 mm and about 35 mm. Thus in some embodiments the weight assembly is provided with a maximum x axis adjustment range Max x that is greater than 50 mm such as greater than 60 mm such as greater than 70 mm such as greater than 80 mm such as greater than 90 mm such as greater than 100 mm such as greater than 110 mm.

On the other hand in some embodiments of the golf club head having a weight assembly that is adjustably positioned within a channel the weight assembly can have an origin y axis coordinate between about 5 mm and about 60 mm. More specifically in certain embodiments the weight assembly can have an origin y axis coordinate between about 5 mm and about 50 mm between about 5 mm and about 45 mm or between about 5 mm and about 40 mm or between about 10 mm and about 40 mm or between about 5 mm and about 35 mm. Thus in some embodiments the weight assembly is provided with a maximum y axis adjustment range Max y that is less than 40 mm such as less than 30 mm such as less than 20 mm such as less than 10 mm such as less than 5 mm such as less than 3 mm. Additionally or alternatively in some embodiments having a rearward track the weight assembly is provided with a maximum y axis adjustment range Max y that is less than 110 mm such as less than 80 mm such as less than 60 mm such as less than 40 mm such as less than 30 mm such as less than 15 mm.

In some embodiments a golf club head can be configured to have a constraint relating to the relative distances that the weight assembly can be adjusted in the origin x direction and origin y direction. Such a constraint can be defined as the maximum y axis adjustment range Max y divided by the maximum x axis adjustment range Max x . According to some embodiments the value of the ratio of Max y Max x is between 0 and about 0.8. In specific embodiments the value of the ratio of Max y Max x is between 0 and about 0.5 or between 0 and about 0.2 or between 0 and about 0.15 or between 0 and about 0.10 or between 0 and about 0.08 or between 0 and about 0.05 or between 0 and about 0.03 or between 0 and about 0.01.

As discussed above in some embodiments the mass of the weight assembly is between about 1 g and about 50 g such as between about 3 g and about 40 g such as between about 5 g and about 25 g. In some alternative embodiments the mass of the weight assembly is between about 5 g and about 45 g such as between about 9 g and about 35 g such as between about 9 g and about 30 g such as between about 9 g and about 25 g.

In some embodiments a golf club head can be configured to have constraints relating to the product of the mass of the weight assembly and the relative distances that the weight assembly can be adjusted in the origin x direction and or origin y direction. One such constraint can be defined as the mass of the weight assembly M multiplied by the maximum x axis adjustment range Max x . According to some embodiments the value of the product of M Max x is between about 250 g mm and about 4950 g mm. In specific embodiments the value of the product of M Max x is between about 500 g mm and about 4950 g mm or between about 1000 g mm and about 4950 g mm or between about 1500 g mm and about 4950 g mm or between about 2000 g mm and about 4950 g mm or between about 2500 g mm and about 4950 g mm or between about 3000 g mm and about 4950 g mm or between about 3500 g mm and about 4950 g mm or between about 4000 g mm and about 4950 g mm.

Another constraint relating to the product of the mass of the weight assembly and the relative distances that the weight assembly can be adjusted in the origin x direction and or origin y direction can be defined as the mass of the weight assembly M multiplied by the maximum y axis adjustment range Max y . According to some embodiments the value of the product of M Max y is between about 0 g mm and about 1800 g mm. In specific embodiments the value of the product of M Max y is between about 0 g mm and about 1500 g mm or between about 0 g mm and about 1000 g mm or between about 0 g mm and about 500 g mm or between about 0 g mm and about 250 g mm or between about 0 g mm and about 150 g mm or between about 0 g mm and about 100 g mm or between about 0 g mm and about 50 g mm or between about 0 g mm and about 25 g mm.

As noted above one advantage obtained with a golf club head having a slidably repositionable weight assembly such as the golf club head having the weight assembly is in providing the end user of the golf club with the capability to adjust the location of the CG of the club head over a range of locations relating to the position of the repositionable weight. In particular the present inventors have found that there is a distance advantage to providing a center of gravity of the club head that is lower and more forward relative to comparable golf clubs that do not include a weight assembly such as the weight assembly described herein.

In some embodiments the golf club head has a CG with a head origin x axis coordinate CGx between about 10 mm and about 10 mm such as between about 4 mm and about 9 mm such as between about 3 mm and about 8 mm such as between about 2 mm to about 5 mm such as between about 0.8 mm to about 8 mm such as between about 0 mm to about 8 mm. In some embodiments the golf club head has a CG with a head origin y axis coordinate CGy greater than about 15 mm and less than about 50 mm such as between about 22 mm and about 43 mm such as between about 24 mm and about 40 mm such as between about 26 mm and about 35 mm. In some embodiments the golf club head has a CG with a head origin z axis coordinate CGz greater than about 8 mm and less than about 3 mm such as between about 6 mm and about 0 mm. In some embodiments the golf club head has a CG with a head origin z axis coordinate CGz that is less than 0 mm such as less than 2 mm such as less than 4 mm such as less than 5 mm such as less than 6 mm.

As described herein by repositioning the slidable weight assembly within the channel of the golf club head the location of the CG of the club head is adjusted. For example in some embodiments of a golf club head having a weight assembly that is adjustably positioned within a channel the club head is provided with a maximum CGx adjustment range Max CGx attributable to the repositioning of the weight assembly that is greater than 2 mm such as greater than about 3 mm such as greater than about 4 mm such as greater than about 5 mm such as greater than about 6 mm such as greater than about 8 mm such as greater than 10 mm.

Moreover in some embodiments of the golf club head having a weight assembly that is adjustably positioned within a forward channel the club head is provided with a CGy adjustment range Max CGy that is less than 6 mm such as less than 3 mm such as less than 1 mm such as less than 0.5 mm such as less than 0.25 mm such as less than 0.1 mm. However in some cases where a rear weight port is provided and or a rearward weight track the club head may be provided with a CGy adjustment range Max CGy that is greater than 2 mm such as greater than about 3 mm such as greater than about 4 mm such as greater than about 5 mm such as greater than about 6 mm such as greater than about 8 mm such as greater than 10 mm such as greater than 12 mm.

In some embodiments a golf club head can be configured to have a constraint relating to the relative amounts that the CG is able to be adjusted in the origin x direction and origin y direction. Such a constraint can be defined as the maximum CGy adjustment range Max CGy divided by the maximum CGx adjustment range Max CGx . According to some embodiments the value of the ratio of Max CGy Max CGx is between 0 and about 0.8. In specific embodiments the value of the ratio of Max CGy Max CGx is between 0 and about 0.5 or between 0 and about 0.2 or between 0 and about 0.15 or between 0 and about 0.10 or between 0 and about 0.08 or between 0 and about 0.05 or between 0 and about 0.03 or between 0 and about 0.01.

In some embodiments a golf club head can be configured such that only one of the above constraints apply. In other embodiments a golf club head can be configured such that more than one of the above constraints apply. In still other embodiments a golf club head can be configured such that all of the above constraints apply.

Table 15 below lists various properties of golf club heads and having a weight assembly retained within a channel.

In addition illustrates the x axis and z axis movement of the CG as the weight assembly is adjusted through various positions within the channel of club heads with winglets and 13000 fairway .

As shown for club head the range of adjustment for CGx is from 5.8 mm near the heel to 0.5 mm near the toe providing a Max CGx of 5.3 mm. In addition the range of adjustment for CGz is from 1.1 mm near the heel to 2.2 mm near the toe providing a Max CGz of 1.1 mm. Furthermore the range of adjustment for CGy is from 27.3 mm to 28.9 mm providing a Max CGy of 1.6 mm.

As shown for club head the range of adjustment for CGx is from 6.6 mm near the heel to 0.7 mm near the toe providing a Max CGx of 7.3 mm. In addition the range of adjustment for CGz is from 2.3 mm near the heel to 3.5 mm near the toe providing a Max CGz of 1.2 mm. Furthermore the range of adjustment for CGy is from 26.4 mm to 26.6 mm providing a Max CGy of 0.2 mm.

As shown for club head with winglets the range of adjustment for CGx is from 5.8 mm near the heel to 0.7 mm near the toe providing a Max CGx of 6.5 mm. In addition the range of adjustment for CGz is from 3.6 mm near the heel to 4.0 mm near the toe providing a Max CGz of 0.4 mm. Furthermore the range of adjustment for CGy is from 25.3 mm to 25.5 mm providing a Max CGy of 0.2 mm. If a lighter weight is used and or the channel is shorter the Max CGx could be approximately 5 mm 4 mm or 3 mm. If the Max CGx is less than 3 mm then there is not a substantial performance difference between the extreme positions of the channel. Similarly if the a heavier weight is used and or the channel has a smaller radius of curvature the Max CGz could be approximately 2 mm 1.5 mm 1 mm or 0.5 mm.

As shown for club heads C F the range of adjustment for CGx is from 6.9 mm near the heel to 0.6 mm near the toe providing a Max CGx of 6.3 mm. In addition the range of adjustment for CGz is from 3.1 mm near the heel to 3.7 mm near the toe providing a Max CGz of 0.6 mm. Furthermore the range of adjustment for CGy is from 32.3 mm to 28 mm providing a Max CGy of 4.3 mm. If a lighter weight is used or if the weight ports are closer together then the Max CGy could be 3 mm or 2 mm. If a heavier weight is used or the weight ports are further apart then the Max CGy could be 5 mm or 6 mm.

Notably comparing the Ixx and Izz values for with winglets to with an additional movable weight shows a significant improvement. Ixx improved from 229 kg mmto 300 kg mmand Izz improved from 366 kg mmto 440 kg mm.

As shown for club head the range of adjustment for CGx is from 6.9 mm near the heel to 0.6 mm near the toe providing a Max CGx of 6.3 mm. In addition the range of adjustment for CGz is from 3.1 mm near the heel to 3.7 mm near the toe providing a Max CGz of 0.6 mm. Furthermore the range of adjustment for CGy is from 13.3 mm to 13.3 mm providing a Max CGy of 0.0 mm.

Unexpectedly the location of the weight bearing channel in the front portion of the club head can lead to unexpected synergies in golf club performance. First because delta 1 is relatively small dynamic lofting is reduced thereby reducing spin that otherwise may reduce distance. Additionally because the projection of the CG is below the center face the gear effect biases the golf ball to rotate toward the projection of the CG or in other words with forward spin. This is countered by the loft of the golf club head imparting back spin. The overall effect is a relatively low spin profile. However because the CG is below the center face and thereby below the ideal impact location as measured along the z axis the golf ball will tend to rise higher on impact. The result is a high launching but lower spinning golf shot on purely struck shots which leads to better ball flight higher and softer landing with more distance due to less energy loss from spin.

Table 16 below lists various measurements taken during a robot testing of golf club head . In the robot test a 30 g weight was positioned at five different positions along the sole of the golf club head and then used to hit a multitude of shots at center face. shows golf club head with a 30 g weight positioned at five positions P P.

As can be seen in Table 16 movement of the 30 g weight from front to back resulted in a delta 1 increase of 9 mm and an rpm increase of over 800 rpms. This resulted in a reduction in ball speed by about 5 mph and a loss in predicted carry distance of about 20 yards. Additionally the longest predicted carry shots occurred when the 30 g weight was in the forward position. Notably CGx moved about 9 mm from the heel to toe positions and over that range CGz changed less than about 2.5 mm.

Importantly Izz and Ixx each increased by about 100 kg mmby moving the weight from the front to the back of the club. However despite this being a more forgiving position the predicted carry distances were the shortest likely due to increased spin and reduced ball speed.

As shown in Table 16 for club head with a 30 g weight the range of adjustment for CGx is from 6.3 mm near the heel to 2.5 mm near the toe providing a Max CGx of 8.8 mm. In addition the range of adjustment for CGz is from 1 mm near the heel to 3.5 mm near the center providing a Max CGz of 2.5 mm. Furthermore the range of adjustment for CGy is from 27.4 mm to 36.4 mm providing a Max CGy of 9 mm. If a lighter weight is used and or the channel is shorter the Max CGx could be approximately 5 mm 4 mm or 3 mm. If the Max CGx is less than 3 mm then there is not a substantial performance difference between the extreme positions of the channel. Similarly if a heavier weight is used and or the channel has a smaller radius of curvature the Max CGz could be approximately 4 mm 3 mm 2 mm 1.5 mm 1 mm or 0.5 mm.

Table 17 below lists various parameters for golf club head using a 15 g weight in the front track and a 15 g weight in the rear track. shows golf club head with the 15 g weights positioned at five positions P P.

As can be seen in Table 17 movement of the 15 g weight from positions 1 3 front to position 5 back resulted in a delta 1 increase of about 4.3 mm which would be a predicted rpm increase of about 350 rpms due to the combination of dynamic lofting and change in CGz. Notably CGx moved about 4.4 mm from the position 1 toe to position 3 heel and over that range CGz changes less than about 0.7 mm.

Importantly Izz and Ixx each increase by about 60 kg mmby moving the 15 g weight in the rearward track from positions 1 3 front to position 5 back . In positions 4 and 5 the club would be considered more forgiving. However this club is slightly less forgiving compared to club with the weight in positions 4 and 5. Forgiving however does not result in distance as proved out by the data captured in Table 16 from the robot test of club . Accordingly it is expected that this club would perform better at positions 4 and 5 compared to club due to the lower CG projection on the face 5.3 vs 2.6 and smaller delta 1 value 21.1 vs 17.1 .

As shown in Table 17 for club head with two 15 g weights the range of adjustment for CGx is from 5.74 mm near the heel to 1.35 mm near the toe providing a Max CGx of about 4.4 mm. In addition the range of adjustment for CGz is from 3.81 mm near the heel to 4.53 mm near the center providing a Max CGz of about 0.7 mm. Furthermore the range of adjustment for CGy is from 28.4 mm to 32.8 mm providing a Max CGy of about 4.4 mm. If a lighter weight is used and or the channel is shorter the Max CGx could be approximately 5 mm 4 mm or 3 mm. If the Max CGx is less than 3 mm then there is not a substantial performance difference between the extreme positions of the channel. Similarly if a heavier weight is used and or the channel has a smaller radius of curvature the Max CGz could be approximately 3 mm 2 mm 1.5 mm 1 mm or 0.5 mm.

The following are additional details about structure that may be or are already incorporated into the embodiments discussed above. In some instances the following discussion provides more in depth discussion. It should be understood that the features described below are compatible with the embodiments discussed above. For example each of the embodiments discussed above may or may not include an adjustable lie loft connection assembly as discussed below. Additionally each of the embodiments discussed above may or may not include a composite face insert as discussed below.

As used herein a shaft that is removably attached to a club head means that the shaft can be connected to the club head using one or more mechanical fasteners such as a screw or threaded ferrule without an adhesive and the shaft can be disconnected and separated from the head by loosening or removing the one or more mechanical fasteners without the need to break an adhesive bond between two components.

The hosel opening is also adapted to receive a hosel insert which can be positioned on an annular shoulder inside the club head. The hosel insert can be secured in place by welding an adhesive or other suitable techniques. Alternatively the insert can be integrally formed in the hosel opening. The club head further includes an opening in the bottom or sole of the club head that is sized to receive a screw . The screw is inserted into the opening through the opening in shoulder and is tightened into the shaft sleeve to secure the shaft to the club head. Additionally the shaft sleeve is configured to support the shaft at different positions relative to the club head to achieve a desired shaft loft and or lie angle.

If desired a screw capturing device such as in the form of an o ring or washer can be placed on the shaft of the screw above shoulder to retain the screw in place within the club head when the screw is loosened to permit removal of the shaft from the club head. The ring desirably is dimensioned to frictionally engage the threads of the screw and has an outer diameter that is greater than the central opening in shoulder so that the ring cannot fall through the opening. When the screw is tightened to secure the shaft to the club head as depicted in the ring desirably is not compressed between the shoulder and the adjacent lower surface of the shaft sleeve . shows the screw removed from the shaft sleeve to permit removal of the shaft from the club head. As shown in the disassembled state the ring captures the distal end of the screw to retain the screw within the club head to prevent loss of the screw. The ring desirably comprises a polymeric or elastomeric material such as rubber Viton Neoprene silicone or similar materials. The ring can be an o ring having a circular cross sectional shape as depicted in the illustrated embodiment. Alternatively the ring can be a flat washer having a square or rectangular cross sectional shape. In other embodiments the ring can various other cross sectional profiles.

The shaft sleeve is shown in greater detail in . The shaft sleeve in the illustrated embodiment comprises an upper portion having an upper opening for receiving and a lower portion located below the lower end of the shaft. The lower portion can have a threaded opening for receiving the threaded shaft of the screw . The lower portion of the sleeve can comprise a rotation prevention portion configured to mate with a rotation prevention portion of the hosel insert to restrict relative rotation between the shaft and the club head. As shown the rotation prevention portion can comprise a plurality of longitudinally extending external splines that are adapted to mate with corresponding internal splines of the hosel insert .

The upper portion of the sleeve extends at an offset angle relative to the lower portion . As shown in when inserted in the club head the lower portion is co axially aligned with the hosel insert and the hosel opening which collectively define a longitudinal axis B. The upper portion of the shaft sleeve defines a longitudinal axis A and is effective to support the shaft along axis A which is offset from longitudinal axis B by offset angle . Inserting the shaft sleeve at different angular positions relative to the hosel insert is effective to adjust the shaft loft and or the lie angle as further described below.

As best shown in the upper portion of the shaft sleeve desirably has a constant wall thickness from the lower end of opening to the upper end of the shaft sleeve. A tapered surface portion extends between the upper portion and the lower portion . The upper portion of the shaft sleeve has an enlarged head portion that defines an annular bearing surface that contacts an upper surface of the hosel . The bearing surface desirably is oriented at a 90 degree angle with respect to longitudinal axis B so that when the shaft sleeve is inserted in to the hosel the bearing surface can make complete contact with the opposing surface of the hosel through 360 degrees.

As further shown in the hosel opening desirably is dimensioned to form a gap between the outer surface of the upper portion of the sleeve and the opposing internal surface of the club head. Because the upper portion is not co axially aligned with the surrounding inner surface of the hosel opening the gap desirably is large enough to permit the shaft sleeve to be inserted into the hosel opening with the lower portion extending into the hosel insert at each possible angular position relative to longitudinal axis B. For example in the illustrated embodiment the shaft sleeve has eight external splines that are received between eight internal splines of the hosel insert .

Other shaft sleeve and hosel insert configurations can be used to vary the number of possible angular positions for the shaft sleeve relative to the longitudinal axis B. for example show an alternative shaft sleeve and hosel insert configuration in which the shaft sleeve has eight equally spaced splines with radial sidewalls that are received between eight equally spaced splines of the hosel insert . Each spline is spaced from an adjacent spline by spacing Sdimensioned to receive a spline of the hosel insert having a width W. This allows the lower portion of the shaft sleeve to be inserted into the hosel insert at eight angularly spaced positions around longitudinal axis B. In a specific embodiment the spacing Sis about 23 degrees the arc angle of each spline is about 22 degrees and the width Wis about 22.5 degrees.

As can be appreciated the assembly shown in is similar to the permits a shaft to be supported at different orientations relative to the club head to vary the shaft loft and or lie angle. An advantage of the assembly of is that it includes fewer pieces and therefore is less expensive to manufacture and has less mass which allows for a reduction in overall weight .

The shaft sleeve has a lower portion including splines that mate with the splines of the hosel insert an intermediate portion and an upper head portion . The intermediate portion and the head portion define an internal bore for receiving the tip end portion of the shaft. In the illustrated embodiment the intermediate portion of the shaft sleeve has a cylindrical external surface that is concentric with the inner cylindrical surface of the hosel opening . In this manner the lower and intermediate portions of the shaft sleeve and the hosel opening define a longitudinal axis B. The bore in the shaft sleeve defines a longitudinal axis A to support the shaft along axis A which is offset from axis B by a predetermined angle determined by the bore . As described herein inserting the shaft sleeve at different angular positions relative to the hosel insert is effective to adjust the shaft loft and or the lie angle.

In this embodiment because the intermediate portion is concentric with the hosel opening the outer surface of the intermediate portion can contact the adjacent surface of the hosel opening as depicted in . This allows easier alignment of the mating features of the assembly during installation of the shaft and further improves the manufacturing process and efficiency. are enlarged views of the shaft sleeve . As shown the head portion of the shaft sleeve which extends above the hosel can be angled relative to the intermediate portion by the angle so that the shaft and the head portion are both aligned along axis A. In alternative embodiments the head portion can be aligned along axis B so that it is parallel to the intermediate portion and the lower portion .

A golf club head has a head mass defined as the combined masses of the body weight ports and weights. The total weight mass is the combined masses of the weight or weights installed on a golf club head. The total weight port mass is the combined masses of the weight ports and any weight port supporting structures such as ribs.

In one embodiment the rear weight is the heaviest weight being between about 15 grams to about 20 grams. In certain embodiments the lighter weights can be about 1 gram to about 6 grams. In one embodiment a single heavy weight of 16 g and two lighter weights of 1 g is preferred.

In some embodiments a golf club head is provided with three weight ports having a total weight port mass between about 1 g and about 12 g. In certain embodiments the weight port mass without ribs is about 3 g for a combined weight port mass of about 9 g. In some embodiments the total weight port mass with ribbing is about 5 g to about 6 g for a combined total weight port mass of about 15 g to about 18 g.

The golf club head of the present application has a volume equal to the volumetric displacement of the club head body. In several embodiments a golf club head of the present application can be configured to have a head volume between about 110 cmand about 600 cm. In more particular embodiments the head volume is between about 250 cmand about 500 cm 400 cmand about 500 cm 390 cmand about 420 cm or between about 420 cmand 475 cm. In one exemplary embodiment the head volume is about 390 to about 410 cm.

Golf club head moments of inertia are defined about axes extending through the golf club head CG. As used herein the golf club head CG location can be provided with reference to its position on a golf club head origin coordinate system. The golf club head origin is positioned on the face plate at approximately the geometric center i.e. the intersection of the midpoints of a face plate s height and width.

The head origin coordinate system includes an x axis and a y axis. The origin x axis extends tangential to the face plate and generally parallel to the ground when the head is ideally positioned with the positive x axis extending from the origin towards a heel of the golf club head and the negative x axis extending from the origin to the toe of the golf club head. The origin y axis extends generally perpendicular to the origin x axis and parallel to the ground when the head is ideally positioned with the positive y axis extending from the head origin towards the rear portion of the golf club. The head origin can also include an origin z axis extending perpendicular to the origin x axis and the origin y axis and having a positive z axis that extends from the origin towards the top portion of the golf club head and negative z axis that extends from the origin towards the bottom portion of the golf club head.

In some embodiments the golf club head has a CG with a head origin x axis CGx coordinate between about 10 mm and about 10 mm and a head origin y axis CGy coordinate greater than about 15 mm or less than about 50 mm. In certain embodiments the club head has a CG with an origin x axis coordinate between about 5 mm and about 5 mm an origin y axis coordinate greater than about 0 mm and an origin z axis CGz coordinate less than about 0 mm.

More particularly in specific embodiments of a golf club head having specific configurations the golf club head has a CG with coordinates approximated in Table 8 below. The golf club head in Table 8 has three weight ports and three weights. In configuration 1 the heaviest weight is located in the back most or rear weight port. The heaviest weight is located in a heel weight port in configuration 2 and the heaviest weight is located in a toe weight port in configuration 3.

Table 8 emphasizes the amount of CG change that can be possible by moving the movable weights. In one embodiment the movable weight change can provide a CG change in the x direction heel toe of between about 2 mm and about 10 mm in order to achieve a large enough CG change to create significant performance change to offset or enhance the possible loft lie and face angel adjustments described herein. A substantial change in CG is accomplished by having a large difference in the weight that is moved between different weight ports and having the weight ports spaced far enough apart to achieve the CG change. In certain embodiments the CG is located below the center face with a CGz of less than 0. The CGx is between about 2 mm toe ward and 8 mm heel ward or even more preferably between about 0 mm and about 6 mm. Furthermore the CGy can be between about 25 mm and about 40 mm aft of the center face .

A moment of inertia of a golf club head is measured about a CG x axis CG y axis and CG z axis which are axes similar to the origin coordinate system except with an origin located at the center of gravity CG.

In certain embodiments the golf club head of the present invention can have a moment of inertia I about the golf club head CG x axis between about 70 kg mmand about 400 kg mm. More specifically certain embodiments have a moment of inertia about the CG x axis between about 200 kg mmto about 300 kg mmor between about 200 kg mmand about 500 kg mm.

In several embodiments the golf club head of the present invention can have a moment of inertia I about the golf club head CG z axis between about 200 kg mmand about 600 kg mm. More specifically certain embodiments have a moment of inertia about the CG z axis between about 400 kg mmto about 500 kg mmor between about 350 kg mmand about 600 kg mm.

In several embodiments the golf club head of the present invention can have a moment of inertia I about the golf club head CG y axis between about 200 kg mmand 400 kg mm. In certain specific embodiments the moment of inertia about the golf club head CG y axis is between about 250 kg mmand 350 kg mm.

The moment of inertia can change depending on the location of the heaviest removable weight as illustrated in Table 9 below. Again in configuration 1 the heaviest weight is located in the back most or rear weight port. The heaviest weight is located in a heel weight port in configuration 2 and the heaviest weight is located in a toe weight port in configuration 3.

According to some embodiments of a golf club head of the present application the golf club head has a thin wall construction. Among other advantages thin wall construction facilitates the redistribution of material from one part of a club head to another part of the club head. Because the redistributed material has a certain mass the material may be redistributed to locations in the golf club head to enhance performance parameters related to mass distribution such as CG location and moment of inertia magnitude. Club head material that is capable of being redistributed without affecting the structural integrity of the club head is commonly called discretionary weight. In some embodiments of the present invention thin wall construction enables discretionary weight to be removed from one or a combination of the striking plate crown skirt or sole and redistributed in the form of weight ports and corresponding weights.

Thin wall construction can include a thin sole construction i.e. a sole with a thickness less than about 0.9 mm but greater than about 0.4 mm over at least about 50 of the sole surface area and or a thin skirt construction i.e. a skirt with a thickness less than about 0.8 mm but greater than about 0.4 mm over at least about 50 of the skirt surface area and or a thin crown construction i.e. a crown with a thickness less than about 0.8 mm but greater than about 0.4 mm over at least about 50 of the crown surface area. In one embodiment the club head is made of titanium and has a thickness less than 0.65 mm over at least 50 of the crown in order to free up enough weight to achieve the desired CG location.

More specifically in certain embodiments of a golf club having a thin sole construction and at least one weight and two weight ports the sole crown and skirt can have respective thicknesses over at least about 50 of their respective surfaces between about 0.4 mm and about 0.9 mm between about 0.8 mm and about 0.9 mm between about 0.7 mm and about 0.8 mm between about 0.6 mm and about 0.7 mm or less than about 0.6 mm. According to a specific embodiment of a golf club having a thin skirt construction the thickness of the skirt over at least about 50 of the skirt surface area can be between about 0.4 mm and about 0.8 mm between about 0.6 mm and about 0.7 mm or less than about 0.6 mm.

The thin wall construction can be described according to areal weight as defined by the equation Eq. 5 below Eq. 5

In the above equation AW is defined as areal weight is defined as density and t is defined as the thickness of the material. In one exemplary embodiment the golf club head is made of a material having a density of about 4.5 g cmor less. In one embodiment the thickness of a crown or sole portion is between about 0.04 cm and about 0.09 cm. Therefore the areal weight of the crown or sole portion is between about 0.18 g cmand about 0.41 g cm. In some embodiments the areal weight of the crown or sole portion is less than 0.41 g cmover at least about 50 of the crown or sole surface area. In other embodiments the areal weight of the crown or sole is less than about 0.36 g cmover at least about 50 of the entire crown or sole surface area.

In certain embodiments the thin wall construction is implemented according to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 870 913 and U.S. Pat. No. 7 186 190 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

According to some embodiments a golf club head face plate can include a variable thickness faceplate. Varying the thickness of a faceplate may increase the size of a club head COR zone commonly called the sweet spot of the golf club head which when striking a golf ball with the golf club head allows a larger area of the face plate to deliver consistently high golf ball velocity and shot forgiveness. Also varying the thickness of a faceplate can be advantageous in reducing the weight in the face region for re allocation to another area of the club head.

A variable thickness face plate according to one embodiment of a golf club head illustrated in includes a generally circular protrusion extending into the interior cavity towards the rear portion of the golf club head. When viewed in cross section as illustrated in protrusion includes a portion with increasing thickness from an outer portion of the face plate to an intermediate portion . The protrusion further includes a portion with decreasing thickness from the intermediate portion to an inner portion positioned approximately at a center of the protrusion preferably proximate the golf club head origin. An origin x axis and an origin z axis intersect near the inner portion across an x z plane. However the origin x axis origin z axis and an origin y axis pass through an ideal impact location located on the striking surface of the face plate. In certain embodiments the inner portion can be aligned with the ideal impact location with respect to the x z plane.

In some embodiments of a golf club head having a face plate with a protrusion the maximum face plate thickness is greater than about 4.8 mm and the minimum face plate thickness is less than about 2.3 mm. In certain embodiments the maximum face plate thickness is between about 5 mm and about 5.4 mm and the minimum face plate thickness is between about 1.8 mm and about 2.2 mm. In yet more particular embodiments the maximum face plate thickness is about 5.2 mm and the minimum face plate thickness is about 2 mm. The face thickness should have a thickness change of at least 25 over the face thickest portion compared to thinnest in order to save weight and achieve a higher ball speed on off center hits.

In some embodiments of a golf club head having a face plate with a protrusion and a thin sole construction or a thin skirt construction the maximum face plate thickness is greater than about 3.0 mm and the minimum face plate thickness is less than about 3.0 mm. In certain embodiments the maximum face plate thickness is between about 3.0 mm and about 4.0 mm between about 4.0 mm and about 5.0 mm between about 5.0 mm and about 6.0 mm or greater than about 6.0 mm and the minimum face plate thickness is between about 2.5 mm and about 3.0 mm between about 2.0 mm and about 2.5 mm between about 1.5 mm and about 2.0 mm or less than about 1.5 mm.

In certain embodiments a variable thickness face profile is implemented according to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 006 060 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 997 820 6 800 038 and 6 824 475 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

In some embodiments of a golf club head having at least two weight ports a distance between the first and second weight ports is between about 5 mm and about 200 mm. In more specific embodiments the distance between the first and second weight ports is between about 5 mm and about 100 mm between about 50 mm and about 100 mm or between about 70 mm and about 90 mm. In some specific embodiments the first weight port is positioned proximate a toe portion of the golf club head and the second weight port is positioned proximate a heel portion of the golf club head.

In some embodiments of the golf club head having first second and third weight ports a distance between the first and second weight port is between about 40 mm and about 100 mm and a distance between the first and third weight port and the second and third weight port is between about 30 mm and about 90 mm. In certain embodiments the distance between the first and second weight port is between about 60 mm and about 80 mm and the distance between the first and third weight port and the second and third weight port is between about 50 mm and about 80 mm. In a specific example the distance between the first and second weight port is between about 80 mm and about 90 mm and the distance between the first and third weight port and the second and third weight port is between about 70 mm and about 80 mm. In some embodiments the first weight port is positioned proximate a toe portion of the golf club head the second weight port is positioned proximate a heel portion of the golf club head and the third weight port is positioned proximate a rear portion of the golf club head.

In some embodiments of the golf club head having first second third and fourth weights ports a distance between the first and second weight port the first and fourth weight port and the second and third weight port is between about 40 mm and about 100 mm a distance between the third and fourth weight port is between about 10 mm and about 80 mm and a distance between the first and third weight port and the second and fourth weight port is about 30 mm to about 90 mm. In more specific embodiments a distance between the first and second weight port the first and fourth weight port and the second and third weight port is between about 60 mm and about 80 mm a distance between the first and third weight port and the second and fourth weight port is between about 50 mm and about 70 mm and a distance between the third and fourth weight port is between about 30 mm and about 50 mm. In some specific embodiments the first weight port is positioned proximate a front toe portion of the golf club head the second weight port is positioned proximate a front heel portion of the golf club head the third weight port is positioned proximate a rear toe portion of the golf club head and the fourth weight port is positioned proximate a rear heel portion of the golf club head.

As mentioned above the distance between the weight ports and weight size contributes to the amount of CG change made possible in a system having the sleeve assembly described herein.

In some embodiments of a golf club head of the present application having two three or four weights a maximum weight mass multiplied by the distance between the maximum weight and the minimum weight is between about 450 g mm and about 2 000 g mm or about 200 g mm and 2 000 g mm. More specifically in certain embodiments the maximum weight mass multiplied by the weight separation distance is between about 500 g mm and about 1 500 g mm between about 1 200 g mm and about 1 400 g mm.

When a weight or weight port is used as a reference point from which a distance i.e. a vectorial distance defined as the length of a straight line extending from a reference or feature point to another reference or feature point to another weight or weights port is determined the reference point is typically the volumetric centroid of the weight port.

When a movable weight club head and the sleeve assembly are combined it is possible to achieve the highest level of club trajectory modification while simultaneously achieving the desired look of the club at address. For example if a player prefers to have an open club face look at address the player can put the club in the R or open face position. If that player then hits a fade since the face is open shot but prefers to hit a straight shot or slight draw it is possible to take the same club and move the heavy weight to the heel port to promote draw bias. Therefore it is possible for a player to have the desired look at address in this case open face and the desired trajectory in this case straight or slight draw .

In yet another advantage by combining the movable weight concept with an adjustable sleeve position effecting loft lie and face angle it is possible to amplify the desired trajectory bias that a player may be trying to achieve.

For example if a player wants to achieve the most draw possible the player can adjust the sleeve position to be in the closed face position or L position and also put the heavy weight in the heel port. The weight and the sleeve position work together to achieve the greater draw bias possible. On the other hand to achieve the greatest fade bias the sleeve position can be set for the open face or R position and the heavy weight is placed in the top port.

As described herein the combination of a large CG change measured by the heaviest weight multiplied by the distance between the ports and a large loft change measured by the largest possible change in loft between two sleeve positions Aloft results in the highest level of trajectory adjustability. Thus a product of the distance between at least two weight ports the maximum weight and the maximum loft change is important in describing the benefits achieved by the embodiments described herein.

In one embodiment the product of the distance between at least two weight ports the maximum weight and the maximum loft change is between about 50 mm g deg and about 6 000 mm g deg or even more preferably between about 500 mm g deg and about 3 000 mm g deg. In other words in certain embodiments the golf club head satisfies the following expressions in Eq. 6 and Eq. 7. 50 mm g degrees

In the above expressions Dwp is the distance between two weight port centroids mm Mhw is the mass of the heaviest weight g and Aloft is the maximum loft change degrees between at least two sleeve positions. A golf club head within the ranges described herein will ensure the highest level of trajectory adjustability.

With respect to the torque wrench includes a grip a shank and a torque limiting mechanism housed inside the torque wrench. The grip and shank form a T shape and the torque limiting mechanism is located between the grip and shank in an intermediate region . The torque limiting mechanism prevents over tightening of the movable weights the adjustable sleeve and the adjustable sole features of the embodiments described herein. In use once the torque limit is met the torque limiting mechanism of the exemplary embodiment will cause the grip to rotationally disengage from the shank . Preferably the wrench is limited to between about 30 inch lbs. and about 50 inch lbs of torque. More specifically the limit is between about 35 inch lbs. and about 45 inch lbs. of torque. In one exemplary embodiment the wrench is limited to about 40 inch lbs. of torque.

The use of a single tool or torque wrench for adjusting the movable weights adjustable sleeve or adjustable loft system and adjustable sole features provides a unique advantage in that a user is not required to carry multiple tools or attachments to make the desired adjustments.

The shank terminates in an engagement end i.e. tip configured to operatively mate with the movable weights adjustable sleeve and adjustable sole features described herein. In one embodiment the engagement end or tip is a bit type drive tip having one single mating configuration for adjusting the movable weights adjustable sleeve and adjustable sole features. The engagement end can be comprised of lobes and flutes spaced equidistantly about the circumference of the tip.

In certain embodiments the single tool is provided to adjust the sole angle and the adjustable sleeve i.e. affecting loft angle lie angle or face angle only. In another embodiment the single tool is provided to adjust the adjustable sleeve and movable weights only. In yet other embodiments the single tool is provided to adjust the movable weights and sole angle only.

In other embodiments the metallic cap does not have a rim portion but includes an outer peripheral edge that is substantially flush and planar with the side wall of the composite insert . A plurality of score lines can be located on the metallic cap . The composite face insert has a variable thickness and is adhesively or mechanically attached to the insert ear located within the front opening and connected to the front opening inner wall . The insert ear and the composite face insert can be of the type described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11 642 310 11 825 138 11 960 609 11 960 610 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 267 620 RE42 544 7 874 936 7 874 937 and 7 985 146 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

The club head of the embodiments described in and can have a mass of about 200 g to about 210 g or about 190 g to about 200 g. In certain embodiments the mass of the club head is less than about 205 g. In one embodiment the mass is at least about 190 g. Additional mass added by the hosel opening and the insert ear in certain embodiments will have an effect on moment of inertia and center of gravity values as shown in Tables 10 and 11.

A golf club having an adjustable loft and lie angle with a composite face insert can achieve the moment of inertia and CG locations listed in Table 10 and 11. In certain embodiments the golf club head can include movable weights in addition to the adjustable sleeve system and composite face. In embodiments where movable weights are implemented similar moment of inertia and CG values already described herein can be achieved.

The golf club head embodiments described herein provide a solution to the additional weight added by a movable weight system and an adjustable loft lie and face angle system. Any undesirable weight added to the golf club head makes it difficult to achieve a desired head size moment of inertia and nominal center of gravity location.

In certain embodiments the combination of ultra thin wall casting technology high strength variable face thickness strategically placed compact and lightweight movable weight ports and a lightweight adjustable loft lie and face angle system make it possible to achieve high performing moment of inertia center of gravity and head size values.

Furthermore an advantage of the discrete positions of the sleeve embodiments described herein allow for an increased amount of durability and more user friendly system.

As discussed above conventional golf clubs do not allow for adjustment of the hosel shaft loft without causing a corresponding change in the face angle . Configured to decouple the relationship between face angle and hosel shaft loft and therefore square loft that is allow for separate adjustment of square loft and face angle .

In particular embodiments the combined mass of the screw and the adjustable sole portion is between about 2 and about 11 grams and desirably between about 4.1 and about 4.9 grams. Furthermore the recessed cavity and the projection can add about 1 to about 10 grams of additional mass to the sole compared to if the sole had a smooth 0.6 mm thick titanium wall in the place of the recessed cavity . In total the golf club head including the sole portion can comprise about 3 to about 21 grams of additional mass compared to if the golf club head had a conventional sole having a smooth 0.6 mm thick titanium wall in the place of the recessed cavity the adjustable sole portion and the screw .

In other particular embodiments at least 50 of the crown of the club head body can have a thickness of less than about 0.7 mm.

In still other particular embodiments the golf club body can define an interior cavity not shown and the golf club head can have a center of gravity with a head origin x axis coordinate greater than about 2 mm and less than about 8 mm and a head origin y axis coordinate greater than about 25 mm and less than about 40 mm where a positive y axis extends toward the interior cavity. In at least these embodiments the golf club head center of gravity can have a head origin z axis coordinate less than about 0 mm.

In other particular embodiments the golf club head can have an moment of inertia about a head center of gravity x axis generally parallel to an origin x axis that can be between about 200 and about 500 kg mmand a moment of inertia about a head center of gravity z axis generally perpendicular to ground when the golf club head is ideally positioned that can be between about 350 and about 600 kg mm.

In certain embodiments the golf club head can have a volume greater than about 400 cc and a mass less than about 220 grams.

The addition of a recessed sole port and an attached adjustable sole piece can undesirably change the sound the club makes during impact with a ball. For example compared to a similar club without an adjustable sole piece the addition of the sole piece can cause lower sound frequencies such as first mode sound frequencies below 3 000 Hz and or below 2 000 Hz and a longer sound duration such as 0.09 seconds or longer. The lower and long sound frequencies can be distracting to golfers. The ribs on the internal surface of the sole can be oriented in several different directions and can tie the sole port to other strong structures of the club head body such as weight ports at the sole and heel of the body and or the skirt region between the sole and the crown. One or more ribs can also be tied to the hosel to further stabilize the sole. With the addition of such ribs on the internal surface of the sole the club head can produce higher sound frequencies when striking a golf ball on the face such as above 2 500 Hz above 3 000 Hz and or above 3 500 Hz and with a shorter sound duration such as less than 0.05 seconds which can be more desirable for a golfer. In addition with the described ribs the sole can have a frequency such as a natural frequency of a first fundamental sole mode that is greater than 2 500 Hz and or greater than 3 000 Hz wherein the sole mode is a vibration frequency associated with a location on the sole. Typically this location is the location on the sole that exhibits a largest degree of deflection resulting from striking a golf ball.

As shown in exemplary golf club heads described herein can include an adjustable sole piece and internal sole ribs. Such exemplary golf club heads can also include adjustable weights at the toe and or heel of the body an adjustable shaft attachment system a variable thickness face plate thin wall body construction and or any other club head features described herein. While this description proceeds with respect to the particular embodiment shown in this embodiment is only exemplary and should not be considered as a limitation on the scope of the underlying concepts. For example although the illustrated example includes many described features alternative embodiments can include various subsets of these features and or additional features.

The illustrated club head also comprises an adjustable toe weight at a toe weight port an adjustable heel weight at a heel weight port and an adjustable sole piece at a sole port or pocket as described herein.

As shown in the CG of the golf club head can divide the club head into four quadrants a front heel quadrant that is frontward and heelward of the CG a front toe quadrant that is frontward and toeward of the CG a rear heel quadrant that is rearward and heelward of the CG and a rear toe quadrant that is rearward and toeward of the CG. The center of the sole port e.g. the aperture can be positioned heelward and rearward of the CG as shown in or in other words in the rear heel quadrant of the club head. As such a majority of the sole piece and a majority of the sole port can be positioned in the rear heal quadrant of the club head but a portion of the sole piece and or a portion of the sole port can also be in the rear toe quadrant of the club head. In some embodiments all of the sole piece and all of the sole port can be rearward of the CG.

With the aperture is located in a rear heel quadrant at least two ribs can converge at a convergence location near the aperture . In some embodiments at least three ribs or at least four ribs converge at a convergence location located in the rear heel quadrant of the club head. It is understood that the number of ribs that converge in the rear heel quadrant can be between two and ten ribs in total.

One or more ribs are disposed on the internal surface of the sole . The ribs can be part of the same material that forms the sole and or the rest of the body such a metal or metal alloy as describe above in detail. The ribs can be formed as an integral part of the sole such as by casting such that the ribs and the sole are of the same monolithic structure. The bottom of the ribs can be integrally connected to sole without the need for welding or other attachment methods. In other embodiments one or more of the ribs can be formed at least partially separate from the sole and then attached to the sole such as by welding.

One or more of the ribs can have a width dimension that is constant or nearly constant along the entire length of the rib. In some embodiments such as the illustrated embodiment each of the ribs has the same constant width such as about 0.8 mm or greater than 0.5 mm and less than about 1.5 mm. In one embodiment the rib has a width of about 0.7 mm. In other embodiments different ribs can have different widths. In some embodiments the width of one or more of the ribs can vary along the length of the rib such as being wider nearer to the rib end portions and narrower at an intermediate portion. In general the width of the ribs is less than the height of the ribs.

One or more of the ribs can form a straight line when projected onto a plane parallel with the ground when the club head is in the address position. In other words one or more of the ribs can extend along a two dimensional path between its end points. In some embodiments the ribs can extend in at least four at least five or at least six different directions across the sole as viewed from above. The direction of each of the ribs can help stabilize the sole in that direction. Thus having ribs in multiple directions desirably helps to stabilize the sole in multiple directions.

It should be noted that the internal sole ribs described herein are not raised portions of the sole that correspond to recessed grooves in the external surface of sole. Instead the ribs described herein comprise additional structural material that is positioned above the internal surface of sole. In other words if the ribs were removed a smooth internal sole surface would remain.

As shown in the sole can include a marker adjacent the sole port such as directly behind the sole port. The triangular sole piece can include three indicators such as O N and C that indicate that the sole piece is set such that the face angle is Open Neutral and Closed respectively depending on which indicator is adjacent the marker . Similarly the bottom surface of the lower wall of the pentagonal sole piece can include five indicators a b c d and e that indicate a face angle setting. When the pentagonal sole piece is secured to the sole port similar to one of the indicators a b c d or e can be aligned with the marker and that indicator can indicate which pair of surfaces A E or trio of surfaces are in contact with the platform and thus what face angle setting corresponds to that positioning of the sole piece. For example if the indicator d on the bottom of the sole piece is aligned with the marker that can indicate that the surfaces D are in contact with the platform and that the sole piece is positioned such that the face angle will be closed 2 when in the address position. The indicators a b c d and e can for example be 4 2 0 2 and 4 respectively or any other indicator scheme that represents to a person what face angle setting is caused by aligning a particular indicator with the marker .

Regardless of the configuration of the adjustable sole piece whether it is circular elliptical polygonal triangular quadrilateral pentagonal hexagonal heptagonal octagonal enneagonal decagonal or some other shape the curvature of the bottom surface of the sole piece can be selected to match the curvature of the front contact surface at the front of the sole . The contact surface and the bottom surface of the sole piece can be the only two surfaces that contact the ground when the club head is in the address position. The lateral distance between the front contact surface and the center aperture of the sole piece can be from about 45 mm to about 60 mm such as about 52 mm.

Having illustrated and described the principles of the illustrated embodiments it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the embodiments can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles. For example although the embodiments disclosed above are made primarily with reference to drivers and driving wood type clubs any aspect of the disclosed technology can be incorporated into a fairway wood having a smaller volume and or greater mass. For example a fairway wood or rescue wood having any of the disclosed low CG and or static high loft characteristics are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure. For instance embodiments of fairway woods incorporating any one or more aspects of the disclosed technology have a volume between about 110 and 250 cmand a weight of between about 190 and 225 grams whereas embodiments of hybrid woods incorporating any one or more aspects of the disclosed technology have a volume between about 80 and 150 cmand a weight of between about 210 and 240 grams.
