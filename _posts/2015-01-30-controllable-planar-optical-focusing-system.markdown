title: Controllable planar optical focusing system
abstract: An optical device has a first metasurface disposed over a substrate. A high-contrast pattern of the first metasurface is operable for modifying, over a first phase profile, a phase front of an incident light beam. A second metasurface, is disposed over a plane parallel to the first metasurface with a second high-contrast pattern and operable for shaping, over a second phase profile, the modified phase front of the incident light beam into a converging spherical phase front. A spacer layer, in which the modified phase front of the incident light beam diffracts, is disposed in a controllably changeable separation between the first and second metasurfaces. Controllably changing the separation between the first and the second metasurfaces by a first distance correspondingly changes the position of the focus point of the converging spherical phase front by a second distance significantly greater than the first distance.

The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 935 433 filed Feb. 4 2014 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and is subject to the provisions of Public Law No. 96 517 35 U.S.C. 202 in which the Contractor has elected to retain title.

The present disclosure relates generally to optics. More particularly an example embodiment of the present disclosure relates to optical systems operable for controllably focusing light.

Example embodiments of the present disclosure relate to optical systems operable for controllably focusing light. The optical systems focus incident beams of light at typical optical infrared visible ultraviolet wavelengths and electromagnetic radiation spanning other wavelength ranges radio microwave x ray .

In an example embodiment the optical system comprises at least a pair of high contrast layers each disposed over a planar surface opposing that of the other across a separation. The high contrast layers are referred to herein by the term metasurfaces. As used herein the term high contrast refers to a contrast between the refractive index of materials from which the metasurfaces are made and the refractive index of materials surrounding or otherwise disposed in close proximity to the metasurfaces . The optical system is operable for adjusting a location of its focal plane. The location of the focal plane is adjustable by varying dimensions of the separation between the parallel metasurfaces by small amounts.

Example embodiments relate to implementation of optical systems at low cost using mass production and standard microfabrication techniques e.g. as used in manufacture of silicon chips and related electronics. Light weight optical systems may thus be implemented with very low profiles relative to typical optics using conventional focus components. Example embodiments relate to implementation of miniaturized and implantable microscopes and endoscopes and to 3D laser lithography and stereolithography which comprise the disclosed optical system operable for adjusting its focal plane.

An example embodiment relates to an optical device comprising a substrate and a first metasurface disposed upon the substrate. The first metasurface comprises a first high contrast pattern operable for modifying over a first phase profile a phase front of a narrow band or monochromatic collimated light beam incident to the first metasurface.

A second metasurface is disposed over a plane parallel to the first metasurface. The second metasurface comprises a second high contrast pattern operable for shaping over a second phase profile the phase front of the modified phase front of the incident light beam into a converging spherical phase front. A spacer layer in which the modified phase front of the incident light beam diffracts is disposed in a separation between the first metasurface and the second surface.

The separation relates to a focus point of the converging spherical phase front beyond the second metasurface relative to the first metasurface in as direction of propagation of the incident light beam. Providing a change in the separation causes a corresponding significant change in the focus point.

Controllably changing the controllable separation between the first metasurface and the second metasurface by a first distance correspondingly changes the position of the focus point of the converging spherical phase front by a second distance wherein the second distance exceeds the first distance to a significant degree.

The separation may comprise an adjustable distance between the first metasurface and the second metasurface. The adjustable distance may be adjustable tunably. For example the adjustable distance may be adjustable by tuning a modulation signal directed to the optical device to which the device is responsive. The significant change in the focus point may comprise a multiple of up to three orders of magnitude 1000 1 relative to the change in the separation.

In an example embodiment changing the separation distance between the first metasurface and the second metasurface may be implemented tunably using piezoelectric and or electrostatic actuation and or modulation. The separation distance between the first metasurface and the second metasurface may also be implemented using MEMS related actuation and or modulation approaches.

The substrate may comprise silicon. The optical device may also comprise at least a first membrane disposed over the substrate wherein the first metasurface is disposed over the first membrane. Optionally the optical device may also comprise a second membrane. One or more of the metasurfaces may be disposed on a substrate which comprises an optically transparent material. The second metasurface is disposed over the second membrane.

The first membrane and or the second membrane may comprise a free standing thin film material such as silicon nitride. The first membrane and or the second membrane may also comprise silicon oxide.

The narrow band and or the monochromatic light may comprise a portion of an infrared visible or ultraviolet spectral region over which the optical device is operable. The narrow band and or monochromatic light may also comprise a portion of an electromagnetic radiation spectrum over which the device may be operable at a radio microwave x ray or other frequency region.

The first metasurface and or the second metasurface may comprise a periodic or quasi periodic array of elements each of which comprises a sub wavelength dimension which is smaller than a shortest wavelength of the narrow band.

A refractive property of the first metasurface and or the second metasurface may relate to a parameter associated with the periodic or quasi periodic arrays of each. For example the parameter associated with the periodic or quasi periodic array may comprise a size and or a shape of a lattice feature of the periodic or quasi periodic array. The parameter associated with the periodic or quasi periodic array may also comprise a size and or a shape of one or more of a plurality of unit elements which comprise the lattice.

An example embodiment is also described in relation to a process for fabricating an optical device. The process may relate to silicon based micro fabrication technologies.

Further an example embodiment is described in relation to an optical system. The optical system may be disposed in various apparatus such as miniaturized microscopes endoscopes and telescopes. These apparatus may be implantable in a body of a medical patient or a physiological subject. The optical apparatus may also relate to stereolithography and 3D laser lithography.

Example embodiments of the present disclosure relate to optical systems operable for controllably focusing light. The optical systems focus incident beams of light at typical optical infrared visible ultraviolet wavelengths and may also be operable with electromagnetic radiation spanning other wavelength ranges.

An example embodiment is described in relation to an optical system comprising at least a pair of high contrast layers each disposed over a planar surface opposing that of the other across a separation. The high contrast layers are referred to herein by the term metasurfaces. Example embodiments relate to optical systems operable for adjusting a location of their focal planes. The location of the focal plane is adjustable by varying dimensions of the separation between the parallel metasurfaces by small amounts.

Devices with rapidly tunable focal length include microlenses with adjustable focus. Such microlenses function typically tune their foci by changing their geometrical characteristics or refractive index profiles. Conventional approaches to tuning the foci of microlenses have included changing the contact angle of a liquid droplet and a solid surface using a process related to electro wetting Ref.1 and modifying profiles of a liquid droplet Ref.2 or a polymer droplet Ref.3 by introducing variation into their volumes.

Variation has typically been introduced into the volumes of liquid and polymeric droplets by increasing or decreasing the volume of liquid pumped into the droplet or by expanding droplets and or contracting droplets by adding or removing thermal energy therefrom. For example heating the droplets adds thermal energy thereto and thus expands their volumes. Alternatively or additionally cooling the liquid or polymer material of the droplets removes thermal energy therefrom and thus reduces the droplet volumes by contraction.

Another conventional approach creates a graded index profile in a liquid crystal layer using a non uniform electrostatic field Ref.4 to which the layer is exposed. Although using these conventional approaches allow microlenses with tunable focal lengths the lenses thus produced remain too large and the tuning process remains too slow for practical use with some significant modern optical and electro optical applications.

In contrast an example embodiment of the present disclosure relates to optical systems having low profiles and fast focal length tuning at speeds sufficient to support modern optical and electro optical applications. An example embodiment relates to an optical device comprising a substrate and a first metasurface disposed upon the substrate. The first metasurface comprises a first high contrast pattern operable for modifying over a first phase profile a phase front of a narrow band or monochromatic collimated light beam incident to the first metasurface.

A second metasurface is disposed over a plane parallel to the first metasurface. The second metasurface comprises a second high contrast pattern operable for shaping over a second phase profile the phase front of the modified phase front of the incident light beam into a converging spherical phase front. A spacer layer in which the modified phase front of the incident light beam diffracts is disposed in a separation between the first metasurface and the second surface.

The separation relates to a focus point of the converging spherical phase front beyond the second metasurface relative to the first metasurface in as direction of propagation of the incident light beam. Providing a change in the separation causes a corresponding significant change in the focus point.

Controllably changing the controllable separation between the first metasurface and the second metasurface by a first distance correspondingly changes the position of the focus point of the converging spherical phase front by a second distance wherein the second distance exceeds the first distance to a significant degree.

The input beam comprises a collimated beam of monochromatic or narrow band light. Example embodiments may be implemented in which the incident beam comprises light at any optical infrared visible ultraviolet wavelength. Embodiments are not limited to such optical wavelengths however. On the contrary example embodiments may be implemented in which the incident beam comprises electromagnetic radiation spanning any other wavelength range radio microwave x ray .

The first metasurface functions as a phase mask and modifies the phase front of the input beam. The beam with the modified phase front travels the distance between the two metasurfaces and undergoes diffraction as it propagates. The second metasurface also functions as a phase mask but it has a different phase profile from the first metasurface. The purpose of the second metasurface is to focus the light incident on it so it modifies the phase front of the beam and shapes it in the form of a converging spherical phase front. The phase mask of the first metasurface is chosen such that the light passed through it diffracts in such a way that when the separation between the two metasurfaces is changed by a small amount the phase front of the light at the second metasurface plane is modified significantly and in a such a way that the location of the focus is moved by a large amount.

The example input beam has a wavelength 2 930 nm and comprises a Gaussian input with a waist radius of 30 m propagating along the z axis. The first metasurface and the second metasurface are located in the x y plane and are separated by a distance of 10 m from each other. In profile the intensity of the light in the x z cross sectional plane is plotted in the logarithmic scale. The simulation is performed using computation related to the plane wave expansion method and the metasurfaces and are modeled as phase masks.

Profile and profile depict diffraction of the beam after passing through the first metasurface and the focus of the diffracted light after passing through the second metasurface. Profile represents the separation between the two metasurfaces at a distance of 8.2 m. Profile represents the separation between the two metasurfaces at a distance of while it is 48.5 m. While the separation distance between the two lenses changes by 3.6 m the location of the focus moves correspondingly by approximately 0.1 mm which comprises ratio of 3.6 100 two orders of magnitude.

The phase masks required for realizing the adjustable focus functionality may be implemented using high contrast layers patterned with subwavelength features. As used herein the term subwavelength features refers to elements comprising the phase masks as having dimensions smaller than the wavelength of the monochromatic beam or the smallest wavelength of the narrow band over which the optical system is operable. In an example embodiment arbitrary phase masks may be implemented by gradually varying in plane geometrical features characterizing periodically or quasi periodically arrayed structures.

An example embodiment may be implemented in which the metasurface is created by gradually varying the duty cycles which correspond to the changing radii of circular posts inclusive disposed over a hexagonal periodic array of silicon posts. depicts the transmission amplitude and phase shift of a plane wave normally incident on the periodic array according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure.

An example of phase mask is created by changing the radii and equivalently duty cycles of silicon posts arranged in a hexagonal lattice. A phase shift is imposed when the light passes through such a metasurface. The phase shift can be approximated at each point on the structure by its corresponding value for a periodic structure having a duty cycle that matches the local duty cycle of the metasurface Ref.5 and Ref.6 . The simulated values of the phase shift that a periodic structure imposes on a normally incident light is shown in .

The example periodic structure comprises a plurality of 0.4 m tall circular silicon posts which are disposed over a 3 m thick silicon dioxide membrane. The posts are arranged in a hexagonal lattice with a lattice constant of 0.34 m. The computed simulation shown is performed at the 633 nm wavelength.

The phase shift imposed by the periodic structure can be changed from 0 to 2 by varying the duty cycle of the structure from 22 to 50 . The amplitude of the transmission shows significant transmission at the 633 nm wavelength where silicon is characteristically absorbing. Phase masks may thus be implemented using a periodic structure and a curve selectively similar to those represented in .

The optical focusing system may be implemented using silicon micro fabrication techniques known to artisans skilled in technologies related to optics electro optics and or semiconductor processes.

An example embodiment may be implemented in which the first metasurface and the second metasurfaces are fabricated on free standing thin film membranes comprising silicon nitride. The membranes may also be fabricated using silicon dioxide. Displacement operations such as for changing the separation distance between the first metasurface and the second metasurface may be implemented using actuation techniques known to artisans skilled in technologies related to optics electro optics and or semiconductor processes. For example the actuation operations may comprise piezoelectric and or electrostatic actuation and or modulation approaches similar or analogous to those used with micro electromechanical systems MEMS and similar technologies.

An example embodiment thus relates to an optical device comprising a substrate and a first metasurface disposed upon the substrate. The first metasurface comprises a first high contrast pattern operable for modifying over a first phase profile a phase front of a narrow band or monochromatic collimated light beam incident to the first metasurface.

A second metasurface is disposed over a plane parallel to the first metasurface. The second metasurface comprises a second high contrast pattern operable for shaping over a second phase profile the phase front of the modified phase front of the incident light beam into a converging spherical phase front. A spacer layer in which the modified phase front of the incident light beam diffracts is disposed in a separation between the first metasurface and the second surface.

The separation relates to a focus point of the converging spherical phase front beyond the second metasurface relative to the first metasurface in as direction of propagation of the incident light beam. Providing a change in the separation causes a corresponding significant change in the focus point.

Controllably changing the controllable separation between the first metasurface and the second metasurface by a first distance correspondingly changes the position of the focus point of the converging spherical phase front by a second distance wherein the second distance exceeds the first distance to a significant degree.

The separation may comprise an adjustable distance between the first metasurface and the second metasurface. The adjustable distance may be adjustable tunably. For example the adjustable distance may be adjustable by tuning a modulation signal directed to the optical device to which the device is responsive. The significant change in the focus point may comprise a multiple of up to three orders of magnitude 1000 1 relative to the change in the separation.

In an example embodiment changing the separation distance between the first metasurface and the second metasurface may be implemented tunably using piezoelectric and or electrostatic actuation and or modulation. The separation distance between the first metasurface and the second metasurface may also be implemented using MEMS related actuation and or modulation approaches.

The substrate may comprise silicon. The optical device may also comprise at least a first membrane disposed over the substrate wherein the first metasurface is disposed over the first membrane. Optionally the optical device may also comprise a second membrane. The second metasurface is disposed over the second membrane.

The first membrane and or the second membrane may comprise a free standing thin film material such as silicon nitride. The first membrane and or the second membrane may also comprise silicon oxide.

The narrow band and or the monochromatic light may comprise a portion of an infrared visible or ultraviolet spectral region over which the optical device is operable. The narrow band and or monochromatic light may also comprise a portion of an electromagnetic radiation spectrum over which the device may be operable at a radio microwave x ray or other frequency region.

The first metasurface and or the second metasurface may comprise a periodic or quasi periodic array of elements each of which comprises a sub wavelength dimension which is smaller than a shortest wavelength of the narrow band.

A refractive property of the first metasurface and or the second metasurface may relate to a parameter associated with the periodic or quasi periodic arrays of each. For example the parameter associated with the periodic or quasi periodic array may comprise a size and or a shape of a lattice feature of the periodic or quasi periodic array. The parameter associated with the periodic or quasi periodic array may also comprise a size and or a shape of one or more of a plurality of unit elements which comprise the lattice.

The first metasurface comprises a first high contrast pattern operable for modifying over a first phase profile a phase front of a narrow band or monochromatic collimated light beam incident to the first metasurface. In step a spacer layer is disposed over the first metasurface.

In step a second metasurface is disposed over the spacer layer on a plane parallel to the first metasurface. The second metasurface comprises a second high contrast pattern operable for shaping over a second phase profile the phase front of the modified phase front of the incident light beam into a converging spherical phase front. The modified phase front of the incident light beam diffracts as it propagates through the spacer layer which is disposed in a separation between the first metasurface and the second surface. The spacer layer disposed in step over the first metasurface is disposed in installed within a space corresponding to the separation between the first metasurface and the second metasurface. Thus step may be performed temporally prior to performance of the step . 

The separation relates to a focus point of the converging spherical phase front beyond the second metasurface relative to the first metasurface in a direction of propagation of the incident light beam. A change in the separation causes a corresponding significant change in the focus point. The significant change may comprise a multiple of three orders of magnitude relative to a magnitude of the change in the separation between the first and the second metasurfaces.

Disposing the first metasurface and or disposing the second metasurface may comprise disposing a periodic or quasi periodic array of elements each of which comprises a sub wavelength dimension which is smaller than a wavelength corresponding to the monochromatic light or of the smallest wavelength of the narrow band. An optical operating range of the optical device relates to a parameter characterizing the first metasurface and or the second metasurface.

The parameter of the first metasurface and or the second metasurface may relate to a size and or a shape of a lattice associated with the first and or the second metasurfaces. The parameter of the first metasurface and or the second metasurface may also relate to a size and or a shape of each of a plurality of unit elements which comprise the lattice.

The fabrication process may also comprise disposing at least a first membrane over the substrate. The disposing of the first metasurface step may thus comprise disposing the first metasurface on the at least first membrane.

The fabrication process may optionally also comprise disposing a second membrane on a surface of the spacer component opposite from the first metasurface and over the plane parallel thereto. The disposing of the second metasurface may thus comprise disposing the second metasurface over the second membrane. The first membrane and or the second membrane may comprise a free standing thin film material. The first membrane and or the second membrane may each comprise silicon nitride or silicon dioxide.

The separation relates to a focus of the converging spherical phase front beyond the second metasurface relative to the first metasurface in a direction of propagation of the incident light beam. A change in the separation causes a corresponding significant change in the focus. The change may be actuated in response to piezoelectric and or electrostatic actuation and or modulation operations and or actuations modulation approaches related to MEMS.

Controllably changing the controllable separation between the first metasurface and the second metasurface by a first distance correspondingly changes the position of the focus point of the converging spherical phase front by a second distance wherein the second distance exceeds the first distance to a significant degree.

A sensor such as a photodiode array or a charge coupled device CCD may be disposed to receive an optical output of the modified light beam opposite from the second convex lens like component in relation to the second focus point .

The optical system may comprise a miniaturized apparatus. The miniaturized apparatus may comprise a microscope an endoscope or a telescope. The miniaturized apparatus may be disposed in a sealed protective housing and may be implantable into a body of a medical patient or a physiological or other biological specimen.
