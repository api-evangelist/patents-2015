All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.

This patent application discloses inventive concepts related generally to guiding correcting and or improving the placement of electrodes on a subject patient.

Electrical measurement of biological activity and particularly non invasive electrical measurement is increasingly important in medical therapy diagnostics and research. For example electrodes of various types may be used to record electrocardiograms ECGs electroencephalograms EEG electromyogram EMG galvanic skin reflex GSR electrooculogram EOG bioimpedance BI and others including invasive or implantable measurements. Accurate and reliable electrical measurements from patients may require precise or consistent placement of the electrodes used for measurement on the patient s body which may require that the user placing the electrodes have a great deal of training and experience. The consequences of placing the electrodes outside of the predetermined conventional or standard locations on the body may result in inaccurate results.

For example electrocardiography is used to examine and monitor the electrical activity of the heart. ECGs are increasingly valuable tools for treating patients at risk for heart disorders. Electrocardiograms ECG can be recorded or taken using multiple electrodes placed on the skin of a patient and electrical signals recorded between two electrodes may be referred to as leads. A variety of different lead patterns including different numbers of electrodes may be used to take an ECG. For example an ECG may be taken with 3 5 and 12 leads. For a standard 12 lead ECG 10 electrode positions are typically used six on the chest and one on each of the patient s arms and legs.

The placement of the electrodes for the ECG is important. Despite the common use of ECGs within the medical profession it is not uncommon for electrodes to be incorrectly placed on the patient by the nurse medical technician or physician. Incorrect placement of electrodes can adversely affect the ECG results and make comparison of the ECG results to standard ECG data difficult. Because of this sensitivity the placement of leads is typically left to trained medical technicians e.g. ECG technicians as it is difficult for an untrained user to correctly place electrodes it would be particularly difficult for an untrained user to correctly place leads on their own body. As mentioned placing one or more of the electrodes used to measure an ECG outside of the accepted standard or conventional positions on the patient s body can affect the ECG making it difficult to compare to a standard ECG and therefore difficult for a medical professional to interpret.

Electrodes are typically placed on a patient by a human allowing an opportunity for human error to result in incorrect electrode placement. The methods devices and systems disclosed herein can be used to improve guide the electrode placement on a patient. Accurate electrode placement can result in improved patient data e.g. ECG data better patient diagnosis and treatment and improved patient health. Although attempts have been made to minimize the error introduced by varying electrode placement in ECG systems including creating systems that are supposed to tolerate a greater variability in ECG measurement these efforts have had limited success. For example U.S. Pat. No. 6 282 440 describes methods for calculating and determining whether electrodes are in the standard ECG electrode placement an alternative electrode placement or an incorrect electrode placement based on an analysis of the ECG measurements resulting from electrode placement. Unfortunately U.S. Pat. No. 6 282 440 does not provide a method for guiding the initial placement of electrodes or easily correcting incorrect measurements.

Different configurations for ECG electrode placement may be used on a patient. Common customary or standard positions for these ten electrode positions have been determined for use in taking a 12 lead ECG. Measurement taken from ten 10 electrode positions on a patient may be used to produce a standard 12 lead electrocardiogram ECG .

Thus a standard or conventional 12 lead ECG configuration typically uses 10 electrode positions which may mean the placement of ten separate electrodes in these positions. illustrates placement of 10 electrodes that may be used for a 12 lead ECG with 6 electrodes on the patient s chest and one electrode on each of the patient s arms and legs. The electrode placed on the right arm is typically referred to as RA. The electrode placed on the left arm is referred to as LA. The RA and LA electrodes are placed at approximately the same location on the left and right arms preferably near the wrist. The leg electrodes can be referred to as RL for the right leg and LL for the left leg. The RL and LL electrodes are placed on the same location for the left and right legs preferably near the ankle. In practice placement of the arm and leg electrodes is much less challenging than placement of the electrodes on the patient s chest. Further ECG measurements may be more sensitive to variations in the placement of chest electrodes.

Based on measurements between these electrode positions standard lead measurements may be taken. For example lead I is the voltage between the left arm LA and right arm RA e.g. I LA RA. Lead II is the voltage between the left leg LL and right arm RA e.g. II LL RA. Lead III is the voltage between the left leg LL and left arm LA e.g. III LL LA. Wilson s central terminal WCT or V can be calculated by RA LA LL 3. Augmented limb leads can also be determined from RA RL LL and LA. The augmented vector right aVR is equal to RA LA LL 2 or I II 2. The augmented vector left aVL is equal to LA RA LL 2 or I II 2. The augmented vector foot aVF is equal to LL RA LA 2 or II I 2. Leads I II III aVR aVL and aVF can all be represented on a hexaxial system illustrated in . Incorrect or shifted electrode placement can shift the results of the ECG on the hexaxial system.

The signals from this 12 lead system may be used to examine the electrical signal resulting from cardiac activity. The 12 lead measurements have been accepted as providing medically relevant information about cardiac health. illustrates a sample ECG annotated to show characteristic features used for analysis of cardiac function in particular PQRST waves. Identification and measurement of the PQRST waves across the 12 leads is well accepted as providing relevant information about the health of a patient. For example illustrates data collected from a patient using a 12 lead standard configuration. The data can be analyzed to obtain representations of the PQRST waves for this patient. As mentioned incorrect placement of the electrodes changes the measured values for the leads.

There may be multiple acceptable positions or ranges of positions for electrodes including ECG electrodes. For example show different configurations for the arm and leg electrodes that may be used in an ECG. The RA LA electrodes may be placed near the wrist as shown in or near the shoulder as shown in and the RL LL electrodes may be placed near the ankle or near the pelvis . Positioning the arm electrodes near the wrist and the leg electrodes near the ankles as shown in is widely accepted as a standard or conventional electrode configuration for the arm and leg electrodes in a 12 lead ECG. Alternatively positioning the arm and leg electrodes adjacent to the thorax as shown in may be referred to as the Mason Likar system for electrode placement. The Mason Likar system is often used to take an ECG during exercise because the arm and leg electrodes are positioned closer to the chest and torso and placed in areas of the body that move less during exercise. The electrode positioning differences between the standard configuration and the Mason Likar system can result in differences in the ECG signals received since the relative positioning of the arm electrodes affects the measured leads see e.g. Resting 12 Lead ECG Electrode Placement and Associated Problems by Macfarlane et al. SCST Update 1995 .

Thus it would be beneficial to provide improved methods for accurately placing electrodes on the body of a patient.

In general described herein are methods devices and systems for guiding and or correcting placement of electrodes on a patient. These methods may be particularly useful for guiding placement of electrodes for ECG measurements. In general the systems devices and methods described herein process a picture of a patient to output electrode positions on the patient. Typically this may include presenting an image of the patient e.g. a modified version of the picture of the patient showing the locations for the electrodes relative to the actual patient picture.

For example a system or device for guiding electrode placement as described herein may include control logic for controlling a processor e.g. microprocessor of a computing device such as a hand held computing device to receive a picture of a patient to analyze the patient to determine the correct placement of the electrodes and to output an image of the patient on which the correct predetermined electrode positions have been marked. In general the control logic may be configured as software hardware or firmware and may control a general purpose computing device e.g. computer tablet or the like or a mobile telecommunications device smartphone such as Iphone Android etc. to accept or acquire the picture and output the image of the patient. The processing step may be performed remotely or locally. In general the processing step may include comparing the picture of the patient to a database e.g. an electrode placement database of various body types and corresponding predetermined conventional or standard positions for electrodes associated with each body type. The picture of the patient may also be normalized prior to comparing the picture the patient database by adjusting the size and or in some cases the aspect ratio brightness contrast or other image features of the picture to allow direct comparison with the database. Normalization may be performed using a marker included as a part of the picture. For example the picture of the patient may be taken with a marker of known or knowable size on the patient and the marker may be used as a normalization marker to normalize the picture before comparison with the database. Normalization may also be performed to even out the brightness contrast sharpness or other imaging quality of the picture. The marker may be placed or applied directly onto the patient e.g. the patient s torso e.g. by adhesive etc. 

Also described herein are methods performed by the devices and systems for guiding electrode placement such as methods of guiding electrode placement on a patient.

For example described herein are methods for guiding proper placement of electrodes on a patient that include comparing a picture of the patient to an electrode placement database to determine positioning of electrodes on the patient wherein the electrode placement database comprises representations of a plurality of body types and predetermined electrode placement positions corresponding to each body type and presenting an image of the patient showing positions for electrodes on the image of the patient.

These methods may be particularly adapted for guiding placement of ECG electrodes on a patient in a standard or conventional configuration on the patient. Thus the database may be configured to include a plurality of body types with corresponding conventional standard electrode placement positions for each body type in the database.

In some variations electrode positions may be determined and indicated for all of the electrodes e.g. all 10 electrode positions used for a standard 12 electrode lead . However in some variations on a subset of the electrode positions may be determined and or displayed. For example a method of guiding positioning of a standard conventional 12 lead electrode placement may determine and show only the six electrode positions on the patient s chest. In some variations where other electrode positions may be determined relative to one or more key electrode positions only the position of the key electrode s may be shown.

In general any appropriate picture of the subject may be used. In some variations the system devices or methods may include taking or acquiring the picture. As described in greater detail below in some variations the picture may be taken by the system or device performing the method e.g. a smartphone or other handheld computer device . The systems devices and methods described herein may instruct a user how to take the picture of the patient including positioning the patient facing forward standing sitting lying etc. approximately how far from the patient to take the picture positioning a normalization marker on or near the patient and the like. The picture may be received as a digital image. The picture may include an image of the patient and particularly a region of the patient s body to which the electrodes are to be applied. For example when applying ECG electrodes the picture may include the patient s torso or chest. Additional regions of the patient s body may be included such as the patient s head legs etc. The patient may be standing seated or lying down. The region of the patient to which the electrodes will be applied is typically bare e.g. a may be shirtless or at least partially shirtless so that the skin can be visualized . As mentioned in some variations a normalization marker may be included as part of the picture. For example a reference marker may be placed on the patient the reference normalization marker typically has a known or standard size such as a coin e.g. a U.S. quarter penny etc. . In some variations the reference marker is provided and may be a distinct shape or color. In some variations the marker is automatically recognized by the apparatus. For example the marker may include a readable code e.g. bar code alphanumeric code QR code etc. alternatively the apparatus may identify the marker by color shape etc.

In variations in which the method system or device guides the user through taking or acquiring the picture the picture may be qualified by the system or device. Qualifying the picture may include checking the picture to confirm that it is suitable and can be analyzed e.g. compared to the database.

As used herein the phrase patient is intended broadly to include any subject on whom the methods devices and systems may be used to help position electrodes. A patient may include an animal in systems and devices specifically configured for use with that type of animal or human and may include healthy or non healthy subjects. As used herein a user may be a person using the systems methods and devices as described herein. In some variations the user is the same as the patient as the systems devices and methods described herein may be used by a patient to guide placement of electrodes on his or herself.

In some variations comparing the picture to the electrode placement database may comprise determining the standard placement of electrodes for a 12 lead ECG on the patient.

In general comparing the picture of the patient to the electrode placement database may include determining a match e.g. the closest match between the picture and one or more representative body types in the patient database. Once one or more closely matching representative body types have been identified the electrode placement corresponding to the representative body types for the match s may be mapped to the picture of the patient. Where more than one match is identified electrode placement may be determined from the standard electrodes placements corresponding to the multiple representative body matches by weighting averaging or other appropriate statistical method for finding a consensus standard among the closest matches and mapping this standard electrode placement to the picture of the patient.

As described in greater detail below an electrode placement database typically includes a plurality e.g. 10 100 1000 10 000 etc. of representations of standard conventional electrode placement for different bodies. A representation of a body type may include an image of a body e.g. picture portion of a picture etc. or information extracted from an image of a body including electrode placement specific for that body where the electrode placement has been confirmed or verified as within the standard conventional bounds. The various body types may include body types of different shapes and sizes height weight morphology gender male female age infant child adult elderly physical morphology shoulder width chest size waist size etc. and the like. Each body type representation may be unique although similar body types may be included creating clusters of body types around more common body types. All of the body types in the database may be pre normalized to allow comparison between the different representations. Multiple different electrode placement databases may be used. For example separate databases may be used for different patient positions lying sitting standing etc. or for different patient genders ages etc. Further different electrode placement databases may be used for different standard conventional electrode placements.

Thus in addition to normalizing the picture before comparing it to an electrode placement database the picture may be processed to prepare it for comparison with the database. In variations in which the comparison is made by extracting features from the picture and comparing these extracted features to the representations of body types in the database the extraction of features may be performed on the picture before or as part of the comparison. For example when comparing the picture of the patient to the electrode placement database includes determining anatomical landmarks from the picture and comparing the anatomical landmarks to the electrode placement database anatomical landmarks may be extracted from the picture first. The picture may also be processed to remove patient identifying features e.g. all or part of the patients face etc. which may be relevant to protect patient privacy.

As mentioned above the comparison of the picture with the database may comprises interpolating between the closest matches to the picture and two or more representative body types in the patient database.

In some variations comparing the picture of the patient to the database comprises using pattern recognition to determine the closest match between the picture and a representative body type in the database. In some variations comparing the picture of the patient to the electrode placement database comprises comparing the normalized picture of the patient to the electrode placement database.

The methods devices and systems described herein may also include presenting the image of the patient showing positions for electrodes on the image of the patient. Any appropriate image of the patient may be presented including a modified version of the picture of the patient showing the positions of the electrodes determined by comparison with the database. In some variations the image of the patient is digitally displayed e.g. on the handheld computing device . And may be enlarged zoom in out or manipulated so that the user can see where to place the electrodes. In some variations the image may include additional guidelines including measurements rulers distances in inches mm etc. relative to the patient including patient landmarks such as anatomical landmarks and or relative to other electrodes.

The presentation of the image of the patient showing the conventional standard position of the electrodes may show all of the electrodes or some of the electrodes. In some variations the presentation of the image may include a series of images separately showing the patient with different electrode positions indicated to better allow a user to step through the process of applying or repositioning the electrodes. In general the presentation of the image of the patient may be visual showing the image and may also include textual written spoken instructions for applying the electrodes. For example in variations of the systems and methods described herein intended for use with a handheld computer device such as a smartphone the device may controlled to step the user through both taking the patient s picture and positioning or repositioning the electrodes by looking at the screen of the smartphone.

In some variations the methods devices and systems described herein may be used to correct and or verify the position of electrodes already present on a patient. For example the user may take or receive a picture of a patient with ECG electrodes already on the chest. Comparing the picture of the patient to the electrode placement database may also compare the position of the electrodes already on the patient with the determined standard conventional positions. Thus comparing the picture of the patient to an electrode placement database may comprise comparing a picture of the patient having one or more electrodes already placed on the patient s chest to the electrode placement database. The position of the one or more electrodes already placed on the patient s chest may then be verified either automatically indicating when one or more is incurred or passively by overlying the correct positions indicated in some specific way e.g. by a color onto the picture of the patient to form the presented image. In some variations the image presented includes an image of the patient showing corrected positioning of electrodes on the image of the patient.

Also described herein are methods for guiding placement of ECG electrodes that include receiving a picture of a patient including the patient s chest comparing the picture of the patient to an electrode placement database to determine positioning of electrodes on the patient wherein the electrode placement database comprises representations of a plurality of body types and predetermined conventional ECG electrode placement positions corresponding to each body type and presenting an image of the patient showing positions for conventional ECG electrode positions on the image of the patient. The method wherein comparing the picture of the patient to the electrode placement database includes determining the closest match between the picture and a representative body type in the electrode placement database.

As mentioned above comparing the picture of the patient to the electrode placement database includes determining anatomical landmarks from the picture and comparing the anatomical landmarks to the electrode placement database. In some variations comparing the picture of the patient to the database comprises using pattern recognition to determine the closest match between the picture and a representative body type in the electrode placement database.

In any of the variations described herein the comparing of the patient picture with the electrode placement database may be performed remotely from the other steps. For example a smartphone may be used e.g. using an application downloaded to the phone to acquire the picture of the patient and to present the image of the patient showing the conventional positions of the electrodes the comparison of the picture with the database may be performed remotely using a remote server. Thus the database may be maintained separately from the application on the smartphone or other device . This may allow modification updating or otherwise amending the database and or the mechanisms for comparing the picture of the patient to the database. The image generated may then be presented on a handheld computer device after it receives information or the generated image back from the remote database. Alternatively in some variations all of the steps are performed on the local level e.g. using the handheld computing device such as a smartphone or tablet computer .

As mentioned above the picture of the patient may include a normalization marker. Thus the step of receiving the picture of a patient may include receiving a picture of a patient includes a normalization marker. In some variations the picture of the patient received may include electrodes on the patient s chest the method device or system may verify the placement of the electrodes already on the chest relative to conventional ECG electrode placement positions.

Also described herein are methods for determining the placement of ECG electrodes including receiving a picture showing a patient including and a normalization marker normalizing the picture using the normalization marker comparing the normalized picture to an electrode placement database comprising representations of a plurality of body types and predetermined ECG electrode placement positions for each body type to determine positioning of electrodes on the patient and presenting an image of the patient showing positions for ECG electrodes on the image of the patient.

A system or device may be configured to perform any or all of the steps described above for receiving a picture of a patient including the region of the patient to which electrodes are to be applied analyzing the picture and providing an image of the patient or any other patient specific map showing the location s of one or more electrodes on the patient based on predetermined conventional and or standard electrode positions.

Although many of the examples described herein are specific to systems devices and methods of placing ECG electrodes according to standard or convention 12 lead ECG electrode placement these systems devices and methods may be used or adapted for use with any predetermined conventional and or standard electrode positioning system including electrodes for electroencephalograms EEG electromyogram EMG galvanic skin reflex GSR electrooculogram EOG bioimpedance BI etc. For example the electrode placement database may include a variety of body types and corresponding predetermined conventional and or standard electrode positions for each of the body types for EEG EMG GSR EOG BI etc. In some variations the different electrode placement regimes different conventional and or standard electrode placement may be linked in the database to each body type and a user may select which placement regime to display. In other variations more than one placement regime may be shown either sequentially or simultaneously for the same patient. For example for ECG electrode placement the electrode placement can correspond to 3 lead 5 lead and 12 lead ECGs.

A system for guiding electrode placement may generally include control logic which may be executed as software hardware or firmware or combinations thereof that receive the picture of the patient determine conventional and or standard electrode placement for that patient using an electrode placement database and output a map or image of the patient showing where on the patient the electrodes should be positioned. The system may also be configured to guide or walk the user through the process of taking the picture of the patient and or positioning the electrodes on the patient. In some variations the system is configured to guide the user by audible instructions written instructions and or visual instructions. The system may be configured to work from e.g. control a handheld computing device including a smartphone e.g. iPHONE ANDROID etc. to receive and in some cases take the picture of the patient and output the image of the patient with the determined electrode position s marked. For example the system may be configured as an application for a smartphone that is downloadable onto the smartphone.

Any of the systems described herein may be dedicated systems that come pre configured to receive a patient picture and output an image of the patient showing electrode placement positions and do not require downloading of an application e.g. software onto a separate device. For example a system may include a camera for taking a picture of the patient control logic for receiving the picture controlling analysis of the picture to determine electrode placement using an electrode placement database and outputting a map or image of the patient showing the location of one or more electrodes according to a conventional and or standard electrode positioning regime. The system may include all or a portion of the electrode placement database or the system may communicate with a remote electrode placement database. Further the system may include a comparison unit which may include comparison logic for comparing the picture of the patient with the body types in the electrode placement database in order to find one or more close matches between the patient and the body types in the database from which the predetermined conventional and or standard electrode positions can be extrapolated to the patient picture.

The system may also be configured to use and may include as part of the system a normalization marker that is included in the picture of the patient. A normalization marker is typically a distinct maker that the systems devices described herein may distinguish in the picture and which may be used to provide scale and or orientation for reference in the picture. For example the normalization marker may be a sticker that can be attached to the skin of the patient the sticker may be brightly colored and may have a known size e.g. an orange circle of one inch diameter . The system device can therefore distinguish this sizing marker in the picture and can normalize the picture using the normalization marker. In some variations the normalization marker may also provide a reference position which the system may use in providing instructions for placement of the electrode s . In some variation more than one sizing maker may be used. A normalization marker may be a common object of known dimension such as a coin. The user may indicate in the system device what the normalization marker e.g. from a menu of possible normalization markers .

As mentioned the image of the patient showing positioning of electrodes can be presented to the user on a handheld computer device. For example the handheld computer device can be a mobile phone smartphone tablet computer or camera with network connectivity.

In general described herein are systems devices and methods for determining the placement of electrodes on a patient. In general these system devices and methods operate by receiving a picture of a patient s body and comparing the picture to a database with representations of a plurality of different body types in order to find the closest match or matches between the patient picture and the different body types. The database may be referred to as an electrode placement database and typically includes representations of a variety of different body types and for each body type associated predetermined electrode placement positions for each of the body types. The predetermined electrode placement positions may correspond to conventional and or standard electrode positions which may have been previously verified. These systems devices and or methods may then extrapolate the optimal placement of one or more electrode s on the picture of the patient based on the one or more matches from the database and present a map of this optimal placement. The map may be an image that includes the picture of the patient on whom the optimal position s or a range of positions have been drawn. These systems may be referred to as systems for guiding electrode placement or electrode placement systems similarly the devices may be referred to as devices for guiding electrode placement or electrode placement devices and the methods may be referred to as methods for guiding electrode placement. These systems devices and methods may be particularly helpful for assisting confirming or guiding placement of ECG electrodes e.g. for performing standard 12 lead ECG measurements.

Any of the systems described herein may be configured for operation with a handheld computing device and particularly a smartphone device such as an ANDROID or iPHONE. Thus the steps of receiving the picture of the patient and or presenting the image showing electrode locations may be performed by a handheld computer device. Thus in some variations the systems described herein generally include control logic for directing the handheld computing device to perform the steps of acquiring the picture of the patient analyzing the picture using the database and presenting the image of the patient. The control logic may also include additional steps at least some of which may be optional including guiding a user to acquire the picture of the patient using a normalization marker which in some variations may be referred to as a sizing marker normalizing the picture passing the picture to an analysis unit for accessing an electrode placement database and comparing the picture to the database extrapolating the optimal electrode placement for the patient from the database and generating a placement map e.g. image for the patient. The control logic may also present the placement map.

For example the methods systems and devices described herein may be used to determine the optimal placement of electrodes for performing 12 lead ECG recordings from a patient by receiving a picture of a patient s body showing the patient s chest and outputting an image of the patient showing optimal positions for at least some of the electrodes on an image of the patient. Thus the determined electrode positions can correspond to conventional lead positioning for electrodes in an ECG in a 12 Lead ECG and may be used to position electrodes in the proper positions on the patient s actual rather than virtual chest.

Examples and illustrations of these methods devices and systems are provided herein however the inventions described herein are not limited in application to the specific details of construction experiments exemplary data and or the arrangement of the components set forth. Other embodiments or variations for practicing or carrying out these inventions are expressly contemplated. The terminology employed herein is for purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting unless specifically indicated as such. Thus in the following detailed description of embodiments of the disclosure numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the disclosure. However it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the concepts within the disclosure can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.

As illustrated in a method of guiding electrode placement may include comparing a picture of a patient to an electrode placement database that includes a plurality of predetermined conventional and or standard electrode placement positions for a variety of different body types . The patient picture is compared to the variety of different body types to determine the closest match s . The corresponding electrode placement positions on the one or more closest matches may then be used to extrapolate the conventional standard electrode placement on the patient. The conventional standard electrode placement may be presented in the form of an illustration of the patient showing positions for one or more electrodes based on the comparison with the database .

In the picture is taken with the patient s shirt removed. The patient is standing and their arms are down at their sides. A normalization marker is included on the patient as well. The normalization marker may be any marker having properties that are known or entered into the system or device. In the marker is a circular sticker that is placed on the upper right side of the patient s chest before taking the picture. The sticker has an approximately one inch diameter. In some variations the maker is a common object of known dimensions that is placed or held by the subject while taking the picture. For example a coin e.g. quarter nickel penny etc. may be placed on the patient. As described in more detail below the normalization maker may provide a reference to normalize the figures so that it can be directly compared with the electrode placement database.

The patient picture in can then be compared to the electrode placement database to find a match with one or more of the body types in the database. In some variations if no close match is found a notification that the system device cannot find a match or cannot provide positioning may be provided. In any variation the method and system may provide an indication of the confidence of the match placement guidance which may be based on how closely the patient picture matches body types in the database.

Once one or more matches is identified from the database the predetermined conventional and or standard electrode positioning for the one or more close matches may be used to suggest positioning of electrodes for the patient. For example electrode placement positions may be extrapolated from the matching body type s and shown on the picture of the patient as illustrated in . In this example six ECG electrode positions are shown on the patient s picture. This image may be presented to the user to assist them in placing the electrodes on the subject. After placement the patient s picture may be taken to confirm that the electrodes have been properly positioned as illustrated in .

In general electrode placement may be confirmed using the methods and systems described herein. shows a picture of a patient s torso similar to in which six electrodes numbered one to six have been positioned . This picture which also includes marker can be compared to an electrode placement database to generate an image of the patient including the actual electrode positions onto which proposed electrode positions are also shown. In the conventional standard electrode positions are overlaid onto the picture . Thus the user may move or adjust the position of the electrodes as shown in the image . Although the technique illustrated above provides images of the patient showing corresponding conventional standard electrode positions based on the database in some variations the image of the patient showing the conventional standard electrode positions determined from the database may be displayed on a video including real time display of the patient allowing real time repositioning of the electrodes.

For example in the suggested positions for the six ECG electrodes are slightly shifted from the positions of the actual electrodes already on the patient s chest. In some variations the suggested or proposed positions may be shown in a semi transparent visual. In general the proposed positions may be shown in a color. The outputted image may be enlarged by the user to help show the relative position of the proposed conventional standard electrode positions. Although the majority of examples provided herein include an output image in which conventional standard electrode positions are illustrated on a picture of the subject in some variations the output is an image of the closest match from the database showing the correctly placed conventional standard electrode positions on a body that is most closely similar to that of the patient.

The picture of the patient can be provided from any appropriate source. In some variations the picture is taken using a computer device with a camera or adapted for use with a camera including the built in camera. Examples of computer devices with cameras include smartphones cell phones laptop computers tablet computers digital cameras and home computers adapted for use with a camera. The control logic controlling the handheld computing device may directly access the camera to take the picture or it may access stored pictures e.g. stored in a memory on the handheld computer and allow the user to select the picture to be used. As mentioned the system may guide the user to take and or select the picture to use including taking the picture with the normalization e.g. sizing marker visible. In general the picture of the patient can be taken by a user or the patient. Examples of users include medical technicians nurses and doctors.

For example the picture of the patient can be previously taken e.g. stored on the computer device and selected for comparison. The picture of the patient can be taken within an application and then selected for comparison. The picture of the patient can be previously taken and stored on a remote server and selected from a remote server for comparison.

The picture of the patient generally includes the region of the patient where the electrodes will be applied. For example when the method devices or systems are for guiding a user to place or correct placement of ECG electrodes the picture can include the chest of the patient. The picture of the patient can include electrodes already placed on the chest. The picture may therefore be taken or selected so that it shows the patient s bare or relatively bare chest. In some cases the patient s chest can be covered by clothing.

As mentioned above the picture of the patient can include a normalizing marker. The marker e.g. sizing marker may have a known size. The marker can be used to normalize or standardize the picture of the patient prior to comparison with the database. For example the marker may allow the picture to be normalized by scaling the picture based on the known size of the marker so that it approximates the size of the body types in the database. Other features may be normalized as well including the brightness contrast focus etc. of the picture using the known properties of the normalizing marker. A picture of a patient having a normalizing marker can be analyzed to normalize the sizing of the picture of the patient to size compare with the representations in the database. Thus normalization or standardization of the picture of the patient can facilitate the comparison of the picture of the patient with the database containing information on predetermined electrode placement positions for a plurality of different body types.

The picture an in some variations the normalized picture of the patient is generally compared to an electrode placement database to determine one or more close matches between the patient picture and the exemplary or body types in the database for whom conventional or standard electrode placement positions are known relative to each exemplary body type. Thus an electrode placement database may include information on predetermined electrode placement positions for a plurality of different body types. The database can include representations for electrode placement for a plurality of different body types. In some variations the representations of body types comprise images bodies including electrodes positioning in a predetermined conventional and or standard position for a particular electrode placement regime. In some variations the representations of body types includes information extracted from an image such as anatomical landmarks for each different body type. Thus the representations of different body types may include characteristic properties of each body type in the database size shape etc. with corresponding electrode placement information for that body. For example distance and direction between the predetermined locations for the electrode placement and anatomical landmarks may form at least part of the database. The representations may be normalized each of the different patients included in the database. For example an electrode placement database may include images of a variety of bodies with the electrodes shown on the body a corresponding image without the electrodes present may also be included . The database can include a variety of different exemplary bodies spanning a variety of different body types weights heights genders sizes ages body mass indexes etc.

In some embodiments the database is stored on a remote server. In some embodiments the database can be stored on system or device e.g. a handheld computer device locally.

As mentioned above the electrode placement database typically includes representations of a plurality of different body types that can be compared against a patient picture or against descriptive information extracted from the patient picture and each body type has a corresponding predetermined conventional and or standard electrode s position for that body type. As used herein a body type refers to an exemplary body which may include characteristic shape size gender position etc. The corresponding predetermined conventional and or standard electrode s position may be verified for that body type by an expert trained in positioning the electrode s for the electrode placement regime of the database. For example an electrode placement database for placing ECG electrodes in a conventional 12 lead ECG pattern may include a number of images of model body types each of which has a verified arrangement of electrodes in the predetermined conventional and or standard electrode s position for a 12 lead ECG. Thus these model body types may correspond to images of subjects having conventionally placed 12 lead ECG electrodes. The placement for each model body type may be confirmed by an expert in placing electrodes in for 12 lead ECG measurement.

A database may include any number of model body types. For example in some variations the database includes more than 100 model body types more than 500 model body types more than 1000 model body types more than 2000 model body types more than 5000 model body types etc. The same subject may provide more than one model body type in the database since different body positions e.g. sitting standing lying down etc. or different angles oblique face on etc. may be taken from the same individual allowing the system to match a patient in a variety of positions and or angles. Each model body type in the database may also be normalized e.g. scaled so that they can be compared more reliably against each other and against patient pictures.

In the electrode placement database includes image of different body types with predetermined conventional or standard electrode positions included in the image. In some variations the database may also or alternatively include body type characteristic information extracted from different body types including different morphologies. For example the database may include anatomical landmark characteristics measurements . This information may be extracted from images such as those shown in . When comparing the patient picture to the database the patient picture may have the same anatomical landmarks extracted for direct comparison with the database.

For example in some embodiments comparing the picture of the patient to the database can include comparing anatomical landmarks on the picture of the patient to anatomical landmarks in the database. As mentioned anatomical landmarks can include the torso size length and configuration of a body region e.g. torso . Anatomical landmarks may include the shoulder width and configuration for example the size and shape of the clavicle. The anatomical landmarks can include the size and configuration of the arms and legs. The anatomical landmarks can include the chest size and width including the sternum sternal notch and rib configuration. The anatomical landmarks can include the size and configuration of the chest and ribs including the first second third fourth and fifth intercostal spaces and the manubriosternal junction also referred to as the Angle of Louis as much as they are detectable from the external anatomy apparent in the picture of the patient. The anatomical landmarks can include areas on the arms legs chest neck etc. Anatomical landmarks may also include the distances between various body regions. In some embodiments the fourth intercostal space can be determining from the manubriosternal junction. The fifth intercostal space mid clavicular line left anterior axillary line and left mid axillary line can also be determined from the picture of the patient. In some embodiments the electrode placement can be determined based on the location of the fourth intercostal space fifth intercostal space mid clavicular line left anterior axillary line and left mid axillary line.

The system or device may then pre process the picture of the patient. Preprocessing may include normalizing the picture . For example if a normalizing marker is use the picture may be scaled using the normalizing marker. Since the size of the normalizing marker is known the system device may analyze the picture to identify the normalizing marker measure the length and adjust the size of the picture using this measured length. The picture may also be cropped to remove any non essential regions and the picture may be adjusted to aid in comparing the picture to the electrode placement database. For example the picture may be contrast enhanced. In some variations pre processing may include extracting features including anatomical landmarks as discussed above.

The picture or characteristic features extracted from the picture may then be compared to the electrode placement database to determine one or more close matches with the body types in the database . For example the picture may be matched against the body types in the database to find the most similar body type or types. The predetermined conventional standard electrode placement from the one or more closest matches may then be used to determine electrode placement for the patient . If there is a single close match the electrode positioning for the closest match may be applied to the patient. For example in variations in which the database includes images of the body types with predetermined conventional standard electrode placement the matching body type image may be aligned with and overlaid onto the patient image in some variations all of the body type image except for the electrode positions may be removed so that the placement of the electrode is shown in an image including the picture of the patient in some variations the normalized version of the picture . This picture may then be output e.g. on a display screen on the handheld computing device .

In some variations multiple close matches from the database may be identified and used to determine conventional standard electrode positions for the patient. For example a weighted combination of the electrode positions e.g. weighted by the similarity to the patient picture may be used to determine the electrode positions on the patient picture.

In some variations comparing the patient picture to the database may be performed by a neural network that is trained in matching patient pictures to the database images. Thus the network may determine which images are most closely matching. Similarly or alternatively pattern recognition may be applied to match the picture of the patient or extracted information from the picture to the database including extracted information of body types.

As mentioned above in some variations the system displays an image of the patient e.g. taken from the picture of the patient showing the conventional standard positioning of the one or more electrodes on the patient . Alternatively or in addition the system may store or upload the image after preparing it .

In some embodiments comparing the picture of the body to the database can be done on a remote server. In some embodiments comparing can be done on the computer device.

Conventional electrode placement for the 12 lead ECG places the electrodes on the left side of the body. In some cases it may be desirable to place the electrodes on the right side of the body. In some embodiments the electrode configuration can be on the right side of the body.

In some embodiments a second picture can be taken after the electrodes are placed on the patient using the image of the patient showing the electrode placement. A picture of the body of the patient with the electrodes placed on the patient can be taken. The picture of the body can be compared to the database to verify the placement of the electrodes. If the electrodes are in the predetermined location then the electrode placement is confirmed. If one or more electrodes are not in the predetermined positions then instructions to correct the electrodes can be determined.
