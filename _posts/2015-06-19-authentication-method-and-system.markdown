The present application is a Division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 537 084 filed Nov. 10 2014 now U.S. Pat. No. 9 064 260 issued Jun. 23 2015 which is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 459 369 filed Apr. 30 2012 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 886 946 issued Nov. 11 2014 which is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 655 625 filed Sep. 4 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 171 567 issued May 1 2012 which claims benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60 408 511 filed Sep. 4 2002 each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to the field of object authentication and counterfeit detection and more particularly to improved hardware devices and methods of use thereof.

The issues of authentication and counterfeit deterrence can be important in many contexts. Bills of currency stock and bond certificates credit cards passports bills of lading as well as many other legal documents e.g. deeds wills etc. all must be reliably authentic to be useful.

It is typically important for an efficient stream of commerce for bills and certificates to be self authenticating that is for a recipient to be able to determine the authenticity of the document without resort to extrinsic information upon presentation. Likewise it also remains useful for additional tools to be available for a forensic analysis of authenticity especially covert features which might be missed by even a skilled counterfeiter.

In the realm of currency anti counterfeiting methods have become quite sophisticated the use of two dimensional authentication mechanisms such as watermarks or special threads incorporated within the paper itself are helpful. However they remain vulnerable to reverse engineering. Once a potential counterfeiter learns how to emulate the anti counterfeiting technology he may use it to his own advantage. Therefore the simple release of anti counterfeiting technology into the world can be an indirect pathway to advance the state of criminal technology.

Several methods have been proposed for increasing the security of paper based certificates. For example randomly placed fibers are difficult to counterfeit so that a coding of location and fiber properties becomes a useful scheme. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 974 150 6 246 061 and 6 035 914 expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. This coding may be provided in an external database for example indexed through a serial number which allows an on line authentication of a bill. The coding may also be cryptographically printed on the bill which may allow self authentication by relying on the cryptographic security. As with all cryptographic schemes once the scheme is broken than is a counterfeiter has available to it the tools to read the information encrypted and or create a new code which appears legitimate the cryptographic scheme no longer serves its purpose.

Therefore it is useful to provide various types or levels of cryptographic authentication to preserve the value of the authentication feature. Advantageously both physical and algorithmic impediments are presented increasing the required skill set of the counterfeiter to achieve a successful counterfeit and also increasing the costs and risks associated with the activity.

A wide variety of attempts have been made to limit the likelihood of counterfeiting. For example some have tried to assure the authenticity of items by putting coded or uncoded markings thereon e.g. an artist s signature on his or her painting . Unfortunately as soon as the code is broken e.g a counterfeiter learns to duplicate a signature this method becomes worthless for authentication purposes. In the context of paper products e.g. currency counterfeiting prevention methods have also used two dimensional authentication mechanisms e.g watermarks or special threads incorporated within the paper used to make the currency. These mechanisms are clearly helpful but they can also be overcome. For example counterfeiters routinely bleach a one dollar bill in such a way that the colored threads which mark the special currency paper are not damaged and then imprint the markings of a one hundred dollar bill thereon. Thus the mere release of physical security materials into the market forms one limitation on their unfettered use.

Other authentication methods have utilized mechanisms that provide three dimensions of data. For example the holograms provided on many credit cards provide more variables i.e. relative to two dimensional threads or watermarks which may be precalibrated and thereafter used to verify the authenticity of an item. Nevertheless since holograms have a pre set or deterministic pattern they may also be duplicated and counterfeit products made. Further since the holograms are invariant they are subject to pilferage before application to goods or translocation from authorized to unauthorized goods in the marketplace. Authentication mechanisms which utilize deterministic patterns are inherently vulnerable to counterfeiting since the counterfeiter in essence has a fixed target to shoot at. High security schemes such as military codes have encryption keys that change frequently. This method however assists prospectively in securing valuable time sensitive information and does not prevent subsequent decryption of a previously transmitted message. At the other end of the spectrum a random element based authentication mechanism would provide an incessantly moving and nonrepeating target that would be practically impossible to undetectably duplicate without knowledge of the encoding scheme.

Finally although existing authentication mechanisms provide adequate protection against counterfeiting in some contexts increasingly powerful tools are available to decode encrypted messages making more secure schemes necessary for long term protection. For example in conjunction with its monitoring and surveillance activities governments routinely seek to break or circumvent encryption codes. The technologies employed are then quickly adopted by the private sector and indeed government regulations seek to maintain weak encryption standards facilitating code breaking. In addition to computers current counterfeiters have access to extremely powerful tools for undermining physical copy protection schemes e.g. color photocopying equipment reverse engineering of semiconductor chips etc. These factors have combined to continually provoke strong demand for new methods and mechanisms for authenticating items especially methods and mechanisms that are less vulnerable to counterfeiting and or employ new copy protection mechanisms.

More recently techniques have evolved for authentication of digital information for example based on cryptological techniques. However these techniques do not serve to verify the authenticity of a particular copy of the information. In fact modern digital content protection schemes do seek to prevent digital copying of content however these rely on secure hardware for storage of the digital content and a breach of hardware security measures results in copyable content with no distinction between an original and a copy thereof.

A number of modern systems implement challenge response authentication which provide enhanced security for encryption keys and encrypted content. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 028 937 Tatebayashi et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 026 167 Aziz U.S. Pat. No. 6 009 171 Ciacelli et al. Content Scrambling System or CSS U.S. Pat. No. 5 991 399 Graunke et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 948 136 Smyers IEEE 1394 1995 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 915 018 Aucsmith expressly incorporated herein by reference and Jim Wright and Jeff Robillard Philsar Semiconductor Adding Security to Portable Designs Portable Design March 2000 pp. 16 20.

The present invention therefore addresses instances where the issue is not merely whether the information is authentic but rather whether the information is authentic and unaltered and the copy itself an original. Obviously known techniques may be used to authenticate the content of a document for example by providing self authenticating digital signatures remote database authentication trusted intermediary techniques and the like. Likewise numerous techniques are available for providing self authenticating features for the physical medium for example security threads inks papers and watermarks printing techniques e.g. intaglio printing microlithography fluorescent inks and or fibers steganographic patterns magnetic and or electrical electronic patterns and the like.

In fact database techniques are known for authenticating objects associated with documents labels or certificates in which the document is both self authenticating and may further reference a remote database with authentication information for the document or associated object. These techniques however are not intended to primarily secure the document itself and thus the techniques fail to particularly address document content security and authentication as well as models for commercial exploitation thereof.

It is known that the color of an object can be represented by three values and that the color may be used for identification and authentication. For example the color of an object can be represented by red green and blue values an intensity value and color difference values by a CIE value or by what are known as tristimulus values or numerous other orthogonal combinations. For most tristimulus systems the three values are orthogonal i.e. any combination of two elements in the set cannot be included in the third element. One such method of quantifying the color of an object is to illuminate an object with broad band white light and measure the intensity of the reflected light after it has been passed through narrow band filters. Typically three filters such as red green and blue are used to provide tristimulus light values representative of the color of the surface. Yet another method is to illuminate an object with three monochromatic light sources or narrow band light sources such as red green and blue one at a time and then measure the intensity of the reflected light with a single light sensor. The three measurements are then converted to a tristimulus value representative of the color of the surface. Such color measurement techniques can be utilized to produce equivalent tristimulus values representative of the color of the surface. Generally it does not matter if a white light source is used with a plurality of color sensors or a continuum in the case of a spectrophotometer or if a plurality of colored light sources are utilized with a single light sensor.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 913 543 and 5 370 763 Curiel expressly incorporated herein by reference relates to a tamper evident and counterfeit resisting document for example a temporary vehicle registration which may be made of paper or paperboard. The document has a zone for inserting information and a pattern within said zone for resisting counterfeiting. A transparent tape which preferably has a silicone resin coating which contains a wax is adhesively secured over information contained within the zone. In other embodiments an alteration resistant article contains variable data and includes an outer film having an upper surface and a lower surface with an adhesive secured to the lower surface. A hologram for receiving at least a portion of the variable data on the upper surface is secured to the outer film lower surface and in one embodiment the hologram has portions which have release properties and portions which have greater adhesive bonding properties than the release containing portions. These respective portions may be established by providing a release material on certain portions of the upper surface of the hologram and providing adhesive enhancing materials on other portions of the hologram upper surface. The hologram may be embossed and have a metallized upper surface. A plurality of relatively small hologram particles may be provided in the outer layer and or the adhesive layer. The hologram is secured to a substrate which in one embodiment has an upper surface printed with pattern means which are printed to a lesser depth than the variable data. In another embodiment the hologram is provided as a unit with the outer film and overlies the variable data. This system therefore provides physical techniques for document authentication and preventing content alteration.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 601 683 Martin Feb. 11 1997 incorporated herein by reference provides a photocopy resistant document having a background pattern or logo which is printed with solvent sensitive dye based ink. The presence of this photocopy resistant background pattern or logo limits copying.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 949 042 Dietz I I et al. Sep. 7 1999 expressly incorporated herein by reference provides a gaming ticket validation system and method. This patent discloses the use of a validating system whereby to deter fraud a validation code is provided which uniquely identifies an article by a combination of a validator machine and a host computer. The validator machine reads the validation code and relays it to the host computer to check for legitimacy proper form and availability and to correlate it to a stored record of indicia. If approved the host computer sends its record of indicia back to the validator machine for display on a monitor. The method is summarized as 1 printing a validation code on an article consisting of a combination of numbers and or symbols which validation code uniquely identifies said article 2 inserting said article into a first validator which reads the validation code and communicates this code to a separate second validator 3 comparing the validation code with second validator to a list of legitimate and available article validation codes stored in a memory of this second validator and determining if the code is valid 4 finding a record in the memory of the second validator which spits out certain necessary information correlating to that code location of sale date of manufacture style etc .

U.S. Pat. No. 5 928 471 Howland et al. Jul. 27 1999 expressly incorporated herein by reference relates to improved security features for paper and in particular to a method of making paper and transparentising selected areas of paper to provide enhanced security features. The invention thus provides a method of making paper comprising the step of depositing fibers onto a support surface to form a porous absorbent sheet applying a transparentising resin to at least portion of said porous sheet and subsequently impregnating the porous sheet with a sizing resin.

The following patents expressly incorporated herein by reference provide enhanced security features for use with finished paper and for non currency and non security papers. EP A2 0203499 discloses a method of applying a pseudo watermark to paper. This method comprises the preparation of a paper containing thermally sensitive material the presence of which renders the translucency of the paper variable by temperature change. When heat is subsequently applied to a part of the surface of the paper a region of the paper becomes semi translucent. U.S. Pat. No. 2 021 141 Boyer November 1935 discloses a method of applying pseudo watermarks to paper by applying a resinous composition to finished paper which permeates the paper and causes it to become more transparent or translucent than the surrounding area. GB A 1489084 describes a method of producing a simulated watermark in a sheet of paper. The sheet is impregnated in the desired watermark pattern with a transparentising composition which when submitted to ultra violet radiation polymerizes to form a simulated watermark. U.S. Pat. No. 5 118 526 Allen et al. Jun. 2 1992 describes a method of producing simulated watermarks by applying heat in the desired watermark pattern onto a thin solid matrix of waxy material placed in contact with a sheet of paper. This results in an impression of a durable translucent watermark. U.S. Pat. No. 4 513 056 Vernois et al. Apr. 23 1985 relates to a process for rendering paper either wholly or partially transparent by impregnation in a special bath of a transparentization resin and subsequent heat cross linking of the resin. EP A1 0388090 describes a method of combining a see through or print through feature with a region of paper which has a substantially uniform transparency which is more transparent than the majority of the remainder of the sheet. JP 61 41397 discloses a method for making paper transparent and a method for its manufacture for see through window envelopes. The method utilises the effect of causing ink cross linked by ultra violet rays to permeate paper thus causing that part of the paper to become transparent.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 946 103 Curry Aug. 31 1999 expressly incorporated herein by reference relates to halftone patterns for trusted printing. Predetermined machine and or human readable information is embedded in at least one serpentine pattern that is printed on each original document so that any given instance of such a document can be later verified or refuted as being the original by determining whether this information can be recovered from the document or not. The method for verifying the originality of printed documents said comprises providing at least one trusted printer for printing original documents embedding predetermined information in each of the original documents in at least one halftone pattern that is composed of halftone cells each of the cells containing a fill pattern which is symmetric about a central axis of the cell with the information being represented by the angular orientations of the respective axis of symmetry of at least some of the cells and classifying the documents as original documents only if said predetermined information can be recovered therefrom. Thus the technique relies on information which can be readily printed but not readily photocopied.

Self clocking glyph codes have been developed for embedding machine readable digital data in images of various descriptions. See for example Bloomberg et al. United States patent application filed May 10 1994 under Ser. No. 08 240 798 for Self Clocking Glyph Codes and U.S. Pat. No. 5 453 605 Hecht et al. Sep. 26 1995 for Global Addressability for Self Clocking Glyph Codes. To integrate these glyph codes into line art images the data typically are embedded in small similarly sized spatially formatted elliptical or slash like marks or glyphs which are slanted to the left or right in generally orthogonal orientations to encode binary zeros 0 s or ones Fs respectively. Customarily these glyphs are written on a spatially periodic two dimensional lattice of centers at a density that enables up to about 500 bytes of data per square inch to be stored on a document. These glyph codes are well suited for incorporating digital data channels into textual and other types of line art images.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 193 853 Wicker Mar. 16 1993 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 018 767 Wicker May 28 1991 incorporated herein by reference provide anticounterfeiting methods wherein a marked image has a minute dot or line pitch which varies from normal scanning resolution of typical copying devices making such mechanical copying detectable.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 315 112 Tow May 24 1994 for Methods and Means for Embedding Machine Readable Digital Data in Halftone Images describes the use of circularly asymmetric halftone dots for incorporating self clocking glyph codes into halftone images and defines a workable approach if the data is confined to the midtone regions of the image in accordance with a known or identifiable spatial formatting rule. High sensitivity however is required to recover the embedded data with acceptable reliability from the darker or lighter regions of the image.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 706 099 Curry Jan. 6 1998 for Method and Apparatus for Generating Serpentine Halftone Images expressly incorporated herein by reference provides circular serpentine halftone cell structures e.g. Truchet tiles for embedding data in images. These serpentine halftone cells have a high degree of rotational tone invariance. The arcuate fill patterns may be rotated 45 degrees with respect to the halftone cell boundaries to produce another rotationally distinguishable pair of halftone structures. These structures have been called Manhattans and also are sometimes referred to as ortho serpentines.

As described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5 696 604 Curry Dec. 9 1997 for Analytic Halftone Dot Construction for a Hyperacuity Printer U.S. Pat. No. 5 410 414 Curry Apr. 25 1995 for Halftoning in a Hyperacuity Printer and U.S. Pat. No. 5 710 636 Curry Jan. 20 1998 for Method and Apparatus for Generating Halftone Images Having Human Readable Patterns Formed Therein which are hereby incorporated by reference halftone patterns may be generated somewhat differently from the traditional way that halftones are generated. The goal is to more precisely control the way the edges of the halftone fill pattern or shape evolves as it grows from highlight to shadow. More particularly in traditional digital halftoning turning on an appropriate number of bits in a threshold array generates the desired tone. The array holds a sequence of threshold values that may spiral outward from a central location as the threshold values ascend. Bits corresponding to those locations in the halftone cell turn on if the incoming data intensity is equal to or greater than the threshold value for that bit location. This method generates halftone dots that grow asymmetrically as one threshold after another is traversed through a range of intensity values from say 0 to 255. For serpentine patterns however it is desired to grow the halftone fill pattern at all positions on its perimeter simultaneously to maintain better control of the shape. Therefore a two step process typically is employed for generating the halftone fill patterns. First an analytical shape function is defined which grows according to a predetermined evolution from the smallest shape for highlight regions through midtones and finally to full coverage of the halftone cell. In this step shape information is maintained with infinite precision with analytic functions. Second as the area of the shape gets larger the fill pattern or shape is rendered as if it were a segment of text or line art with a corresponding shape. The result is more control over the shape and the tone evolution of the halftone because they are defined with analytic functions. Nevertheless it is believed that would be possible to use the traditional thresholding array to generate serpentines given a large enough threshold array.

There are two main goals when analytically defining the shape function. The first is to define functions that can evolve through growth from the smallest shape at intensity value of zero to the largest shape at a value of say 255 in a continuous manner. Any jumps in tone caused by discontinuities in the functions will be readily visible in the halftone images. The second goal is ensure that the functions can be solved for the position and angle of the nearest edge of the shape from any point within the halftone cell at all stages of its evolution with analytic accuracy. This allows the shape which is defined by a hyperbolic shape function to be precisely rendered. The strategy used to create a family of curves is to fix the focal point to a suitable value and then select a x y value along a halftone cell side for each family member.

One of the qualities that causes the tone of serpentine halftone patterns to be substantially invariant to rotation is that there is very little change at the boundary between neighboring halftone cells upon 90 degree rotation. This is achieved by selecting the points of intersection for the curve pair defining the fill patterns or shape to be equidistant from the midpoint of the halftone cell side. Two hyperbolic curves are used to define the serpentine shape and the points at which those curves intersect the periphery of the halftone cell are selected so that these intersections are equally displaced in opposite directions from the midpoint of the cell side. In order to make full use of the analytic precision with which the halftone shape is defined the rendering of the edges of the shape typically is carried out by modulating the laser of a laser printer with a precision that is finer than the size of the scan spot. For instance in the time it takes the spot to sweep out its own diameter up to eight bits of digital information can be provided for modulating it. Likewise inkjet printers may also produce modulated dot patterns.

The serpentines printed in full color with the correct color balance and halftone shapes are extremely difficult to reproduce reprographically. The narrow diagonally extending unfilled areas in halftone cells representing the darker tones are especially difficult to reproduce faithfully because ordinary copying tends to cause near neighboring shapes to blur together thereby degrading if not obliterating the shape information and clues that aid in determining cell direction. Without these distinguishing features the image takes on the form of a waffle pattern and is easily recognized as a forgery. Although typical color copiers are excellent at reproducing the correct tones for high quality images they must supply their own halftone algorithms to do this properly. They usually have their own electronic halftoners embedded in the electronics of the machine and these haftoners typically are optimized for machine dependent tone reproduction curves and implementationally dependent halftone dot shapes. Accordingly it is extremely unlikely that an existing halftone that is not a serpentine can reproduce a serpentine halftone. Another possible method of reproducing serpentine images is to scan them in process the image to determine cell orientation then reproduce the original data file required to print an original . This requires access to a printer that can print serpentines an unlikely prospect for the casual counterfeiter.

Accordingly serpentines are an excellent candidate for trusted printing applications. For this application a trusted printer i.e. a printer controlled by a trusted party such as a service bureau typically is employed for printing original documents that are designed to include one or more serpentine patterns. Predetermined machine and or human readable information is embedded in at least one of the serpentine patterns that is printed on each original document so that any given instance of such a document can be later verified or refuted as being the original instance by attempting to recover this known information from the document in question. This is not an absolute safeguard against counterfeiting but it is a significant hindrance to those who may attempt to pass off xerographic copies or other conveniently produced copies as original documents.

The feature that gives serpentines a large dynamic range also makes them difficult to copy. As the hyperbolas asymptotically approach the limiting diagonal of the halftone cell the small region of white is extremely difficult to copy without loss of contrast. The resulting waffle appearance of the halftone screen conveniently lacks directionality. This makes serpentines a candidate for image authentication and counterfeit deterrence.

Moir effects have been used in prior art for the authentication of documents. For example United Kingdom Pat. No. 1 138 011 Canadian Bank Note Company discloses a method which relates to printing on the original document special elements which when counterfeited by means of halftone reproduction show a moir pattern of high contrast. Similar methods are also applied to the prevention of digital photocopying or digital scanning of documents for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 018 767 Wicker or U.K. Pat. Application No. 2 224 240 A Kenrick Jefferson . In all these cases the presence of moir patterns indicates that the document in question is counterfeit. Another known method provides a moir effect used to make visible an image en coded on the document as described for example in the section Background of U.S. Pat. No. 5 396 559 McGrew Mar. 7 1995 based on the physical presence of that image on the document as a latent image using the technique known as phase modulation . In this technique a uniform line grating or a uniform random screen of dots is printed on the document but within the pre defined borders of the latent image on the document the same line grating or respectively the same random dot screen is printed in a different phase or possibly in a different orientation. For a layman the latent image thus printed on the document is hard to distinguish from its background but when a reference transparency consisting of an identical but unmodulated line grating respectively random dot screen is superposed on the document thereby generating a moir effect the latent image pre designed on the document becomes clearly visible since within its pre defined borders the moir effect appears in a different phase than in the background.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 039 357 Kendrick Mar. 21 2000 expressly incorporated herein by reference relates to security bands to prevent counterfeiting with color copies. A protected security document is provided that foils counterfeiting even if a laser photocopy machine is utilized. The document has at least three discrete half tone printed bands disposed on its surface provided by dots or lines. Each printed band has a different screen density and within each bands the dots or lines comprise a warning word or symbol e.g. Void or a background. The dots or lines of either the Void or background drop out when photocopied while the dots or lines of the other do not. The dots or lines that do not drop out may be dimensioned so that there are about 24 34 per centimeter while for those that do drop out there are about 52 64 per centimeter. The bands are typically arranged either linearly or in concentric circles and interband areas having density gradually transitioning between the densities of adjacent bands are provided. The total density variation between discrete bands is typically about 10 35 depending upon ink color typically about 1.0 10 gradation between adjacent bands. Full tone indicia which does readily reproduce is also printed on the substrate.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 995 638 Amidror et al. Nov. 30 1999 incorporated herein by reference relates to methods and apparatus for authentication of documents by using the intensity profile of moir patterns occurring between superposed dot screens. By using a specially designed basic screen and master screen where at least the basic screen is comprised in the document a z intensity profile of a chosen shape becomes visible in their superposition thereby allowing the authentication of the document. If a microlens array is used as a master screen the document comprising the basic screen may be printed on an opaque reflective support thereby enabling the visualization of the moir intensity profile by reflection. Automatic document authentication is supported by an apparatus comprising a master screen an image acquisition means such as a CCD camera and a comparing processor whose task is to compare the acquired moir intensity profile with a prestored reference image. Depending on the match the document handling device connected to the comparing processor accepts or rejects the document. An important advantage is that the process can be incorporated into the standard document printing process so that it offers high security at the same cost as standard state of the art document production. The system is based on the moir phenomena which are generated between two or more specially designed dot screens at least one of which being printed on the document itself. Each dot screen consists of a lattice of tiny dots and is characterized by three parameters its repetition frequency its orientation and its dot shapes. Dot screens with complex dot shapes may be produced by means of the method disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08 410 767 filed Mar. 27 1995 Ostromoukhov Hersch .

U.S. Pat. No. 6 014 453 Sonoda et al. Jan. 11 2000 expressly incorporated herein by reference relates to a counterfeit detecting method and device to generate counterfeit probability data and apparatus employing same. Counterfeit probability data are generated indicating that a non reproducible document is being processed even when the pattern which identifies such documents has been defaced. One set of rules and membership functions is stored in each of three memory sets for each of 1 an unaltered pattern identifying a non reproducible document 2 an altered version of that pattern and 3 a pattern identifying an ordinary reproducible document. A fuzzy inference unit uses these rules and membership functions to generate data representing the probability that a counterfeiting attempt is occurring. These probability data are transmitted to the copy machine through a control CPU to prevent unlawful copying.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 045 881 6 001 516 5 919 730 5 864 742 5 856 266 5 843 564 and 5 752 152 provide a label or certificate which contains one or more microdots that are embedded in the label or certificate for providing a non visual but machine detectable mark or marks. The detected means for detecting the presence of one or more microdots in the label or certificate inhibits a copy machine from copying the document another embodiment can include the encryption or encoding of signatures into a plurality of microdots for assigning document ownership . Here the original label or certificate is placed on a bed of a scanner to provide a digitized sequence of scanner signals to a digital image processing unit that incorporates a keyboard touch screen and or a mouse for operator interfacing and a monitor for viewing the scanned image. A printer is directly attached to the digital image processing unit or is attached via a communication link. With either configuration the printer forms hard copy prints. An algorithm residing in the digital image processing unit detects the presence of the microdot pattern in the original document and automatically deactivates the printer to abort the document copying process thereby restricting the unauthorized copying of the original document. In other words the microdots are undetectable by the unaided eye but detectable by copying machines associated with software that programs the machine to prevent copying when microdots are detected.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 035 914 Ramsey et al. Mar. 14 2000 expressly incorporated herein by reference for counterfeit resistant materials and a method and apparatus for authenticating materials relates to the use of fluorescent dichroic fibers randomly incorporated within a media to provide an improved method for authentication and counterfeiting protection. The dichroism is provided by an alignment of fluorescent molecules along the length of the fibers. The fluorescent fibers provide an authentication mechanism of varying levels of capability. The authentication signature depends on four parameters the x y position the dichroism and the local environment. The availability of so many non deterministic variables makes counterfeiting difficult. Essentially fibers having a readily detectable non RGB colorspace characteristic e.g. fluorescent dichroism are embedded randomly within a fibrous substrate. Fibers near the surface are readily identified due to their fluorescence. The fibers are then analyzed for dichroism i.e. having a polarization axis. The positions of these dichroic fibers are useful for authenticating the substrate.

The fibers are distributed throughout the media in a random fashion during the production process. Thus the fiber related signature is a random variable rather than a deterministic one. In fact it is not believed that any methods presently exist for copying fiber placement within a substrate. The signature of every item will be different making it more difficult to reverse engineer. For example two dimensional images e.g. in the x y plane of papers incorporating the inventive fluorescent dichroic fibers provide increased security over the prior art blue threads used in currency. A comparison of a white light image and a fluorescence image showing the two dimensional distribution of florescent dichroic fibers provides unique information. Fibers lying at or near the surface of the paper are easily observed by the white light image but are quickly masked below the surface. In a fluorescence image fibers that lie below the surface are also readily observable. A comparison of the two images provides a signature. Furthermore processing of the paper calendaring further alters this image comparison. The pressing process reduces the fluorescence from the surface fibers while not perturbing the subsurface fibers thus depth information is available by comparing the two images.

The fluorescent fibers emission characteristics will also vary depending upon the angular orientation of the fibers within the media relative to a polarized excitation source. For example at a given wavelength the intensity of electro magnetic energy emitted by the fibers may vary considerably depending upon whether the fibers within the media are vertically or horizontally oriented relative to the direction of a linearly polarized excitation source and a parallel polarization analyzer. Hence the dichroic nature of the fibers provides a fourth variable for each point along the fiber i.e. x y z and dichroism emission behavior .

The emission spectrum of each fluorescent dichroic fiber can provide data on the fiber s local environment. For example consider the use of the present invention in paper media or in an aerosol application. The local environment of the fluorescent dichroic fibers cause photon scattering e.g. the orientation and number density of the paper fibers and absorption e.g. varying thickness of the dried carrier vehicle in an aerosol application . This local environment is indirectly observed through the measurement of the fluorescent dichroic fiber s apparent fluorescent anisotropy. This apparent fluorescent anisotropy assumes random values because the process of incorporating the fibers into the media is a random process.

It is not necessary to analyze each variable for authentication varying levels of security may be obtained by selecting one or more feature for analysis. For example at the first level i.e. the lowest authentication lowest cost an item having fluorescent dichroic fibers incorporated therewith may merely be checked to see that the fluorescent fibers are present in the item. The particular fluorescent agent used may be kept secret and dyes which fluoresce in non visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum may be employed so copying this feature may be difficult. At the second level of authentication accuracy an item having fluorescent dichroic fibers may be checked to see that the florescent fibers present in the media have the correct fluorescence anisotropy. This level of authentication exceeds that of the first level because the fluorescence anisotropy is dependent upon the molecular structure of the fluorescent molecule and the specific processing conditions used to prepare the fibers containing the fluorescent molecules. The third level of authentication accuracy involves generating a prerecorded x y pattern of the fluorescent fibers in the item e.g. by logging the particular random pattern of fibers present in a particular credit card when the card is manufactured . When the item is presented for authentication the observed pattern is compared with the prerecorded pattern. Since each item would have a unique pattern detection of a counterfeit would simply involve detection of a duplicate or unmatchable pattern. At the highest level of authentication accuracy the x y apparent fluorescent anisotropy pattern of the fluorescent dichroic fibers in the item would be prerecorded. As in the above case when the item is presented for authentication the observed pattern is compared with the prerecorded pattern. Since the values for the variables in the x y apparent fluorescent anisotropy pattern are random this level of authentication yields an item that is virtually impossible to duplicate. Calculations using the number density of blue and red fibers incorporated into currency paper as a base case indicate that the probability of a random repeat of the x y apparent fluorescent anisotropy pattern is about 1 part in 10 an extremely unlikely event.

The original forms of cryptography involved the use of a single secret key that was used to both encrypt and decrypt the message known as symmetric cryptography . One challenge to this technique is the logistics of communicating the secret key to the intended recipient without other parties gaining knowledge of the key. In 1976 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman introduced the concept of Public Key cryptography asymmetric cryptography . In their system each person is the owner of a mathematically related pair of keys a Public Key intended to be available to anyone who wants it and a Private Key which is kept secret and only known by the owner. Because messages are encrypted with a Public Key and can only be decrypted by the related Private Key the need for the sender and receiver to communicate secret information as is the case in symmetric cryptography is eliminated.

Public Key encryption is based on two mathematically related keys that are generated together. Each key in the pair performs the inverse function of the other so what one key encrypts the other key decrypts and vice versa. Because each key only encrypts or decrypts in a single direction Public Key encryption is also known as asymmetric encryption. Encryption and authentication take place without any sharing of Private Keys each person uses only another s Public Key or their own Private Key. Anyone can send an encrypted message or verify a signed message but only someone in possession of the correct Private Key can decrypt or sign a message.

The two primary uses of Public Key cryptography encryption and digital signatures. Encryption messages are encrypted by using the Public Key of the intended recipient. Therefore in order to encrypt a message the sender must either have or obtain the Public Key from the intended recipient. The recipient of the message decrypts the message by using their Private Key. Because only the recipient has access to the Private Key through password protection or physical security only the recipient can read the message. In order to create a digital signature the sender s computer performs a calculation that involves both the sender s Private Key and the message. The result of the calculation is a digital signature which is then included as an attachment to the original message. The recipient of the message performs a similar calculation that includes the message the digital signature of the sender and the sender s Public Key. Based on the result of the recipient s calculation known as a hash it can be determined whether the signature is authentic or is fraudulent and whether the message had been intercepted and or altered at any point between the sender and the recipient.

In most cryptosystems with some exceptions such as elliptic key encryption the larger the key size the stronger the encryption. While some people could argue that you can never have too strong a level of encryption in the world of cryptography the word overkill can certainly be applicable. With stronger encryption comes greater system complexity and longer processing durations to both encrypt and decrypt.

Presently there are four different grades that refer to the strength of the protection Export grade gives minimal real protection 40 bit for symmetric encryption or 512 for asymmetric . Personal grade 56 or 64 bits symmetric 768 asymmetric is recommended for keys that are not very important such as those that protect one person s personal e mail or those that serve as session keys for low importance transactions. Commercial grade 128 bit symmetric or 1024 asymmetric is recommended for information that is valuable and fairly sensitive such as financial transactions. Military grade 160 bit symmetric or 2048 bit asymmetric is recommended for information that is truly sensitive and must be kept secret at any cost.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 984 366 Priddy Nov. 16 1999 expressly incorporated herein by reference relates to unalterable self verifying articles. Self verifying article creation includes receiving recipient specific data encoding a first selected subset of the recipient specific data and fixing the encoded subset along with other human recognizable data on a surface of an article. Self verifying article authentication includes scanning a surface to locate an encoded first data set decoding the first data set and comparing the decoded first data set with a control data set which may also be fixed upon the surface to determine the authenticity of the received self verifying article. According to one disclosed embodiment enhanced data security can be obtained and maintained by verifying a machine readable data set on an object for acceptability against predetermined criteria which may include searching a data base e.g. an organized comprehensive collection of data stored for use by processing system s of previously issued articles to determine uniqueness. The transmission may be by wired or non wired communication. In order to verify authenticity an encoded data set divided in two on an article to be authenticated is read and processed locally or remotely to first check consistency between the divided parts and to provide biometric authentication information about a presenter or bearer of the object.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 932 119 Kaplan et al. Aug. 3 1999 and WO 97 25177 Shachrai et al. expressly incorporated herein by reference relate to a laser marking system with associated techniques for authenticating a marked workpiece. Images of marked objects are stored and may be authenticated through a database and or through a secure certificate of authenticity including an image of the marked object. According to Kaplan et al. difficult to reproduce characteristics of an object are used as an integrity check for an encoded message associated with the object. These characteristics may be measured or recorded and stored for example within a marking on the object or in a database. Advantageously these measurements and characteristics may be derived from an image of the object captured in conjunction with the marking process. In fact by storing such images and providing a pointer to the image e.g. a serial number the measurements or characteristics to be compared need not be determined in advance. Therefore according to such a scheme the object to be authenticated need only include a pointer to a record of a database containing the data relating to the object to be authenticated. This allows information relating to characteristics of the object which may be difficult to repeatably determine or somewhat subjective to be preserved in conjunction with the object. An image of the object on a certificate of authenticity may be used to verify that the object is authentic while providing a tangible record of the identification of the object. Known secure documents and methods for making secure documents and or markings are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 393 099 D Amato Feb. 28 1995 U.S. Pat. No. 5 380 047 Molee et al.

It is known to provide a number of different types messages for cryptographic authentication. A so called public key private key encryption protocol such as available from RSA Redwood Calif. may be used to label the workpiece with a digital signature . See A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public Key Cryptosystems by R. L. Rivest A. Shamir and L. Adelmann Communications of ACM 21 2 120 126 February 1978 expressly incorporated herein by reference. In this case an encoding party codes the data using an appropriate algorithm with a so called private key. To decode the message one must be in possession of a second code called a public key because it may be distributed to the public and is associated with the encoding party. Upon use of this public key the encrypted message is deciphered and the identity of the encoding party verified. In this scheme the encoding party need not be informed of the verification procedure. Known variations on this scheme allow private communications between parties or escrowed keys to ensure security of the data except under exceptional authentication procedures. See also W.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 065 119 Sandford I I et al. May 16 2000 expressly incorporated herein by reference provides a method of authenticating digital data such as measurements made for medical environmental purposes or forensic purpose and destined for archival storage or transmission through communications channels in which corruption or modification in part is possible. Authenticated digital data contain data metric quantities that can be constructed from the digital data by authorized persons having a digital key. To verify retrieved or received digital data the data metrics constructed from the retrieved or received data are compared with similar data metrics calculated for the retrieved or received digital data. The comparison determines the location and measures the amount of modification or corruption in the retrieved or received digital data.

Methods that hide validation information within the data being authenticated offer an alternative means to validate digital data. Digital watermarks can be added to data by methods falling generally into the field of steganography. Steganographic methods are reviewed by W. Bender D. Gruhl and N. Morimoto in Techniques for Data Hiding Proc. SPIE Storage and Retrieval for Image and Video Databases III 9 10 Feb. 1995 San Jose Calif. This reference also is incorporated herein by reference.

One method of impressing a digital watermark is given by G. Caronni in Assuring Ownership Rights for Digital Images Proc. Reliable IT Systems VIS 95 1995 edited by H. H. Bruggemann and W. Gerhardt Hackl Vieweg Publ. Co. Germany . Another method is given by I. J. Cox J. Kilian T. Leighton and T. Shamoon in Secure Spread Spectrum Watermarking for Multimedia NEC Research Inst. Tech. Report 95 10 1995. These references also are incorporated herein by reference.

Unlike the checksum or digital signature that calculate a measure of the original data digital watermarking techniques modify the data in order to encode a known signature that can be recovered. The presence of the hidden signature in received data verifies that the data are unchanged or its absence reveals that the data were modified from the watermarked form. The method of Cox et al 1995 supra is designed specifically for digital images and it is sufficiently robust to survive even transformations of the digital data to analog form. However all the above methods proposed for digital watermarking generally detect modifications by means of an external signature i.e. no metric that measures the fidelity of the original digital data is used. Consequently there exists no ability to measure in any detail the extent of the changes made or to estimate the precision of the received data. The steganographic watermarking methods differ from the digital signature and checksum methods primarily by being invisible and by using the digital data to convey the watermark thus eliminating the need for an appended value.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 926 551 Dwork et al. Jul. 20 1999 expressly incorporated herein by reference elates to a system and method for certifying content of hard copy documents. The system and method facilitate proof that a specific item such as a document has been sent via a communication medium such as the mail service of the United States Postal Service at a specific time. A bit map image is produced such as by scanning a hard copy document. Preferably the bit map is compressed into a data string and hashed. The hash file is signed by a certifying authority such as the USPS using an existentially unforgeable signature scheme. The original document a code representation of the string and a code representation of the signature are sent via the communication medium. As a result the combination of materials sent provides proof of the authenticity of the content of the document.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 745 574 Muftic Apr. 28 1998 expressly incorporated herein by reference relates to a security infrastructure for electronic transactions. A plurality of certification authorities connected by an open network are interrelated through an authentication and certification system for providing and managing public key certificates. The certification system with its multiple certification and its policies constitute a public key infrastructure facilitating secure and authentic transactions over an unsecure network. Security services for applications and users in the network are facilitated by a set of common certification functions accessible by well defined application programming interface which allows applications to be developed independently of the type of underlying hardware platforms used communication networks and protocols and security technologies.

Typical encryption and document encoding schemes that may be incorporated in whole or in part in the system and method according to the invention to produce secure certificates and or markings are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 422 954 Berson Jun. 6 1995 U.S. Pat. No. 5 337 362 Gormish et al. Aug. 9 1994 U.S. Pat. No. 5 166 978 Quisquater Nov. 24 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 113 445 Wang May 12 1992 U.S. Pat.

In order to provide enduring authentication it may be desired that multiple codes containing different information in different schemes be encoded on the object so that if the security of one code is breached or threatened to be breached another generally more complex code is available for use in authentication. For example a primary code may be provided as an alphanumeric string of 14 digits. In addition a linear bar code may be inscribed with 128 512 symbols. A further 2 D array of points may be inscribed e.g. as a pattern superimposed on the alphanumeric string by slight modifications of the placement of ablation centers double ablations laser power modulation and other subtle schemes which have potential to encode up to about 1k 4k symbols or higher using multi valued modulation. Each of these increasingly complex codes is in turn more difficult to read and decipher.

As is known from U.S. Pat. No. 5 932 119 Kaplan et al. Aug. 3 1999 intrinsic imperfections or perturbations in the marking process may be exploited for authentication. Thus a pattern may be provided which can be analyzed but for which techniques for copying are generally unavailable. Thus a marking pattern even applied using standard means may provide an opportunity for counterfeit resistant feature identification.

In like manner intentional or pseudorandom irregularities seemingly random but carrying information in a data pattern may be imposed on the marking in order to encode additional information on top of a normally defined marking pattern. Such irregularities in the marking process may include intensity modulation fine changes in marking position and varying degrees of overlap of marked locations. Without knowledge of the encoding pattern the positional irregularities will appear as random jitter and the intensity irregularities will appear random. Because a pseudorandom pattern is superimposed on a random noise pattern it may be desirable to differentially encode the pseudorandom noise with respect to an actual encoding position or intensity of previously formed markings with forward and or backward error correcting codes. Thus by using feedback of the actual marking pattern rather than the theoretical pattern the amplitude of the pseudorandom signal may be reduced closer to the actual noise amplitude while allowing reliable information retrieval. By reducing the pseudorandom signal levels and modulating the pseudorandom signal on the actual noise it becomes more difficult to duplicate the markings and more difficult to detect the code without a priori knowledge of the encoding scheme.

A number of authentication schemes may be simultaneously available. Preferably different information is encoded by each method with the more rudimentary information encoded in the less complex encoding schemes. Complex information may include spectrophotometric data and image information. Thus based on the presumption that deciphering of more complex codes will generally be required at later time periods equipment for verifying the information may be made available only as necessary.

Known techniques for using ID numbers and or encryption techniques to preventing counterfeiting of secure certificates or markings are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 367 148 Storch et al. Nov. 22 1994 U.S. Pat. No. 5 283 422 Storch et al. Feb. 1 1994 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 814 589 Storch et al. Mar. 21 1989 expressly incorporated herein by reference.

In addition to being analyzed for information content i.e. the markings the object image may also be compared with an image stored in a database. Therefore based on a presumptive identification of an object an image record in a database is retrieved. The image of the presumptive object is then compared with the stored image and any differences then analyzed for significance. These differences may be analyzed manually or automatically. Where a serial number or other code appears this is used to retrieve a database record corresponding to the object that was properly inscribed with the serial number or code. Where the code corresponds to characteristics of the object and markings more than one record may be retrieved for possible matching with the unauthenticated object. In this case the information in the database records should unambiguously authenticate or fail to authenticate the object.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 974 150 Kaish et al. Oct. 26 1999 expressly incorporated herein by reference relates to a system and method for authentication of goods. An authentication system is provided based on use of a medium having a plurality of elements the elements being distinctive detectable and disposed in an irregular pattern or having an intrinsic irregularity. Each element is characterized by a determinable attribute distinct from a two dimensional coordinate representation of simple optical absorption or simple optical reflection intensity. An attribute and position of the plurality of elements with respect to a positional reference is detected. A processor generates an encrypted message including at least a portion of the attribute and position of the plurality of elements. The encrypted message is recorded in physical association with the medium. The elements are preferably dichroic fibers and the attribute is preferably a polarization or dichroic axis which may vary over the length of a fiber. An authentication of the medium based on the encrypted message may be authenticated with a statistical tolerance based on a vector mapping of the elements of the medium without requiring a complete image of the medium and elements to be recorded.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 592 561 Moore Jan. 7 1997 incorporated herein by reference suggests a system that provides an authenticating tracking anti diversion and anti counterfeiting system that can track various goods. The system includes a control computer a host computer a marking system and a field reader system which are all compatible and can be physically linked via data transmission links. An identifiable and unique mark is placed on each good or on materials out of which the goods are to be made which enables subsequent inspection. The marks or patterns include areas where a marking agent is applied in an encrypted pattern and areas where it is not applied. The pattern can be scanned or captured by a reader and deciphered into encoded data. The entry can then either be compared directly to a set of authentic entries on a database or decoded and compared to a set of data on the centrally located host database. The marking system provides control over imprinting allowing a limited number of authorized codes to be printed before reauthorization is required. In order to provide marking validation a camera captures images of imprints. After imprinting of the encoded marking an image of the marking is obtained and centrally authenticated as a valid code which may be stored in a database along with stored pertinent information pertaining to this specific product. Monitoring of the marked goods is facilitated by including a unique encrypted pattern having for example a unique owner identifier a unique manufacturer identifier a unique plant identifier a unique destination identifier and time and date information.

Thus there remains a need for a system and method for systems and methods for authenticating goods including portable authentication devices. Heretofore such systems have had various shortcomings.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 005 960 herein incorporated by reference provides an anti counterfeiting system wherein a system and method of marking goods for authentication and tracking purposes is described. A central control unit enables the system by providing an allotment of goods to a host unit. The host unit directs marking terminals to mark particular goods with specific information coding symbols. Goods are either marked directly or are identified by means of affixed features which are marked with encoding symbols either prior to or subsequent to affixing to the goods. Following marking goods of fixtures are scanned to ensure proper marking and then packaged for shipment and or they can be checked by illuminating the symbols marked thereon and cross referencing this data with the host database by using a field reading unit.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 397 142 herein incorporated by reference describes coded threads and sheet materials for making such threads useful in counterfeit inhibiting garments. The sheet material comprises transparent microspheres a specularly reflective layer underlying the microspheres and a polymeric layer underlying the specularly reflective layer and containing particulate matter which may be varied from sheet material to sheet material to encode information and allow identification of the sheet material. The sheet material is split in narrow widths and incorporated into threads.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 527 383 herein incorporated by reference describes a thread which comprises a polymeric material onto which has been fixed a symbol or repeating multiple symbols which are detectable and readable under magnification. When incorporated into garments or garment labels this thread is useful in identifying the true manufacturer of the goods and the absence of such threads would help in the detection of counterfeit goods.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 956 409 discloses a method and system for the secure application of seals. An optical image of a seal is recorded by a computer and encrypted using a key for encryption generated in response to template biometric data from the authorized persons. When a person seeks to use the seal for example to apply the seal to a document or label test biometric data is input from that person and used to generate a key for decryption. If the test biometric data matches the template biometric data the key for decryption will be useful for decrypting the encrypted seal and the person seeking access to the seal. The test biometric data represents a handwritten signature given contemporaneously by the person seeking access and is verified against a set of template signatures earlier given by at least one authorized person. Specific signature features are determined in response to the template signatures and used for generating one or more keys for encrypting the seal. Similarly specific signature features are determined in response to the test signature and used for generating keys for decrypting the seal. Features are embedded in the optical image of the seal or in the printed seal in the event that the document or label is physically printed which demonstrate to a person examining the document that the seal is genuine. These features include micro embedding of biometric data or specific features determined in response thereto or even the embedding of dichroic fibers in or patterns thereon.

There remains a need however for improved authentication systems and methods providing both logical algorithmic security as well as physical impediments to counterfeiting.

The present invention provides in a first embodiment an encoded watermark which includes self authentication information. That is a physical process is applied to the paper stock which alters its properties typically including an optical property. This physical process typically requires special equipment and is irreversible in the sense that it would be quite difficult to change the coded watermark on an already engraved and printed certificate or bill. The coding is preferably cryptographically secure and thus creating or forging the coding requires further information. The watermark preferably encodes a characteristic of the stock which is random and difficult to copy such as a fiber pattern.

Typically a watermark is impressed on a web of paper in a later stage of processing before it is dried. At this time the reading of the location and orientation of bulk cellulose fiber patterns while the web is being processed and before it is calendared would be quite difficult. On the other hand it would be possible to read the location and orientation of relatively low density optically contrasting fibers such as dyed nylon threads as the web is moving at high speeds.

Thus according to one aspect of the invention the web is scanned for the location of randomly distributed and optically apparent features which are relatively fixed in location and orientation while still being manufactured. This information is then used to establish a dynamically reconfigurable watermark pattern for example using a set of binary ternary or quarternary displaceable pins in a one or two dimensional pattern in an area of the web near the features which are being encoded. In this way the watermark becomes a coded self authentication feature for the stock. If the code is cryptographically secure then a counterfeiter would have to both be able to reproduce the paper making conditions to provide a suitable watermark and have the algorithm for generating the proper code.

Alternately a different type of watermark may be used. For example a reactive cross linking agent could be used to selectively change the chemical nature of the cellulose regionally to form a printer code. Likewise a polymerizable material may be applied and cured to form a permanent pattern. While these processes themselves are not highly counterfeit resistant the marking may be cryptographically encoded and irreversibly applied.

It is also noted that in stocks which have security threads such as the metallized polyester film used in new U.S. currency the stock itself is formed of two laminated sheets. This in turn theoretically allows a process to be applied to the interface between the sheets. Since currency stock is highly controlled and itself difficult to reproduce a coded marking formed in this spaced would also have security attributes beyond an analogous marking formed on the external surface of the stock.

According to an aspect of the invention for each piece of monetary currency identification document other document or other physical article an identifier is created comprising encrypted and or graphic information where the identifier can be read or determined by a manual or automatic process at each of its occurrences. Preferably the identifier is physically and or algorithmically self authenticating meaning that the marking associated with the object would after careful inspection normally be expected to come only from an authorized source. The information in the identifier may be logically associated with some property or properties of some zone of or the entire substrate being identified which may be homogeneous and or heterogeneous in its composition. With respect to paper currency in particular the preferred features to be encoded are optically readable and randomly determined by a stochastic physical process have a relatively low density in the whole are relatively stable over time in their optical properties position and orientation and themselves comprise an authentication feature i.e. are themselves not readily duplicated to form a counterfeit. The identifier preferably is cryptographically encoded for example using a hash such as the known MD5 and SHA 1 algorithms or a public key infrastructure PKI scheme such as available from RSA. Clearly strong encryption may be used to provide enhanced security.

It is noted that while the preferred physical authentication feature is an optically scannable low density fiber pattern other features may be encoded. For example high density patterns such as a relation ship of cellulose fibers in a small region an optical reflection pattern of dichroic flecks in printed portions of the bill a polymer fiber pattern which may be clear or invisibly dyed or other pattern may be employed. It is most useful when the feature itself is difficult or essentially impossible to copy and the original production of an identifier requires information unavailable to the counterfeiter such as an encryption key. Further preferred is that the identifier itself is provided on the substrate in a manner which is difficult to replicate or originally produce.

Preferably the authentication scheme according to the present invention supports both manual inspection and automated authentication. Thus features comprising the identification are preferably machine readable and more preferably optically scannable. One set of embodiments of the invention permit standard optical raster scanning of the features to be authenticated and the authentication code while other set of embodiments require further information beyond a chroma luminance map of the object. For example dichroic patterns fluorescence spectral absorption transmittance or reflection patterns or the like may be material.

A separate aspect of the invention provides increased security for currency. It is well known that currency typically circulates a number of times before being retired. That is it is transferred between a number of persons or businesses. Often the bills circulate through banks and may include central banks.

In banks and central banks an environment exists wherein currency is machine counted and analyzed at least in a simple manner to detect worn bills and possibly counterfeits. This process step provides a particular opportunity to provide more sophisticated analysis of the bills and further to update information recorded on the bill. For example this information may include an updated authentication profile tracking history and the like. This allows an investigator to review detailed information the bill off line and without requiring real time access to a centralized database of such information. Likewise such a system allows circulating bills to be updated and therefore permits replacement of insufficiently secure authentication information and correction for degradation wear and distortion of the currency.

A further aspect of the invention provides a system and method for imposing or imprinting a marking on an embedded strip within a paper sheet. For example US currency includes a narrow metallized polyester film ribbon which has a metallization pattern which conveys the currency denomination. This film may be additionally encoded with various patterns for example by laser electrical or thermal ablation photonic substrate modification or the like. For example in like manner to the embodiments set forth above an encoded message may be provided on the polyester film which may be read using optical or other means. Since the polyester ribbon is dimensionally and environmentally stable the marking may be microscopic and reliably read without a high degree of redundancy or a substantial overhead of error correcting codes which may be required for markings which are subject to wear distortion or partial obliteration.

Preferably the currency is scanned using a suitable scanner to determine a unique characteristic such as a low density fiber pattern. The pattern is then cryptographically processed and turned into a binary code. A laser is then controlled to mark the polyester film with the binary data representing the cryptographic authentication code.

On order to authenticate the bill the stock is scanned which preferably also acquires the laser marking pattern on the polyester ribbon. If the security feature for example a dichroic fiber then the scanner also analyzes the polarization patterns to detect the dichroism. Likewise other feature specific attributes may also he measured for authentication. The encoded information is then analyzed using an appropriate algorithm to ensure that the encoded message corresponds to within a desired degree of certainty and allowing for limitations on the precision of measurement and likely variations in the currency stock over time to the security features determined to be actually present. If the self authentication scheme does not verify the bill a further analysis may be performed out of the ordinary processing stream. On the other hand normally verified bills may be processed with high throughput.

As noted above an annotation may also be printed on the bill for example a two dimensional code using infrared fluorescent ink in an unprinted margin of the bill. In this case the scanner determines the content and location of any prior markings which may then also be analyzed and the printer places a new marking in a next available location. Bills for which there remains no available marking locations may be retired remain unchanged or subject to a different parking scheme. It may also be possible to bleach off relatively old markings to make room for new markings. Using a 150 dpi marking scheme in a quarter inch margin approximately 500 bits per inch raw data may be recorded. If 250 bits are required for each marking and the margin is six inches long a total of 12 markings are possible. If however an incremental marking update requires only 64 bits then many more increments may be permitted.

For example the initial marking includes an encoding of all or a selected portion of the randomly disposed security feature s . If the encoding is a subset then the encoding also defines the subset or permits authentication based on a full bill scan. The encoding also preferably includes the bill serial number to ensure correspondence with the printer serial number. Other information such as the identification of the particular scanner or a production lot may also be included. The data is then encrypted using a hash or PKI scheme or other cryptographic scheme and error correction and detection codes included. Preferably an ink jet printer with a permanent ink is used to apply the marking. The ink is preferably an infrared fluorescent dye so that the marking is mostly invisible to the naked eye.

A support means is provided for a dynamically reconfigurable watermark for example a paper calendering roller in the case of a paper substrate or a flat press whereby rigid members such as metal pins are supported in a geometric array such as a 16 16 or other square a hexagonal tiled array and or in a pictorial pattern or as part of same and or as part of a steganographic design.

The web entering the roller is scanned optically using a bar scanner or set of bar scanners 3 8 color one pass 600 dpi to determine a random pattern of security features in the web.

A processor then processes the image to extract the security features and encodes them into a pattern suitable for controlling the dynamically reconfigurable watermark. This pattern may also include a serial number pattern. The scanned pattern or processed representation thereof and or watermark may also be stored in a database indexed to the stock which for example may already have a serialization pattern established.

An actuation means whereby said rigid members are individually motivated by command toward the substrate to be marked such as paper of cellulose and or other polymeric materials. Example of such actuation means may be solenoids pushing or pulling the pins magnetic fields pulling the pins from the opposite side of the substrate to be marked or pneumatic actuactors and or mechanical actuators such as by gears and pins for example in analogy to striking a plano string and or the pneumatic mechanism of a player plano . The patter may be binary actuation or a higher order encoding. In the case of higher order encoding the algorithm preferably takes into consideration a neighboring element analysis to enhance reading reliability and correct for intersymbol interference the interrelation of a status of one data symbol with the read value of another data symbol.

An interface is provided to control actuation of the rigid members. This may be a computer interfaced actuation controller an intermediate mechanical programmer which is itself logically interfaced or direct keyboard or human graphic user interface logical input or by some other software designed to record by way of watermark some optical magnetic electronic conductive resistive capacitive chemical and or some physical property or properties of the substrate and or some other information selected for identification and or authentication and or tracking or said substrate.

As stated above this characteristic is preferably subject to random variations and is difficult to copy this making it useful as a security feature and making the marking useful for self authentication.

It is also possible for the rigid members to apply heat and or light in addition to or separately from pressure to the substrate. The heat or light may for example modify or cure components of the object to be watermarked. Likewise a post process may be employed to prevent modification or unintended degradation of the watermark after implementation.

The watermark may also be a chemical or spectroscopically or optically detectable pattern generated by pressure sensitive components within or upon the substrate such as by microspheres containing ink visually or not visually detectable. Thus the watermark need not be a true watermark imposed on the stock prior to or during the final calendaring step and may be provided separately from the papermaking process itself.

The watermark may also be a chemical or spectroscopically or optically detectable pattern generated by heat sensitive components within or upon the substrate.

Likewise an optically induced watermark may be provided wherein the pattern is produced by photochemical interaction with laser generated or other light and the substrate is optionally subsequently de photoactivated i.e. fixed .

A Process for Self Authenticating or Tracking Circulated Documents Where Physical and or Chemical Properties of a Given Document Can Change.

The preferred system according to this embodiment comprises means for measuring and recording properties of a given document e.g. currency bill upon the document. Thus self authentication schemes are supported.

A processor capable of encrypting the properties is employed which may be a general purpose processor or special cryptoprocessor.

A printer is provided for over printing machine readable or other information upon the document by use of visible or invisible inks electrically conductive or insulating chemicals inks or magnetic ink. The form of the information could be a digital array e.g. data matrix bar code picture or a set of alphanumeric symbols. Readability can be caused by optical contrasts magnetic or electrically capacitive contrasts as a result of the overprinting comprising a pattern in logical association with said document properties.

The reader detects the physical parameters of the information fields based upon utilized fields of standardized geometry or based upon information within or in association with said fields. The reader can be an optical electrical or magnetic array sensor or imager.

A registration device may be used to advance the document within the printer or the printing head within the printer such that after an authentication of the document new information can be printed upon said document in a sequentially defined area within an assigned printing zone for example the border of a currency bill in a manner to produce one or more printed fields each time the document is authenticated. The reader reads the imprinting and therefore also defines a sequential unmarked region in which a subsequent marking is placed.

Preferably a feature of the bill includes dichroic fibers which have an anisotropic optical property. The polarization axis of the fibers is generally aligned with the long axis of the fibers and thus it is relatively easy to distinguish a true dichroic fiber from a printed indicia by analyzing light polarization properties of a fluorescent emission. During an initial encoding all fibers may be presumed to be dichroic unless the absence of dichroism of a fiber is itself a security feature so during initial production this step may be dispensed with. On the other hand field authentication preferably verifies dichroicity of the fibers to guard against simple chroma luminance copying e.g. color xerography of an authentic bill.

An encryption system may be employed to provide and encode updated authentication information optionally together with additional information which is then printed on the bill in a sequential unmarked region.

For verification a scanner reads the encoded information as well as the security features and confirms correspondence. The updated code may also describe changes in the bill such as loss of certain surface fibers dirt fingerprints chemical residue or the like which may be useful for tracking the bill and subsequent authentications.

A centralized database may also store a copy of the scan or information derived therefrom the set of markings on the bill and other information. Preferably any such centralized database is not required for normal authentications and is used interactively only in exceptional cases. On the other hand batch processing using the centralized database may be useful to detect trends and significant threats to the currency supply such as by super counterfeits .

A polymer ribbon is incorporated into currency stock in known manner in addition to the existing polyester ribbon. This ribbon is specially adapted to be reliably written to with information after it is within the bill of currency to add information logially associated with some property of the individual piece. This ribbon may incorporate writable optical disk technology holographic storage technology or respond to optical thermal magnetic or electrical energy to record a pattern.

The ribbon or thread can for example be composed of a material subject to a fixable change in optical or electrical properties by sandwiching the bill between an appropriate electrode nanoelectrode array. For example a fixable or non fixable photosensitivity to a specific combination of photons could be employed e.g. dual photon capture. Further a chemical could be released in an appropriate pattern by some combination of these processes or by heat and or pressure that can bring about a machine readable patterned change in properties of the thread. Thus the chemical composition of the ribbon or thread may be itself a security feature.

The above discussed techniques may be advantageously combined alone or in combination with other techniques as described in further detail below 

A first preferred embodiment of the invention employs dichroic fibers as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 035 914 Ramsey et al. Mar. 14 2000 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 974 150 Kaish et al. Oct. 26 1999 . These fibers have properties that are readily distinguished from most types of imprinted patterns and further may be dispersed in a non deterministic manner on a substrate. Thus fiber pattern in a substrate may be used as a basis for authentication.

A second preferred embodiment employs one or more proprietary dyes which are withheld from public availability. These dyes may be selected having desired distinctive optical properties which are readily detectable. Therefore by detecting the spectrographic properties of the dye the object on which the dye is deposited may be authenticated.

The techniques according to the present invention are not limited to the preferred embodiments and therefore various known security features and techniques may be employed to provide a secure authentication system.

The present invention also provides authentication apparatus for verifying authenticity of media according to the present invention.

In the case of a dichroic fiber the authentication system provides an optical system that reads an optical image of the fibers while a polarization property of incident light is varied. The light from the fibers is then analyzed to verify that the pattern results from fibers having dichroic properties. The pattern of the fibers is then compared with a pattern determine during a pre authentication step which may be stored in an encrypted message imprinted on the media or stored remotely and recalled during an on line authentication procedure.

In order to provide improved authentication and avoidance of counterfeiting the present invention utilizes fluorescent dichroic indicators. Materials that are dichroic may have different absorption coefficients for light i.e. electromagnetic energy typically ranging from infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths polarized in different directions. When the energy of the incident photon polarization corresponds to the absorption transition of the molecule the interaction between the absorbing dipole and the incident photon is largest and high absorption of incident photons is observed. This energy is for example re emitted by a fluorescent molecule with the plane of polarization of the emitted photons aligned with the emitting dipole of the fluorescent molecule. Most molecules have the absorbing and emitting dipole approximately collinear. When the polarization of the exciting light is collinear with the absorption dipole the fluorescent emission will be highest. Light polarized normal to the absorbing dipole on the other hand is not absorbed to a great extent hence the resulting emitted intensity from this absorption is low. Where the light source is not polarized the dichroism of each fiber will result in respective polarized reflection transmission and emission.

According to a preferred embodiment an authentication indicator comprises a dichroic material. Preferably the dichroic material will exhibit a high degree of dichroism. It is not important however in what form the dichroic materials are introduced into the media being authenticated. For example there may be situation where authentication is facilitated by using dichroic indicators in the form of ribbons rectangles pyramids spheres etc. As long as the indicator s dichroism is reasonably preserved during formation of the article i.e. incorporation of the dichroic indicators with the article the shape form of the dichroic indicator is not important. A preferred form for the dichroic indicator is a fiber. Fibers may advantageously be used to incorporate the desired dichroic behavior into the article since fibers may be incorporated within many processes without detriment to the process e.g. paper making weaving sewing or dichroic fiber. The fibers may have widely varying cross sections and lengths. Essentially the only requirement is that the configuration of the fiber not disrupt the underlying manufacturing process e.g. with aerosol applications the fibers must be sufficiently small to be sprayed . Where otherwise feasible the dichroic fibers are somewhat elongated since elongated fibers are easier to identify within a matrix of material and can potentially provide more data that shorter fibers e.g. since different points along the length of a long fiber may be more or less obscured by paper fibers be closer to or further from the paper surface etc. and hence exhibit more or less dichroism . Finally in some circumstances it may be possible to use fibers of uniform lengths to provide easily verifiable data points i.e. when inquiring whether a marked article is authentic one can quickly see if fibers of appropriate lengths are present. Synthetic polymer materials are preferred for the fiber material e.g. Nylon 6 6. A wide variety of acceptable indicator materials are available at very low cost. For example polyesters polyamides poly amide imides and poly ester imides can be made birefringent. Examples of polymers used in preparing the stretched films having a positive intrinsic birefringence include polycarbonates polyarylates polyethylene terephthalate polyether sulfone polyphenylene sulfide polyphenylene oxide polyallyl sulfone polyamide imides polyimides polyolefins polyvinyl chloride cellulose and polyarylates and polyesters. Examples of negative intrinsic birefringence stretched films include styrene polymers acrylic ester polymers methacrylic ester polymers acrylonitrile polymers and methacrylonitrile polymers.

Suitable dyes where necessary or desired include naphthalimides coumarins xanthenes thioxanthines naphtholactones azlactones methines oxazines and thiazines. Rhodols Rhodamines See U.S. Pat. No. 5 227 487 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 442 045 fluoresceins and flavines are preferred for visible fluorescence. In using dyes it should be apparent that instead of employing a single dye or modulating the content of a single dye a plurality of distinct dyes may be added to the fiber matrix potentially providing distinct and relatively orthogonal coding schemes. For example Molecular Probes Alexa dye series includes five fluorescent dyes typically used to prepare bioconjugates. The absorption spectra of these five spectrally distinct sulfonated rhodamine derivatives Alexa 488 Alexa 532 Alexa 546 Alexa 568 and Alexa 594 dyes match the principal output wavelengths of common excitation sources thus allowing multicolor coding. Of course various other dyes or compatible sets of dyes may be employed.

Fluorescent resonant energy transfer FRET techniques may also be used to label fibers and detect labeling. It is noted that dichroism is not necessary especially where a complex optical effect such as fluorescence or FRET is present. Again by combining techniques more efficient coding and greater difficulty in counterfeiting fibers is provided.

The dichroic agent can be brought into association with the indicator in a variety of ways. In order to maximize the dichroism the dichroic agents e.g. molecules of dye are aligned maximally non dichroism is achieved by a random distribution of dye molecules. Typically the dye alignment is achieved by a stretching of the polymer matrix during manufacture which alters an anisotropy and alignment of polymer chains. The dye is interspersed or linked to the chains and thus is aligned simultaneously. If the fiber is selectively stretched or selectively annealed after stretching spatial variations in dichroism will be apparent. The dye may also be bleached e.g. photobleached in a secondary process. Since many dyes have a narrow band absorption such dyes may be selectively bleached allowing independent control over spatial dye concentration. Heating or other annealing processes are typically not selective and alter the crystalline structure of the entire portion of the fiber. Such selective heating is possible for example with infrared laser diodes or even infrared LEDs.

Preferably when simple fibers are used as the indicator the dichroic marking material is aligned along the length of the fiber. In this way the fibers will have very different emission spectra i.e. with respect to intensity when excited with light polarized parallel versus perpendicular to the fiber axis assuming the absorption dipole is along the fiber axis. In general the absorption dipole of the fluorescent marking molecule will not be perfectly aligned with the fiber axis. This is permissible but it is preferred that the absorption dipole is nearly parallel or orthogonal to the fiber axis.

Where more complex fibers are employed preferably the transitions involve polarization rotation between extremes. For example the fibers may be squished along 90 degree displaced axes along its length. Other techniques may be used to selectively orient the molecules in the fiber for example using magneto optic recording techniques.

The marking material e.g. a fluorescent dye may be associated with the indicator material e.g. fibers during formation i.e. the marking material may be incorporated within the indicator itself or the marking material may be added to the indicator after formation of the indicator. For example when fibers are used as the indicators and luminescent dye is used as the marking material a preferred method of assuring maximal dichroism i.e. maximum coalignment of dye molecules is to melt blend the fibers and dye and then stretch the fiber. With other fiber marking dye combinations it may be possible to achieve satisfactory dichroism without a stretching step e.g. by dipping the fiber in a container of dye.

The preferred dyes in the present invention are luminescent i.e. fluorescent or phosphorescent . More preferably fluorescent dyes are utilized as the marking material. Phosphorescent marking materials may also be used however. The appropriate dye for use in a particular application will depend upon the specifics of the situation. In general most preferably a fluorescent dye is selected so that the dye s dichroism is maximized at the intended detector wavelength. The marking dye may be tailored to quite specific applications. For example a dye that emits in the infrared portion of the spectrum may be used to create an authentication signature that is invisible to the eye yet easily detected with appropriate instrumentation.

The fluorescence signal is preferably provided by a fluorescent dye or pigment doped into the fiber polymer matrix having a long major axis to align with the polymer chains of the fiber during the drawing process. Known dyes may be used for example organic fluorescent dyes that have absorption and emission in the infrared to near ultraviolet range. These dyes are also known for a variety of other uses such as fluorescence microscopy chemical detection and tagging physical photon capture applications and the like. A fluorescent dye or pigment must also be sufficiently stable thermally to withstand the fiber production process as well as uncontrolled environmental exposure. The required preferred concentrations of dye track those utilized in fiber technology generally i.e. no special processing is required to combine the indicator and marking materials except for perhaps an added process step to coalign the dye molecules within along the indicator fibers as discussed above.

To duplicate labels containing the fluorescent dichroic fibers a counterfeiter would need to among other things duplicate the fluorescent dye used to produce the same emission behavior at the selected detector wavelength use fibers of the same general length and shape and produce counterfeit label stock having the same general number of fibers per a given area of paper. Any attempt to counterfeit the fiber containing label through a printing based process would fail since printing would not reproduce the fibers dichroism and even the fluorescence would be difficult to achieve.

Thus at higher levels of authentication the pattern of the fluorescent dichroic fibers is detected and archived during initial processing thereof i.e. before the label is circulated . When a particular label is submitted for examination a detector can be used to ascertain the fibers position within the paper as well as its dichroism e.g. polarization angle .theta.. A three dimensional i.e. x y .theta. authentication mechanism can therefore easily be provided by using an imaging device such as a CCD imaging array with associated polarizer s . This CCD imaging array may be an area array or line scan array the latter requiring a separate scanning system. The polarimeter may include fixed or rotating variable polarizers.

At a highest level of security and authentication the marked label is measured before it is circulated to record the path x y .theta..sub..lambda.x y polarization angle at wavelength .lambda. at a position x y A.sub..lambda.x y specific absorption at wavelength.lambda. at a position x y physical disposition of the fibers within the media e.g. label . It would be very difficult to duplicate these parameters. This data or a subset thereof is formulated as a plain text message and encrypted into cipher text by an encryption algorithm such as the triple 56 bit DES encryption algorithm or the RSA public key private key algorithm. In the former case the authentication requires a secure and trusted party which holds a symmetric key. In the latter case the public key is published and may be used to decrypt the message to determine if it corresponds to the label characteristics.

The scanned pattern on the certificate is captured as a set of pixels and represented internally in the image processor as an image projected on a surface with the surface not necessary being constrained as a planar sheet. This processor may provide a raster to vector conversion process. The printed code is also imaged and captured by the processor for example by optical character recognition bar code recognition pattern recognition magnetically ink coded recording MICR reader or other known means. The projected image is then compared with the ideal image represented by the code printed on the certificate. A stochastic analysis is performed of the types and magnitudes of any deviations as well as correlations of deviations from the ideal. The deviation pattern as well as any other deviations from the encoded patterns which for example represent lost or obscured fibers noise environmental contamination with interfering substances errors or interference in the original encoding process etc. are then used to determine a likelihood that the certificate itself corresponds to the originally encoded certificate. Thus the determined authenticity is associated with a reliability thereof based on stochastic variations in the properties of the authentication certificate and stochastic variations in the generation of the associated secure code. A threshold may then be applied to define an acceptable error rate false positive and false negative in the authentication process. The reliability of the authentication or a go no go indication is then output.

In order to avoid the requirement for encrypting an entire or substantial portion of a representation of an image of the certificate the medium may be subdivided into a plurality of regions each region associated with a vector which for example is two dimensional or of higher dimensionality. The vector which represents an irreversible compression of data derived from the region is then encoded and encrypted in the encrypted message. For verification the vector mapping is decrypted and unencoded from the recorded message. The medium is then scanned and an analogous vector mapping derived from the newly scanned image. The recorded vector map is compared with the measured vector map allowing a correlation to be determined. In this case given the large number of degrees of freedom e.g. a polarization vector for each region or zone even relatively large deviations between the recorded and measured vector maps may be tolerated in the authentication process. Thus an initial deskewing and dewarping algorithm may be use to initially align the regional boundaries to achieve maximum cross correlation. Such algorithms and image processing systems are known in the art. A cross correlation of even 0.1 over tens or hundreds of degrees of freedom may be sufficient to allow highly reliable authentication with a low number of false positives and false negatives.

The label may thus be subdivided into a plurality of zones each associated with an encrypted code portion. In this case since each subdivided zone stands alone any such zone or set of zones with sufficient degrees of freedom may be used to authenticate the entire label. Where the zones are small or have a limited number of degrees of freedom the reliability of authentication of the entire label by any one zone may be insufficient. Therefore a plurality of zones may be authenticated with each authenticated zone adding to the reliability of the resulting authentication. Any zones that fail to authenticate may also be weighted into the analysis although typically with a lower weight than zones that correctly authenticate.

The present invention therefore provides systems and methods employing self authenticating and on line authenticating schemes allowing determination of object authenticity by evaluation of a non duplicable and essentially random pattern.

More specifically one aspect of the present invention provides a method and apparatus for the production and labeling of objects in a manner suitable for the prevention and detection of counterfeiting that includes a recording apparatus containing a recording medium having macroscopically detectable anisotrophic optical properties.

In a dichroic fiber embodiment a plurality of dyes may be employed within the fibers either using multiple dyes in a single fiber or a plurality of fiber types each having different dye properties. Each dye having a distinct absorption and fluorescence spectrum is separately detectable. Further the respective dye concentrations may be varied during the manufacturing process or later selectively bleached by for example a laser at an absorption maximum wavelength of a particular dye species. The dichroism may also be varied for example by controlling a stretch process during fiber production or by heating the fiber above a recrystallization point with for example a laser. Thus for example using commonly available three color image detectors in conjunction with an appropriate optical system three separate dyes may be detected providing additional degrees of freedom for an authentication scheme. It is noted that while dichroic fibers are preferred it is not necessary for each dye to be associated with a dichroic property or a distinct dichroic property. Thus the dichroism fluorescence and absorption and or transmission characteristics may potentially be distinct characteristics of the fiber.

In another embodiment of the invention microspheres or other shaped objects are provided having dichroic properties. In this case the data map includes the position and polarization axis orientation of the objects which it should be understood is a three dimensional vector in the case of a linear fluorescent emission axis from a dye and a two dimensional vector in the case of a radially symmetric fluorescent emission from a dye. Advantageously these objects may either be embedded in the stock or applied later using a printing process for example lithography ink jet printing specialized laser printing with care taken to avoid undesired changes to the dichroism in the fuser and the like.

According to one embodiment of the invention dichroic fibers are formed of nylon having a fluorescent dye mixed into the polymer matrix. During the forming process the fiber is stretched which tends to align the molecules along the stretch axis. This anisotropic characteristic lead to dichroism which differentially affects light of varying polarization axis. Therefore due to this differential effect the fiber will have a light polarization rotation especially at wavelengths corresponding to the absorption and or emission of the fluorescent dye. It is noted that the nylon itself may also be dichroic but typically the effect is not easily observed at visible or other easily measured wavelengths on the other hand the dye is specifically selected to have useful optic interactions and to obtain a high degree of anisotropism under the process conditions.

The preferred nylon dichroic fibers allow for a number of identifying variations for example the amount or type of dye in the fiber optical heat physical or chemical e.g. chemical or photo bleaching heating stretching or fiber deformation modifications of the fiber during or after fabrication or after placement in an identifying substrate. As can be seen a number of degrees of freedom are possible providing a number of strategies for detection and making duplication difficult. The preferred variations are the amount of dye and physical stretch both of which can be controlled early in the manufacturing process of the fibers. Preferably these two variations are provided over relatively short distances for example millimeter ranges or smaller providing a relatively high information carrying capability and this allowing relatively short lengths of fiber to provide sufficient information to identify the substrate.

Alternately a modulated laser may be used to modify the fiber to alter the dye and or molecular chain organization. Such laser coding can be applied on a physical scale of microns and can be controlled to tight tolerances. Fibers may also be used which are selectively sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature humidity gasses and the like so that a change in characteristics e.g. optical characteristics is measured based on a change in such conditions. Thus for example a document is provided with fibers that change in color with respect to temperature humidity or pH. The document is then analyzed in two or more different states and the differential response recorded. It is noted that in order to change pH an acid gas soluble in the fiber such as hydrochloric acid acetic acid moist carbon dioxide or ammonia is provided in the environment. Other types of dye indicators are also known.

According to another feature of the invention an authentication feature of a certificate degrades over time or environmental exposure making long term persistence of authentic documents in the market more difficult. Such a component is for example a dye or additive that degrades with ambient light or oxygen exposure under normal conditions or even is the result of a progressive internal chemical reaction for example due to a catalyst dissolved in the fiber matrix. Of course this degradation limits the ability to inventory and ship normal stock that are intended to be deemed authentic after a long period of time and compels expedited authentication. However for applications where a short time window is appropriate such self destructing anti counterfeit technologies may be appropriate.

The present invention also provides a recording apparatus capable of imprinting a desired dichroic pattern on a substrate. This pattern therefore could be authenticated by means similar to that provided for fibers. In distinction to fibers imprinted patterns would be pixelated on the surface of the medium only and have very limited dichroic properties. A visual examination would also reveal that the pattern was not due to fibers. Thus a careful examination could distinguish the methods. However this allows the use of a common reader device to authenticate distinctly different certificates.

The recording apparatus provides at least two transfer films having the appropriate dichroic properties which are selectively deposited on a substrate in a microscopic pixel pattern to yield the desired pattern.

It is noted that according to the present invention the optical properties of the fibers or dyes need not be in a visible optical range and therefore infrared reactive dyes may be employed. Two advantages result from the use of infrared dues and detection equipment. First the pattern may be spatially coincident with a visible graphic thereby increasing spatial utilization efficiency. Second infrared laser diodes and light emitting diodes are less expensive that their visible counterparts and are available in various wavelengths and simple silicon photodiode detectors are appropriate.

According to an embodiment of an authentication device a tag is provided having visible from a surface thereof a low density non deterministic dichroic fiber pattern and a machine readable code defining the fiber pattern. The authenticity of the tag is therefore dependent on a correspondence of the machine readable code on the tag and the actual fiber pattern on the tag.

The preferred dichroic fibers have a relatively narrow optical absorption bandwidth to excite fluorescence and therefore require either a carefully selected narrow band source such as a laser diode or light emitting diode or a broadband light source such as an incandescent lamp. In the case of a broadband source in order to maintain a high signal to noise ratio a filter is preferably provided to limit emissions near the fluorescent wavelength.

For example a narrow band diffraction filter e.g. 565 nm passing light at the absorption maximum may be provided to filter the light from a xenon incandescent bulb.

The optical sensor system also includes a filter to pass the fluorescent light emitted from the fibers but block other stray light. For example a red e.g. 620 nm pass Ratten filter may be used. Ascertaining the presence of a particular dye is facilitated by hyperspectral analysis.

In order to detect the dichroism a rotating polarizer may be employed while capturing images during various phases of rotation. Typically the fibers have a dichroism closely related to the physical axis of the fiber. By detecting dichroism therefore the existence of a fiber as compared to a normally imprinted indicial may be determined. The detection of dichroic features also advantageously allows digital background subtraction.

Typically the fibers have a uniform cross section and thus the significant data included in a fiber pattern is the endpoints and path of the fiber. This information may therefore be efficiently coded and indeed much of the information may be truncated without substantial loss of system security.

The tag preferably has a bar code imprinted thereon with self authenticating information and a serial number. A bar code reader in the authentication device therefore reads the code. The self authenticating information is then compared with the detected fiber pattern to determine a correspondence thereof. This correspondence may be based on a normalization transform to account for example for image skew or other artifacts. Further since the tag is subject to change due to environmental factors an acceptable error rate or fuzzy match correlation may be defined to avoid false negatives while maintaining an appropriately high level of security.

The present invention may also be applied to the authentication of optical recording media. According to a first embodiment an optical disk is provided with a measurable random error rate due to physical imperfections in the optical recording medium. While presently manufacturing techniques are such that the error rate is low the base error rate may be artificially increased by inserting impurities in the resin used to form the media for example a polycarbonate resin. One type of impurity is air filled glass microbeads M which would have the effect of dispersing light between the read laser and the information pattern this resulting in random bit errors.

In data recording media error detection and correction techniques would likely be able to counteract the effects of such defects. On the other hand in musical compact disks CDs which do not employ error detection such random errors would likely have little effect on the reproduced sonic quality due to the presence of digital and analog filters in the signal path.

According to the present invention the position of the defects may be encoded and therefore verified. It is possible to record a on off code on a CD for example by selectively metallizing or demetallizing a circumferential band of the disk in a binary data pattern which could be read by the read head as a bar code. Demetallization could be effected for example by a carbon dioxide laser ablation pattern. The defect data pattern and code are intercepted for example at the output of the optical detector or as a component of a digital filter processing the output of the optical sensor. Firmware within the CD player determines a correspondence of the code with the actual defect pattern on the disk and may block playback of disks that lack correspondence. The player may also use error correction based on the encoded defect locations to counteract the effect of the defects on the signal.

These disks are backwards compatible with existing players since the errors are generally effectively filtered.

While it is preferred to employ the existing optical pickup of the optical disk drive to read the disk defect characteristics it is also possible to employ a distinct system. For example the encoding may be placed partially or entirely on the non data reading surface of the disk. This encoding may be read within a disk player or separately. For example a simple LED and photodiode may be provided to read a non deterministic pattern and code formed on the back of the disk along a single circumferential path. The non deterministic pattern may be for example a surface roughness or irregularity a pattern of ink drops or fibers dispersed in a graphic ink or the like. The code may be simply printed using existing contact or non contact techniques.

It is a feature of the present invention wherein an excitation source may be employed the excitation source being a bright light source such as a xenon incandescent bulb with a narrow band diffraction filter approximating the absorption maxima filtering said light.

It is an object of the present invention to provide wherein optionally the absorption and emission wavelengths are narrow a broad band receiver having a cutoff filter to block exciting light.

It is a feature of the present invention wherein a polarizer is provided between said broad band receiver and a sample which rotates between successive exposures wherein over a half rotation of said filter two or more exposures are taken such that by employing digital background subtraction the dichroic fibers which show maximum variance with respect to rotational angle of the filter as compared to background signals are extracted.

According to the present invention the label or certificate may be provided with codes having a multiplicity of levels. Thus even if a first level code is broken one or more backup codes may then be employed. The advantage of this system over a single level complex code is that the complexity of the detection devices used in the first instance may be reduced and the nature and even existence of the higher level codes need not be revealed until necessary.

In order to prevent mass duplication of labels or certificates it is preferable to encrypt and print a code representing varying characteristic of the label or certificate. In verifying the code the associated characteristics must correspond. Such a system adds markedly to the complexity of any counterfeiting scheme while still allowing labeling or goods and production of certificates to proceed. In a simpler system the mere repetition of supposedly random or pseudorandom codes is detected indicating simple copying.

In order to prevent the replacement of an authentic label on a different item a unique random or quasi unique characteristic of the item is encoded on the label. In this way relocation of the label to other goods may be detected.

In order to provide robustness against encryption cracking a plurality of encoding schemes may be employed for example to avoid complete system failure if one of the encoding schemes is broken . For example three different codes may be provided on the certificate employing three different algorithms and potentially based on three different sets of criteria.

Preferably the encoding and authentication employ a system which prevents tampering reverse engineering or massive interrogation which might lead to a determination of the underlying algorithm and or the generation of valid codes for counterfeit goods. Thus for example a secure central server may provide authentication services over secure communications channels.

Self authentication may be based on a public key algorithm however unless this algorithm is highly secure this is not preferred for high security applications but may be acceptable in moderate security applications. The risk is that if the private secret encryption key is discovered or released the usefulness of the encoding is lost and further until the pool of authentic goods bearing the broken encoding is depleted counterfeiters may continue undetected. Self authentication schemes are subject to sequential cracking attempts until the code is broken once an authentication code private key is discovered it may be used repeatedly.

It is noted that the imprinted code on the certificate need not be visible and or comprehensible but rather may itself be a security feature. Thus special inks printing technologies or information storage schemes may be employed. Preferably proprietary dyes having unique detectable optical signatures are employed.

Another embodiment of the invention provides an authenticatable sealing tape. The tape is imprinted with a machine readable code which for example uniquely identifies the tape portion at repetitive intervals e.g. every 2 inches. The tape also includes a set of fiducials as physical landmarks and a dichroic fiber pattern for example due to a low density of fibers adhered to the adhesive side of the tape in a non deterministic pattern. The tape is tamper evident such that if the tape is cut or removed evidence remains of this tampering.

When applied the contents of the sealed container are identified and the tape identification scanned with the contents thereafter associated with the identification of the tape. During authentication the tape is again scanner for identification and fiber pattern which is then authenticated on line to ensure authenticity.

While the tape may also be self authenticating this poses the issue of false positive authentications if a spool of tape is stolen since the imprint on the tape does not relate to the contents of the sealed container.

One embodiment of the present invention thus solves the above noted problems and overcomes suboptimizations inherent in the prior art by providing an authentication mechanism utilizing fluorescent dichroic fibers. The fibers are randomly and non deterministically embedded into or form a part of a substrate. This means that by studying any one substrate the pattern in any other substrate and therefore a code representing that pattern is not made apparent. This pattern may be stored in a database with an identification of the substrate indexing the stored characteristics of the substrate and or encoded on the substrate with an imprinted encrypted code.

The preferred system incorporates a sheet of material the authentication certificate or label impregnated with dichroic fibers containing a fluorescent dye that combines to form a high security system to thwart counterfeiting in a wide range of applications. Dichroic polymer fibers may also form part of the object to be authenticated. These fibers are relatively difficult to produce and their embedding into paper or woven goods requires special equipment. Further these fibers are observable with the naked eye discouraging low sophistication attempted counterfeiting of certificates without this feature. This system allows for instant field verification of labels while maintaining a high level of security against counterfeiting by making the reverse engineering process extremely difficult and expensive. No two labels are ever alike yet they can be produced very economically. In order to determine if the imprinted code corresponds to the certificate itself the fiber pattern which is completely random is illuminated by a light and read by a scanner. The resulting pattern is then compared to the encoded pattern to determine authenticity.

According to a preferred embodiment the pattern on the certificate is represented as an image projected on a surface with the surface not necessary being constrained as a planar sheet. Therefore relative deformations of the certificate pattern may be resolved through mathematical analysis using known techniques. The relative deformations as well as any other deviations from the encoded patterns which for example may represent lost or obscured fibers noise environmental contamination with interfering substances errors or interference in the original encoding process etc. are then used to determine a likelihood that the certificate itself corresponds to the originally encoded certificate. Thus the determined authenticity is associated with a reliability thereof based on stochastic variations in the properties of the authentication certificate and stochastic variations in the generation of the associated secure code. A threshold may then be applied to define an acceptable error rate false positive and false negative in the authentication process.

To produce an informational level of security which allows authentication without accessing a central information repository database the location or particular characteristics of the dichroic fibers which are random or unique are determined and used to generate an encrypted code wherein the encryption algorithm key or private key is maintained in secrecy. Therefore the code must match the dichroic fiber location or characteristics for authentication of the certificate. Since the dichroic properties provide a characteristic which existing duplication systems cannot control the certificate with encoding is very difficult to undetectably duplicate.

According to another embodiment of the invention fibers may be provided with spatial variation in patterns such as dichroism color coating thickness or the like providing additional and difficult to reproduce degrees of freedom into the security scheme. These variations may be random or relatively unique and for example may include enough information content to uniquely identify the object. For example the polarization angle along the length of a dichroic fiber may be controlled by altering a stretch of the fiber during fabrication or post modification for example by laser diode heating to form a polarization angle pattern on the fiber which varies over distance. The pattern may be truly random or pseudorandom with an arbitrarily large repetition interval or have a regular pattern. In any case as the fiber either on the object or the certificate itself is being encoded on an authentication certificate the fiber is analyzed for the particular property and this property and possible the relationship to other properties used in part to encode the certificate. It is noted that the replication of such patterns on fibers is particularly difficult making this a useful additional security feature beyond the mere presence of dichroic fibers.

As stated above the fiber may be imparted with a varying dichroic characteristic by selectively dying or bleaching a fiber or by inducing dichroism by selectively stretching portions of the fiber. In one embodiment a beam of light e.g. a laser may be used to excite and selectively bleach dye within the fiber providing a system for writing information to the fiber. In another embodiment the fiber or substrate is coated with a magneto optic recording layer which is selectively heated above the Curie temperature and selectively subjected to a magnetic field to induce a measurable light polarization effect.

The fiber may be modified during or in conjunction with the manufacturing process or at a point of use. When a laser is used to modify the fiber it heat the fiber thereby altering the alignment of molecules and or it may bleach the dye in the fiber thus reducing the concentration of the fluorescent species. The laser may be driven in a regular pattern a random pattern a pseudorandom pattern or in a chaotic state of operation. In the latter case the inherent instability of the laser is employed. It is noted that according to the method of VanWiggeren and Roy Communication with Chaotic Lasers Science 279 1198 1200 Feb. 20 1998 an information signal may be modulated onto the laser output and masked by the chaotic variations providing an encrypted data signal. By replicating the state of a receiving system laser having similar characteristics including parameters of operation and starting state it is possible to decode the data from the output signal. See Also Gauthier D. J. Chaos Has Come Again Science 279 1156 1157 Feb. 20 1998 . Thus for example a serial number or other coding may be imparted to the fiber which would be difficult to detect or duplicate without knowledge of the encoding system parameters providing an additional level of security.

The label formed with the fibers may be identified based on an identifying location of the fibers and or identifying characteristics of the fibers. The fibers may be randomly dispersed in a carrier material at such density to allow reliable identification but without obscuring identifying features. For example the fibers may be mixed into pulp to form paper such as in the process used for U.S. currency. The locations of the fibers are then determined allowing a correlation between the fiber locations and the identity of the substrate.

The present invention thus encompasses a system that reads a unique characteristic of a label or certificate and imprints thereon an encrypted message defining the unique characteristic making the label or certificate self authenticating. Optionally a unique or identifying characteristic of an object associated with a label or certificate may be further ascertained and printed as an encrypted message on the label uniquely associating the label or certificate with the object. Preferably the characteristic of the object is a random tolerance or highly variable aspect which is difficult to recreate yet which is comparatively stable over time so that measurements are relatively repeatable. Where the characteristic changes over time preferably these changes are predictable or provide identification such as of the date of manufacture. As stated above the authentication algorithm may compensate or take into consideration normal changes or deviations thus minimizing rechecks or manual examination of the certificates or labels.

The labeling system therefore includes a reader for reading the unique characteristics of the label or certificate such as a polarization sensitive imaging device for reading a distribution of dichroic fibers embedded in paper and optionally a device which measures an identifying characteristic of the object to be labeled such as a dimension tolerance color sewing or thread pattern etc. This information is then encrypted using an algorithm to produce an encrypted message which is then printed in the label for example using a dye sublimation or ink jet printer. The encryption is preferably a multilevel system for example including a 40 bit algorithm a 56 bit algorithm a 128 bit elliptic algorithm and a 1024 bit algorithm. Each message level is preferably printed separately on the label for example the 40 bit encrypted message as an alphanumeric string the 56 bit encrypted message as a binary or bar code the 128 bit elliptic encrypted message as a two dimensional matrix code and the 1024 bit algorithm as a pseudorandom placement of dots of one or more colors on the face of the label. Alternately the higher level messages may be encrypted by the lower level algorithms providing a multiple encryption system. Preferably each encrypted message corresponds to successively more detailed information about the label and or the object optionally with redundant encoding or potentially without any overlap of encoded information. This system allows readers to be placed in the field to be successively replaced or upgraded over time with readers that decode the more complex codes. By limiting use of the more complex codes and release of corresponding code readers until needed the risk of premature breaking these codes is reduced. In addition the use of codes of varying complexity allows international use even where export or use restrictions are in place of the reader devices.

The invention also provides a reader adapted to read the characteristic of the label corresponding to the encoded characteristic optionally sense or input the characteristic of the associated object and either manually or automatically verifies the printed code on the label. If the code verifies the label and or object are authentic.

Preferably both the marking system and the reader have a secure memory for the algorithm s which is lost in event of physical tampering with the devices. Further the devices preferably have a failsafe mode that erases the algorithm s in case of significant unrecoverable errors. Finally the systems preferably include safeguards against trivial marking or continuous interrogation while allowing high throughput or marking and checking of objects and labels.

Since the algorithm memory within the reader may be fragile a central database or server may be provided to reprogram the unit in case of data loss after the cause of loss is investigated. Any such transmission is preferably over secure channels for example 128 bit encryption or so called secure socket layer SSL through a TCP IP communication protocol. Each reader and marking system preferably has a unique identification number and set of encryption keys for any communication with the central system and a marking placed on the label indicative of the marking conditions for example marking system ID date location marking serial number and the like.

Labels can be affixed to any number of consumer and high security application including for example CDs software designer clothes wine cosmetics seals video tapes floppy disks perfume electronics currency cassettes books records documents and financial instruments.

The detailed preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with respect to the drawings. Like features of the drawings are indicated with the same reference numerals. In a substrate with dichroic fibers located on it is subject to a filter of an incandescent lamp . A polarizer is beneath a filter underneath a camera and this camera via a Universal Serial Bus USB is connected to a computer which is in turn connected to a bar code scanner via a RS 232 standard serial port . The bar code scanner scans the bar code on the substrate and completes the authentication procedure with the aid of the computer .

One of the bobbins is a take up bobbin for winding the ink ribbon while the other is a supply bobbin for supplying the ink ribbon . An optical sensor for detecting the type of the ink ribbon accommodated in the ribbon cassette is disposed on the carriage at its edge away from the platen . The optical sensor is connected to a controller disposed at a desired position of the thermal transfer printer for controlling the recording operation and other operations thereof. The controller is composed of a memory a CPU and other components not shown. Based on a signal outputted from the optical sensor while the carriage is moving the controller at least determines or detects presence or absence of the ribbon cassette the type of the ink ribbon accommodated in the ribbon cassette the travel distance of the carriage relative to its home position the open or close state of a canopy and the distance between the pair of adjacent or separated ribbon cassettes . The generally plated canopy is arranged over the carriage spaced on a frame not shown such that the canopy can be opened and closed. In the closed state the canopy serves to hold down the paper at the exit of a paper feed mechanism not shown. The canopy has a length along the carriage generally equivalent to the travel area of the carriage . A plurality of cassette holders not shown for holding the ribbon cassettes are disposed at predetermined positions on the canopy at the side opposed to the carriage . By these cassette holders the ribbon cassettes and housing ink ribbons and respectively of four different colors and or dichroic axes are arranged in a row along the travel direction of the carriage . The ribbon cassettes and are selectively passed between the canopy and the carriage and the cassettes are the same in shape and dimension regardless of the types of the ribbons . Each of the ribbon cassettes is composed of a generally flat and rectangular case body made of upper and lower members in which a pair of rotatably supported reels a pair of rotatably supported ribbon feed rollers not shown and a plurality of rotatably supported guide rollers facing a ribbon path are disposed. The ink ribbon is wound between the pair of reels . The middle of the ribbon path for the ink ribbon is drawn outside. The pair of reels when mounted on the upper carriage provide the take up reel for winding the ribbon used for printing and the supply reel for feeding the ribbon . A plurality of key grooves are formed on the inner periphery surface of each reel in a manner of spline spaced from each other around the periphery. The inner periphery surface of one reel provides a take up hole in which the take up bobbin is engaged. The inner periphery surface of the other reel provides a supply hole in which the supply bobbin is engaged. On the surface of the ribbon cassette opposed to the platen when the ribbon cassette is mounted on the carriage a recess is formed to which the thermal head faces. In this recess the middle of the ribbon is drawn. On the rear side of the ribbon cassette running in parallel to the side on which the recess is formed an identification marker is disposed for identifying the type of the ink ribbon housed in each ribbon cassette .

In the start of the process leads to the definition and determination of a dichroic fiber pattern within a substrate or on a label. Next is the generation of a pixel definition followed by printing polarization for axis and band . Next print polarization axis band and then print polarization axis and band and axis band respectively and .

The drive then based on the code seeks defects in the disk at locations defined by the code. . The code therefore may include track and sector information for a set of defects which may be limited in number to 5 16 defects. Preferably the absolute number of defects on any disk is not intentionally made higher than that necessary for authentication.

Using the disk read circuitry the location of the expected defects is correlated with the existence of actual defects to authenticate the disk . If defects are not found at the expected locations or there are an insufficient number of identified defects the disk authentication fails.

Since the locations of the defects are encoded it is possible to correct the output for the existence of the defects by filtering . The authentication process is then complete and an authenticated disk may be played normally.

At the start the disk is loaded into the drive . On the top non data reading surface of the disk a custom code is imprinted. This code is read for example by a one or more light emitting diode photodiode pair. This code is for example a bar code disposed circumferentially about a portion of the disk. A non deterministic pattern is read from the disk which may be formed as a pattern of ink reflection a pattern of fibers or ink spots or the like in line with the optical read path of the sensor. This optical sensor is not presently provided in known disk drives.

The dye spectral characteristics or dichroism of the non deterministic elements are also verified by optical techniques.

Optionally an on line authentication procedure may be employed for example to verify a detailed pattern of fibers on the disk.

If the non deterministic pattern and physical attributes dye and or dichroism correspond to an authentic disk signature then the disk is authenticated and the disk may be used normally at the end of the process . Otherwise firmware within the drive may be employed to prevent normal usage.

There have thus been shown and described novel receptacles and novel aspects of anti counterfeit systems which fulfill all the objects and advantages sought therefore.
