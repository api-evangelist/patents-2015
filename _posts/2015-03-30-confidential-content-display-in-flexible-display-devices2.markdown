In other exemplary embodiments the program code and programs such as a bending program and a confidential content program may be stored on at least one of one or more computer readable tangible storage devices on server computer or distributed between two or more servers.

Referring to a flexible display is a display device which is flexible in nature includes a plurality of sensors not shown that can sense the bending direction of the display relative to axes of the display the degree of bending of the display bending stress imparted to the display and touch or pressure from a user. The flexible display also preferably contains at least one camera on the display. The camera can preferably track facial direction of users who are in a specific range and viewing angle of the flexible display . The display area of the flexible display device preferably has a grid not shown corresponding to a series of coordinates which can be used to indicate where the flexible display device will bend or should be bent by the user.

The camera tracks the presence of other users in a continuous fashion for facial recognition and to determine whether other unauthorized users may be in a position to view the confidential content on the flexible display device. Users are granted viewing access to the display area based on their facial image. If a user s facial image is verified through comparison to facial images stored in a repository for example repository and associated with the authorized user who opened the file the user is granted access to view the confidential content on the flexible display device.

When a file with confidential content is opened the rights of who can see the display of the confidential content are determined as well as the degree of confidential content. This includes levels of confidential and percentage of content that is confidential. The determination of what confidential content is present in the file may be predetermined by the creator of the file present within properties of the file defined by the user or may be extracted by a text mining algorithm from text within the file.

If anyone other than authorized users is within viewing range to see the display then the confidential contents will be masked automatically for example using different colors hatching or something indicating different levels of confidentiality.

The bending program and or the confidential content program of the flexible display device will calculate and show the bend direction and amount of bend required to hide a particular display portion referred to as the hidden area or confidentiality pane from any users who are unauthorized and in viewing range of the display. As the authorized user needs more space in a confidential pane or hidden area the bending of the display increases to fit the legend associated with identifying the confidential content masked in the display portion of the display area .

If the unauthorized users are so close or within a specific range of the display device and there is no viewing angle that can protect the confidential content from viewing by unauthorized users the authorized user will be alerted and the document will not be displayed to the authorized user.

In this example the confidential content is circled e.g. 50 450 and girlfriend. The confidential content may be ranked or classified by how confidential a user feels the content is or a predefined classification set of confidentiality. In this case the 50 and 450 would be classified as being more confidential than girlfriend . The confidential content of 50 and 450 could be ranked at the same confidential level or at different levels.

A bending sensor not shown of the flexible display device detects when and where the flexible display device is bent and detects a hidden area . The confidential content is displayed in the hidden area with matching color coding or an appropriate legend and the exposed portion or display portion of the flexible display displays the entire contents of the file with the confidential content masked.

In a first step a confidential content program of the flexible display device receives registration information from a user step . The registration information may include but is not limited to personal information such as name address phone number date of birth and other information that can be used to verify the identity of the user.

The confidential content program of the flexible display device receives a confidential content classification from the user step . There are many potential levels of confidential content classification defined such as top secret secret confidential non confidential or a numeric security level could be used. These levels may be predefined and or altered based on user preferences. A user may consider any information having to do with salary to be at the top level of confidential content classification where his address is at a lesser level of classification. There may be other users that would rank their address at a higher level of classification than information associated with their salary.

Within a given document specific sections could have different classifications providing the ability for the user to control access to who can read different classifications of the confidential content. The registering or authorized user may grant specific secondary authorized users access to certain levels of confidential content based on classification.

The confidential content program of the flexible display device receives a facial picture of the registering or authorized user and any secondary users and stores the facial picture with the user s registration information step for example in repository of . The facial picture in combination with the registration information may be used to validate viewing of confidential content within electronic files.

The confidential content program of the flexible display device receives user preferences step which may include but is not limited to tolerance range allowance for other authorized viewers whether the device bends automatically or provides a recommendation for the user to bend the flexible display device.

The tolerance range would include a range of distance from the display in which a user does not want unauthorized users present even with bending of the flexible display device to hide confidential content and a range in which to search for possible unauthorized users attempting to view the display of the flexible display device.

A registered or authorized user may also register or authorize a plurality of secondary users to view at least a portion of confidential content for example spouses or other family members or members of the same workgroup.

In a first step the flexible display device receives a user login and a facial picture or image of the user step for example through the confidential content program . The facial picture is received through the camera of the flexible display device.

If the user login and facial image of the user is verified step the flexible display device receives a request from the user to open an electronic file containing confidential content step for example through the confidential content program .

If the user does not have permission to view the requested file or in some embodiments any or all of the confidential content within the file step determined through the confidential content program the confidential content program sends the user a notification denying the request to open the file step and the method returns to step of receiving a request to open a file.

The confidential content program then searches for the presence of viewing direction and distance of secondary users a user other than the user who has logged into the system within a distance range of the display device step through a camera of the flexible display device.

If there is a secondary user within the distance range of the display step the secondary user s facial image is compared with the repository to determine if the secondary user is authorized or has rights to view the confidential content step . If there is no secondary user the method proceeds to step .

If the secondary user is authorized and in some embodiments if the user is also authorized to view the confidential content the flexible display device displays the file with the confidential content unmasked to the user and secondary authorized user step and the method returns to step .

If the secondary user or in some embodiments the user is not authorized to view the confidential content step the locations of the confidential content within the file is determined step for example through the confidential content program .

The determined confidential content within the file is masked based on the confidential content classification of the content and in some embodiments the confidential content authorization of the user and or secondary user step for example by the confidential content program . The masking may be different colors or hatching or any other means for preventing readability of the confidential content by users who can see the exposed portion or display portion of the flexible display.

In some embodiments what contents are masked can be determined based on a comparison of the security level of any particular piece of content with the highest security level which either the user or any secondary user has. In this embodiment for example if the user and all secondary users are authorized for confidential material but not top secret or secret the confidential material will be displayed but anything rated secret or top secret would be masked. Therefore for multiple users viewing the display of the flexible display device the lowest or highest security level in common for all of the users viewing the display of the flexible display device and the confidential content will be displayed in the hidden area of the flexible display device.

The coordinates at which to bend the flexible display device to display the confidential content to authorized users only is calculated step for example by the confidential content program . The calculation analyzes the facial direction of the unauthorized users to calculate their view angle and provides a direction in which the flexible display is recommended for bending to allow a portion of the display to be hidden from the unauthorized users.

The amount in which the flexible display device is recommended for bending is also based on the degree of confidentiality as determined in step . The greater the amount of confidential content present within the file the larger the area needed for the confidential content and the larger the bend. Furthermore the greater the degree of confidentiality or the higher the level of confidentiality the increase in the amount of bending recommended.

The flexible display device is bent at the calculated coordinates step for example by the bending program . The operating system framework application programming interface API of the flexible display device through the bending program bends the flexible display in specific direction to protect view of confidential content. Alternatively the user can bend the flexible display device as indicated along the calculated coordinates.

Secondary users are searched for who can see the hidden area from the bending of the flexible display device step for example with the camera of the flexible display device through the confidential content program .

If the secondary user does not have authorization to see the hidden area with the confidential content step for example as detected through facial recognition of the secondary user through the confidential content program and the camera of the flexible display device an alert is sent to the user regarding the unauthorized secondary user view of the confidential content in the hidden area step and the method returns to step .

If the secondary user does not have authorization to see the hidden area with the confidential content step for example as detected through facial recognition of the secondary user through the confidential content program and the camera of the flexible display device the file is opened with the confidential content masked on the display of the flexible display device and the legend relating to the confidential content is displayed in the hidden area or confidentiality pane of the flexible display device step and the method returns to step .

In addition the confidential content may be displayed in the confidentiality pane or hidden area in a smaller font than present in the viewing portion of the display.

Each set of internal components also includes a R W drive or interface to read from and write to one or more portable computer readable tangible storage devices such as a CD ROM DVD memory stick magnetic tape magnetic disk optical disk or semiconductor storage device.
