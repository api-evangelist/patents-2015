The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other potential features of the disclosure will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

Techniques are described for inheriting biometric identifiers by credential granting authorities. Within a credential management application credential granting authorities can issue credentials to users. Multiple credential granting authorities can grant a user a credential and the credentials may be accessible through a credential management application running on a user s device. For example a user may have an employee credential from Organization a membership credential from Organization and a banking credential from Organization all of which may be accessible through the credential management application. The user may login to the credential management application by through any one of the user s credentials. Once authenticated by the credential management application the user can access the resources associated with each credential. Each resource provides the user with access to different aspects associated with the credential such as providing access to various parts of a building or providing access to various user accounts. Before providing a user with access to sensitive resources associated with the credential a credential granting authority may require that a user provide additional identification verification. A credential granting authority may use a biometric identifier to verify the identity of a user. For example a user may speak numbers into a client device and the credential granting authority can grant access to its resources based upon receiving a recording of the user speaking the numbers and authenticating the user based on the user s voice recording.

As part of registering a biometric identifier for a user such as for example a voice print for the user a credential granting authority may verify the identity of a user. For example the credential granting authority may verify the identity of a user by viewing a government issued identification. The credential granting authority also may ask the user to read a series of text strings and record the user s voice while doing so. The credential granting authority then may process these recordings to create a voice print. The credential granting authority then may allow the user to access its resources upon matching the user s voice with the collected voiceprint. The voiceprint thus may allow the credential granting authority to authenticate the user without the need for a username and password or as a second layer in addition to a username and password.

In some implementations a credential granting authority may require a user to provide biometric identification to access a resource before the credential granting authority collects a biometric identifier for the user. For instance some credential granting authorities may trust a biometric identifier collected by another credential granting authority and allow access to their resources based on the biometric identifier from the trusted credential granting authority. In other words the credential granting authority may inherit the biometric identifier from the trusted credential granting authority. For example a user attempting to access the resources of a bank Organization may be required by Organization to provide a biometric identifier before being allowed to access the desired resources of Organization . Previously the user may have registered a biometric identifier with another credential granting authority Organization . When the user attempts to access the resources of Organization using a biometric identifier the credential management application may determine by accessing trust data whether Organization trusts a biometric identifier collected by Organization . Responsive to a determination by the credential management application that Organization does trust biometric identifiers collected by Organization the user can use the same biometric identifier that the user previously registered with Organization to access resources of Organization without having to register a new biometric identifier with Organization .

Referring now to an example user interface is shown that illustrates a list of options for logging into the credential management application. The options include different credential granting authorities that have issued credentials to the user such as Organization as reflected in credential option . As shown in Organization and Organization are reflected in option and option respectively because Organization and Organization have issued credentials to the user. The options also include a server option that allows the user to log into the credential management application using an option provided by the credential management application. The user may select any of the options to log into the credential management application. When the user selects one of the options for example option corresponding to Organization another user interface is displayed to the user as described below in relation to such as a dialog box prompting the user to supply the user s authentication information for Organization to log in to the credential management application.

Referring now to an example user interface is shown that illustrates a log in screen for a particular user to log into the credential management application. In this example the user interface provides a text display indicating that the log in corresponds to Organization and thus the credential management application will authenticate the user using Organization s authentication information. Alternatively the user may be redirected to authenticate himself directly with Organization and then Organization may send a communication to the server or to the user s client device indicating that the user has been authenticated and that the user should be allowed to access the user s credential management application account. The user interface shows a log in option in which the user can provide a voice login that has been registered with Organization by selecting button . In general though any suitable type of authentication information and authentication technique may be used.

For example if the user wishes to access a credential issued by a university the user may provide a voice login as authentication information. The authentication information required may be different depending on the credential issuing organization. The user may be able to provide as authentication information a voice login when logging into the credential management application using the login option provided by the university. Other login options provided by other credential granting authorities may request authentication information such as user name and password finger print retina scan etc. The authentication information may be confirmed either by a server hosting the credential management application or by a server at the credential granting authority.

Regardless of which entity processes the user s authentication information and authorizes a user to log in to the credential management application the credential management application enables a variety of different credential granting authorities to issue mobile device based credentials and or keys through the credential management application. For example illustrates an example of a user s credentials issued by different organizations.

Referring now to an example user interface is shown that illustrates a collection of the credentials held by a particular user. In this example the user interface shows four user credentials for the particular user corresponding to credentials issued to the user by different credential granting authorities. The user also may select the Add a Credential tab to add new credentials issued to the user by credential granting authorities to the user s account.

In this example the collection of credentials includes four credentials Option may be selected to access credentials issued by the server that hosts the credential management application. Another credential is a state issued driver s license selectable using option issued by Organization for which the user provided log in information e.g. using interface in . Another credential is an employee ID selectable using option issued by Organization . The last credential is a metro rail pass selectable using option issued by Organization . The user may select one of the credentials to view the credential. For instance when the user selects the Employee ID option for Organization the credential is displayed on the user s mobile device as illustrated in .

Referring now to an example user interface is illustrated that displays a selected credential. In this example the selected credential is the employee ID credential that was selected using option for Organization in the user interface of . The user interface includes a description of the selected credential and a picture of the user that holds the credential. Also the user interface includes some personal information related to the credential holder . In some implementations some or all of the information displayed in the user interface may have been provided by the organization issuing the credential Organization . The interface also includes a validation mechanism . The validation mechanism may be used for validation of the user s credential by other users or entities. In the example shown in the validation mechanism is a Quick Reference QR code. Another user or entity may use a validating device to image the QR code extract credential information encoded within the QR code and send the extracted credential information to the credential management system or the credential granting authority for validation.

In some implementations as an alternative or in addition to a QR code the validation mechanism may be an alphanumeric code and or the validation mechanism may be an indication that credential information is available for transmission using ultrasonic communications near field communications NFC and or other short wavelength radio transmissions e.g. in the ISM band from 2400 2480 MHz for example according to the Bluetooth standard. The user interface further includes a button that causes additional information about the credential to be displayed. For instance when the user selects the button the user s mobile device displays the interface illustrated in .

In some implementations the user interface represents a front of an employee badge and the interface illustrated in represents a back of the employee badge. In these implementations when the user selects the button an animation may occur that makes it appear as if the employee badge is being flipped from the front of the badge represented by the user interface to the back of the badge represented by the interface illustrated in .

Referring now to an example user interface is illustrated that displays additional information about a credential. In this example the additional information corresponds to the selected credential illustrated in the user interface of corresponding to the employee ID of Organization . The interface displays detailed information that displays the name of the user and the name of the credential granting authority for the particular credential the email address of the user the length of time the user has held the credential and the phone number of the user. Some or all of the detailed information displayed about the credential may be provided by the organization issuing the credential in this case Organization . The user interface also includes a button that causes the display to return to the front of the badge or the user interface illustrated in . The user interface also may include a button that causes the user s mobile device to display any keys that have been issued to the user in connection with the credential displayed in user interfaces and .

When a credential granting authority issues a credential to a user through the credential management application it also may issue one or more keys to the user e.g. for the purposes of providing access to one or more physical and or logical resources controlled by the credential granting authority . For example when Organization issues an employee ID to the user it also may issue a number of keys to the user that enable the user to unlock different doors within the Organization office buildings to gain access to certain floors of the buildings from the building s elevators to enter exit the parking garage to gain access to a computing device account or network etc. In some implementations the keys are associated with access control systems that regulate access to the physical and or logical resources and enable the physical and or logical resources to be locked or unlocked by invocation of a control within the credential management application on the user s mobile device.

Various examples of different keys that an organization may issue to a user for example as part of issuing the user an employee credential through the credential management application are shown in .

Referring now to an example user interface is illustrated that displays a list of keys associated with a credential. In this example the user interface shows a list of five keys that have been issued to the user by Organization . The keys enable the user to access various physical and or logical resources that are controlled by Organization . The user also may select one of the keys to view details about the key and or to attempt to use the key to gain access to the corresponding physical or logical resource. For instance when the user selects the HQ 12th Lobby South key selectable by option information about the key is displayed on the user s mobile device as illustrated in .

Referring now to an example user interface is illustrated that displays a prompt to the user to speak a text string . In this example the user selected a key of Organization that required additional authentication to access the key. The user was already logged into the credential management application when the user provided a voice print at prompted in but because of the sensitivity of the selected key Organization has chosen to require an additional voice print when accessing the key. In some implementations biometric identification may be limited to accessing secure resources. As such the user may have logged into the credential management application using a username and password instead of a voice print. As shown in the user selected the HQ 12th Stair B key and the user interface displayed a prompt for the reader to read the text string . The user may select button and begin reading the text string . In some implementations the biometric identifier used to access the HQ 12th Stair B key may have been collected by Organization . Alternatively Organization may have inherited the biometric identifier from a different credential granting authority based on Organization trusting the different credential granting authority.

Referring now to an example user interface is illustrated that displays information about a selected key. The user interface may have been reached by selection of a key in or by selecting a key in that prompted an additional voice print request as shown in . The user interface includes a text display that describes the key and a slideable interface component that enables the user to use the key to access a physical resource in this case a door to the 12th floor lobby of the Organization headquarters. The interface also may display information about the user in text display area . In this example the user may use the key to access a physical resource by sliding the key shaped icon in the slideable interface component from a locked position to an unlocked position . Other types of interface options may be presented by interface for providing access to a physical resource using the key. In this example when the user slides the slideable interface component to the unlocked position a determination may be made as to whether the user is authorized to open the corresponding door and if so the door opens and a confirmation message is displayed to the user for example by presenting the interface illustrated in . In some implementations the determination that the user is authorized to open the door using the key is made prior to presenting the user with the list of keys e.g. in user interface of .

Referring now to an example user interface is illustrated that displays an indication that a physical resource has been unlocked using a key and is accessible to the user. In this example a display interface component may be provided indicating that Organization has authorized the door to HQ 12th Lobby South to be opened.

The access of a physical resource using a key can be enabled by any suitable technique. For example a user s mobile device may use short range wireless communication signals such as infrared e.g. Bluetooth or near field communication e.g. NFC signals to access a physical resource by placing the mobile phone in close proximity to the physical resource. As another example the mobile device may access a physical resource indirectly via an intermediate device such as a relay or a router. Additionally or alternatively the mobile device may use a wireless network communication signal e.g. Wi Fi cellular etc. to access a physical resource over a communication network. For example the mobile device may send control signals to the credential granting authority via wireless communication either directly or via the server system which may then in turn control the physical resource. More specifically the mobile device may send an indication to the server that the user is attempting to access a key on the mobile device. The server may then determine whether the user is authorized to access the location that the user is attempting to access with the key. If the server determines that the user is authorized then the server can send a signal to an access control system to grant access to the location. In some implementations the mobile device may use an attached device such as a dongle to facilitate access of the physical resource. These are merely some examples of techniques that can be used by a mobile device to access a physical resource as a result of a user of the mobile device attempting to use a key to access the physical resource and other techniques may be used.

The server system includes a validation server an account data store a credential data store trust data and biometric identifiers . The validation server is involved in the process of validating credential granting authorities as well as validation of credentials and or keys. The validation server authenticates credential granting authorities that would like to make credentials available to users of the credential management system. The validation server also validates credentials and or keys held by users of the credential management system through communication with credential management applications operated on user devices. For example the validation server can authenticate a user by comparing the biometric identifiers to a biometric identifier received by a user through the client . As described in greater detail elsewhere the validation server may use the trust data to associate different credential granting authorities with the same biometric identifier.

The user account data store stores user account information and the credential data store stores credential information associated with user accounts. Users of the credential management application may set up a user account that allows the user to store personal information as well as the credentials issued to the user. Each user account may include identification information for the user and credential data that defines credentials held by the user. The system may maintain accounts for multiple different users with each user account being specific to a user and the credentials held by the specific user.

Credentials or information related to credentials issued to a user by a credential granting authority may be cached in the credential data store until a cache until date associated with the credential passes. The cache until date defines the date that a cached version of the credential may be used without having to communicate with the credential granting authority to confirm the continued validity of the credential. When the cache until date has not passed the server system may access from electronic storage at the server system a cached version of the credential and use the cached version of the credential to send credential information e.g. send a user an updated list of the user s credentials or validate the credential e.g. confirm to another user that the user s credential is valid . When the cache until date has passed the server system communicates with the credential granting authority that issued the credential to receive updated credential information for the credential and then sends credential information or validates the credential based on the updated credential information. For example an employer may define a cache until date of twenty four hours for an employee credential issued to an employee by the employer. In this example if the server system has received information for the employee credential from the employer s system less than twenty four hours prior to the employee s attempted use of the credential e.g. presentation of the credential to gain access to the employer s building the server system may validate the use of the employee credential without having to communicate with the employer s system. If not the server system communicates with the employer s system to receive updated credential information for the employee credential and validates the use of the employee credential based on the updated credential information for the employee credential.

Credentials also may be associated with an expiration date. When a credential is associated with an expiration date credential information for the credential may be stored by the server system until the expiration date. For instance when the server system determines that the expiration date of a credential has passed the server system may delete the data defining the expired credential and remove the expired credential from the user s account.

The validation server is in communication with the account data store and the credential data store for example to manage and validate credentials. The validation server authenticates and establishes connectors with various trusted credential granting authorities as shown in . A connector may include communication information that the server system uses to communicate with a credential granting authority . For instance the communication information may include an electronic address e.g. a uniform resource locator URL that the server system uses to communicate with the credential granting authority and a set of guidelines that govern a format for exchanging communications between the credential granting authority and the server system . The credential granting authority programs its system to follow the set of guidelines stipulated by the server system to enable the two platforms to communicate credential information successfully. The set of guidelines stipulated by the server system may be published to allow software developers and or information technology staff to configure the systems at the credential granting authorities to comply with the set guidelines. A connector may be established between the system of a credential granting authority and the server system when the server system stores the communication information and the system of the credential granting authority has been configured to communicate in accordance with the set of guidelines. In some implementations the communication information defining the connector may include communication information that enables the credential granting authority to communicate with the server system through an Application Programming Interface API of the server system . The server system may store unique communication information for each credential granting authority and thus establish a unique connector with each credential granting authority . For the sake of brevity the term connector is used throughout this disclosure to refer to communication information used in exchanging communications with a credential granting authority and does not necessarily connote a physical connection between the server system and a system of the credential granting authority although a physical connection may be used in some implementations.

As shown in the validation server has established multiple different connectors for multiple different credential granting authorities. The credential granting authorities may include one or more universities one or more companies and one or more government agencies among other credential granting authorities. Each credential granting authority maintains a credential repository e.g. credential repositories on a system operated by the credential granting authority. The systems operated by the credential granting authorities use the connectors to communicate credential information from the credential repositories to the validation server . For instance the client device may wish to display a credential from the credential granting authority associated with the connector . The validation server first identified the organization as authentic and established the connector between the server system and the credential granting authority. Using the connector the validation server sends a request to the credential granting authority for credential information of a user of the client device . The credential granting authority accesses data from the credential repository and uses the connector to provide credential information from the accessed data to the validation server which in turn provides credential information to the client device for display through the credential management application. In some implementations a credential granting authority may provide several types of credentials to a user such that the user s account includes multiple different credentials issued by the credential granting authority to the user. Additionally or alternatively a user may receive credentials from several different credential granting authorities such that the user s account includes at least a first credential issued by a first organization and a second credential issued by a second organization. The credential management system may maintain accounts for many different users and may manage credentials issued to these users by many different organizations.

Some organizations may use biometric identifiers to authenticate a user. In order to use a biometric identifier to authenticate a user the server collects the biometric identifier from the client and stores the biometric identifier. For example Organization may indicate to the server that Organization will allow authentication using biometric identifiers. To collect a biometric identifier a user may provide biometric information such as a voice print or finger print to the server through the client . In the case of the voice print the server may display a text string on the client for the user to read. The server receives the biometric identifier and stores it in biometric identifiers in connection with Organization .

The server may use the biometric identifier to authenticate the user. The server may authenticate the user before allowing the user to log into the credential management application and or before the user accesses a key or resource associated with a credential. For example the server may receive notification that a user is attempting to log into the credential management application through client . The user may select the option of logging into the credential management application using the Organization credential. Having previously set up a biometric identifier with Organization the server will prompt the client for the biometric identifier to authenticate the user. The server will receive the biometric identifier from the client and compare the biometric identifier to the saved biometric identifier saved in connection with Organization . If the server determines that the biometric identifiers match then the server grants logs the user into the credential management application.

The server may also use the biometric identifier to authenticate a user when the user attempts to access a resource associated with a credential if requested by the credential granting authority. For example the user may attempt to use a key associated with Organization s credential to open a door. The server receives notification from the client that the user is attempting to use the key. The server determined that that Organization has identified the key as one that requires additional authentication. As such the server sends a request to the client to collect another biometric identifier. The server receives and compares the collected biometric identifier similarly to when the user logged into the credential management application. If the biometric identifier matches then the server sends a signal to access control system to unlock the door that matches the key.

In some implementations a credential granting authority may trust a biometric identifier collected by another credential granting authority. A credential granting authority trusts a biometric identifier collected by another credential granting authority when the credential granting authority allows the server to authenticate a user for access to the credential granting authority s credential or resources by using the other credential granting authority s biometric identifier. In other words the credential granting authority inherits the biometric identifier from the other credential granting authority. When a credential granting authority trusts or inherits a biometric identifier collected by another credential granting authority the server may copy the biometric identifier associated with the other credential granting authority to the biometric identifiers associated with the credential granting authority. For example if Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected by Organization then the server can copy the biometric identifier to biometric identifiers for Organization when Organization collects the biometric identifier. In some implementations the biometric identifier is not copied and associated with the credential granting authority that trusts the biometric identifier. Instead the server grants access to a resource for a credential granting authority based on a biometric identifier stored and associated with the other credential granting authority. The credential granting authority that collected the biometric identifier retains ownership and control of the biometric identifier. For example if Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected by Organization then when a user tries to access the resources of his Organization credential the server compares the user s biometric sample to the biometric identifier collected by Organization and stored in biometric identifiers . Within biometric identifiers Organization is not associated with Saving Bank s biometric identifiers.

Before a voice print is collected the credential granting authority verifies the identity of the user. Verification may be performed offline. For example the user may present a picture identification to a representative from the credential granting authority. Once the representative from the credential granting authority verifies the identity of the user the representative can indicate to the server to begin the voice print collection process. The user s identify can also be verified online. For example the user may have already logged into the credential management application by authenticating through the credential granting authority.

When the server receives an indication the user s identity has been verified the server will notify the device to begin collecting a voice print as shown in screen . The user may select the set up now button to begin the collection process. Screen displays a text string that the user is instructed to read. The text string is determined by the server and sent to the device for display to the user. The user selects the talk button and holds the talk button until the user finishes speaking. The talk button will indicate to the user to release the talk button when the user finishes speaking as shown in screen . When the user is speaking into the device the device may be transmitting the speech to the server in real time or the device may record the user s voice and transmit the recording to the server when the user finishes speaking. The server processes the user s voice and sends an indication of the processing to the device as shown in screen . Once the processing is complete the server sends an indication to the device and the device displays screen . The server stores the processed voice print and an identifier of the credential granting authority that collected the voice print in biometric identifiers . When the user attempts to access a resource associated with the credential granting authority that requires biometric identification the server accesses the biometric identifier and compares the stored data to a voice sample received from the user during authentication.

The process begins with the device receiving a request to collect a voice recording of the user. The client device may receive the request from a credential server based on the user requesting to access a resource associated with a credential granting authority that requires biometric authentication. The device presents the user with text to read in screen and the client device records the user s voice in screen . The server processes the voice recording and determines if the user can be verified. If the server verifies the voice of the user then the device displays screen and permits access to the resource. If the server is unable to verify the voice of the user then the device displays screen and different text to the user to read in screen

The server receives from a first credential granting authority a biometric identifier that is associated with a user and that was collected by the first credential granting authority . For example the credential granting authority may choose resources that require biometric authentication. The resources may be particular keys that require access particular sensitive areas or the credential granting authority may require users to provide biometric authentication to access the credential granting authority s credential instead of a username and password. In some implementations the biometric identifier may be a voiceprint a retina scan an iris scan and or a fingerprint among other biometric identifiers. When a user registers a biometric identifier with the first credential granting authority the first credential granting authority verifies the identity of the user. In some implementations the first credential granting authority receives a username and password from the user to verify the identity of the user. In some implementations the first credential granting authority may verify the identity of the user offline such as with a picture ID. Once the credential granting authority has verified the user the credential granting authority can collect a biometric identifier. In some implementations the credential granting authority collects the biometric identifier by recording the voice of the user reading a text string. During or after collection of the biometric identifier the server receives data indicating that the first credential granting authority verified the user and is the user associated with the biometric data.

The server stores the biometric identifier in association with the user and the first credential granting authority . For example the server may store the biometric identifier in a database where each database entry contains a biometric identifier data identifying the user associated with the biometric identifier and data identifying one or more credential granting authorities associated with the biometric identifier. In some implementations the biometric identifiers may be stored within the server as shown in with the biometric identifiers .

The server accesses trust data that enable a determination of whether a second credential granting authority trusts biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority . For example the second credential granting authority may require biometric identification to be able to access resources of the second credential granting authority. The second credential granting authority may not require that the use a biometric identifier collected directly by the second credential granting authority to access the resources of the second credential granting authority. Instead the second credential granting authority can choose to trust the first credential granting authority s biometric identifier and use it to allow regulate the user s ability to access the resources of the second credential granting authority. To determine whether the second credential granting authority trusts the first credential granting authority s biometric identifier the server accesses trust data. In some implementations the trust data may be stored within the server as shown in with the trust data . In some implementations the trust data contains data that identifies the credential granting authorities that a particular credential granting authority trusts for collecting a biometric identifier. For example the trust data may contain data that indicates that Organization trust biometric identifiers associated with Organization and Organization . The Organization or Organization biometric identifiers may be ones that were collected by either Organization or Organization or may be ones that were inherited by either Organization or Organization . In some implementations the trust data may be provided and modified by the credential granting authority. For example Organization may instruct the server to add that biometric identifies collected by Organization are trusted by Organization . Conversely Organization may instruct the server to change the data indicating that biometric identifies collected by Organization are trusted by Organization to Organization not trusting biometric identifiers collected by Organization .

The server may also access trust data when a user attempts to access a key associated with a particular credential but when the user has not been authenticated by the credential granting authority associated with the key. For example a user provides a biometric identifier collected by Organization to log in to the credential management application through Organization . The user attempts to access a key associated with a credential from Organization . The server receives notification that the user is attempting to access a key for Organization . Before granting access to the location associated with the key the server accesses trust data to determine if Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected by Organization .

The server determines that the second credential granting authority trusts biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority based on the accessed trust data . For example the trust data may contain data that indicates that Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected by Organization . Based on this trust data the server determines that Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected by Organization .

In some implementations the server confirms whether the second credential granting authority trusts the biometric identifier collected by the first credential granting authority. The server may confirm whether the second credential granting authority trusts the biometric identifier collected by the first credential granting authority by sending a request for confirmation to the first credential granting authority. For example the server may receive a request from Organization to begin requiring biometric identification. The server accesses the trust data and determines that Organization has requested to inherit the biometric identifier collected by Organization . The server sends a request to Organization to confirm that Organization trusts the biometric identifiers collected by Organization . Organization sends a confirmation that it trusts the biometric identifiers collected by Organization and based on this confirmation the server determines that Organization trusts the biometric identifiers collected by Organization .

In some implementations the trust data may explicitly indicate that the second credential granting authority trusts the first credential granting authority. For example the trust data may contain a unique identifier for each credential granting authority. The unique identifier for each credential granting authorities may be associated with the unique identifiers of other credential granting authorities that the credential granting authority trusts. Using this trust data the server compares identification information of the first credential granting authority with the trust data. The identification information may contain the name of the first credential granting authority a location of the first credential granting authority an IP address associated with the first credential granting authority and or other information. Based on the comparison by the server the server may determine that the first credential granting authority is the same as the one referenced in the trust data and thus determine that the second credential granting authority trusts the biometric identifier collected by the first credential granting authority. For example the trust data may contain data indication that Organization explicitly trusts Organization . The trust data may further indicate that Organization is located in Springfield and is associated with an IP address of 255.255.255.255. The server may compare this trust data with identification information for Organization . There may be more than one credential granting authority named Organization . One may be in Springfield and associated with IP address 255.255.255.255 and the other may be in Greenville and associated with IP address 128.128.128.128. The server may determine that the Organization in Springfield and associated with IP address 255.255.255.255 is the one trusted by Organization and thus Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected by Organization .

In some implementations the trust data indicates a level of security that the second credential granting authority trusts. The server determines the level of security that the first credential granting authority used when collecting the biometric identifier. If the level of security trusted by the second credential granting authority is satisfied by the level of security used by the first credential granting authority then the server determines that the second credential granting authority trusts biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority. A credential granting authority may specify that it trusts a level of security at or above a certain level. For example a credential granting authority may trust level 3 security and any levels more secure. The level of security may be an encryption level used to store the biometric identifier the identification type s required by the first credential granting authority when verifying the identity of the user and or an encryption level used to transmit the biometric identifier during authentication among other factors related to security levels. For example the trust data may contain data indicating that Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected when the identity of the user was verified using a passport. The server may determine based on data provided by Organization that Organization requires a passport when verifying a user s identity when collecting a biometric identifier. Based on this requirement the server may determine that Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected by Organization . In some implementations a third party may determine the level of security used by a credential granting authority. For example an encryption verification entity may verify that the encryption protocol used to encrypt and store the biometric identifier is AES.

In some implementations the trust data indicates a timing restriction for the second credential granting authority to trust a biometric identifier collected by the first credential granting authority. The server determines timing conditions that are associated with the biometric identifier collected by the first credential granting authority. If the conditions are satisfied then the server determines that the second credential granting authority trusts biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority. The timing restrictions may require that the first credential granting authority have had collected the biometric identifier within a particular time period e.g. the last week month year etc. . For example the trust data may contain data that indicates that Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected by Organization if the biometric identifiers were collected within one year. In this example if the server determines that the biometric identifier collected by Organization was collected five months ago then the server determines that the biometric identifier collected by Organization satisfies the timing conditions specified by Organization and thus Organization trusts this particular biometric identifier collected by Organization . In some implementations the timing restriction may be based on when the user is attempting to access the resources of the credential. A credential granting authority may choose to trust biometric identifiers collected by other credential granting authorities only during specific time periods. For example Organization may agree to trust biometric identifiers collected by Organization if the user was attempting to access the Organization resources between 9 am and 5 pm on Monday through Friday. During other times Organization may not trust biometric identifiers collected by Organization .

In some implementations the trust data indicates geographic restrictions for the second credential granting authority to trust a biometric identifier collected by the first credential granting authority. The server determines geographic conditions that are associated with the biometric identifier collected by the first credential granting authority. If the conditions are satisfied then the server determines that the second credential granting authority trusts biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority. The geographic restrictions may require that the first credential granting authority have had collected the biometric identifier within a particular country or that the collection of the biometric identifier occurred within particular distance of the location of the first credential granting authority. For example the trust data may contain data that indicates that Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected by Organization if the biometric identifiers were collected within ten miles of the location of Organization . The location of Organization as known by the server may be Springfield. The location of the collection of biometric identifiers collected by Organization may be determined to be within seven miles of Springfield based on an IP address of the collection. Because the distance is within the conditions of Organization the server determines that Organization trusts this particular biometric identifier collected by Organization . In some implementations a credential granting authority may trust a biometric identifier collected by another credential granting authority if the user is attempting to access resources associated with the credential in a particular region. For example Organization may trust a biometric identifier collected by Organization if the user is attempting to access resources associated with the Organization credential while in Springfield. Conversely Organization may not trust a biometric identifier collected by Organization if the user is attempting to access resources associated with the Organization credential while outside of Springfield.

The server performs based on the determination that the second credential granting authority trusts biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority biometric identification of the user using the biometric identifier collected by the first credential granting authority . In the case of a voice print the server prompts the user through the user s device such as device to read a text string presented on the device . The user reads the text string and the device sends the voice sample to the server . The server performs biometric identification by comparing the voice sample to the voice print stored in the biometric identifiers .

In some implementations the server accesses the trust data in response to receiving the biometric identifier. The server stores the biometric identifier in association with the second credential granting authority based on the trust data indicating that the second credential granting authority trusts biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority. The server receives a request to access resources of the second credential granting authority and to access those resources the server determines that the second credential granting authority requires biometric identification of the user. The server accesses the stored biometric identifier and compares it to a biometric sample received from the user. In some implementations the stored biometric identifier is stored within the server as shown in with biometric identifiers .

In some implementations the server accesses the trust data in response to receiving the biometric identifier. The server may determine that multiple credential granting authorities trust biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority. In this instance the server may store the biometric identifier in association with the multiple credential granting authorities. The server may access the stored biometric identifier and compare it to a biometric sample received from the user. For example if Organization may require that users access resources associated with Organization using a biometric identifier. To initiate the process of enrolling a user in biometric identification the server determines whether Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected by Organization . In making that determination the server may also determine that Organization and Organization trust biometric identifiers collected by Organization . The server may then store the biometric identifier collected by Organization in association with Organization Organization and Organization . When the user attempts to access resources associated with any of the credentials issued by Organization Organization or Organization that require biometric identification the user will provide a biometric identifier and the server will perform biometric identification based on biometric identifiers collected by Organization .

In some implementations the trust data includes data sufficient to determine all of the credential granting authorities managed by the server system that trust biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority. In such implementations upon collection of a biometric identifier of a user by the first credential granting authority the server evaluates the trust data against the credential granting authorities that have granted credentials to the user and determines a subset of the credential granting authorities that trust the first credential granting authority. The server then may store the biometric identifier of the user collected by the first credential granting authority in association with the subset of the credential granting authorities. Accordingly when the user attempts to perform biometric authentication for one of the subset of the credential granting authorities the server may access the stored biometric identifier of the user collected by the first credential granting authority and use it for the biometric authentication. However when the user attempts to perform biometric authentication for one of the credential granting authorities not included in the subset the server requires another biometric identifier that is different from the biometric identifier of the user collected by the first credential granting authority to perform biometric authentication. In this regard the server requires a biometric identifier collected by a credential granting authority other than the first credential granting authority.

In some implementations the server accesses trust data in response to the user trying to access a resource associated with the second credential granting authority that requires a biometric identifier. For example the user may not have registered a biometric identifier directly with the second credential granting yet but the user may try to access a resource associated with the second credential granting authority using a biometric identifier anyway. In this instance the server determines whether the second credential granting authority trusts biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority or any other credential granting authority and uses the biometric identifier collected by the first credential granting authority to perform biometric identification of the user as a consequence of having determined that the second credential granting authority trusts biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority and as a consequence of having determined that the first credential granting authority has collected a biometric identifier for the user. For example a user may try to access a resource associated with Organization that requires a biometric identifier but before the user has registered a biometric identifier directly with Organization . Upon trying to access the resource associated with Organization the server accesses trust data and determines that Organization trusts biometric identifiers associated with Organization . The server can then use the biometric identifier collected from the user by Organization to perform biometric identification of the user.

In some implementations the server can further add to an account of the user a credential issued by the second credential granting authority based on the user being identified using the biometric identifier. For example if the user requests to add a credential for Organization and Organization requires biometric authentication of a user before allowing the user to add an ABC credential the server may determine that Organization has collected a biometric identifier for the user and that Organization trusts biometric identifiers collected by Organization . Consequently the server can add the credential for Organization to the user s account based on input matching the biometric identifier collected by Organization .

In some implementations the server may determine that the second credential granting authority does not trust biometric identifiers collected by the first credential granting authority. In this instance the server may require that another biometric identifier be used to identify the user when trying to access a resource associated with the second credential granting that requires biometric authentication. For example Organization may require biometric identification to access the resources associated with Organization s credential. The server may determine that the Organization does not trust biometric identifiers collected by Organization and that the user has not registered biometric identifiers with credential granting authorities. Consequently the server may require that in order to use a biometric identifier to access the resource of the Organization the user needs to have a biometric identifier collected by the Organization .
