Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119 the benefit of priority from provisional application 62 219 036 with a filing date of Sep. 15 2015 is claimed for this non provisional application.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to dielectric materials in which the constituent dielectric properties can be adjusted by optical control. In particular this invention relates to techniques for producing a dynamically controllable artificial dielectric AD .

Composite dielectrics are of high interest because their electromagnetic properties can be controlled synthetically. In particular the method of mixing several dielectric components together to achieve a final effective permittivity is useful for many electromagnetic applications and examples have been around for more than a century. As one example there may be a need for a particular permittivity to obtain a specific electromagnetic impedance to minimize radio frequency RF reflection.

A composite material in which at least one of the components is a good conductor is referred to as an artificial dielectric as coined by W. E. Kock Metallic delay lenses 27 1 59 82 January 1948 . The term artificial dielectric is used to distinguish the polarization properties of a conductor from that of an insulating dielectric. The conductor consists of what is known to those skilled in the art as free charge whereas a dielectric insulator consists of bound charge. Either achieves a similar polarization response to an applied electric field. A dynamic photo variable dielectric response can be realized by using a photo conductive material as a component in the composite dielectric H. Kallman et al. Induced conductivity in luminescent powders. II. AC impedance measurements 89 4 700 707 February 1953 . The dielectric permittivity constant of a photo conductive material as a first component component 1 can be represented by the complex relation 

where is the real part of the permittivity j square root over 1 is the imaginary number is the photo conductivity is the angular frequency and the subscript p means photo conductive particulate. In eqn. 1 the imaginary component stems only from conductivity and is assumed to be much larger than from other dielectric loss effects.

For the case of a two element material the permittivity of the second component component 2 can be represented simply as where the subscript b refers to an insulating binder. Here the second component is treated as an insulator and so has conductivity of zero i.c. . 2 

Many dielectric mixing equations exist depending on geometrical and material parameters. One popular mixing equation known by those artisans of ordinary skill is the Lichtenecker equation K. Lichtenecker Die Dielektrizit ts konstante nat rlicher and kunstlicher Mischk rper 27 1926 given by 3 where fis the volumetric fill factor of component 1. Note that eqn. 3 is written for a two component composite dielectric but can be extended to multiple components R. Simpkin Derivation of Lichtenecker s Logarithmic Mixture Formula from Maxwell s Equations 58 3 545 550 March 2010. . This equation is generally appropriate for mixtures that are symmetric meaning that geometrically the particles can be interchanged and the equation remains valid.

For the case that the photo conductive component is within an insulating binder material then another relation has been shown to be effective from Kevin A. Boulais et al. Optically Controllable Composite Dielectric Based on Photo conductive Particulates 62 7 1448 1453 June 2014 .

Conventional dielectrics yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular exemplary embodiments provide a dielectric material for switch control by optical stimulus. The material includes photo conductive particulates and a transparent binder for containing the plurality of particulates to form a photo conductive pigment based matrix. The pigment based matrix is disposed to overlap first and second separate electrodes to produce an electrical junction. Capacitance of the pigment based matrix changes from a first value absent the optical stimulus to a second value in response to illumination at a specific electromagnetic frequency and intensity by the optical stimulus.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

In accordance with a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention the components process steps and or data structures may be implemented using various types of operating systems computing platforms computer programs and or general purpose machines. In addition those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature such as hardwired devices or the like may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herewith. General purpose machines include devices that execute instruction code. A hardwired device may constitute an electric or electromagnetic circuit as a device to control the electromagnetic field.

An important aspect of the optically controllable composite dielectric is that the net capacitance and resistance remain relatively constant over a wide range of signal voltage. show the measured capacitance and resistance for a typical sample as a function of signal voltage for two different optical power densities. There is a clear tendency towards signal voltage independence. This is in contrast to the common varactor method of tuning electromagnetic devices. Varactors use voltage controlled depletion capacitance rendering them inherently non linear with signal voltage. Results are shown for two different optical power densities. View capacitance and view resistance measurements of the composite dielectric showing near linearity with signal voltage ranging from 5 mV to 20 V.

The ink forms an overlap with the electrode of an overlap length and the gap between the electrodes has a width . The ink is composed of undoped semi insulating gallium arsenide or silicon particulates in a poly methyl methacrylate urethane resin binder. In tests the electrode gap widths varied between 0.05 cm and 0.3 cm and the length of the gap was 0.5 cm for all cases.

Exemplary embodiments provide techniques to incorporate materials in photo controllable composite dielectrics using high photo absorptive materials. Practical photo controllable composite dielectrics require tradeoffs in design to achieve a desired parameter space of operation. One tradeoff is the desire to use highly photo conductive particulates as the active component in the composite which has the detrimental effect of limiting the thickness of the material to very thin geometries. For example utilizing band to band transitions of particulates fabricated from semi conducting materials can limit the optical penetration depth.

Incorporating eqn. 1 into eqn. 4 the effective permittivity is found to change with conductivity. illustrates a plot of eqn. 4 for three different conductivity values with the top curves representing the real part of the permittivity while the bottom curves are the imaginary part of the permittivity which shows frequency dispersion. As conductivity increases the curves sweep from left to right towards higher frequencies. As the curves sweep past a selected frequency the effective permittivity changes thus showing photo control of the permittivity.

Such a photo controllable composite dielectric has been demonstrated in which the photo conductive particulate was undoped semi insulating USI GaAs and the binder component was poly methyl methacrylate urethane resin PMMA U . See Boulais 2014 . USI GaAs demonstrates one advantage of using semi conducting or semi insulating particulates that have deep level traps because light can penetrate deep throughout the material.

Using higher intensity light is possible to accomplish this but the alternative method would not be efficient because much of the energy would merely shift the curve to the higher range of frequencies. A more advantageous solution involves a material with a higher value of conductivity at a lower intensity of light to sweep the curve past 10Hz. This renders a more controllable composite dielectric that is more sensitive to light and more efficient.

The selection of natural materials with a desired conductivity can be limiting. In the case of crystalline or organic semiconductors conductivity is often controlled by doping the material with impurities. The absorption rate can be high when bandgap material is used because direct electron hole pair generation stems from the lattice atoms instead of the impurities. High absorption can be desirable due to enhanced sensitivity to light but this can also be less optimal because of limitations in the penetration depth of light. In the case of composite dielectrics high absorption could limit the light from reaching particulates that are deeper within the material and thereby diminishing controllability of the composite dielectric. Such materials would be limited to very thin inks.

For the aforementioned USI GaAs particulates case light absorption was minimal enabling light to reach particulates very deep within the composite. The selected wavelength of light only interacted with deep level traps within the material in K. A. Boulais et al. Circuit analysis of photosensitive capacitance in semi insulating GaAs 60 2 793 798 February 2013 . Direct electron hole pair generation was suppressed. This led to a tradeoff in lowering sensitivity to light and restricted the operable frequency range unless high intensity light was used.

Exemplary embodiments relate to a means to a photo controllable composite dielectric in which the active particulates can be highly photo absorptive thus minimizing the need for the tradeoff between optical sensitivity and composite material thickness. Optical absorption is controlled geometrically instead of by material properties alone. Thus highly absorptive materials can be used while permitting light to penetrate deeper into the composite dielectric to reach particulate throughout. The exemplary technique removes the restriction of low optical absorption for a tunable composite dielectric such as in the case of conventional USI GaAs. In turn this process enables new materials to be used that cover a broader range of frequencies while also having higher sensitivity to light.

Here any range of photo conductivity can be used without concern of high optical absorption. An example of a material might be a semi conductor that photo conducts by light absorption creating direct electron hole pairs. Absorption in many such materials can be excessive thereby limiting light penetration to 100 m for example. Thus if the optically controllable artificial dielectric AD e.g. ink is only 1 m thick then light can reach approximately fifty particulates deep.

Photo capacitive and Photo resistive Ink Based on conductive particulates in binder matrix one desires to produce a practical and affordable manner of large area square meters to several square miles manufacturing of tunable metamaterial MM medium and other tunable electronic devices. Exemplary embodiments provide a liquid suspension that covers the surface of insulators fill cavities or likewise and become part of an electrical circuit.

Alternatively exemplary embodiments include a solid with particulates imbedded within that are distributed homogeneously or non homogeneously. For example a wax material can be used and when heated the wax flows as an ink that includes the particulates. When dried cured or otherwise solidified this material herein called liquid suspension changes the effective capacitance of the covered or filled medium to any electrical signal traveling through the medium when illuminated with light.

This change in capacitance is related to a functional dependence of the intensity of light. The functional dependence could be linear logarithmic or any other mathematical form depending on the particulate material of choice such as USI GaAs and Si. Weak intensities of the illuminating light produce small capacitance changes and high intensities of the illuminating light will produce large capacitance changes. In addition the change in capacitance can be inversely proportional to any mathematical form that describes the intensity of the illuminating light.

The liquid suspension components e.g. binder will also determine the sensitivity to light and which type of light infrared visible ultraviolet produces the desired effect. In addition the particle size and volumetric fraction of the suspension s components affect the optically controllable AD properties under illumination and both properties can be used as parameters to design a medium that satisfies specific requirements for the electronic circuit of interest. The active component of the ink is the particulates but the binding matrix can play an important role to enhance the effect.

There are two fundamental mechanisms to transfer an electrical signal through an arbitrary medium such as the binder conduction and induction. Here the actual electrical charges move through the binder medium with an effective drift velocity. The ability of an electrical charge to travel through the medium varies greatly from material to material. This property is known as the conductivity of the medium or its reciprocal known as the resistivity.

Conductivity and resistivity are the two physical parameters known with the highest ratio between the largest known value and the smallest. For known values the ratio of conductivity to resistivity between the most conductive materials known not including superconductors to the least conductive is on the order of 10. When superconductors are considered this ratio effectively becomes infinitively large.

Another way that electrical signals can travel through a medium is by the mechanism known as displacement. Here the electrical charges do not physically travel through the medium but rather the electrical information travels by changing the polarization of sectors imbedded in the medium. Materials with imbedded polarization are classed as dielectrics and the property that measures this property is the dielectric constant. There is a large range of dielectric values among the materials but not nearly as large as in the case of conductivity. For an electrical signal travel via displacement must vary with time.

An example of time varying electrical signal is the alternating current AC that feeds electricity to home appliances. An ideal insulator is a medium that does not permit any conduction but enables displacement. Such medium can be placed between two conductors in a manner that electrical energy can be stored in such device. This device is commonly known as a capacitor or condenser. Since the early days of electronics the value of a capacitor has been recognized. Capacitors are used in almost every circuit that uses AC electricity.

By varying the dimensions of the electrodes and insulator different values of capacitance can be achieved. Traditionally when a capacitor capable of a capacitance change is used the capacitance change is achieved by mechanical means. This means that somehow either changing the relative surface area of the electrodes or changing the distance of the gap between the electrodes using mechanical devises achieves the required capacitance. Mechanical devises are very slow compared to the times required in some applications durations as small as 10sec . For applications where mechanical actuators cannot be used changing the capacitance using light could be the desired solution.

Photo capacitance is the ability to change the effective capacitance of a medium using light. In the 1970s many researchers used this property to characterize the electrical properties of GaAs and as a quality control criterion. GaAs photo capacitance is optimally produced by infrared light approx. 0.950 m wavelength when using sub bandgap light energies that interact with deep level traps.

A very simple and effective photo capacitor can be made by placing a GaAs wafer between two metal electrodes and impose illumination. When such device is connected to a high frequency AC resonant electric circuit the resonance frequency will change by changing the intensity of the infrared light. Boulais 2013 demonstrated the ability of GaAs tuning a split ring resonator SRR from 100 MHz up to 1.8 GHz by changing the intensity of infrared light illuminating a GaAs crystal placed in the gap of the ring. An SRR is an electrical structure that consists of a conductor shaped as a ring with a small gap. The gap is used to provide the ring with capacitance. These structures have been extensively studied in the last fourteen years because of artisan interest in electromagnetic metamaterials.

Metamaterials are periodic structures of electrical devices. These structures potentially have the ability to show electromagnetic properties like electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability very different to any known natural material. Metamaterials can have remarkable properties but they are inherently resonant structures. This means that they tend to exhibit their properties in one narrow frequency value including the development of tunable metamaterials.

The results of Boulais 2013 are the first to demonstrate the possibility of a large bandwidth tunable metamaterial. However satisfaction of military and commercial needs by metamaterials requires developing the capability to manufacture large structures in an economical and practical way. These GaAs single crystal photo capacitors placed in the SRR s gap are not a cost effective solution to the manufacturing process. A better solution is an ink substance that can be printed on split ring gaps at large area fast production factories. The manufacturing process can be accomplished with the exemplary photo capacitive ink . Exemplary devices can be used to tune any device as well as frequency selective surfaces and non periodic structures and not only metamaterials.

Exemplary embodiments provide a medium that features an electrical capacitance or conductance change when illuminated with light. The components within the medium include photoconductive pigment such as from semiconductor particulates e.g. USI GaAs and Si . The medium features photo capacitance in powder form other types of photoconductive media also in powder form and any binder that could be solvent based. Binders could include thermoplastic solid materials such as wax.

In all methods the powder components may be surface modified to enhance compatibility with the binder. The exemplary sample used poly methyl methacrylate or PMMA as the polymer intrinsic GaAs in powder form and acetone or CH CO as the solvent. An alternate exemplary sample used semiconductor grade wax such as Aremco Products Inc. Crystalbond 509 translucent to the frequency of infrared light being used and intrinsic GaAs in powder form.

The purpose of the dielectric is to create large capacitance between the particulates . The purpose of the particulate that form the pigment is to provide a lossy capacitance in which the loss is optically controlled. All the components are mixed in solution and the suspension is applied in the part of the circuit component to be tuned using light. Thus the real part curves of the dielectric constant of the medium mixture can be adjusted by optically controlling the imaginary part curves of the dielectric through the Kramers Konig relation which is well known to artisans of ordinary skill.

Prior to mixing the surface properties of the powder materials may be adjusted using surface modifying groups such as alkyl silane or alkyl phosphonate molecules to enhance integration with the other mixture components. Alkyl phosphonates are esters of phosphoric acid. The suspension is permitted to completely dry. Once dried the newly formed electrical photocapacitor is connected to a high frequency AC electrical circuit. The resonant frequency of the AC circuit is measured and the ink is illuminated with light. In exemplary embodiments a solid state infrared laser has been used to illuminate at an infrared wavelength of 0.950 m. The intensity of the light is varied and the resonant frequency of the circuit changes.

A mathematical model can be used to clarify the electrical behavior of the tunable pigment based ink in an example configuration. The model defines the ingredients of the ink in terms of electrical components and . The behavior is then clearly evident even though in practice the physical implementation can be quite different. For example the model assumes a periodic arrangement of unit cells medium and particulate but in practice the arrangement can be random.

In the exemplary model the photo sensitive pigments component of the optically controllable AD or ink in one such application are particulates of semiconducting or semi insulating materials. However they can also be other materials such as photo conductive polymers photo sensitive molecular doped polymers liquid crystal powder and barium titanate BaTiO powder for example. Thus a single particulate can be represented electrically as a parallel combination of one resistor and one capacitor . The binder surrounding the particulates forming the matrix is assumed to be purely insulating and is represented in terms of pure capacitance .

The binder must be transparent or translucent to the photon energy such that light can reach pigment material deep within the material although exceptionally thin inks might not require this restriction single layer for example . The light causes an increase in conductive charge which changes the electric and magnetic dipole moment of the particulate .

Although it is not necessary binder materials with high dielectric constant and low loss tangent have better performance because high permittivity can increase the tuning range of capacitance and resistance. Candidate materials for the binder can be but not limited to polymer ceramic e.g. polysiloxanes strontium titanate SrTiO titanium dioxide TiO and magnesium titanate MgTiO . The model assumes a periodic arrangement of unit cells consisting of particulates and binder that are arranged in a block like structure. Further magnetic materials can be added to the binder material to control the magnetic properties. This enables different ranges of optically controllable impedance materials.

The function of electron and hole density with light is well known to those skilled in the art as described in R. S. Muller et al. 2e John Wiley Sons New York 1986. The light can be greater than the bandgap of the particulate material or less than the bandgap when traps exist within the bandgap. Such traps can occur naturally near the middle of the bandgap and are common in many forms of semiconducting material including GaAs silicon carbide SiC and gallium nitride GaN for example.

To be useful in circuit application for example the final form of impedance can be described as a series combination of resistance and capacitance. The photo sensitive capacitance is a useful part of the tunable pigment based ink and is given by 

Much information can be learned from these equations and from which shows typical variation of capacitance and resistance as a function of for values dielectric constants 13.1 F m particulate 2.6 F m binder frequency 2 10rad s i.e. 1 MHz volume fraction V 0.5 and area to length ratio A L 1 m. Capacitance and resistance as a function of particulate resistivity for a frequency of 1 MHz.

The resistivity is controllable via light intensity. In the limit of infinite resistivity as the capacitance is represented by a simple dielectric mixture. By contrast as resistivity reduces to zero as 0 the capacitance is represented by an artificial dielectric. For example increasing light intensity decreases resistivity along the abscissa and in turn increases capacitance. The parameters listed in are common of many of the materials that compose the optically controllable AD or tunable pigment ink . In particular the dielectric constant for the particulate is for GaAs and for the binder being typical for PMMA. Physically artisans of ordinary skill can recognize that the ink moves from a dielectric mixing response at high resistivity to an artificial dielectric response at low resistivity.

In some applications resistive loss is not desirable and should be minimized. The peak in resistive loss of tunable pigment based ink can be determined by mathematical means from eqn. 16 as 

Thus the loss can be very small for high frequencies. Using the parameters listed in the loss can be plotted as a function of frequency as shown in . As can be observed from eqn. 17 and the loss becomes diminishingly small at high frequencies. Dependent on applications the composite inks offer two different functions tunable photo capacitance and tunable photo resistance. Both functions are optically controlled and can be easily integrated into various tunable devices. shows the plot view with the resistive loss as a function of frequency.

Another advantage of exemplary embodiments as demonstrated in this model is that the range of capacitance can be enhanced using various techniques. The change in capacitance can be determined by mathematical means from eqn. 14 as 

Range of capacitance in the tunable ink as a function of fractional volume of particulates for the parameters listed in . Capacitance range can also be enhanced by increasing the dielectric constant of the binder . This is shown in again using the parameters of . Range of capacitance in the tunable ink as a function of the binder dielectric constant for the parameters listed in .

The reason the capacitance range increases with increasing binder dielectric constant is that the electric field interaction between particulates is stronger thus enhancing the artificial dielectric effect at small resistances in . Capacitance range also increases when the particulate dielectric constant decreases.

Another aspect of exemplary embodiments involves adding a third component or even higher order number of components to the tunable ink to make enhance capacitance range. The technique is known as dielectric mixing. Typically one mixes a high dielectric material to increase a lower dielectric material such as a high dielectric powder to a low dielectric polymer binder to enhance the dielectric strength of the mixture while maintaining the structural or adhesive properties of the polymer. The technique can be used for the tunable pigment ink to enhance the interaction between the active particulates thus enhancing the capacitance range.

Another important advantage of exemplary embodiments involves the capacitance and resistance as described by eqns. 14 and 16 not being functions of voltage. This means that changes in signal amplitude do not influence the impedance of the tunable ink significantly. For example in a tuned inductive capacitive tank circuit the resonant frequency does not shift with signal voltage in the case of tunable ink which is a major advantage. Changes in capacitance due to changes in signal voltage can add harmonic generation to the signal which is often undesirable.

Different formulations have been attempted by varying the GaAs particle size. For a particular GaAs size several formulations with varying volume fractions of GaAs particulates to polymer binder were also evaluated. Photo capacitance has been observed in all samples. However there were significant differences in the amount of photo capacitance observed. For GaAs particles a size of about 0.5 mm 0.5 mm 1.00 mm in a volume of GaAs to polymer provided the largest photo capacitance effect of all formulation attempted.

To date a formulation has not been produced with a photo capacitance effect as large as in single crystal GaAs which has effectively a volume fraction ratio of unity or V 1. However the measured effect of the inks produced thus far is sufficiently inclusive to be used in many applications including tunable MMs.

Particulates of GaAs particles in wax have also been found to be translucent to infrared and again photo capacitance and photo resistance was observed. Semi insulating GaAs has also been used in experiments but as the theory indicates any photo conductive material can be used for the particulates including photo conductive polymers for example. Tunable metamaterials have great potential in everything related to electromagnetics. The photo capacitive ink can accelerate the implementation of many commercial applications.

Exemplary embodiments provide a process to optically control the effective permittivity of an artificial dielectric and enables the active inclusions to be fabricated from pulverized semi insulating material. The electric dipoles from the inclusions are controlled by photo generation of charge carriers using infrared light. An infrared transparent binder provides the matrix material. An important feature of the exemplary process is that the permittivity is linear with electric field intensity over a useable parameter space.

The primary application involves a pigment based ink or paint to be utilized as a tuning mechanism for metamaterials and other resonant based structures. Other applications include a controllable gradient index lens in which inhomogeneous light intensity can provide a dynamic response for focusing or steering of beams and RF circuit elements including filters phase delays antennae and other microwave devices.

Frequency selective surfaces FSS are EM materials that also have a periodic arrangement of resonant conductive inclusions that can be used to control EM radiation. The FSS is typically fabricated in planar form to control the transmission or reflection properties of EM radiation. In terms of wave propagation in a periodic structure the FSS utilizes the optical branch and the MM utilizes the acoustic branch. The electromagnetic bandgap EMB between these branches provides a stop band that is useful to minimize surface waves for example.

Exemplary embodiments provide dynamic control to the effective permittivity of an AD by using light by exploiting photo conductive particulates in place of the fixed conductors used for static ADs. Infrared light is used to short out the parasitic capacitance of the particulates leaving only the series capacitance between the particulates.

The change in internal capacitance appears as a constituent change in permittivity for wavelengths much greater than the particulate size and spacing. As a dynamically controllable AD by optical photon stimuli the notion of a controllable lens in which an EM beam can be focused to various lengths or steered in different directions comes to mind. Of particular interest is the incorporation of these materials as a pigment based ink that can be printed at low cost to tune resonant MM EBG and FSS structures or RF components such as filters phase delays and small antennae.

In experimental results active particulates were prepared by pulverizing USI GaAs using a mortise and pedestal. The slightly n type USI GaAs had a room temperature resistivity of 2.3 10 cm. Once pulverized the particulates were embedded in one of several types of matrix materials for the binder including poly methyl methacrylate PMMA or semiconductor grade mounting wax. In both cases the matrix binder was sufficiently transparent to infrared light necessary to enable deep activation of the USI GaAs particulates . Scanning electron micrographs of the pulverized material through various stages of preparation are shown in as USI GaAs particulates. These views for pulverized USI GaAs include first size second size third size and after size sorting .

The ink was formed over various gap widths between two copper strips. The length of the gap for all cases was 0.5 cm and the ink overlapped the copper electrodes at the gap edges by approximately 0.3 cm. Attempts were made to control the thickness and overlap of the ink although variations did occur. Typical ink thicknesses were on the order of 0.1 cm. Low frequency signals were found to aid in accurate resistive loss measurements. An HP 4284A precision LCR meter capable of frequencies up to 1 MHz was used for the measurements in series resistance capacitance mode. A 100 mV signal voltage was employed to measure the complex impedance as a function of optical power density gap length and probe frequency. A power calibrated yttrium doped fiber laser with wavelength 1.07 m was used to illuminate the sample uniformly. Measurements were acquired at room temperature in a darkened room.

Results for capacitance and resistance for various gap sizes are shown in respectively for a typical sample. Although particle size included varied particulate the range of 0.025 cm to 0.050 cm was found to be optimal for USI GaAs and these values are assumed unless otherwise noted. From the percent change in capacitance between 0 mW cmand 500 mW cmillumination is 62 58 45 and 35 for gaps of 0.05 cm 0.1 cm 0.2 cm and 0.3 cm respectively. That the smallest gap has the highest change in capacitance may have to do with the particulate size being of the same order as the gap thus representing more of a single crystal effect rather than an AD effect.

In each resistance curve has a characteristic peak. The peak is attributed to the manner in which the particulates interact to form the imaginary part of the net series impedance. show series capacitance and series resistance measurements for dynamically controllable ink based on pulverized USI GaAs pigment as a function of power density.

From the capacitor viewpoint one can first derive the effective permittivity from the single unit cell model . Then one can show that the permittivity derived from the cell model indeed represents the effective permittivity of the bulk material. Assume the electric field is directed from top to bottom on the cell model which is modeled as a series connection of two sections from top to bottom separated by the particulate .

Results for capacitance and resistance for various gap sizes are shown in respectively for samples with particulate sizes ranging over 0.025 cm to 0.040 cm. Effects from the substrate were subtracted from the data by assuming a lossless capacitance in parallel with the capacitance of the composite dielectric on the opposing side of the electrodes . Using the analysis by T. Chen et al. Analysis of a Concentric Coplanar Capacitive Sensor Using a Spectral Domain Approach 30 AIP Conf. Proced. 1335 1647 1654 2011 and U.S. Pat. No. 8 791 707 for materials on coplanar electrodes substrate capacitances of 0.22 0.18 0.14 0.12 pF have been calculated for gap widths of 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 cm respectively. A relative dielectric constant for FR 4 of 4.8 was used for the substrate at 1 MHz in the calculation. The analysis in Chen 2011 does not account for skin effect in the calculations.

The anticipated trend of increasing composite capacitance with increasing optical power density is evident as the particulate capacitance changes to conductive behavior. From the percent changes in capacitance between 0 mW cmand 500 mW cmillumination for gaps of 0.05 0.10 0.20 0.30 cm are 87 84 60 53 respectively. That the largest gaps have the smallest change in capacitance is likely associated with a larger portion of electric flux lying outside of the composite thereby diluting the effect as discussed by Chen et al.

Another contribution could be due the granularity of the matrix as compared to the smaller gaps. In the limiting case of a single particulate making intimate contact with the electrodes the inter particulate capacitance stems only from the depletion regions within the USI GaAs. Single crystal configurations have been reported to produce dramatic change in capacitance.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
