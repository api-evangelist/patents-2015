title: Anonymous customer reference services enabler
abstract: Variable subscriber identifiers (V-SubIds) for protecting subscriber privacy are generated and managed. In one aspect, an Anonymous Customer Reference Services (ACRS) component generates a V-SubId, which is a short-lived subscriber identifier that is inserted in a request received from a user equipment during request enrichment. Moreover, a different V-SubId can be inserted in subsequent request from the user equipment and thus, cross-site behavior tracking can be mitigated. In one aspect, the V-SubId can be exchanged for a subscriber identifier (SubId) associated with the user equipment, upon query by trusted systems/applications. Further, the V-SubId can be exchanged for a site-specific Anonymous Customer Reference (ACR) upon query by untrusted systems/applications, if user authorization is received. Moreover, the life cycle of the ACR is managed by the ACRS component, based on subscriber input.

Application app developers and other potentially non trusted entities can monitor and or track communication device users through a unique identifier ID e.g. subscriber identifier SubId related to a subscriber of the communication device creating privacy problems for the users. The systems and methods disclosed herein facilitate generation and utilization of a variable subscriber ID V SubId to prevent profiling and or subscriber behavior tracking by unauthorized applications entities. In one aspect the V SubId masks the subscriber s identity e.g. the unique SubId from selected unauthorized websites which are accessed by the subscribers and accordingly protects subscriber privacy.

Aspects or features of the disclosed subject matter can be exploited in substantially any wired or wireless communication technology e.g. Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS Wi Fi Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX General Packet Radio Service GPRS Enhanced GPRS Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE Third Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 Ultra Mobile Broadband UMB High Speed Packet Access HSPA Zigbee or another IEEE 802.XX technology. Additionally substantially all aspects of the disclosed subject matter can be exploited in legacy e.g. wireline telecommunication technologies.

The systems and methods disclosed herein in one aspect thereof can mitigate user activity tracking and or profiling by unauthorized entities e.g. websites systems etc. by utilization of variable subscriber identifiers V SubIds during request enrichment. In one aspect the disclosed subject matter relates to a system comprising at least one memory that stores computer executable instructions and at least one processor communicatively coupled to the at least one memory that facilitates execution of the computer executable instructions. Moreover the computer executable instructions on execution perform an authentication of a user equipment to allow the user equipment to connect with a telecommunications network wherein the authentication employing a static identifier associated with the user equipment. Further the computer executable instructions on execution receive in the telecommunications network from the user equipment a request for an operation to be performed by an untrusted entity accessible via the telecommunications network. Additionally the computer executable instructions on execution based on the authentication assign a variable subscriber identifier to the static identifier associated with the user equipment insert the variable subscriber identifier into the request and facilitate transmission of the request including the inserted variable subscriber identifier to the untrusted entity.

Another aspect of the disclosed subject matter relates to a method that includes receiving by a system comprising at least one processor a query for a variable subscriber identifier that is to be inserted into a request from a user equipment the request being directed to an untrusted entity. Further the method includes identifying by the system a static identifier associated with the user equipment based in part on an authorization of the user equipment with a telecommunications network automatically generating by the system the variable subscriber identifier and assigning by the system the variable subscriber identifier to the static identifier. Yet another aspect of the disclosed subject matter relates to a computer readable storage medium comprising computer executable instructions that in response to execution cause a system including at least one processor to perform operations including determining that a request received at a telecommunications network from a user equipment is directed to an untrusted entity accessible via the telecommunications network based on analyzing the request the request being for an operation to be performed by the untrusted entity identifying a static identifier associated with the user equipment based in part on an authorization of the user equipment with the telecommunications network and obtaining a variable subscriber identifier assigned to the static identifier associated with the user equipment. In addition the operations include inserting the variable subscriber identifier into the request and directing the request with the variable subscriber identifier thus inserted to the untrusted entity.

Referring initially to there illustrated is an example system that facilitates utilization of a V SubId to protect user privacy according to one or more aspects of the disclosed subject matter. System can utilize SIM and or SIM based authentication assets to differentiate between trusted and untrusted networks and or services. Moreover system can be utilized to mask or replace a unique ID associated with a user equipment UE during communication between the UE and one or more systems services. Typically UE can include most any electronic communication device such as but not limited to most any consumer electronic device for example a tablet computer a digital media player a digital photo frame a digital camera a cellular phone a personal computer a personal digital assistant PDA a smart phone a laptop a gaming system etc. Further UE can also include for example LTE based devices such as but not limited to most any home or commercial appliance that includes an LTE radio. It can be noted that UE can be mobile have limited mobility and or be stationary. Typically the subscriber of the UE is assigned a unique and constant subscriber identifier SubId for example that is associated with the subscriber identity module SIM and or subscriber account associated with the UE . In one example the SubId is independent of a Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number MSISDN and SIM of the UE and does not change if the MSISDN is modified and or SIM is replaced.

In one embodiment system can include a network gateway for example deployed within a core mobility network e.g. cellular network that facilitates routing of a request s received from UE . As an example the network gateway can include but is not limited to a proxy server e.g. a Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP proxy server a next generation gateway NGG and or a multi service proxy MSP . Moreover the UE can be coupled to the network gateway via one or more radio access network s and or network elements not shown of the mobility network. In one aspect the UE for example on power on or on entering a coverage area of the mobility network can perform a SIM authentication with the mobility network e.g. via handshaking with a home location register HLR to authorize the UE to communicate via the mobility network. By way of example on authentication a network support node for example Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN can assign an Internet protocol IP address to the UE identify a device number such as but not limited to a MSISDN associated with the UE e.g. from the HLR and propagate the IP address and corresponding MSISDN to downstream network elements such as the network gateway . Moreover when a request from UE is received the network gateway can detect an IP address from the request and accordingly determine the corresponding MSISDN associated with the IP address. Moreover the request as disclosed herein can include most any communication message delivered from the UE to a network server e.g. a web server an application server an email server etc. . In one example the request can include but is not limited to a request for information data from the network server. In another example the request can also include but is not limited to an instruction and or command for requesting the network server to perform a specific action e.g. load a new web page refresh a web page delete an email etc. . In yet another example the request can include a HTTP request e.g. a GET request a PUT request a DELETE request etc. . However it is noted that the subject disclosure is not limited to HTTP requests and that the UE can transmit requests utilizing most any communication protocol for example but not limited to Secure HTTP S HTTP HTTP Secure HTTPS SPDY protocol Waka protocol a proprietary protocol etc. Moreover if the UE utilizes a secure protocol such as but not limited to S HTTP and or HTTPS a network server not shown can perform a HTTP Redirect onto an endpoint within the server served by HTTP such that the network gateway can enrich the request with V SubId SubId. Further although mobility and or cellular networks are described herein it is noted that the network gateway can reside within most any communication network e.g. wired or wireless that facilitates authentication with UE based on a unique ID credential associated with the UE and or subscriber of the UE prior to the UE connecting to and or accessing the communication network.

In one aspect the network gateway can employ a SubId enrichment policy wherein on receiving a request communication and or data packet from UE the network gateway identifies a SubId associated with the MSISDN of the UE and enriches a header of the request with the SubId data based in part on the destination of the request. Typically the SubId is a unique and unchangeable identifier associated with a subscriber of UE . In particular the network gateway can determine whether the destination of the request is a trusted entity ies e.g. an entity authorized to access the SubId or an untrusted entity ies e.g. an entity that is not authorized to access the SubId for example based on a destination uniform resource locator URL within the request. In one example if the network gateway determines that the destination of the request is a trusted entity the header of the request can be updated with the SubId associated with UE and the updated request can be forwarded to the trusted entity . As an example the trusted entity can utilize the SubId to enable consistent data services and or a seamless service experience across data sessions for the UE e.g. one click payment taking advantage of implicit authentication already done as part of the device s logging on and or connecting to the mobile network .

Alternatively if the network gateway determines that the destination of the request is an untrusted entity the header of the request is updated with a V SubId . The updated request can then be forwarded to the untrusted entity . As an example the V SubId can change with time e.g. periodically on demand based on an event schedule etc. and or across data sessions such that the untrusted entity cannot track and or profile subscriber activity. Moreover the V SubId can be randomly generated unique opaque and or can be repeated and or reused. Accordingly the V SubId due to its changing nature can prevent traceability of the subscriber by the untrusted entity while allowing a network service provider to uniquely identify the subscriber associated with the V SubId if the need arises e.g. for law enforcement .

Referring now to there illustrated is an example system that facilitates generation and transmission of V SubIds over a mobility network in accordance with an aspect of the subject disclosure. To mitigate the risk of undesired subscriber behavior tracking by unauthorized systems system facilitates V SubId insertion in a data packet in place of a unique SubId insertion in response to the data packet being directed to the unauthorized systems. It is noted that the UE network gateway trusted entity ies and untrusted entity ies can include functionality as more fully described herein for example as described above with regard to system .

In one embodiment the network gateway can include a request analysis component that can determine whether a request received from UE is to be enriched with a V SubId or a unique SubId e.g. a SubId that is constant static . The request analysis component can receive the request from the UE and can analyze at least a portion of the request for example a header e.g. HTTP header associated with the request. In one example the request analysis component can based on the analysis identify a destination URL to which the request is directed. Further the request analysis component can compare the destination URL with a set of authorized and or trusted URLs stored in whitelist s that is retained in a URL data store . By way of example whitelist s can include a set of URLs associated with trusted websites systems content providers service providers etc. In an aspect the whitelist s can typically be created updated and or managed by a network operator associated with the network service provider. Further the request analysis component can determine an IP address of the UE e.g. based on the analysis of the request and can identify a corresponding device ID e.g. MSISDN of the UE .

Moreover if the request analysis component identifies that the destination URL is within the whitelist s then a request enrichment component can map the device ID e.g. MSISDN to a unique SubId associated with the subscriber e.g. via a database lookup and insert the SubId within the request e.g. within the header of the request . Further the request enrichment component can forward the enriched updated request to a trusted entity associated with the destination URL. Alternatively if the request analysis component identifies that the destination URL is not within the whitelist s then the request enrichment component can determine a V SubId for the request. According to an embodiment the request enrichment component can access an anonymous customer reference services ACRS component to receive the V SubId. Moreover the ACRS component can facilitate generation and management of V SubIds. Further the ACRS component can provide a SIM based Identity e.g. based on a SIM based authentication performed as part of the UE s connecting to the mobility network to external systems and application developers. As an example the V SubId can include most any random opaque unique for a specific time and or session number or code that can change based on an event criterion such as but not limited to expiration of a timer termination of a data session etc. In an aspect the ACRS component can generate the V SubId by employing most any random number generator that can create the V SubId based on or independent of the SubId MSISDN device ID etc. For example the ACRS component can utilize a 32 digit long random number or an MD5 hash of a random number.

Further the ACRS component can store e.g. temporarily or permanently the V SubId in one or more tables retained within ID data store . As an example a one to one mapping can typically exist between the V SubId and the SubId associated with the UE such that a SubId query based on the V SubId can be performed e.g. by service provider partner systems law enforcement systems etc. and the SubId corresponding to the queried V SubId be retrieved. In one aspect the ACRS component can determine when the subscriber s data session has ended or a timer associated with the V SubId has expired and can remove and or modify the V SubId from the one or more tables . As an example transaction logs associated with creation and or modification of records e.g. including the V SubId within the one or more tables can be saved e.g. by the ACRS component such that a subscriber s transaction can be identified at a later time e.g. for law enforcement purposes .

In one aspect on receiving a request for a V SubId from the request enrichment component the ACRS component can perform a table lookup to determine if the subscriber for the destination URL has a previously generated valid and or non expired V SubId stored in the one or more tables . If a valid and or non expired V SubId exists for the subscriber the existing V SubId can be returned to the request enrichment component by the ACRS component . In contrast if valid and or non expired V SubId does not exist for the subscriber the ACRS component can generate a new V SubId and return the new V SubId to the request enrichment component . In one aspect the request enrichment component can insert the V SubId within the request e.g. within the header and forward the enriched updated request to an untrusted entity associated with the destination URL. Additionally or optionally the V SubId can be stored at the network gateway for a specific period e.g. 24 hours to avoid and or mitigate communication between the request enrichment component and the ACRS component . In one aspect to further increase efficiency the request enrichment component can utilize the same V SubId while not expired across all untrusted entities for a specific time.

Accordingly system facilitates delivery of SubIds to the trusted entity ies and delivery of V SubIds to the untrusted entity ies . Although only whitelist s are depicted and described herein it is noted that the URL data store can also include blacklist s that specify URL s of untrusted entity ies to which a V SubId and not a SubId is to be transmitted. Further it is noted that the URL data store and the ID data store can include volatile memory s or nonvolatile memory s or can include both volatile and nonvolatile memory s . Examples of suitable types of volatile and non volatile memory are described below with reference to . The memory e.g. data stores databases of the subject systems and methods is intended to comprise without being limited to these and any other suitable types of memory.

Referring now to there illustrated is an example system that facilitates a reverse lookup for a SubId by a trusted entity according to an aspect of the subject disclosure. Typically system can be utilized for providing an ID associated with a subscriber e.g. static or dynamic to one or more websites systems platforms etc. to facilitate communication with UE . It is noted that the UE network gateway untrusted entity ies ACRS component and ID data store can include functionality as more fully described herein for example as described above with regard to systems and . System can include a trusted entity ies such as but not limited to a trusted website system network platform server etc. which can be authorized e.g. by the user and or service provider to receive and or utilize a SubId associated with the subscriber for example for value added services. Moreover the trusted entity ies can be substantially similar to trusted entity ies and can include functionality as more fully described herein for example as described above with regard to trusted entity ies .

In one aspect the UE can access the trusted entity ies via the untrusted entity ies . For example a trusted website can be accessed by the UE from a link on an untrusted website. As described herein the network gateway provides a V SubId to the untrusted entity ies during communication between the UE and the untrusted entity ies . As an example the V SubId is inserted within a request from the UE to the untrusted entity ies for example within a header e.g. HTTP header in the request and or the body of the request. In another example the V SubId can be appended to the header and or body of the request. The V SubId can be transmitted through a communication network for example via one or more websites servers systems to the trusted entity ies . Based on an analysis of the request the trusted entity ies can detect that the received ID e.g. within a header of a request is a V SubId. For example V SubIds can have a specific configuration and or syntax such as but not limited to a predefined code within the first last N digits characters wherein N can be most any positive integer which can be identified by the trusted entity ies to verify that the received ID is a V SubId.

According to an embodiment the trusted entity ies can exchange the V SubId for a SubId associated with the subscriber via an application programming interface API platform . As an example the API platform can receive the V SubId from the trusted entity ies verify that the trusted entity ies is authorized to receive the SubId e.g. based on a URL associated with the trusted entity ies and query the ACRS component for the SubId on successful verification. In one aspect the ACRS component can perform a reverse lookup to retrieve a SubId corresponding to the V SubId from the ID data store . As an example the API platform can provide an appropriate interface e.g. Representational state transfer RESTful interface Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP interface etc. to facilitate communication between the trusted entity ies and the ACRS component . Additionally or alternatively the trusted entity ies can determine and or generate the SubId based on a decoding technique algorithm applied to the V SubId in response to the V SubId being generated based on applying a coding technique algorithm to the SubId. For example the V SubId can be generated based on a hash signature of the SubId and the trusted entity ies can identify the SubId by applying an inverse hash signature algorithm to the V SubId.

As an example the trusted entity ies can utilize the SubId to apply user preferences and or enable consistent data services and provide a seamless service experience across data sessions. Accordingly system can enrich a header e.g. HTTP header with a V SubId that cannot be utilized by untrusted entities for subscriber profiling and can provide an API platform that enables the trusted entity ies to securely retrieve the SubId using the V SubId. Although it is depicted in as residing outside the ACRS component the ID data store also can reside e.g. completely or partially within the ACRS component and or be locally or remotely coupled to the ACRS component .

In one aspect the API platform provides an interface for the untrusted entity ies to make a request for an ACR based on user authorization. Moreover the ACRS component can generate ACRs and manage ACR lifecycles. As an example the ACR can include most any random number that can be based on or independent of a SubId. Typically the ACR can be specific to a particular website or set of websites and or can be static for a specified time period. On receiving a request to generate an ACR for a specific untrusted entity ies the API platform can facilitate authorization e.g. depicted as a dotted line in with the UE to receive subscriber consent and or approval. As an example the authorization can include but is not limited to an OAuth flow that is used to ensure subscriber s authorization for the ACR request by the untrusted entity ies . OAuth is a security protocol that is developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF OAuth Working Group and is defined by Hammer et al. The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol draft ietf oauth v2 23 Jan. 21 2012 which is incorporated by reference herein. It is noted that the subject disclosure is not limited to the OAuth protocol and most any communication protocol can be utilized for authorization. On receiving subscriber authorization API platform can request the ACRS component to generate the ACR and transmit the ACR e.g. through API Platform to the untrusted entity ies . In addition the ACRS component can generate and store the ACR in a table within the ID data store . Moreover if user authorization is not received the API Platform will not forward the ACR request from the untrusted entity ies to the ACRS component .

While the ACR is active for a given URL the ACRS component can provide the ACR to the network gateway for enrichment of subsequent requests to the untrusted entity ies from the UE . As an example the expiration time associated with the ACR can be specified by the user during authorization and or can be set to a code e.g. 999 that indicates that the ACR will not expire unless explicitly requested by the subscriber and or the untrusted entity ies . Further the untrusted entity ies and or subscriber via UE can request an ACR cancellation through API platform . As an example OAuth flow can be employed to ensure subscriber s authorization for the ACR cancellation if requested by the untrusted entity ies e.g. the same OAuth token that was utilized to create the ACR can be reused to cancel the ACR . Moreover on receiving the ACR cancellation request e.g. authorized by the subscriber the ACRS component can remove the ACR from the table and notify the network gateway of the cancelled ACR.

According to one aspect the ACR can include a predefined code for example within the first last N digits characters wherein N can include most any positive integer which can be identified by a trusted entity e.g. trusted entity ies accessed via untrusted entity ies to verify that the received ID is an ACR. Moreover as with the V SubId the trusted entity can exchange the ACR for a SubId associated with the subscriber via the API platform . In one example the API platform can receive the ACR from the trusted entity determine that the trusted entity is authorized to receive the SubId e.g. based on a URL associated with the trusted entity and query the ACRS component for the SubId on successful verification. In one aspect the ACRS component can perform a reverse lookup to retrieve a SubId corresponding to the ACR from the ID data store .

Referring now to there illustrated is an example system that utilizes SIM based authentication to provide site specific ACRs according to an aspect of the disclosed subject matter. Typically the UE network gateway trusted entity ies untrusted entity ies ACRS component ID data store and API platform can include functionality as more fully described herein for example as described above with regard to systems .

In this embodiment initially the network gateway provides a V SubId e.g. in a request header to both trusted entity ies and untrusted entity ies . As described herein with respect to system the untrusted entity ies can request an ACR via API platform . In one aspect the trusted entity ies of system can also request an ACR via the API platform . Moreover the API platform can receive user authorization prior to the ACRS component generating ACRs for the trusted entity ies and or untrusted entity ies . On receiving user approval the ACRS component can create and or store respective ACRs for the trusted entity ies and untrusted entity ies . In one example the ACRs can be utilized by the network gateway for subsequent requests from the UE that are directed to the trusted entity ies and or untrusted entity ies for example until deleted and or cancelled by the subscriber and or the entity e.g. the trusted entity ies and or untrusted entity ies .

Further the network gateway can insert the V SubId in an extended HTTP header that provides subscriber identification data for example an x up subno header . It is to be noted that x up subno is one example of a field gateway parameter inserted within and or added to an HTTP header in a request message e.g. received from UE for example by a network gateway e.g. network gateway and that the subject disclosure is not limited to x up subno headers. At the network gateway can transmit the x up subno header to the untrusted entity . In one aspect the V SubId can be forwarded for example via a set of networked elements links from the untrusted entity to a trusted entity as depicted by dotted line . At the trusted entity can transmit a SubId lookup request with the V SubId as an input parameter to the API platform . In response at the API platform can query the ACRS component with the V SubId. As an example the ACRS component can perform a reverse lookup to determine the SubId corresponding to the received V SubId. At the ACRS component can transmit the SubId to the API platform which in turn can forward the SubId to the trusted entity at .

In one aspect the untrusted entity can exchange the V SubId for a static ACR based on user authorization. At the untrusted entity can facilitate user authorization e.g. via an authorization server associated with the service provider to make a request for an ACR. For example the untrusted entity via a web browser displayed on UE can query whether the user would like the untrusted entity to remember preferences and or credentials associated with the user and or UE . If the user provides a positive acknowledgment an authorization token can be provided e.g. via the authorization server to the untrusted entity which in turn can utilize the authorization token to facilitate receipt of the ACR. Moreover on receiving user authorization at the untrusted entity can transmit a GET ACR command to the API platform e.g. including transmitting the authorization token to the API platform .

On receiving verifying user authorization based on the authorization token at the API platform can transmit an ACRgetcreate query to the ACRS component . ACRgetcreate is a routine function called by the API platform to retrieve an ACR from the ACRS component . As an example the ACRgetcreate can include input parameters such as V SubId e.g. provided by the untrusted entity and or SubId e.g. provided by the API platform and a uniform resource identifier URI e.g. provided by the API platform as registered by the untrusted entity at on boarding . In response the ACRS component can generate the ACR for the untrusted entity and at and the ACR can be transmitted to the untrusted entity via the API platform . In addition at the ACRS component can notify the network gateway of the newly generated ACR for the untrusted entity . As an example the notification allows a dynamic update of the network gateway with the authorized ACR for a given URL. In one embodiment at a second request e.g. directed to the untrusted entity is transmitted by UE . Moreover the network gateway can utilize the ACR e.g. received at for example insert the ACR in the x up subno header of the request and at the network gateway can transmit the x up subno header to the untrusted entity . As an example the ACR can be transmitted in the x up subno header of all subsequent requests between the UE and the untrusted entity until the ACR is deleted e.g. based on user authorization .

In one aspect the ACR can be forwarded for example via a set of networked elements links from the untrusted entity to a trusted entity as depicted by dotted line . At the trusted entity can transmit a SubId lookup request with the ACR as an input parameter to the API platform . In response at the API platform can query the ACRS component with the ACR which in turn can perform a reverse lookup to determine the SubId corresponding to the received ACR. At the ACRS component can transmit the SubId to the API platform and at the API platform can forward the SubId to the trusted entity .

Referring now to illustrated is an example methodology that facilitates request enrichment with V SubIds and or ACRs according to an aspect of the subject disclosure. Typically methodology can be implemented to avoid and or prevent tracking of subscriber activity by unauthorized entities. At a request e.g. data packet can be received from a UE e.g. by network gateway . At the request can be analyzed e.g. by request analysis component . As an example it can be determined based on the analysis that the request is directed to an untrusted unauthorized entity e.g. website system network server etc. . At a V SubId or ACR can be obtained for the request for example based on the analysis e.g. by request enrichment component . As an example the V SubId or ACR can be determined and or assigned to a URL associated with the untrusted unauthorized entity. At the V SubId or ACR can be inserted in the header of the request e.g. by request enrichment component . Further at the request with the modified header can be transmitted for example to the untrusted unauthorized entity.

Moreover at the ACR can be utilized for subsequent requests received from the UE that are directed to the untrusted entity. For example the ACR can be inserted within a header of the subsequent requests and the enriched requests can be forwarded to the untrusted entity. In one aspect at the ACR can be deleted based on user authorization. As an example the deletion of the ACR can be requested by the user and or the untrusted entity and authorized by the user . Once the ACR is deleted subsequent requests can be enriched with V SubIds that are modified per session and or periodically.

Now turning to there is depicted an example GSM GPRS IP multimedia network architecture that can employ the disclosed communication architecture. In particular the GSM GPRS IP multimedia network architecture includes a GSM core network a GPRS network and an IP multimedia network . The GSM core network includes a Mobile Station MS at least one Base Transceiver Station BTS and a Base Station Controller BSC . The MS is physical equipment or Mobile Equipment ME such as a mobile phone or a laptop computer that is used by mobile subscribers with a Subscriber identity Module SIM . The SIM includes an International Mobile Subscriber Identity IMSI and or MSISDN which is a unique identifier of a subscriber. The MS includes an embedded client that receives and processes messages received by the MS . The embedded client can be implemented in JAVA and is discuss more fully below. It can be appreciated that MS can be substantially similar to UE and include functionality described with respect to UE in systems .

The embedded client communicates with an application that provides services and or information to an end user. Additionally or alternately the MS and a device can be enabled to communicate via a short range wireless communication link such as BLUETOOTH . As one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize there can be an endless number of devices that use the SIM within the MS to provide services information data audio video etc. to end users.

The BTS is physical equipment such as a radio tower that enables a radio interface to communicate with the MS . Each BTS can serve more than one MS. The BSC manages radio resources including the BTS. The BSC can be connected to several BTSs. The BSC and BTS components in combination are generally referred to as a base station BSS or radio access network RAN .

The GSM core network also includes a Mobile Switching Center MSC a Gateway Mobile Switching Center GMSC a Home Location Register HLR Visitor Location Register VLR an Authentication Center AuC and an Equipment Identity Register EIR . The MSC performs a switching function for the network. The MSC also performs other functions such as registration authentication location updating handovers and call routing. The GMSC provides a gateway between the GSM network and other networks such as an Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN or Public Switched Telephone Networks PSTNs . In other words the GMSC provides interworking functionality with external networks.

The HLR is a database or component s that comprises administrative information regarding each subscriber registered in a corresponding GSM network. The HLR also includes the current location of each MS. The VLR is a database or component s that contains selected administrative information from the HLR . The VLR contains information necessary for call control and provision of subscribed services for each MS currently located in a geographical area controlled by the VLR. The HLR and the VLR together with the MSC provide the call routing and roaming capabilities of GSM. The AuC provides the parameters needed for authentication and encryption functions. Such parameters allow verification of a subscriber s identity. The EIR stores security sensitive information about the mobile equipment. In one aspect the AuC performs a SIM authentication in response to MS for example powering on and or entering a coverage area of the BTS . The SIM authentication allows the MS to communicate via the GSM GPRS IP multimedia network. By way of example on authentication a Gateway GPRS Support Node GGSN can assign an Internet protocol IP address to the MS receive a device number such as but not limited to a MSISDN associated with the MS from the HLR and propagate the IP address and corresponding MSISDN to downstream network elements such as the network gateway .

A Short Message Service Center SMSC allows one to one Short Message Service SMS messages to be sent to from the MS . A Push Proxy Gateway PPG is used to push e.g. send without a synchronous request content to the MS . The PPG acts as a proxy between wired and wireless networks to facilitate pushing of data to the MS . A Short Message Peer to Peer SMPP protocol router is provided to convert SMS based SMPP messages to cell broadcast messages. SMPP is a protocol for exchanging SMS messages between SMS peer entities such as short message service centers. It is often used to allow third parties e.g. content suppliers such as news organizations to submit bulk messages.

To gain access to GSM services such as speech data and short message service SMS the MS first registers with the network to indicate its current location by performing a location update and IMSI attach procedure. The MS sends a location update including its current location information to the MSC VLR via the BTS and the BSC . The location information is then sent to the MS s HLR. The HLR is updated with the location information received from the MSC VLR. The location update also is performed when the MS moves to a new location area. Typically the location update is periodically performed to update the database as location updating events occur.

The GPRS network is logically implemented on the GSM core network architecture by introducing two packet switching network nodes a serving GPRS support node SGSN a cell broadcast and a Gateway GPRS support node GGSN . The SGSN is at the same hierarchical level as the MSC in the GSM network. The SGSN controls the connection between the GPRS network and the MS . The SGSN also keeps track of individual MS s locations security functions and access controls.

A Cell Broadcast Center CBC communicates cell broadcast messages that are typically delivered to multiple users in a specified area. Cell Broadcast is one to many geographically focused service. It enables messages to be communicated to multiple mobile phone customers who are located within a given part of its network coverage area at the time the message is broadcast.

The GGSN provides a gateway between the GPRS network and a public packet network PDN or other IP networks . That is the GGSN provides interworking functionality with external networks and sets up a logical link to the MS through the SGSN . In one aspect the GGSN is coupled to the other IP networks via the network gateway . Moreover network gateway can be coupled to the ACRS component not shown and can include functionality as more fully described herein for example as described above with regard to systems . In addition in one aspect trusted entities and untrusted entities can include but are not limited to most any network server e.g. web server application server email server etc. and can include functionality as more fully described herein for example as described above with regard to systems . Although it is depicted in as residing outside the GGSN the network gateway can reside within e.g. completely or partially the GGSN . When packet switched data leaves the GPRS network it is transferred to an external TCP IP network such as an X.25 network or the Internet. In order to access GPRS services the MS first attaches itself to the GPRS network by performing an attach procedure. The MS then activates a packet data protocol PDP context thus activating a packet communication session between the MS the SGSN and the GGSN . In a GSM GPRS network GPRS services and GSM services can be used in parallel. A GPRS network can be designed to operate in three network operation modes NOM NOM and NOM . A network operation mode of a GPRS network is indicated by a parameter in system information messages transmitted within a cell. The system information messages dictates a MS where to listen for paging messages and how signal towards the network. The network operation mode represents the capabilities of the GPRS network.

The IP multimedia network was introduced with 3GPP Release 5 and includes an IP multimedia subsystem IMS to provide rich multimedia services to end users. A representative set of the network entities within the IMS are a call session control function CSCF a media gateway control function MGCF a media gateway MGW and a master subscriber database called a home subscriber server HSS . The HSS can be common to the GSM network the GPRS network as well as the IP multimedia network .

The IP multimedia system is built around the call session control function of which there are three types an interrogating CSCF I CSCF a proxy CSCF P CSCF and a serving CSCF S CSCF . The P CSCF is the MS s first point of contact with the IMS . The P CSCF forwards session initiation protocol SIP messages received from the MS to an SIP server in a home network and vice versa of the MS. The P CSCF can also modify an outgoing request according to a set of rules defined by the network operator for example address analysis and potential modification .

The I CSCF forms an entrance to a home network and hides the inner topology of the home network from other networks and provides flexibility for selecting an S CSCF. The I CSCF can contact a subscriber location function SLF to determine which HSS to use for the particular subscriber if multiple HSS s are present. The S CSCF performs the session control services for the MS . This includes routing originating sessions to external networks and routing terminating sessions to visited networks. The S CSCF also decides whether an application server AS is required to receive information on an incoming SIP session request to ensure appropriate service handling. This decision is based on information received from the HSS or other sources such as an application server . The AS also communicates to a location server e.g. a Gateway Mobile Location Center GMLC that provides a position e.g. latitude longitude coordinates of the MS . The MME provides authentication of a user by interacting with the HSS in LTE networks.

The HSS contains a subscriber profile and keeps track of which core network node is currently handling the subscriber. It also supports subscriber authentication and authorization functions AAA . In networks with more than one HSS a subscriber location function provides information on the HSS that contains the profile of a given subscriber.

The MGCF provides interworking functionality between SIP session control signaling from the IMS and ISUP BICC call control signaling from the external GSTN networks not shown . It also controls the media gateway MGW that provides user plane interworking functionality e.g. converting between AMR and PCM coded voice . The MGW also communicates with a PSTN network for TDM trunks. In addition the MGCF communicates with the PSTN network for SS7 links. According to an embodiment system disclosed herein can be implemented within and or communicatively coupled to the GSM network the GPRS network the IP multimedia network and or the IP networks .

The evolved RAN for LTE consists of an eNodeB eNB that can facilitate connection of MS to an evolved packet core EPC network. The connection of the MS to the evolved packet core EPC network is subsequent to an authentication for example a SIM based authentication between the MS and the evolved packet core EPC network. As an example the eNB can host a PHYsical PHY Medium Access Control MAC Radio Link Control RLC and Packet Data Control Protocol PDCP layers that include the functionality of user plane header compression and encryption. In addition the eNB can implement at least in part Radio Resource Control RRC functionality e.g. radio resource management admission control scheduling cell information broadcast etc. . The eNB can be coupled to a serving gateway SGW that facilitates routing of user data packets and serves as a local mobility anchor for data bearers when the MS moves between eNBs. In addition the SGW can act as an anchor for mobility between LTE and other 3GPP technologies GPRS UMTS etc. . When MS is in an idle state the SGW terminates a downlink DL data path and triggers paging when DL data arrives for the MS . Further the SGW can perform various administrative functions in the visited network such as collecting information for charging and lawful interception.

In one aspect the SGW can be coupled to a Packet Data Network Gateway PDN GW that provides connectivity between the MS and external packet data networks such as IP service s network s . Moreover the PDN GW is a point of exit and entry of traffic for the MS . It can be noted that the MS can have simultaneous connectivity with more than one PDN GW not shown for accessing multiple PDNs.

The PDN GW performs IP address allocation for the MS as well as QoS enforcement and implements flow based charging according to rules from a Policy Control and Charging Rules Function PCRF . The PCRF can facilitate policy control decision making and control flow based charging functionalities in a Policy Control Enforcement Function PCEF which resides in the PDN GW . The PCRF can store data e.g. QoS class identifier and or bit rates that facilitates QoS authorization of data flows within the PCEF.

In one aspect the PDN GW can facilitate filtering of downlink user IP packets into the different QoS based bearers and perform policy enforcement packet filtering for each user charging support lawful interception and packet screening. Further the PDN GW acts as the anchor for mobility between 3GPP and non 3GPP technologies such as WiMAX and 3GPP2 CDMA 1 and EvDO .

In one aspect the PDN GW is coupled to the IP service s network s via the network gateway . The network gateway can be coupled to the ACRS component not shown and can include functionality as more fully described herein for example as described above with regard to systems . In addition in one aspect trusted entities and untrusted entities can include but are not limited to most any network server e.g. web server application server email server etc. and can include functionality as more fully described herein for example as described above with regard to systems . Although it is depicted in as residing outside the PDN GW the network gateway can reside within e.g. completely or partially the PDN GW .

Although the GSM GPRS IP multimedia network architecture and LTE network architecture is described and illustrated herein it is noted that most any communication network architecture can be utilized to implement the disclosed embodiments.

Referring now to there is illustrated a block diagram of a computer operable to execute the disclosed communication architecture. In order to provide additional context for various aspects of the disclosed subject matter and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief general description of a suitable computing environment in which the various aspects of the specification can be implemented.

Communications media typically embody computer readable instructions data structures program modules or other structured or unstructured data in a data signal such as a modulated data signal e.g. a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery or transport media. The term modulated data signal or signals refers to a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in one or more signals. By way of example and not limitation communication media include wired media such as a wired network or direct wired connection and wireless media such as acoustic RF infrared and other wireless media.

The interface for external drive implementations includes at least one or both of Universal Serial Bus USB and IEEE 1394 interface technologies. Other external drive connection technologies are within contemplation of the subject disclosure.

The drives and their associated computer readable storage media provide nonvolatile storage of data data structures computer executable instructions and so forth. For the computer the drives and storage media accommodate the storage of any data in a suitable digital format. Although the description of computer readable storage media above refers to a HDD a removable magnetic diskette and a removable optical media such as a CD or DVD it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of storage media which are readable by a computer such as zip drives magnetic cassettes flash memory cards cartridges and the like can also be used in the example operating environment and further that any such storage media can contain computer executable instructions for performing the methods of the specification.

The computer is operable to communicate with any wireless devices or entities operatively disposed in wireless communication e.g. desktop and or portable computer server communications satellite etc. This includes at least Wi Fi and Bluetooth wireless technologies. Thus the communication can be a predefined structure as with a conventional network or simply an ad hoc communication between at least two devices.

Wi Fi or Wireless Fidelity allows connection to the Internet from a couch at home a bed in a hotel room or a conference room at work without wires. Wi Fi is a wireless technology similar to that used in a cell phone that enables such devices e.g. computers to send and receive data indoors and out anywhere within the range of a base station. Wi Fi networks use radio technologies called IEEE 802.11 a b g etc. to provide secure reliable fast wireless connectivity. A Wi Fi network can be used to connect computers to each other to the Internet and to wired networks which use IEEE 802.3 or Ethernet . Wi Fi networks operate in the unlicensed 2.4 and 5 GHz radio bands at an 11 Mbps 802.11a or 54 Mbps 802.11b data rate for example or with products that contain both bands dual band so the networks can provide real world performance similar to the basic 10 BaseT wired Ethernet networks used in many offices.
