The invention relates to 1 7 diazacarbazole compounds which are useful as kinase inhibitors more specifically useful as checkpoint kinase 1 chk1 inhibitors thus useful as cancer therapeutics. The invention also relates to compositions more specifically pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods of using the same to treat various forms of cancer and hyperproliferative disorders as well as methods of using the compounds for in vitro in situ and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells or associated pathological conditions.

Individual cells replicate by making an exact copy of their chromosomes and then segregating these into separate cells. This cycle of DNA replication chromosome separation and division is regulated by mechanisms within the cell that maintain the order of the steps and ensure that each step is precisely carried out. Involved in these processes are the cell cycle checkpoints Hartwell et al. Science Nov. 3 1989 246 4930 629 34 where cells may arrest to ensure DNA repair mechanisms have time to operate prior to continuing through the cycle into mitosis. There are two such checkpoints in the cell cycle the G1 S checkpoint that is regulated by p53 and the G2 M checkpoint that is monitored by the serine threonine kinase checkpoint kinase 1 chk1 .

Chk1 and chk2 are structurally unrelated yet functionally overlapping serine threonine kinases activated in response to genotoxic stimuli reviewed in Bartek et al. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001 vol. 2 pp. 877 886 . Chk1 and chk2 relay the checkpoint signals from the ATM and ATR which phosphorylate and activate them. Chk2 is a stable protein expressed throughout the cell cycle activated mainly by ATM in response to double strand DNA breaks DSBs . In contrast Chk1 protein expression is largely restricted to S and G2 phases. In response to DNA damage ChK1 is phosphorylated and activated by ATM ATR resulting in cell cycle arrest in the S and G2 M phases to allow for repair of DNA damage reviewed in Cancer Cell Bartek and Lukas Volume 3 Issue 5 May 2003 Pages 421 429. Inhibition of Chk1 has been shown to abrogate cell cycle arrest leading to enhanced tumor cell death following DNA damage by a range of chemotherapeutics. Cells lacking intact G1 checkpoints are particularly dependent on S and G2 M checkpoints and are therefore expected to be more sensitive to chemotherapeutic treatment in the presence of a chk1 inhibitor whereas normal cells with functional G1 checkpoints would be predicted to undergo less cell death.

The term package insert is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products that contain information about the indications usage dosage administration contraindications and or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.

The term chiral refers to molecules which have the property of non superimposability of the mirror image partner while the term achiral refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.

The term stereoisomer refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution and connectivity but different orientations of their atoms in space that cannot be interconverted by rotation about single bonds.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as crystallization electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention including but not limited to diastereomers enantiomers and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and l or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. For example any reference to a structure of 2 hydroxypyridine include its tautomer 2 oxo 1 2 dihydropyridine also known as 2 pyridone.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include but are not limited to sulfate citrate acetate oxalate chloride bromide iodide nitrate bisulfate phosphate acid phosphate isonicotinate lactate salicylate acid citrate tartrate oleate tannate pantothenate bitartrate ascorbate succinate maleate gentisinate fumarate gluconate glucuronate saccharate formate benzoate glutamate methanesulfonate mesylate ethanesulfonate benzenesulfonate p toluenesulfonate pamoate i.e. 1 1 methylene bis 2 hydroxy 3 naphthoate salts alkali metal e.g. sodium and potassium salts alkaline earth metal e.g. magnesium salts and ammonium salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure.

Compounds are tested in a cellular assay using the human colorectal adenocarcinoma derived cell line HT 29 ATCC HTB 38 .

The cell line is maintained in DMEM F12 1 1 media Invitrogen Gibco 31331 supplemented with 10 FCS at 37 C. in a 5 COhumidified incubator.

Cells are seeded in 96 well plates at 30 000 cells well and after 24 h they are exposed to 20 nM SN 38 in 0.4 DMSO. One column of 8 wells on each plate was used to generate a maximum signal control. These cells are treated with 0.4 DMSO without SN 38. Cells are grown for a further 16 h then the media containing DMSO plus or minus SN 38 is removed and replaced with media containing 300 nM nocodazole alone to determine baseline or in combination with ten concentrations of chk1 inhibitor final DMSO concentration is 0.4 . Cells are grown for a further 24 h. The media is removed and replaced with 50 l lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. This buffer contains detergent to bring about cellular disruption. Following complete cellular disruption 25 l lysate is transferred to a MesoScale 96 well 4 spot plate coated with an antibody to Histone H3 MesoScale Discovery MSD Product K110EWA 3 which have been previously blocked with 3 bovine serum albumin in Tris buffered saline. Following the transfer of lysate to the MSD plate Histone H3 in the lysate is captured on the coated antibody by incubation at room temperature for 2 h. Following the capture step the plate is washed and then incubated with an antibody to phosphorylated Histone H3 which is conjugated with a Sulfo Tag. This tag gives a signal when in proximity to the electrode on the base of the MSD plate. Binding the tagged antibody to the captured protein allow detection on a MSD reader.

The ECis defined as the concentration at which a given compound achieves 50 decrease of the measured levels of phospho Histone H3 within the range of a normal sigmoidal dose response curve compared to the signal generated by 300 nM nocodazole alone. ECvalues are calculated using the XLfit software package version 2.0.5 or Graphpad Prism version 3.03 fitting a sigmoidal curve with a variable slope.
