This invention relates to Radio Frequency Identification RFID tags and more specifically to methods and systems managing information on and access to RFID tags including information stored and exchanged by through and about assets deployed in a wide range of environments.

Conventionally standard software whether office business enterprise or of other type is not capable of interacting with RFID tags. Instead special applications are written either as self contained applications that read and write data to tags sometimes called edgeware or by using so called middleware that can connect tags in a database or event format. Thus only individuals with special software have been able to exchange data with an RFID tag. As RFID tags have become more widely used there has emerged a need for easier means of accessing and managing information on RFID tags that avoids the need to develop and integrate custom applications.

RFID tags have also been traditionally limited to small amounts of data e.g. as asset ID related information and non standard interface software leaving the RFID tag and the information associated with its asset isolated from general access such as through the Internet. As capabilities increase for storing and accessing information on RFID tags there emerges a need to access and integrate this information. This need is emerging is an understanding that an Internet of Everything may take advantage of communication of data by and through a wide range of physical assets that have not conventionally been part of the Internet such as home appliances sensors of various types goods in transit components in manufacturing manufacturing equipment tools used in service environments computing assets deployed in data centers and many many others. Many such devices lack connected power sources and it can be quite expensive to provide batteries or energy harvesting e.g. solar cell technologies. Accordingly a need exists for methods and systems that enable the benefits of connectedness of a wide range of assets without requiring grid connection battery power or power generating capabilities.

In embodiments the energy to power at least one of the first RF tag and the second RF tag may be from the RF device. The first RF tag may operate using energy received from the RF device and the second RF tag may operate using energy received from an RF signal from the first RF tag. The first RF tag and the second RF tag may receive the RF signal from the RF device such as where the data transferred from the first RF tag to the second RF tag is transferred from the first RF tag to the RF device and then to the second RF tag.

These and other systems methods objects features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the drawings. All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.

In aspects of the systems and methods described herein although the term radio frequency identification RFID tag is used throughout the disclosure the usage of this term is not meant to be limiting such as to traditional RFID technologies e.g. RFID technologies utilizing RFID protocols for interfacing with RFID tags such as containing an identifier code for inventory tracking and the like . The usage of the term RFID tag in the present disclosure pertains more generally to electronic devices communicating at least in part through wireless RF technology including any near field and or far field technologies and communication protocols known to the art.

In aspects of the systems and methods described herein a radio frequency identification RFID tag may use multiple RF network nodes e.g. radio microchips to communicate information to a RFID reader a network other RFID network nodes or the like. The communication of the information may be provided to the RFID reader using at least one antenna using a communication facility using both the at least one antenna and the communication facility or the like.

In aspects of the systems and methods described herein each of the multiple RF network nodes may include radio frequency circuits digital circuits memory storage communication facilities and the like for storing and transmitting information to RFID readers networks other RFID tags markets applications data stores and the like. The RFID tag may include circuitry for inter RF network node communication that may provide RF network node redundancy increased functionality improved connectivity to the reader increased RFID tag memory RFID tag memory management and the like.

In embodiments the RF network node redundancy may provide for a more robust RFID tag that may provide greater resistance to damage greater capability to work in harsh environments functionality and memory when damaged or the like. RF network node redundancy may support a protocol of one RF network node providing a backup to another RF network node. For example if one RF network node is damaged another RF network node may assume the role of the damaged RF network node.

In embodiments the increase RFID tag functionality may be provided by the inter RF network node communication. On the multiple RF network node RFID tag the different RF network nodes may provide different functionality to the RFID tag. For example one of the RF network nodes may provide memory management while another RF network node may provide encryption capabilities. In an embodiment there may be a master RF network node that may coordinate the capabilities that the different RF network nodes may provide.

Aspects of the systems and methods described herein may provide for improved connectivity with the RFID reader. By using multiple antennas and multiple RF network nodes the RFID tag may be able to communicate using different frequencies may be able to adjust the impedance of the RF network node for an improved signal quality may have an increased range of transmission or the like. By communicating with multiple frequencies the RFID tag may be able to select a frequency that provides an advantageous transmission characteristic for different environments such as liquids and metals. The RFID tag may be able to select one of the available antennas that may provide the best impedance match to the RFID tag and RF network nodes. The impedance match may provide a clearer transmission signal from the RFID tag to the RFID reader.

In an embodiment the multiple RF network node RFID tag reflecting or broadcasting at the same time may improve the signal strength. The improved signal strength may increase the RF amplitude that may increase the range of the RF signal. The increased signal strength may be particularly advantageous when the tag is applied to an item that contains a liquid. The liquid may absorb radio waves and the increased signal strength may allow the signal to reflect or broadcast farther despite the presence of a liquid.

In an embodiment the multiple RF network node RFID tag reflecting or broadcasting together may improve the signal clarity. The simultaneous reflecting or broadcasting of a plurality of RF network nodes may provide a more rapid RF transition similar to a square wave. The rapid RF transition may allow the signal to be received faster by the reader. In an embodiment less expensive readers may be used because the RF signal may be clearer. In an embodiment the clearer signal may be important when the RFID tag is on a metal object that tends to reflect the RF signal.

Aspects of the systems and methods described herein may provide for increased memory for the RFID tag. Using the inter RF network node connectivity the memory for the multiple RF network nodes may be managed to provide expanded memory redundant memory distributed memory or the like. For example if each of four RF network nodes has 8 Kb of memory the memory of all four RF network nodes may be combined to provide a total memory for the RFID tag of 32 Kb. In another example the four RF network nodes may provide redundant memory where all four of the RF network nodes store the same information.

Aspects of the systems and methods described herein may provide for interfacing with external sensors. The sensors may provide information such as temperature humidity acceleration gas levels smoke heat or the like. The RFID tag may read the sensors and the information may be saved to the RFID tag the RFID tag may provide the stored sensor information to the reader on the next read request. The sensor information may be used by the RFID tag to calculate freshness of a product the environment in which a product is stored the handling history of a product or the like.

Aspects of the systems and methods described herein may provide for inter RFID tag communication using a communication facility that may include a gateway facility. Using the gateway facility the RFID tag may be able to communicate to a network to other network capable devices to other network capable RFID tags or the like. The inter RFID tag communication may allow the RFID tags to provide redundant information between RFID tags. Additionally the RFID tags may be able to communicate information from one RFID tag to another RFID tag to form a tag network that may be similar to a mesh network where information may be transmitted using a number of different routes.

In an embodiment the cost of producing the RFID tag may be reduced because the RF network node may not require precise placement on an antenna lead. Placement machinery may be expensive and the placement sequence may be time consuming both of which may result in increased RFID tag cost. The RF network nodes as described herein may be randomly placed on the antenna lead.

In an embodiment smaller RF network nodes may be used because non precise placement is more easily performed. Smaller RF network nodes may be less expensive. By contrast machinery used at present to place RF network nodes may not be able to place the smallest available RF network nodes.

The increased capabilities of the multiple RF network node RFID tag may provide increased capabilities for markets to track materials track products track employees track patients provide security and the like. For example the increased memory capabilities of the multiple RF network node RFID tag may allow for the storage of tracking information through a distribution system. At each point in the distribution system the RFID tag may receive and transmit information to and from the reader.

In another market example the increased RFID tag memory may allow the storage of patient information that may be read to determine if the patient is to receive a certain medicine. The RFID tag may contain enough increased memory to store all of the patient s medicine information surgical history medical history and the like that may aid in the proper administering of medications. For example a nurse may use a portable reader to read the patient information and medicine information to assure that the medicine is appropriate for the patient.

In another example the multiple RF network node RFID tags may store security information that may determine if a person may enter a room building facility or the like. The RFID tag may store personal information security access information record location information to track the movements of the person within a facility or the like. Throughout this disclosure the phrase such as means such as and without limitation . Throughout this disclosure the phrase for example means for example and without limitation .

Referring to an embodiment of the RFID tag and associated interfaces facilities markets and applications is shown. Features of the depicted embodiment are directed to optimizing certain interfaces that are shown in . As would be understood in the art for example an interface between an antenna and an RF network node may be susceptible to electrostatic discharge ESD a sudden and momentary electric current that may flow when an excess of electric charge finds a path to an object at a different electrical potential such as ground power or the like. The term may often be used in electronics and other industries to describe momentary unwanted currents that may cause damage to electronic equipment. The antenna may be a source of such accumulated charge which may lead to electrostatic discharge into the electronics of a RFID tag . In embodiments there may be an ESD and impedance matching components as a part of a RF and Analog block that reduce the accumulation of charge that may lead to ESD reduce the effects of ESD protect against ESD or the like.

It would be further understood in the art as another example that the interface between the antenna and the RF network node may be susceptible to impedance mismatch due to changes in the antenna configurations changes in the environment changes in electrical properties of components or the like. Impedance matching may attempt to make the output impedance of a source the antenna for instance equal to the input impedance of the load to which it is ultimately connected the input to the RF network node for instance. Impedance matching is usually implemented in order to maximize the power transfer and minimize reflections from the load. The concept of impedance matching may be applied when energy is transferred between a source and a load. Sometimes the term impedance matching may be used more generally to mean choosing impedances that work well together instead of making two impedances complex conjugate . The more general interpretation includes impedance bridging where the load impedance may be much larger than the source impedance. Bridging connections may be used to maximize the voltage transfer rather than the power transfer.

In embodiments the RF network node may contain the ESD and impedance matching functional block. The ESD and impedance matching functional block may include multiple switch elements to connect or disconnect impedance components such as capacitors inductors resisters and combinations thereof. State control of these switches may determine the impedance match between the antenna and the RF network node . The setting of these switches may be controlled by analog or digital circuit configurations. In embodiments impedance matching control may be performed automatically to tune the impedance match by analog circuitry upon reception of a carrier wave with impedance matching implemented in the RF and analog block of the RF network node . The impedance match from tuning the impedance matching may increase the power level received from the antenna. In embodiments there may be too much power being delivered to the RF network node and the circuit may need to be de tuned mismatched impedance to reduce the received power. Detuning may be performed if voltages exceed the operating supply voltage to ensure that circuitry connected to the supply derived from the RF power is not damaged. In an embodiment the detuning mechanism may serve as a voltage limiter to the RF network node circuitry. In embodiments control of the impedance matching in the ESD and impedance matching functional block may provide a way to increase received power by tuning to improve the impedance match or protecting the circuitry on the RF network node from high input voltages by detuning the impedance match.

In embodiments impedance matching may be controlled digitally by combinatorial logic sequential logic a program subroutine or the like and may be implemented after the power to the RF network node has stabilized and a data processing and controller block has been powered up. The digital control for impedance matching may be alterable though programming internal to the RF network node or externally through read write capabilities of the RF network node . Digital control is described in more detail below.

In embodiments implementation of impedance matching between the antenna and the RF network node may provide a way to automatically adjust to initial conditions upon power up due to a received modulated carrier from a reader . This automatic adjustment to impedance matching may improve the chances for the RFID tag to communicate with the reader when distance environment materials or the like would otherwise limit the initiation of such communication. In embodiments implementation of impedance matching between the antenna and the RF network node may provide a way to systematically adjust impedance matching to maintain maximum received power or voltage. This systematic adjustment may allow for compensation from impedance mismatches resulting from changes in environment such as moisture proximate conductors such as metals or liquids or the like. The ability of the RFID tag to adjust impedance matching may allow the RFID tag to operate more reliably under changing environmental and product usage conditions.

Another embodiment of impedance matching may be dynamic impedance matching. Dynamic impedance matching may include adjusting the center frequency sent by the reader and received by the RFID tag dynamically adjusting the capacitance of the RFID tag to match the impedance of the of the object to which the RFID tag is attached to match the impedance of the environment where the RFID tag may be operating or the like. Depending on the type of object on which the RFID tag is attached e.g. water or metal or the operating conditions different center frequencies may perform better then others. For example in the US the RFID tag center frequency may be 915 MHZ but if the RFID tag is attached to a case of water the RFID tag communication may be improved using a different center frequency.

In an embodiment the center frequency may be determined by programmable tuning of the RFID tag center frequency. Programmable tuning of the RFID tag center frequency may be accomplished by a user transmitting a digital word from a reader that represents the new frequency with which the reader and RFID tag combination will communicate. The RFID tag may receive the digital word and may change the center frequency with which the RFID tag may receive reader signals. In an embodiment the digital word may be modified by the reader and or the RFID tag until a center frequency is established that provides for the optimum communication frequency. In an embodiment the center frequency digital word may be initiated by a user using a reader interface. The user may initiate the center frequency digital word based on the object on which the RFID tag is attached based on the environment in which the RFID tag is operating or the like.

In an embodiment the programmable tuning of the frequency may be combined with an RFID tag power meter e.g. the power meter is described in more detail herein to determine the optimum center frequency. For example the user may transmit a digital word representing a starting center frequency. The RFID tag may adjust the receiving center frequency and the power meter may measure the power difference between the original center frequency and the new center frequency based on the received digital word. The power meter readings may be compared and a new frequency digital word may be determined based on the change in the RFID tag received signal strength. In an embodiment the reader and RFID tag may continue the adjusting of the center frequency until the optimum center frequency is determined. As may be understood the center frequency adjustment process may be used to adjust to the optimum center frequency for the object on which the RFID tag is attached.

In an embodiment in coordination to optimizing the center frequency the impedance match of the RFID tag to the antenna may be dynamically adjusted using a bank of variable capacitors varactor . In an embodiment the dynamic impedance adjustment may be performed separately from the center frequency optimization in parallel with the center frequency optimization in series with the center frequency optimization in response to a request from the reader in request from the RFID tag or the like. In an embodiment the varactor capacitance may be adjusted based on a voltage in the case of the RFID tag the voltage may be an actual voltage measured by the power meter a power meter predicted voltage or the like.

As one example of dynamic impedance matching a digital word representing a new center frequency may be sent by the reader the digital word may have been determined by a user. The RFID tag may receive the digital word and may use the word to adjust the center frequency used by the RFID tag. The power meter may measure the change in the received signal strength and may adjust the impedance match with the antenna by adjusting the varactors. Once the impedance has been adjusted the power meter may again measure the received signal strength and a new digital word may be determined to again adjust the center frequency to optimize the received signal strength. This sequence of adjusting the digital word adjusting the impedance with varactors and determining a new digital word may continue until an optimum center frequency is determined. It should be understood that there may be many different sequence processes for dynamically adjusting the impedance using the digital word and varactors and this example is used for illustration purposes only and should not be considered as the only method of optimizing the center frequency.

In embodiments the RF network node may contain a voltage limiter and multiplier functions that boost the voltage of the incoming modulated carrier while limiting the voltage of the boosted signal to a predetermined maximum value. The voltage limiter and multiplier function may include a pre multiplier stage an intra multiplier an RF power limiter a voltage limiter a current limiter an over voltage limiter and the like. The boost in the voltage may be a multiplying factor such as times three times five times eight or the like. In embodiments the output of the multiplier may produce voltages of 5 volts or greater. Additionally the operational circuitry of the RF network node may be of a technology that may be damaged if exposed to a voltage in excess of a specified maximum voltage for instance 2 volts. The voltage limiter may be required to limit the voltage to this circuitry to a voltage that is less than this specified maximum voltage for instance 1.8 volts. In embodiments the voltage limiter and multiplier may condition signals received from the ESD and impedance matching circuitry and may provide output to an envelope detection circuitry as shown in .

The modulated carrier may require the envelope detection prior to demodulation. In embodiments the envelope detector may be a simple system such as a diode and a low pass filter or it may include a more complex circuit configuration. In addition the envelope detection block may have a mean detector which detects the mean value of the envelope and compares this output to the output of the envelope detector to determine whether the signal is a 1 or a 0. In embodiments the envelope detector block may also provide other detection modes for instance the envelope detector block may provide for a synchronous detection mode. Synchronous detectors may be considerably more complex than envelope detectors. A synchronous detector may for example consist of a phase locked loop and multiplier circuits. In a synchronous detector mode multiplying the modulated carrier by a sine wave that is phase locked to the incoming carrier may be involved in the demodulation. As shown in however the envelope detection functional block may represent any pre demodulation technique and is not meant to be limited to any particular circuitry that may be referred to as envelope detection.

In the demodulator functional block may include the circuitry for performing the final demodulation of the incoming modulated carrier waveform received by the RF network node . Demodulation is the act of removing the modulation from the incoming analog signal. For instance to demodulate an AM signal the signal may be passed through a diode rectifier. The amplitude variation may then integrate into the original modulating signal. Each modulation technique requires its own unique method for demodulation and the demodulator shown in is meant to represent the circuitry for the demodulation technique employed in certain embodiments. In embodiments the modulation technique used in the demodulator may be any modulation technique known to the art such as ASK PSK FSK QAM or the like.

Certain embodiments may employ the ability to change the modulation technique as a way to improve system performance. For instance the system may change the order of a QAM scheme in order to increase a reception parameter such as raising the QAM order to increase the bit rate when the RFID tag is close to the reader lowering the QAM order to improve bit error rates when the RFID tag is at an increased distance from the reader and the like. By accommodating various modulation schemes the RFID tag may be able to improve its data rate and or its operable range from the reader .

As shown in the output of the demodulator may then converted to a digital signal and presented to the data processing and controller functional block for command processing as discussed herein. When command processing is complete any required command response and or data return message to the reader or the other RFID tags may be sent from the data processing and controller to a modulator for signal conditioning prior to transmission. As in the case of the demodulator the modulator may use a plurality of modulation schemes in communication with the reader or the other RFID tags . In embodiments the return modulation scheme may be PSK a digital modulation scheme that conveys data by changing or modulating the phase of the carrier wave. The carrier wave for transmission of the modulated command response may be the backscattered carrier wave received from the reader . That is the RFID tag may not require a carrier source generated within the RFID tag .

As shown in the output of the modulator may be sent to the ESD and impedance matching functional block. In addition to the impedance matching performed between the antenna and the RF network node s internal circuitry to improve transmission the ESD and impedance matching block may provide a way of switching in an impedance element such as a capacitor or inductor in order to purposely provide impedance mismatching. This technique may be associated with the modulation of the outgoing signal and may be implemented to change the imaginary part of the input impedance. PSK may offer the advantages of continuously available power with respect to ASK. In embodiments the modulation technique used in the modulator may be any modulation technique known to the art such as ASK PSK FSK QAM or the like.

In addition to the antenna to the demodulator communication path and the modulator to the antenna communications path with the reader and the other RFID tags the RF network nodes may communicate with each other through a common antenna connection . To facilitate this a communications path between the data processing and controller and the antenna s may be implemented by way of an inter node interface as shown in . The inter node interface may connect the data processing and controller to the common antenna connection through the ESD and impedance matching block. The connection of the inter node interface to the common antenna connection may be a direct connection or through circuit elements within the ESD and impedance matching block.

In embodiments the plurality of RF network nodes connected together via the common antenna connection may provide a distributed functionality for the RFID tag with a master RF network node coordinating the functionality of the other RF network nodes on the RFID tag . The distributed functionality may include combined memory locations separate multiple memory locations secure memory locations public memory locations multiple frequencies selective power reduction encryption decryption and the like. The interconnection of data processing and controller blocks of the different RF network nodes on the RFID tag may significantly increase the overall functionality flexibility modularity and or redundancy of the RFID tag .

In embodiments the RFID tag may operate as a device that is passive semi passive or active. These terms may refer to whether there is a source of power internal to the RFID tag or not. The passive RFID tag may not have an internal power supply. In the case of the passive RFID tag minute electrical currents induced in the antenna by the incoming radio frequency signal may provide just enough power for the RFID tag s circuitry in the RFID tag to power up and operate. Therefore the passive RFID tag may not have a power supply but may still have a power management block. shows one embodiment of the interfaces between the power management block of the RF network node and other function blocks within the RF network node . Prior to any portion of the RF network node being powered the antenna may receive the reader s transmitted carrier wave. This incoming signal may be fed to the power management block through the ESD and impedance matching block in order to extract or harvest the power of the carrier wave. The power management block may then rectify and filter the incoming carrier wave to establish a stable supply of power to the rest of the RF network node . The power management circuitry may be required to regulate the output voltage to the rest of the RF network node which may vary significantly depending on the EM field value of the received carrier wave.

In embodiments the power management may provide power to functional blocks within the RF network node at different times. For instance power may be supplied to the RF and analog block prior to power supplied to the data processing and controller block power may be supplied to a clock prior to the rest of the RF and analog block power may be supplied for bias circuitry prior to control circuitry and the like. In embodiments power management may provide logical signals to the RF network node functional blocks to indicate the state of power readiness such as a power on reset POR signal a power available signal a power too low signal and the like. These logical signals may better enable the proper power up sequence within the RF network node . In addition the power management control and status signals may allow for conservation of power during the RFID tag operations in order to extend the operational time increase the amount of circuitry powered in order to increase the available functionality of the RF network node or the like. The power management may include not only a means of harvesting power for use in the RF network node but also provide logic and control of power up sequences and power conservation modes.

In embodiments the multiple RF network nodes on the RFID tag may share power. Shared power may provide for equal power distributed amongst the different RF network nodes different power distributed amongst the different RF network nodes control of the power used by the different RF network nodes or the like. In embodiments distributed control of the power management block may be implemented in a plurality of ways such as the master RF network node controlling the power distribution amongst the different RF network nodes of the RFID tag the different network nodes of the RFID tag collectively monitoring and controlling power distribution and the like. The algorithm for control of the distributed power management may be stored into the memory of the RF network nodes . In embodiments distributed control of power management amongst the different RF network nodes of the RFID tag may better enable the RFID tag to manage functional resources on the RFID tag . This may allow the RFID tag to dynamically redirect the RFID tag s functionality to accommodate the changing demands from commands received market needs redundancy management link quality or the like.

Harvested power from the incoming carrier wave may drop below the threshold power for a short time after the carrier wave from the reader has interrogated the tag. In an embodiment the short period of time may range from microseconds to seconds. During this transition to insufficient power the power management block may communicate this event with a voltage too low signal. Information stored in volatile memory and all volatile control states may be lost after power transitions below a minimum voltage. Certain information stored in memory or in control states may be critical to future communications and operations. An example of such critical information may be the contents of a flag register indicating the operational or sequential states of an ongoing process or assignments. Power may terminate too quickly for this information to be stored into non volatile memory before power is lost. The systems and methods described herein may provide for a persistence circuit that may enable selective memory cells to maintain their memory states for short periods in the absence of power supplied by the incoming carrier wave. The short period for which memory states may be maintained may be 10 ms 100 ms 1 second 5 seconds or the like. The memory cells that reside within the persistence circuit may function much like a capacitor holding the charge of the memory cell briefly until stable power is re established. In embodiments the persistence circuit may better allow the RFID tags to maintain continuity in operations and functionality in the presence of brief disruptions of carrier wave transmission from the reader .

In an embodiment the multi RF network node RFID tag may be able to harvest power and backscatter information to the reader simultaneously. The RF network nodes may coordinate the backscattering of information to the reader and harvesting power by selecting at least one RF network node to backscatter information while at least one RF network node harvest power from the incoming RF signal from the reader. For example in a four RF network node RFID tag one RF network node may be selected to backscatter the information to the reader while three RF network nodes harvest power from the incoming RF signal. In an embodiment the RF network nodes selected to backscatter or harvest power may be determined by the orientation of the RFID tag to the reader. In an embodiment the RF network nodes may coordinate which node will backscatter and which node will harvest power. Additionally the RF network nodes selected to perform either backscattering or harvesting may differ for each RFID tag read. In this manner the RFID tag may be able to harvest all the available power from the incoming RF signal while also backscattering information to the reader. The result of the simultaneous backscattering and power harvesting may be extended power and time available to the RFID tag for data computing data storing data transmitting and the like.

Depending on the reader signal strength the amount of power harvested by the RFID tag the command transmitted by the reader or the like the power management may schedule the power up of RF network nodes to receive power during a read cycle. By scheduling RF network nodes the power management may power a RF network node may not power an RF network node may power an RF network node for a short period may partly power an RF network node or the like. For example if the reader signal is weak and therefore less power is harvested the power management may only power a portion of the RF network nodes. In an embodiment the power management may coordinate with the data processing controller to determine which RF network nodes are required to provide a response and then may only power the required RF network nodes . In another example the command from the reader may not require all the RF network nodes to complete a certain task and the power management may not power RF network nodes that are not required to complete the response to the reader. The result of scheduling the RF network node power up may be to conserve the power consumed by the RFID tag to allow for the required power and time to complete the reader command.

In another embodiment the RFID tag RF network nodes may share the harvested power. In an embodiment the harvested power may be pooled in a power storage facility that may have a common connection between the all the RF network nodes . In an embodiment the power storage facility may be a set of capacitors a battery a combination of capacitors and a battery or the like that may be connected to the common connection as power is harvested the power storage facility may receive and store the power. For power sharing the individual RF network nodes may determine the amount of power required to execute the current reader command requirement and may share power received from the power storage facility with the other RF network nodes . For example if the current command is a write operation and the RF network node memory is full the RF network node may determine that it cannot execute the write command and may share it s available power with the other RF network nodes .

In an embodiment the RF network node power sharing may be a method of the RF network node determining that power is not required by the RF network node and the RF network node being isolated from the power storage facility. In an embodiment the sharing of power may be enabled by the setting of switches within the RF network node setting switches within the power management or the like to isolate RF network nodes from the power storage facility and connect RF network nodes that require power to the power storage facility.

In an embodiment the power required by an RF network node may vary during the duration of a reader command and therefore the power shared by the RF network node may change. For example the request from the reader may request both a read and write of information to the RFID tag . During the read operation one of the RF network nodes may require power and may receive power from the power storage facility. But during the write portion of the command the same RF network node memory may be full and therefore the RF network node may not participate in the write operation and may share power with the other RF network nodes by being isolated from the power storage facility. It should be understood that during a reader command cycle RF network nodes may be switched on or off a plurality of times to share power with the RF network nodes that require power.

In support of power harvesting RF network node power scheduling and RF network node power sharing a method of power metering may be implemented to accurately measure the amount of power being received from reader signal. Accurate and timely incoming power measurement may be important to the operation of the RFID tag . For example if the reader signal is in decline the RFID tag may not receive enough power to complete a write cycle. In this situation the RFID tag may determine to wait for the next reader cycle to start the write cycle of the reader command. In another example based on the amount of power measured by the power meter the RFID network nodes may use power scheduling power sharing or the like to extend the amount of time the available power can be used by the RFID tag .

In an embodiment the power meter may provide power information to both the reader and the RFID tag . In the case of the reader the power meter may provide incoming power information back to the reader . The reader may use the power information to determine if the current read cycle needs to be extended to determine if another read cycle needs to be preformed determine if the reader power needs to be increased or the like. In an embodiment the reader may be able to record a series of power meter power measurements to determine RFID tag power profile rate of change. The power profile may be used to determine if the read cycle is continued if the read cycle is repeated if the reader power is increased or the like. The power profile may be used to predict how much power the RFID tag may receive and may be used to make determinations of operations that can be completed with the remaining power.

In the case of the RFID tag the power meter may provide power profile rate of change information current power information or the like to the RFID tag . The power information provided by the power meter may allow the RFID tag to determine if an operation can be completed if an operation should be started if an operation should be canceled or the like. In an embodiment based on the power meter reading the RFID tag may transmit information to the reader requesting extension of the current read cycle requesting an additional read cycle requesting increased reader transmitted power or the like. The power profile may be used to predict how much power the RFID tag may receive and may be used to make determinations of operations that can be completed with the actual or predicted remaining power. For example the next operation may be a data write and the RFID tag may determine if the write operation can be started with the predicted amount of power to be received. If the write operation cannot be completed with the predicted amount of power the RFID tag may request the reader to extend the current read cycle request an additional read cycle request increased reader transmitted power or the like.

In an embodiment to provide accurate power readings from the reader signal the RFID tag power meter may include a flash analog to digital AD converter associated with the antenna . By placing the flash AD converter near the antenna the incoming signal power may be measured as the reader signal is received by the RFID tag . In an embodiment an algorithm may be used to determine the amount of power that can be created by the RFID tag from the received signal.

In embodiments the data processing and controller on the RFID tag may include digital circuitry that requires the clock oscillator. The systems and methods described herein may provide for the clock circuit as part of the RF and analog block . The frequency of the clock may be a selectable value such as 1 MHz 3 MHz 6 MHz or the like. In embodiments the clock oscillator may be specific frequency and configuration such as a 1.92 MHz starved ring oscillator or other frequency and configuration that meets the needs of the RF network node and associated external interfaces. In embodiments the clock oscillator may require a specific oscillator frequency in order to provide for accurate detection reception and transmission of data. In embodiments the variation of the clock s oscillator frequency may be highly accurate such as 2.5 variation during backscatter. The presence of the highly accurate clock oscillator may better provide for reliable internal RF network node functionality and communications via interfaces external to the RF network node . In embodiments the clock and data may not be synchronized between the RF network nodes on the RFID tag .

In embodiments the synchronization circuit may calibrate may synchronize the RF network nodes . Synchronization may be related to synchronizing the phase of clock oscillators on a plurality of RF network nodes . For example a synchronization signal may be sent from a master RF network node the reader another RFID tag or the like to synchronize all targeted RF network node clock oscillators. Calibration may be related to the adjustment of the clock oscillator s frequency on the plurality of RF network nodes . Calibrating the clock oscillator of each RF network node to a common clock oscillator may be accomplished by transmitting a calibration signal among the plurality of RF network nodes . The calibration signal may be transmitted from each RF network node onto the inter node communications interface and simultaneously received by all RF network nodes .

In embodiments the data processing and controller may include a routine for establishing which of the plurality of RF network nodes on the RFID tag is to act as the master this protocol is described herein. The implementation of the protocol may require the use of a random number provided to the routine running via the data processing and controller . In embodiments a random number generator may supply the random number to the data processing and controller .

The random number generator may be a computational or physical device designed to generate a sequence of numbers or symbols that lack any pattern i.e. appear random. Software based routines for random number generation are widely used but may fall short of this goal though they may meet some statistical tests for randomness intended to ensure that they do not have any easily discernible patterns. There are two principal methods used to generate random numbers. One may measure a physical phenomenon that is expected to be random and then compensate for possible biases in the measurement process. The other may use computational algorithms that produce long sequences of apparently random results which are in fact determined by a shorter initial seed or key. The latter type is often referred to as a pseudo random number generator.

The physical random number generator may be based on an essentially random atomic or subatomic physical phenomenon whose randomness may be traced to the laws of quantum mechanics. Examples of such phenomena include radioactive decay thermal noise shot noise clock drift and the like. In an embodiment clock drift may act as the random physical source from which the random number may be generated. Clock drift may ultimately be related to component differences design differences behavior changes caused by component aging configuration and set up differences or the like. In embodiments a plurality appropriately adjusted ring of oscillators may be employed that are summed by exclusive or logic to generate the random number from the drift of the oscillators. Further a logical enable signal may be provided to initiate or terminate the action of the random number generator . Although clock drift represents an example of a configuration for generating the random number it may be understood that any configuration known to the art to generate the required random number may be employed.

In embodiments the data processing and controller may be a digital portion of the RF network node that functions as a central data processing facility for command decoding execution and response a logical control facility for state related functions a memory storage facility for the storage of short and long term data in volatile or non volatile memory a program storage and execution facility for software based control of operational execution and market specific applications a data interface controller and the like. In embodiments the data processing and controller may provide the function of central processing unit for the RF network node possessing program storage combinatorial and sequential logic data bus interfaces and the like. In embodiments the flexibility of the RF network node to accommodate a plurality of market functions may be partly associated with the data processing and controller .

In embodiments the data processing and controller receives and transmits commands and data through a plurality of interfaces including the demodulator the modulator the ESD and impedance matching block a communications facility and the like as shown in . The data processing and controller may be responsible for command decoding encoding encrypting decrypting execution storing and the like. A command may be an instruction where an instruction is a form of communicated information that is both command and explanation for how an action behavior method or task may be begun completed conducted or executed. In embodiments the data processing and controller may receive commands or instruction through the demodulator interface decode the command execute the command using internal storage logic external interfaces or the like to the data processing and controller gather requested data action responses sensor readings communications or the like directed by the command and transmit responses telemetry status or the like by way of the modulator interface. In embodiments command and response may also be via the direct RF network node interface to other RF network nodes on the RFID tag .

In an embodiment an RFID tag or RFID network node may include the method and system of interpreting commands from the RFID reader . In an embodiment the amount of the RF network node execution code required to execute the RFID reader commands may be reduce by the RF network node generically processing commands sent by the RFID reader to the RFID tag . In an embodiment the RFID reader commands may contain a number of associated parameters for the execution of the RFID reader command. An RF network node generic processor may be used to divide the command into its individual parameters for processing by the RF network node . In an embodiment the RF network node may recognize the RFID reader command by the parameters associated with the command. For example the RFID reader may transmit a command with the parameters operation code memory bank delay and the like. The RF network node may recognize the RFID reader command as a memory read command by these associated parameters. The RF network node may execute the overall RFID reader command by executing code associated with the individual parameters. In an embodiment the master RF network node may break the RFID reader command code into parameters and execute the parameters or may request other RF network nodes on the RFID tag to process all or some of the parameters. The master RF network node may transmit information to the RFID reader based on the returns of the individually executed parameters. In an embodiment the RF network node may selectively execute the RFID reader command based on the command s role in the RFID tag the RFID tag may be able to execute any RFID reader command but may not execute all of the RFID reader commands received. In an embodiment by reducing the RFID reader command code into generic parameters the RFID network node execution code may be reduced and may result in the RF network node size being significantly reduced. Additionally there may be an increase in the RF network node functionality by executing RFID reader commands using only the individual parameters to execute the entire RFID reader command.

In embodiments the data processing and controller on a RFID tag may support command encryption. Encryption may be a process of encoding information in such a way that only a processing device with the encryption key may decode it. The systems and methods described herein may utilize various systems of encryption including symmetric key encryption public key encryption digital certificates and the like. In symmetric key encryption each of the RFID tags may have a key that is used to encrypt or decrypt a packet of information. In symmetric key encryption each of the RFID tags utilizing the encryption scheme may require the key to communicate. In public key encryption a combination of a private key known only to the RFID tag and a public key given by the RFID tag to any interface device attempting communication is used in the encryption design. Digital certificates utilize a third independent source often referred to as a certificate authority in the encryption design. In embodiments any encryption process known to the art may be used in implementing a secure communications design. The implementation of an encryption scheme within the communications design of an embodiment of the invention may provide greater reliability of operation as well as secure processing of the market implementation. In embodiments encryption may be utilized in any communications external to the RFID tag such as the RFID tag to the reader the RFID tag to the RFID tag the RFID tag to external facilities and the like.

In embodiments the data processing and controller may support proprietary command protocols that may be specific to the systems and methods described herein specific to a market application specific to a geographic location or the like. The data processing and controller may also support the international standard EPCglobal UHF class 1 generation 2 Gen2 for the use of RFID tags. The Gen2 standard specifies protocols for the RFID tag air interfaces the protocol for exchanging information between the RFID tag and the reader .

Referring to in embodiments the communications facility may be a communications facility B that is part of the data processing and controller on the RF network node a communications facility A on the RFID tag in communication with the data processing and controller or both. The communications facility may interface with a plurality of external facilities such as sensors A displays B a gateway C a peripheral D a network E a device F an actuator G and the like. The communications facility may utilize a serial interface to communicate with external facilities such as an IC bus an SMBus a PMBus an SPI bus a 1 wire bus and the like. For instance an IC bus Inter Integrated Circuit bus is a multi master serial computer bus that may be used to communicate between the data processing and controller and low speed external facilities . The SMBus System Management Bus represents a subset of IC that defines stricter electrical and protocol conventions where many IC systems incorporate policies and rules from SMBus. The PMBus Power Management Bus is a further variant of the SMBus which is targeted at digital management of power supplies. Like SMBus it is a relatively slow speed two wire communications protocol based on IC. Unlike either of those standards it defines a substantial number of domain specific commands rather than just saying how to communicate using commands defined by the reader. The 1 Wire bus is similar in concept to IC but with lower data rates and longer range. The SPI Bus Serial Peripheral Interface bus is a synchronous serial data link standard that operates in full duplex mode and is sometimes referred to as a four wire serial bus contrasting with three two and one wire serial buses. One skilled in the art will appreciate that there are a large variety of serial buses that may be used by the invention in communicating with external facilities including non standard interfaces and so the list and description provided herein should not be taken as limiting in any way.

In embodiments the RFID tag may act as the master on the communications bus where the external facility would act as the slave. Alternately the external facility may act as the master and the RFID tag the slave. For instance the RFID tag may act as a slave to a sensor A and automatically store historical records of sensor activity. In embodiments one way to implement this could be to have the RFID tag be considered a serial bus slave such as an IC bus slave and an external sensor act as the bus master. The external sensor being the master may then initiate data transfers and sensor information that ends up as raw data in the RFID tag slave device. In embodiments another way to implement this could be to have the RFID tag automatically store the sensor data as a history record in a memory structure similar to an ATA container. In embodiments the RFID tag may not be using the raw address received from the serial bus to write to that location in memory but instead may be keeping track of previously written records and putting new data in the proper location. Later on when an interrogator comes along it may use the table of contents in memory to know if any of the history records are of interest. This design could also be flexible enough to format the memory based on data contents. For example the bus master might send an address along with 16 bytes of data. The data may have actually come from a plurality of different sensors and could be split into different records or into a single record with identifiers for each piece of data. In embodiments compression schemes may also be utilized such as standard schemes or application specific schemes to compress the sensor data before storing it in memory.

In embodiments the communication facility interface to external facilities may support the implementation of a broad range of applications such as sensor tags display tags smartcards medical uses and the like. For instance a sensor tag may store temperature stress or any other information accumulated by a sensor. For instance sensors linked to RFID tags may have many military applications ranging from recording storage conditions of materials calibrations for equipment storage of usage information of equipment and the like. For example it may be necessary to keep track of how many times a tank has fired a round through its barrel and that after a set number of firings the barrel may have to be replaced. In this instance the present invention may combine with a sensor on a tank gun barrel to count how many times its fired such as through sensing the temperature where the sensor downloads the information to the tag via the communications facility as described herein. In another instance the communications facility may allow the present invention to be integrated into smart commerce applications such as smart cards. For example smartcards may utilize the present invention in the smart card to automate or make it easier to write information to a smart card e.g. Bank card. The serial bus associated with the communication may then be burned so that that information could not be changed. In another instance the communications facility may allow the present invention to be used in medical applications such as using the tag in combination with a medical testing system that would download the test results into the tag for later reading.

In embodiments the present invention may be used in conjunction with a display B such as an electronic paper display e ink display liquid crystal display LCD thin film transistor display TFT organic light emitting diode display OLED nano crystal displays and the like. In embodiments a display B may be a stand alone output display or a display module where the display module may include other functions such as display driver electronics control functions and the like in addition to the output display. In embodiments the present invention may be able to store and send information to a display B that is powered by an external source i.e. not powered through the tag supplied power from the tag to change the displayed information and where the display B requires no power to hold display information and the like. For example electronic paper also called e paper is a display technology designed to mimic the appearance of ordinary ink on paper. Unlike a conventional flat panel display which uses a backlight to illuminate its pixels electronic paper reflects light like ordinary paper and is capable of holding text and images indefinitely without drawing electricity while allowing the image to be changed later. To build e paper several different technologies exist some using plastic substrate and electronics so that the display is flexible. E paper may be considered more comfortable to read than conventional displays. This may be due to the stable image which does not need to be refreshed constantly the wider viewing angle and the fact that it uses reflected ambient light. One example of e paper technology is e ink a technology that requires ultra low power consumption. The principal components of electronic ink are millions of tiny microcapsules about the diameter of a human hair. In one incarnation each microcapsule contains positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid. When a negative electric field is applied the white particles move to the top of the microcapsule to become visible to the reader. This makes the surface appear white at that location. At the same time an opposite electric field pulls the black particles to the bottom of the microcapsules where they are hidden. By reversing this process the black particles appear at the top of the capsule which now makes the surface appear dark at that location. To form an E Ink electronic display the ink is printed onto a sheet of plastic film that is laminated to a layer of circuitry. The circuitry forms a pattern of pixels that can then be controlled by a display driver. These microcapsules are suspended in a liquid carrier medium allowing them to be printed using existing screen printing processes onto virtually any surface including glass plastic fabric and even paper. In embodiments the present invention may be used in conjunction with an electronic paper display where the tag may provide power to the display B when information is updated but where the display B does not require power to maintain the displayed output. One skilled in the art can appreciate that the combination of the present invention and electronic paper technology may enable a variety of applications such as human readable labels i.e. without the aid of an RFID reader where the tag holds information to be displayed and where the tag may have that information updated resulting in a change to the displayed information. In embodiments the updating of the information may come from an update provided through an RFID reader a second tag an external facility and the like. In embodiments the present invention s memory capabilities as described herein may provide a greater amount of data storage to be made available to the display application than would be otherwise available.

In embodiments the present invention used in conjunction with a display B such as with an electronic paper display may be used to replace tags such as paper tags metal plate tags and the like. For instance electronics equipment may need to be tagged to carry information such as part and manufacturing data modifications updates part number inspection data calibration data safety data and the like. In embodiments applications of the present invention to providing human readable tag labels may include tags for avionics equipment where the amount of information to store on the label may require the large memory capabilities of the present invention as described herein. For example companies like Boeing and Airbus may benefit from a high memory RFID to keep track of maintenance events equipment configuration and the like. The present invention may provide a solution where previously relatively static plates or labels are replaced by a reprogrammable display B attached to the asset for purposes including the tracking of identification configuration maintenance calibration and other information. In embodiments the present invention may use a changeable display B in lieu of metal plate tags paper label and the like where the display B may be changed by electronic means by direct contact magnetic fields electromagnetic waves and the like to provide new information. The display B may be used in combination with RFID label data such as an electronic product code or unique identifier. The display B may be used in combination with a high memory RFID tag that records pertinent changes to the tagged item. The display B may use power to change the display B as provided by an RFID reader by an integrated battery by an energy storage device by fuel cells by capacitors as harvested from external power sources e.g. via temperature gradients light receptors etc by direct electrical connection from another device and the like. In embodiments the display B may have the dimensions materials and configuration that are configured to allow for efficient performance of an RFID antenna within the device. The thickness of the tag display B may be increased beyond typical practice in order to allow for operation when mounted on metal. A dielectric material may be used so as to provide tuning for the antenna or to reduce the thickness of the device. In embodiments the antenna may be based on a dipole a slot antenna a monopole and the like. The antenna may be configured for operation capacitively or inductively using near field physics. The display B may include a bar code including 1D and 2D barcodes. The display B may include changeable configuration information. In embodiments programmability or re programmability of the tag associated with the display B may derivative from fixed or hand held solutions. The display B may be synchronized with a database in some manner. The display B may be in combination with a contact memory button with real time location functionality and the like. The display B may be used in reusable applications such as transportation totes tagged pallets and the like. The display B may have an interface between RFID tag and display B that is serial in nature as described herein to minimize pin outs.

In embodiments the present invention may provide power to or from external facilities as well as from other outside sources e.g. battery power to enable a flexible power scheme to a wide range of RFID applications. For example the RFID tag could provide power to an external facility to provide a fully passive battery free operation have power supplied from the external facility to provide higher power applications have power supplied from an external source through the external power interface to provide an active or semi active solution and the like. In embodiments the present invention may provide power to an external facility even when the only source of power is the RFID reader . That is an external facility may be powered when the RFID tag is operating as a passive tag.

In embodiments the data processing and controller may provide memory for the storage of commands command tables the RFID tag health and status information data program storage register information encryption keys control states and other uses of digital memory known to the art. The data processing and controller may utilize a plurality of memory technologies including random access memory RAM static RAM dynamic RAM read only memory ROM program read only memory PROM electrically erasable EEPROM flash memory and the like including other volatile or non volatile memory technologies known to the art. In embodiments the data processing and controller may manage the memory with a memory manager where the memory manager may manage not only memory on its own RF network node but on other RF network nodes such as when its own RF network node is a master RF network node

In embodiments memory located within the data processing and controller may be partitioned segmented blocked and the like into a plurality of functional areas including areas that are public private encoded volatile non volatile shared distributed and the like. An example of a public area of memory may be a portion of memory that is readable by unsecured facilities such as public readers portable public readers other RFID tags with public storage and the like. An example of a private area of memory may be a portion of memory that is only readable by secured facilities such as market specific readers application specific readers company private facilities and the like. Private areas of memory may also be encoded to increase security or the level of privacy afforded by a secure portion of memory.

In embodiments memory located on the RF network nodes on the RFID tag may be shared distributed common or the like. An example of a shared memory may be memory on the RF network nodes that may be shared by the other RF network nodes accessed by the other RF network node data processing and controllers made available to the other RF network nodes or the like. An example of distributed memory may be memory utilized by one RF network node s data processing and controllers across one or more other RF network nodes resident on the same RFID tag . An example of common memory may be memory areas on the RF network nodes that are made available to the other RF network nodes such that the memory is available for common use by all of the RF network nodes . Because of the inter node interface made available through the RFID tags common antenna connection memory across the RFID tag may be utilized in a plurality of ways amongst the RF network nodes on the RFID tag . The ability of these systems and methods to communicate directly from the RF network node to the RF network node may enable a plurality of memory use configurations. These various memory configurations may provide significantly greater memory storage which may in turn allow for greater functionality and the market capability.

In embodiments the data processing and controller may function as a memory manager such as for the management of memory that is shared distributed common or the like. An example of memory managing shared memory may be having the master RF network node acting as the memory manager. In this instance the master RF network node may set up partitions or boundaries in the extended memory space available across the plurality of the RF network nodes resident on the RFID tag . The master RF network node may also allocate which of the RF network nodes have access to certain areas of shared memory arbitrate between the RF network nodes when there is contention for the same memory space alter memory allocations and resources as processing requirements change and the like. Similar memory management activities may be utilized for distributed or common memory where the master RF network node may control memory allocations and access.

In embodiments areas of memory may require authentication verification to gain access where different areas of memories require unique authentications. For example there may be three areas of memory one public one private and one private encrypted. The public area of memory may not require any authentication to gain access. The private area of memory may require some form of authentication perhaps a password or the like. The private encrypted area of memory may require some form of authentication as well as some form of encryption key to gain access. In embodiments the ability to block off segments of memory into a plurality of sizes uses markets access encryption and the like in combination with the ability share memory across the RF network node boundaries may better enable the RFID tag to be used in a variety of markets .

In embodiments memory may be utilized to process data intelligently. For instance rather than being limited to storing and transmitting raw data to the reader or the other RFID tags the RF network node may perform processing steps on the raw data and store this post processed data in memory for subsequent transmission. An example of this may be the conversion of raw sensor A data such as a voltage level and performing post processing to convert this raw voltage level into a temperature value. Calibration tables may also be resident in memory and available for use in the conversion to temperature value based upon the characteristics of the sensors interfaced to the particular RF network node . In embodiments conversion or calibration values may be transmitted to the RFID tag memory or stored in the RFID tag at the time of manufacture. There may be different conversion and calibration values for each of the sensors and so a data table may exist in memory for this purpose. The ability of the RFID tag to perform intelligent data processing may decrease the processing requirements of the reader or other communicating RFID tags which may enable the use of simpler reader facilities such as portable readers or enabling reduced post processing such as simpler RFID tag to RFID tag data processing or the like.

Referring to a depiction of a block diagram embodiment with major components of an RFID tag is shown. In an embodiment the data processing and controller may be responsible for processing the information received from the RF and analog block . The processing may include analytical work on the data such as calculations conversions encryption decryption searching storing information to memory receiving information from memory or the like. The memory may be a continuous memory partitioned memory or the like where the information received from the RF and analog block and the data processing and controller may be stored. In an embodiment the memory may be one time programmable memory OTP many time programmable memory MTP a combination of OTP and MTP memory or the like.

In an embodiment information stored on the RFID tag may be searched. The search may be at the request of the reader as part of a process on the RFID tag or the like. Because of the limited amount of power with which an RFID tag has to perform a requested task RFID tag searching may be designed to consume the least amount of power. The RFID tag search may include a look up table content addressable memory CAM brute force search of all memory locations bit matching or the like.

In the example of a content table there may be a look up table that may store the location of certain information. The location information stored in the content table may be a pointer to certain memory locations a pointer to memory regions a pointer to fixed allocated memory words a pointer to dynamic allocated words or the like. For example the content table may store information on an objects current name and price information is stored. When a request is received for the objects price the search sequence may be to look up the information location in the content table and the content table my point directly to the price memory location. The content table may be search using word matching brute force binary matching or the like. It should be understood that the content table may use many different methods to find memory information and this example is not to be considered the only method of finding information using a content table.

An RFID tag search may also be performed with CAM where the entire memory content is searched for the desired information. Using CAM information within memory may be indexed by content and using CAM the index may be searched to retrieve a memory pointer that points to the information within the memory. For example a phone book may be set up in content addressable memory where a name look up is performed. The name may be found in the indexed content where a pointer may point to the memory location of the name and the same memory location may include additional information related to the name such as a phone number address information or the like.

In an embodiment a binary CAM may be used in a tag memory search. In binary CAM all the memory is matched to a binary search term using the binary numbers 1 and 0. The binary CAM may include a comparator to compare the search word to the word found in memory. The binary CAM search may return a first match all matches or the like.

In an embodiment a ternary CAM may also be used. The ternary CAM may add a third character called don t cares where the binary search term may be masked with a character for binary numbers that are not important to the search. For example the search may be on the word 10XX11 where the X is the masking character and the ternary CAM search may return matching words 100011 100111 101011 and 101111 . The binary CAM and ternary CAM searches may be considered a parallel simultaneous search of all memory locations. The binary and ternary CAM may require low levels of power because instead of reading memory locations a hardware parallel lookup that can be performed quickly and with less power.

In an embodiment in addition to content look up tables and CAM searches there may be specialized application specific data organization that may allow very quick data searches on an RFID tag . In one embodiment an application specific data organization may locate information in specific memory locations for rapid retrieval of information. Data organizations that look to specific memory locations may be considered non search searches because a full memory search is not required to find the information required. In an embodiment there may be a number of different methods the a non search may be executed such as a content table storing the location of specific information information stored in specific memory locations memory information indexed in a certain order and the like.

In an embodiment another method of finding information on an RFID tag may be using a table of contents within the memory. The table of contents may divide the RFID tag memory into regions of memory that contain certain types of memory then a pointer or series of pointers may point to these memory regions. In an embodiment the table of contents may be combined with other searching methods to find information. For example a search may use the table of contents to narrow a search to a particular region of memory and then use a binary CAM search to locate the particular information. An example of information searching may be in the aviation industry. An RFID tag may be associated with an aircraft component and may record and store the archival history of the component. The component RFID tag may store information related to manufacturing flight cycles maintenance and the like. In searching for information the table of contents may be used to find the memory region containing the desired information such as maintenance history and then may user a binary CAM search to locate the specific information required. In an embodiment the table of contents may be organized for each type of application for which the RFID may be used.

In an embodiment the memory may include OTP memory. For use on multiple RF network node RFID tags the OTP memory may provide benefits such as high memory density fast access times field programmability low programming voltage short programming times MTP emulation eMTP the ability to mask ROM scalability wide I O bus capability redundancy security energy efficiency or the like. The multiple RF network node may be able to coordinate the OTP memory associated with multiple RF network nodes using the communication bus among the RF network nodes . In an embodiment the OTP memory may be implemented differently depending on the use of the RFID tag . For example the OTP may be divided into at least one memory word or may be divided into segments that may include more than one memory word but may represent one memory address. The organization of the words and segments may provide for one time writing of information to the word memory or information may be written more than once to segments that may contain multiple word storage. The multiple word storage for the segment memory may be considered the depth of writing. In other words the segment may provide for information to be written to the same storage word address for the number depth of words associated with the segment. Segment depth will be described in more detail below. In the multiple RF network node RFID tag the OTP memory may be on some of the RF network nodes or all the RF network nodes . Each RF network node may provide control of the OTP memory that may be on the RF network node . Additionally all of the OTP memory of the individual RF network nodes may be coordinated by a master RF network node or in a distributed manner without a master node. Furthermore the OTP memory may be coordinated as a single memory store coordinated as redundant memory stores coordinated as separate memory stores or the like depending on the requirements of the RFID tag .

In an embodiment the OTP memory may be a write once memory where information may be written to the OTP memory only once but may be read many times. Information may be written to the OTP memory while on the wafer prior to when the RFID tag is associated to an object after the RFID tag is associated to an object or the like. For example information may be written to the OTP memory at a manufacturer before or as the RFID tag is associated with an object to provide information on the object such as a part number a serial number pricing information manufacturing information quality information or the like. In another example an enterprise may purchase RFID tags without stored information and may apply information to the RFID tag after the RFID tag has been associated with an object at the enterprise such as object location object price information storage information date information delivery information or the like.

In an embodiment the OTP memory may be implemented as a single memory store as a redundant memory store as a combination of single and redundant memory stores separate memory stores or the like. The OTP memory may be divided into smaller memory stores to be used as redundant memory where the RF network node may store the same information in more than one of the smaller memory stores. For example an 8K OTP memory may be divided into two redundant 4K OTP memory stores and when information is stored to the OTP memory the same information may be stored to both of the 4K memory stores. This may provide a redundant memory system that may allow retrieval of the stored information even if there is a failure of one of the memory stores. It may be understood by one skilled in the art that the OTP memory may be configured in a number of different ways consistent with the present invention.

In an embodiment the OTP memory may be configured as a write once memory where the manufacturer enterprise or other user of the RFID tag may store information to the available OTP storage space. In this embodiment the OTP memory may only be able to receive information once the information may be written to the OTP memory starting at the beginning of the storage location and may be sequentially written to the end of the information to be stored. This method of OTP memory may be useful for storing information such as a part number serial number pricing information and the like.

In an embodiment different locations of the OTP memory may be assigned to different information. For example part number information may be assigned memory locations 1 7 and serial number information may be assigned memory locations 8 14. In an embodiment there may be an end of file indicator end of record indicator record pointer or the like to define the end of a certain memory location. For example at the end of storage location 7 there may be an end of record pointer to indicate that this is the end of the part number information. Using this storage method the part number may be stored at one time and the serial number may be stored at another time on the same OTP memory. In an embodiment the data processing and controller may be programmed as to which information is to be stored in certain locations of the OTP memory and as to the management of storing the proper information to the assigned memory locations.

In an embodiment using this method the data processing and controller may store the different available memory locations in a configuration table to define where information is to be stored. In an embodiment the RFID tags may be industry specific where the data processing and controller may be programmed to assign information to certain OTP memory locations. For example a retail store RFID tag may store part number serial number and pricing information to different locations on the OTP memory with the pricing information being written once the object and RFID tag are received in the retail store. In another example the aviation industry may store part number serial number and FAA required information to the OTP memory for example the FAA information may be written to the RFID tag over the life cycle of the aviation component to a different set of locations within the OTP memory. It may be understood by one skilled in the art that there may be many different types of information stored to OTP memory using this information writing protocol.

In another embodiment the OTP memory may emulate MTP eMTP memory by providing a protocol to write information to the same RFID tag memory location more than once. In MTP memory information may be written to the same memory location more than once but OTP may only be capable of writing information in a certain memory location once. To emulate MTP memory the OTP memory may have more than one memory word related to the storage address for the same information. In an embodiment the information may be stored in a section of memory called a segment and the segment may have a plurality of memory words associated to it for storing written information more than once. In this manner the information may be considered being written to a virtual memory location. The information may be virtually written to the segment while the information is actually written to the physical location of one of the memory words in the segment. For example in storing an object s price to eMTP memory the segment storing the price may have a number of memory words in which to write the price. The first time the price is written to the segment the price may be written to the first word associated to the segment. With the writing of the price information to the first segment word it may be recorded within the segment that the first segment word contains the pricing information. A different price may be written to the same segment a second time this second price may be written to the second word in the segment and it may be recorded with the segment that the second word contains the last written pricing information. Therefore when there is a read request for the pricing information the pricing segment may be read to determine that the second word has the latest price. It should be understood that the segment may have a plurality of memory words associated to it and information may be written to the segment for as many times as there are words associated with the segment. For example if the segment has four associated words then information may be written to the segment four times before the segment is considered full and cannot be written to again. However there may be additional segments that may be dynamically allocated should the pricing information change again. Dynamically allocated segments may be allocated on demand when the previous segment has been completely written to and the pricing information changes once again. Dynamic allocation of memory will be further described below.

In another embodiment MTP memory may also be used to store all the RFID tag data. The data stored within the MTP memory may be information that may be written more than once. For example a retail store may change the price of an item many times over the time the item is on a shelf this information may be written to MTP memory. In this case the changes in price may be written either to the same MTP memory location every time the price is updated on the RFID tag or to a different MTP memory location.

In another embodiment the data processing and controller may incorporate both OTP and MTP memory for saving information to the RFID tag . Among other things the MTP memory may be used to store address information about the OTP segments within a table the address information may be stored in variables within the MTP table. The MTP table variables may be written an unlimited number of times to track the address information of the OTP segments. As new information is written to the next OTP word memory the MTP table may be updated with the memory word address information. Using MTP memory to store the OTP segment memory address information may allow the use of a small amount of MTP memory to track large amounts of OTP memory segments by storing segment information within the MTP table using multiple writes to the same table variable. For example in the aviation industry as new FAA information is received by the RFID tag the data processing and controller may determine the next OTP segment to store the information store the segment address information into the MTP table variable and then store the new information in the correct storage location within the OTP memory.

Information within the OTP memory may be burned in and may not require an electrical charge to maintain the stored information. This may allow the multiple RF network node RFID tag to manage the power on the RFID tag using the power management . The power to the OTP memory may be managed based on the type of command received by the RFID tag based on where the information is stored or the like. For example if the RFID tag command does not require a memory recall or memory storage the power management may not power the OTP memory. In another example depending on where information is stored within the OTP memory the power management may only power a portion of the OTP memory. Additionally since the OTP memory is burned in power may not be required to maintain the information stored within the OTP memory and therefore may not require initial powering to store information periodic powering to maintain the stored memory or the like.

Referring to an embodiment of storing information within OTP memory using a segment table and data maps and is shown. In an embodiment the segment table may store pointers addresses for data stored in the data maps and . The segment table may be implemented as OTP memory MTP memory a combination of OTP memory and MTP memory eMTP memory or the like. As OTP memory there may be a set number of available pointers to point to the next memory writing position point to existing information in a memory position or the like. In an embodiment the segment table may be divided into a number of segments to store pointer information and the segments may be grouped into sets of segments for pointing to information within the data maps and the number of segments within a segment group may be dependent on the organization of the data maps and . As new information is written to a data map and the next segment within a segment group may be written with a pointer to the new information.

In an embodiment the data maps and may be organized as direct maps and segment maps . In an embodiment direct maps may be data locations that may be intended to contain certain information. In an embodiment the direct maps may be used by the owner of the RFID tag to write owner information to particular memory locations within the direct map the direct map may be divided into data addresses that may be used to store the certain types of data the owner may save to the RFID tag . For example the owner of the tag may be an aviation enterprise that may write maintenance information to the RFID tag and may require a certain number of data addresses to store this information. For this example there may be direct map data addresses for each of the saved maintenance records. In an embodiment each data address within the direct maps may be used to store certain types of data. In embodiments data may span more than one data address data may be a portion of a data address or the like.

In another embodiment the data addresses of the direct map may be used to emulate MTP eMTP memory by allowing information to be written to each direct map address more than once. In this case each data address may have a plurality of associated memory words to store information in OTP memory. As shown in there are four memory words for each of the eight direct map data addresses. The number of memory words that are associated to a direct map address may be considered the direct map write depth. For example in the direct map of the write depth is four. With a write depth of four information may be written to each direct map memory address four times before the memory address is considered full. For example the first time information is written to a certain memory address the information may be written to memory word one. If new information is required to be written to the same direct map memory address the next information may be written to memory word two. Writing to the next write location for a particular memory address may continue until the last memory write word is filled with information. In direct map four data words are shown for each user address it should be understood by someone knowledgeable in the art that there may be any number of user addresses and data words for information storage. Additionally it should be understood that there may be a variable number of data words for the addresses within a direct map where some addresses have different write depths from other addresses. For example addresses 1 10 may have a write depth of four and addresses 11 20 may have a write depth of six. In an embodiment there may be an algorithm to determine what is the next available direct map word to which information is to be written and the most recent written direct map word from which to read the information.

In an embodiment the segment maps may be used for storage of any information that may be written to the RFID tag . Similar to the direct map the segment maps may contain an individual element of data data may span more than one data block data may be a portion of a data block data may be stored using the set write depth of the memory address data may be stored using a variable write depth or the like. In segment map six data words are shown for each address it should be understood by someone knowledgeable in the art that there may be any number of addresses and data words for information storage.

In an embodiment the segment map may use a fixed write depth a variable write depth a combination of fixed and variable write depths or the like. In an embodiment a fixed write depth may include each segment in the segment table associated to a fixed number of memory words to store information. As shown in the segment table has a fixed write depth of six memory words. As information is written to the segment the next OTP memory word is used to store the new information. Once the segment has been written to for the six memory words that memory segment may be considered full. It should be understood that while one segment may be considered full other segments within the segment table may have memory words that have not yet been written and therefore are not considered full.

In another embodiment the segment map OTP memory may use a variable write depth. In an embodiment as a segment is considered full because all of the segment words have been written memory words from other segments that have not been written may be associated to the full segment address. For example if the six memory words associated with a first segment are all written a second segment and associated memory words may be used to continue storing information to the first segment. In the segment map configuration shown in this may then provide the first segment with twelve memory words to store information. As more information is stored to the first segment additional other segments containing unused memory words may be associated to the first segment to continue storing information to the first segment and therefore increasing the write depth of the first segment. In an embodiment a memory protocol may be used for the variable write depth to associate the first segment with additional segments. In an embodiment the first segment may use all of the second segment words may use some of the second segment words or the like. In an embodiment if some of the second segment words are used by the first segment the write depth of the second memory may be reduced to account for the information written from the first segment and the write depth for the first segment may be increased.

In an embodiment instead of predefined fixed segments and fixed memory word locations the OTP memory may dynamically allocate segments dynamically allocate memory word allocations dynamically allocate segments and memory word allocations or the like.

In an embodiment dynamically allocating memory words to segments may include predefined segments within the segment table that do not have associated memory words. In an embodiment there may be a plurality of memory words defined within an OTP memory space that may be dynamically allocated to a segment as the segment requires additional memory words. The number of memory words may be related to the amount of memory available and the size of the memory words. In an embodiment as information is stored to the segment the segment may be allocated a memory word from the plurality of defined memory words. In an embodiment a plurality of memory words may be allocated to a segment. In an embodiment the segments within the segment table may have different numbers of memory words allocated. For example using the dynamically allocated memory words a first segment may have ten memory words allocated and a second segment may have two memory words allocated. The dynamic allocation of memory words may continue until all of the predefined memory words have been allocated to segments.

In an embodiment dynamically allocating segments may include adding the segment to the segment table as previously undefined information is added to the OTP memory. In an embodiment initially the segment table may be without defined segments. As new information write requests are made to the OTP memory the new segment may be created and added to the segment table . As the new segment is added to the segment table memory words may be allocated to the segment as a fixed memory word allocation or the memory words may be dynamically allocated as described above.

In an embodiment the dynamic allocation of segments and word memory may be implemented as a combination of MTP and OTP memory or may be implemented as only OTP memory. An example of using a combination of MTP and OTP memory may be to implement the segment address table as MTP memory and the memory words using OTP memory. This configuration may allow the unlimited rewriting of segment address information to the MTP memory to track the OTP word that is storing the latest information in the OTP word memory.

In an embodiment all of the RFID tag memory may be implemented using only OTP memory. Both the segment table and the word memory may be implemented using only OTP memory. As previously described OTP memory may be used to store information into word memory that is allocated to a segment within the segment table . In this configuration the segment table may also be implemented using OTP memory the segment table allocation may be fixed or dynamic. In using OTP for the segment table the next segment may be determined by using a bit map deducing the next address by counting the number of segments already allocated or some other address tracking method. In the case of the bit map setting a bit to 0 or 1 for each segment address allocated may map the allocated segment and may be used to determine the next segment. In the case of deducing the segment the number of segments already written may be counted during the write operation to determine the next address for a segment. In an embodiment the choice of which method to use to determine the next segment may be the method requiring the least number of reads to determine the next segment.

An example of using a bit map for determining the next segment may include determining the number of the segments to allocate by counting the bits in the segment table storing the segment number in the segment table writing the bit in the segment bitmap that corresponds to the segment writing the data and bit into the new segment and the like.

In an embodiment when storing information to the segment and or the word memory special considerations may be used to account for the available power to store the information. In an embodiment if the power level is above a certain power threshold the writing operation may proceed but if the power level is below the power threshold the writing operation may not proceed. In an embodiment there may be specific algorithms for writing information to the RFID tag to allow for recovery from the power level transitioning to a level below the threshold during a write operation to properly write all the information or to allow a recovery point from the interrupted write operation. In an embodiment a verification bit may be written as part of the information write process to provide an indication if the write process completed and the stored information is correct. In an embodiment the verification bit may be written after the information is written the verification bit may be written before the information is written or the like.

In an embodiment the flow chart on shows a careful write algorithm that may allow for recovery from a low or no power situation during a write operation. The first step may be to start with a virtual address and data to write. The next step may be to determine the most recent address that may have the verification bit set the verification bit may indicate that the previous write completed successfully. There may be a decision step to determine if the new data is the same as the previous data. If so no additional processing steps may be needed and the process may be done . If the data is different from the previous data there may be a locate and read step to determine the next write location for the data. There may be another decision step to verify that data can be written to the new address and word memory. If not another memory location additional write depth must be used to store the new data and a bit is written to the to the new address . This test also allows recovery from a power failure during a write operation if this same write operation was left incomplete due to a previous power failure. There may be a test to determine if the entire word has been written . If the entire word has not been written the step may be to write the next data bit to the word memory assuming the data is written one bit at a time . The last step may be to set the verification bit to indicate the write operation of step was complete.

Again referring to in an embodiment the RFID tag memory may be implemented using both fixed allocation of memory and dynamic allocation of memory. In this memory configuration the dynamically allocated memory may be implemented as any of the previously described methods such as fixed segments with dynamically allocated memory words dynamically allocated segments with fixed allocation of memory words dynamically allocated segments with dynamically allocated memory words or the like. The use of both the fixed and dynamically allocated memory may provide for information writing flexibility by allowing for users to write previously undefined information to the RFID tag and to have a fixed amount of memory allocated to structured writes of information. In an embodiment one implementation of the memory on the RFID tag may include first writing to the dynamic memory and writing to the fixed memory second. A characteristic of dynamically allocated memory may be a level of uncertainty of the amount of remaining memory that results from the flexibility of the type of information that may be written to the dynamic memory. Using the dynamic memory users may save information that may be of varying lengths and various numbers of records and therefore may use up the dynamic memory at an unpredictable rate. An advantage of implementing writing to dynamic memory before writing to fixed memory may be once the dynamic memory becomes full and writing to the fixed memory begins the RFID tag may return a message to the user that there is a certain amount of memory remaining to be written. Since the fixed memory has a structured set amount of memory with every information write to the RFID tag the RFID tag may be able to return the amount of memory remaining for additional writes. For example after a write to the RFID tag the RFID tag may return the total amount of memory remaining the remaining write depth of the virtual address to which information was just written or the like.

In an embodiment the RFID tag may implement both OTP and MTP memory to provide different types of memory regions within the RFID tag the different memory regions may provide different memory characteristics to the RFID tag . In embodiments a combination of the OTP and MTP memory may be used on all the RF network nodes some RF network nodes may use only OTP memory and some RF network nodes may use only MTP memory or any other combination of OTP and MTP memory on the RF network nodes . The combined OTP and MTP memories may be coordinated to provide read and write capabilities to all of the different regions of memory all the memory regions may be accessed on the RFID tag during the same read write cycle. In embodiments the different regions of memory may include unlimited writing regions limited writing regions once write regions or the like.

In an embodiment MTP memory may be used to provide the unlimited writing regions of the RFID tag . In an embodiment the MTP memory may be allocated to some or all of the RF network nodes and may be coordinated by the RF network node architecture to appear as a continuous memory space to the user. The use of the MTP memory may allow unlimited writing to all the MTP memory locations for the life cycle of the RFID tag .

In an embodiment OTP memory may be used to provide the limited writing regions of the RFID tag . In an embodiment the OTP may use any of the above described OTP and eMTP memory allocation methods such as direct mapping segment mapping fixed memory word allocation dynamic word allocation dynamic segment allocation or the like. In an embodiment the limited write region may be implemented using only OTP memory MTP and OTP memory or the like.

In an embodiment OTP memory may be used to provide the once write writing regions of the RFID tag . In an embodiment the OTP memory may be organized into individual memory locations that may allow information to be written once to the individual memory location but read many times. In an embodiment the once write regions may be used to save information that should not be changed during the life cycle of the RFID tag . For example it may be advantageous to save a part number or serial number of an object that the RFID tag is associated with to prevent this information from being over written during the life cycle of the RFID tag . In an embodiment the once write region may provide a form of write protection for information stored within the once write region.

In an embodiment the segment table may store pointer information for the segment maps for an individual RF network node for a plurality of RF network nodes or the like. In an embodiment the segment table may store pointer information for redundant memory distributed memory public memory private memory or the like.

In an embodiment an OTP memory location may be written to more than once. Information may be written to the OTP memory where the information does not change often for counters or the like. In an embodiment there may be a protocol for storing new data in an OTP memory location that may already contain data. For example a counter may use the same numbers over time and the numbers that may have previously been used may be written to again with the same number. A portion of the direct maps or segment maps may be dedicated to a counter and the data blocks reused as the counter is incremented. In another example the same information may be written a number of different times e.g. a product name the information may be checked to determine if the information has been previously stored before storing the new information.

While many of the embodiments disclosed herein involve multi node configurations it should be understood that the OTP MTP and eMTP memory described herein may be used in single RF network node or single radio chip RFID tags where the single RF network node or radio chip may have OTP MTP eMTP memory individually or in combination. Additionally the OTP MTP eMTP memory described herein may also be used in non RFID tag technologies for memory storage. For instance memory may be used in a mode where data stored in OTP memory on the tag is accessible through an interface other than through an RF interrogator such as when a external facility is connected to the communication interface of the communications facility or serial bus and the external facility powers the tag and accesses the memory. In this mode power may be provided to the tag by the connected external facility where both power and data lines are provided between the tag and the external facility somewhat akin to a USB interface. In this way the tag provides memory to the external device as an extended memory. For example an external facility may be a stand alone computing device computer mobile device smart phone display and the like a networked computing device and the like being provided memory facilities on the tag that may be accessed as an extended memory through the computing device. Alternately power may be provided through an RFID interrogator but where data is exchanged between the tag and the external facility. For example an RFID interrogator may RF illuminate the tag to provide power to the tag the tag provides power to the external facility and then data is exchanged between the tag and the external facility such as data provided from the tag to the external facility or from the external facility to the tag .

In an embodiment a single RF network node RFID tag may include OTP memory and may store information within the OTP memory.

In an embodiment a single RF network node RFID tag may include OTP and MTP memory and may store information within the OTP and MTP memory.

In an embodiment a single RF network node RFID tag may include OTP memory as a one time write memory to emulate MTP memory.

In an embodiment a single RF network node on an RFID tag may coordinate OTP memory within the single RF network node RFID tag .

In an embodiment an RFID tag may include a single RF network node and may coordinate OTP memory using segment tables and direct mapping of data related to the segment tables.

In an embodiment an RFID tag may include a single RF network node and may coordinate an OTP direct map using an MTP segment table.

In an embodiment a single RF network node RFID tag may write information to OTP memory using a fixed write depth.

In an embodiment a single RF network node RFID tag may write information to OTP memory using a variable write depth.

In an embodiment a single RF network node RFID tag may use an algorithm to determine if a memory write has completed and may recover if the write did not complete.

In an embodiment an RFID tag that includes OTP memory may be used for archiving data over long periods of time such as days months years or the like. The archiving of data may include the permanent storing of information within the non volatile memory such as OTP memory of the RFID tag . For example in the aviation industry there may be requirements to maintain data for up to twenty years. As previously described when new information may be written to OTP memory. In using OTP memory to store information existing information may be maintained within a memory word and the new information to be stored may be written to a new memory word leaving the original information on the RFID tag. In an embodiment the saving of the original information and storing new additional data may provide data history that may be used as archive information where both the new and old information may be retrieved viewed read transmitted to an external network or the like. In one embodiment there may be an interface with the RFID tag where the user may be able to view the archived information.

As previously described the original and new information may be stored in fixed allocated OTP memory dynamically allocated OTP memory or the like. The different write depth memory systems may be used to store archived information on the RFID tag . For example a fixed write depth memory may provided for a fixed amount of memory archiving while dynamically allocated memory may have a variable amount of archiving that may only be limited by the amount of memory available on the RFID tag .

Additionally using OTP memory as archiving memory may provide a hardened memory system that resists environmental changes to the stored memory information such as chemical vibration temperature thermal shock electromagnetic pulse humidity mechanical shock autoclave magnetic e.g. degaussing fields e beam ionizing radiation e.g. x rays gamma rays cosmic radiation and the like. For example radiation hardened memory as understood in the art is one that is able to retain and or operate through an exposure to a level of ionizing radiation. Since OTP memory information is burned into the RFID tag e.g. with fuse or anti fuse OTP technologies the information is non volatile and may be resistant to environmental changes to memory such as to ionizing radiation. The RFID tag may have OTP memory locations arranged in a manner that allows the RFID tag to have an addressable memory store that withstands radiation exposure. For instance as described herein a plurality of OTP memory locations may be configured into an emulated multiple time programmable eMTP memory location where since the OTP memory locations comprising the eMTP memory location are radiation hardened memory locations the eMTP memory thus becomes an emulated radiation hardened multiple time programmable memory. Ionizing radiation is only one example of an environment that the OTP and by extension eMTP memory locations may be hardened against as described herein.

In addition to the hardened aspects of the archive OTP memory resistance to environmental influences the RFID tag may include a start up memory test to determine the availability of memory for storage or if memory locations may have received damage that might affect the OTP memory. In an embodiment if a blank memory location is determined to be damaged the damaged memory locations may be marked to not receive additional information. In another embodiment if a memory that contains information is determined to be damaged the RFID tag may attempt to move the information from the damaged locations to non damaged locations within the RFID tag . In another embodiment information may have been originally stored in a redundant memory location and when information in a primary location is found to be damaged the redundant memory location may be accessed. For example when an RFID interrogator attempts to read the primary location the RFID may provide the RFID interrogator with the information from the redundant location. In addition information from the redundant memory location may then be written to at least one further additional memory location that is available providing further redundancy in the event of damage to the redundant memory location. In embodiments the data itself may not be provided in a redundant location but rather the data is redundantly encoded e.g. Hamming code BCH code Golay code where the encoding of the data is stored in redundant locations. In embodiments as described herein memory may be included on a single RFID node multiple RF network nodes multiple RFID tags and the like. For instance primary memory may be included on one of a plurality of RF network nodes and redundant memory included on a second of a plurality of RF network nodes. In another embodiment the primary and redundant memory may be on the same RFID node.

Test data reveals that an OTP based RFID tag having the characteristics of embodiments as described herein may withstand harsh environments including maintaining access performance e.g. read range data integrity writability and the like through various changes in environmental conditions. RFID tags that are able to withstand harsh environments may expand the use of RFID tags into industries and information applications that have not previously been available using traditional RFID tags. This is especially true when a plurality of OTP memories are configured into an eMTP memory location as described herein thus creating an MTP based RFID tag that is capable of withstanding harsh environments. Industries that may benefit from RFID tags capable of withstanding harsh environments may include the life sciences nuclear aerospace oil and gas industries and the like. For example an RFID tag that can maintain data integrity through a high ionizing radiation event may be used to store information and tagged to life science samples undergoing a sterilization process. These tags may also be used for lower intensity but longer exposure applications such as in aerospace where a component may be tracked for 30 years of high altitude flights in low elevated but accumulating gamma radiation exposure.

Tables 1 though 4 present test data with respect to radiation environments for OTP based RFID tags of the present invention including different packaging configurations such as inlay type tags flexible tags and the like. A number of corresponding off the shelf EEPROM based RFID tags were tested as a point of reference where EEPROM tags offer the convenience of re write capability but at the cost of not being very resistant to harsh environments.

With respect to testing protocols all samples were initialized with random data to fill the RFID memory banks. In addition the OTP samples were written with OTP data and the accessible MTP data as allowed. Each part was swept over the UHF frequency range 860 960 MHz to establish the baseline performance. After each environmental exposure the samples were scanned to validate memory integrity and determine deviation in the required minimum RF power required to reflect data. The results represent an average of 3 samples for each condition. Samples were mounted to either aluminum or polymethylmethacrylate based on individual product specifications and recommendations and were interrogated across the frequency range 860 960 MHz using a standard off the shelf reader and antenna. A test rig was built to ensure that the before and after sweeps were collected at the same distance in the same environment.

Radiation resistance is a challenging environment for RFID tags. In general electronic devices are largely insensitive to low levels of radiation over the course of their service such as from background radiation at the surface of the Earth. However some industry applications require much higher radiation tolerance such as in the medical fields e.g. surgical products and medical devices requiring sterilization equipment usage tracking disposable item tracking where the intensity is substantially greater than background radiation food preparation and manufacturing e.g. mixing and handling equipment shipping and storage containers long term storage containers sterilizing an environment with tagged foods packages and containers in place tracking foods through the supply chain bio technology food storage e.g. tanks space e.g. satellite components spacecraft power production e.g. nuclear power hybrid power plants solar science e.g. biotech physics research health care e.g. dental imaging CT scanning MRI imaging UV treatments radiation treatment imaging diagnosis military and first responder applications e.g. equipment exposure to radiation military e.g. tracking equipment and exposure through deployment transportation e.g. aerospace and the like. Other applications may require more moderate radiation intensity over the short term but require higher dose requirements over the long term such as in aerospace medical equipment hospital patient care and the like. For example the challenge for the aerospace environment goes above and beyond traditional electronics for two reasons the need to maintain data integrity while in service at higher altitudes and the need to maintain this data for 30 years. Testing included exposure to two sources of radiation that can be accurately determined and controlled to simulate long term exposures electron beam and gamma rays.

Electron beam e beam radiation is used in a variety of applications from polymer processing to pest control. Free electrons are the result of either ionizing radiation from multiple sources or engineered using cathode ray tubes. Various dosages of E beam radiation were examined for both effects of data retention Table 1 and post exposure IC functionality write ability Table 2 . OTP tags of the embodiments described herein survived all dosages tested for both data integrity and IC functionality where results were reported on a pass fail P F basis. Corresponding EEPROM tags failed at all dosages tested.

Gamma ray radiation is used in a variety of applications from moderate intensity long term exposure for aircraft to high intensity exposure for sterilization procedures in the life sciences. These high energy events have the potential to interact or couple with charge based devices to damage circuitry. For screening purposes samples were subjected to gamma radiation and checked for effects of data retention Table 3 and post exposure IC functionality write ability Table 4 . The OTP tags of the embodiments herein survived all radiation levels for both data retention and IC functionality. EEPROM tags failed at all radiation levels above 2.5 kGy.

From these results it follows that using OTP type memory in RFID tags having the characteristics of embodiments as described herein minimizes the risk of data loss and corruption for ionizing radiation.

Other environments that may involve factors that are harsh or difficult for a typical RFID tag include corrosive and chemical environments high temperature environments e.g. military desert deployments data centers e.g. on hot components solar modules automotive interiors exteriors high temperature manufacturing environments e.g. crystal growth sintering melting high water content environments e.g. shipping beverages and foods involving water and the like.

In an embodiment the combined memory of the RFID tag may be organized with more than one memory method. For example one memory location may use a fixed write depth while another memory location may use variable write depth. The way in which the RFID tag memory is allocated may be determined by the type of information the RFID tag is storing and the memory usage may vary from one RFID tag to another RFID tag. In an embodiment the memory may be allocated as the information is stored to the RFID tag when the RFID tag is associated to an object when information is first written to the RFID tag or the like.

In an embodiment the RFID tag memory organization may be stored in a configuration table on the RFID tag. In embodiments the configuration table may be stored on a single RF network node stored across multiple RF network nodes or the like. The configuration table may store and manage data related to the organization of the RFID tag memory such as types of memory memory regions word depth writing type e.g. fixed or variable and the like. In an embodiment the configuration data may be considered metadata for the data writing type regions of the RFID tag . In an embodiment the configuration table may be fixed or dynamic. For example with a fixed configuration table the table may be written with the configuration of the available memory and may not be changed during the life of the RFID tag . A dynamic configuration table may be able to have different memory allocations written to it over time as the memory is allocated. For example variable word depth is used on the RFID tag and as additional word depths are made available to memory the new memory region for the variable depth memory may be stored to the configuration table.

In embodiments the data processing and controller may determine the number of switch elements to turn on or off in the ESD and impedance matching block. The data processing and controller may send more than one control command for the adjustment of the ESD and impedance matching block. For example the data processing and controller may read the value of a parameter associated with the strength of the received signal from the reader and the data processing and controller may send a command to adjust the switch settings of the ESD and impedance matching block. This procedure may continue until a maximum value for the parameter is reached. Another example may be the data processing and controller sending a command to adjust the switch settings of the ESD and impedance matching block after each read attempt by the reader .

In embodiments the data processing and controller may support the reader control of impedance matching. The reader may have an algorithm to receive the RFID tag transmissions measure the strength of the response calculate a command function and resend the read signal with the command function. The command function may be a command to adjust the impedance and resend the data. The command function may be received by the data processing and controller which may create the control command to be sent to the ESD and impedance matching block to turn switch elements on or off to match the impedance of the antenna . An improved impedance match may result in the improved strength of the RFID tag on the second return signal. In embodiments the process of the reader sending a read request and a function command to adjust the impedance may be repeated until an acceptable reception level is achieved.

In embodiments the data processing and controller may support communications from one RF network node to another RF network node across the inter node interface and the RFID tag s common antenna connection as will be described in . The inter node interface may connect to the common antenna connection through the RF network node s ESD and impedance matching block . The common antenna connection may connect all of the RF network nodes of the RFID tag as well as the RFID tag s antenna s together. Data may be transferred across these connections from one data processing and controller to another. The data processing and controller of each of the RF network nodes may include a transmitter and receiver in support of this interface. Transmission across this interface may be accomplished by modulating the DC level of the signal on the common antenna interconnection by using an inverter with a high resistance at its output that is connected to the interface. In this way the DC level may be modified AM modulation . In embodiments the data rate across the inter node interface may be at a relatively low rate such as 75 kHz 100 kHz 150 kHz or the like as compared with the HF and UHF frequencies of the reader s carrier wave.

Communications across the inter node interface may occur simultaneously with or exclusive from transmissions to and from the reader or other tags. In embodiments capacitance on the common antenna connection may be such that the communication s bandwidth remains sufficient for both the low frequency of inter node interface communications a frequency of 100 kHz for instance and the higher carrier frequency of the reader a frequency of 900 MHz for instance.

In embodiments the data processing and controller may have an internal data bus that enables communication within the data processing and controller . This internal data bus may provide a direct data path between processing elements memory registers arithmetic units and the like. The internal data bus may provide buffered data paths between the data processing and controller and functional blocks that are external to the data processing and controller such as the random number generator the persistence circuit the modulator the demodulator the communications facility and the like.

In embodiments the master RF network node may control the communication s path between the RF network nodes which includes the internal data bus the inter node interface and the common antenna connection .

In embodiments the data processing and controller may include programming logic and or memory in support of a function for determining which of the RF network nodes may be the master RF network node on the RFID tag . The master RF network node determination may occur each time the RFID tag is powered up. Alternately the master RF network node assignment once established may be maintained during brief interruptions in power by storing the assignment logic state in the persistence circuitry described herein. Assignment of the RF network node as master or slave may also be stored in memory where memory may be volatile for use during operations or non volatile for use over multiple operational power on off periods. The data processing and controller function that performs the selection of the master RF network node may utilize the random number generator . The data processing and controller may control the random number generator by providing a logical enable signal generate a random number signal read a random number signal or the like. There may be a data interface between the random number generator and the data processing and controller which may be a serial or parallel interface. In embodiments the interface may be a serial interface reading an exclusive or of the multiple oscillators running in the random number generator .

In embodiments the reader may be connected to computer device as shown in . The computer device may be a server a desktop computer a laptop computer a tablet computer a handheld computer a smart device e.g. a smart phone or the like. Additionally the computer device may be connected to a network for support of additional functionality that may include data storage an application server the markets or the like. In an embodiment the network may be a LAN WAN peer to peer network intranet Internet or other network system.

The computer device may provide support to the reader by providing the commands for the reader to transmit to the RFID tags . The computer device may be used as a temporary store for the information received by the reader from the RFID tags to which the reader is communicating. The temporary store of the computer device may aggregate the RFID tag information until all the information is transmitted then the information may be transmitted to the network .

For example the application server may aggregate the movement information of a product from the plurality of readers over the products distribution system. The application server may create an aggregated report on the total movement of the product from the start of the distribution to its present location. Additionally the application server may send out an alert to an enterprise if it is determined that a product has remained at a single location longer that is necessary. For example where the product may be a perishable product and is required to be delivered to a market within a certain time period the application server may provide an alert that the delivery is being held up at a particular location so the enterprise may intervene to ensure its timely delivery.

For example a market may transmit information to the reader to retrieve certain information from an object when the reader reads the objects RFID tag .

In the RFID tag where there is more than one RF network node as described above with reference to a protocol to select the master RF network node may be utilized to determine which RF network node may be the master for the execution of command and control of the received commands. If at least one of the RF network nodes is determined to not be the master it may enter a slave mode . If the RF network node is determined to be the master a received command may be executed by the master RF network node . After command execution the response to the command may be formatted by the data processing and controller block and sent to the RF and analog block to be modulated and transmitted to the reader . When the reader receives the data the reader may terminate the transmitted carrier wave which in turn may remove the source of power from the RFID tag . The RFID tag may then power down . The data read sequence may then be ended . It should be understood that this flow graph representing one possible sequence that may be executed by the RFID tag is provided as a representative routine to illustrate the operability of some of the major functional blocks of the RFID tag and is not meant to limit the functional capabilities of the RFID tag as illustrated by embodiments described herein.

In the above protocol the first RFID tag component to be physically acted upon may be the antenna . However as shown in there may be multiple RFID tags each with multiple antennas . One antenna may be connected to multiple RF network nodes multiple antennas may be connected to a single RF network node or to multiple RF network nodes one antenna may be connected to one RF network node or multiple RF network nodes while another antenna on the same tag may be connected to a separate RF network node or multiple RF network nodes . In the case where there is more than one antenna connected to the RF network node or multiple RF network nodes the RFID tag may select which antenna is to be used in communications. In addition different antennas may be optimized for different frequencies such as one antenna operating at high frequency HF while another antenna is operating at ultra high frequency UHF very high frequency VHF or the like. The individual antenna may also be capable of receiving and transmitting signals on different frequencies. The antennas may be transmitting and receiving with the reader or other RFID tags . In embodiments if the ESD and impedance matching scheme utilizes capacitive impedance the antennas may need to have positive real impedance for best results.

In embodiments the connection of multiple antennas with multiple RF network nodes may be associated with an electrical reference ground . shows four antenna interconnection configurations A D of a plurality of possible combinations of antennas and RF network nodes . For example shows an antenna interconnection configuration A where four antennas are interconnected with four RF network nodes . In embodiments each antenna may be connected to an RF network node as well as connected to the other antennas and other RF network nodes . Further power may be received primarily by the antenna most directly associated with the RF network node or may be shared amongst the interconnected RF network nodes . For example energy received by the antenna A may be primarily used by the RF network node A or may be shared by some or all of the interconnected RF network nodes A D. In an embodiment for each of the four antenna interconnection configurations A D there may be a third connection point on the RF network node in addition to the two antenna connection points connected to the common electrical reference ground . The common electrical reference ground may provide the electrical reference for power and signals on and between the RF network nodes and thus provide a common electrical reference ground for multiple RF network nodes on the RFID tags .

In embodiments each antenna may be paired with a specific RF network node . An antenna RF network node pair may be interconnected with other antenna RF network node pairs or may be separate. For example the antenna interconnection configuration D shows two antenna E F RF network nodes E F connected together and one antenna G RF network node G separate. In embodiments antenna RF network node pairs that are connected together may share power. For instance the antenna E RF network E pair is connected to antenna F RF network F pair and there may be circuitry on the RF network node that enables them to share or redirect power received by the antennas E F to the associated RF network nodes E F. In embodiments the sharing circuitry may include a method to logically or the connections from multiple antennas to the RF network node . Further this sharing circuitry may provide a method to reduce the amount of power received by a given RF network node .

The embodiments shown in the antenna interconnection configurations A D show examples that include one antenna for each RF network node . In embodiments other configurations may include one antenna for a plurality of RF network nodes a plurality of antennas for each RF network node or other configuration ratio of antenna to RF network node there may be many different configurations for a plurality of antenna RF network node combinations. A person skilled in the art may understand that the may be other antenna and RF network node configurations. The embodiments shown are provided as examples of antenna RF network node configurations and should not be considered limiting.

In embodiments the RF network node may utilize the inter node interface and the associated common antenna connection in the communication with other RF network nodes during execution of the master RF network node determination function as previously described with reference to . An embodiment of the RF network node using the random number generator the inter node interface and associated logic is shown in . Upon initial power up of the RF network nodes on the RFID tag and after impedance matching has been achieved the RF network nodes may each read a value from their random number generator and write the value into a memory register . Additionally the RF network nodes may present the value from the random number generator to the inter node interface through a buffered output. In embodiments the RF network nodes may be performing this function at different times as described herein where the first RF network node to present a random number onto the inter node interface may get its value written into a bus register of all the RF network nodes on the RFID tag .

With the first RF network node s random number written into the bus register and each of the RF network nodes eventually writing its own random number into its memory register as depicted in the RF network node may now determine if it is the master RF network node . Each of the RF network nodes may compare the contents of the memory register and the bus register . If the values in the RF network node s memory register and the bus register are the same then it may be selected as the master. If not it may be a slave. In the case where two or more of the RF network nodes are simultaneously writing their random number out onto the inter node interface the value written into the bus registers of all of the participating RF network nodes may be a combination of all the random number values placed on the inter node interface and thus represent neither of the RF network node s value from its random number generator . In this instance no RF network node may be immediately selected to be the master RF network node and other protocols described herein may be required to resolve the mismatch of the random number on the bus registers . It may be understood that these examples illustrate only one of a plurality of hardware software configurations to implement the master RF network node determination function and that other implementations will be understood by one skilled in the art.

In embodiments described with reference to the master RF network node may provide configuration management for the RFID tag such as switching the antennas switching the antenna frequency configuring the communications facility and the like. Configuration management may be dictated by external control via commanding through the reader interface or from another RF network node . Configuration management may be self directed by the master RF network node through programming through stored tables in memory or the like. Configuration management may be associated with redundancy management where the master RF network node may be configuring the RFID tag to maintain an optimum operational configuration.

In embodiments described with reference to the data processing and controller may provide for redundancy management of the elements within its own RF network node and for the RF network nodes and the antennas on the RFID tag as well as for other RFID tags . The master RF network node may execute redundancy management. A plurality of elements may be managed with respect to redundancy such as individual RF network node functional blocks such as an oscillator the random number generator the persistence circuit memory and the like or the RFID tag elements such as the antennas and the communication facility . Redundancy management may also extend to other RFID tags in the area.

In embodiments described with reference to the master RF network node may provide for redundancy management of the plurality of RF network nodes on a the RFID tag . The RF network nodes may be assigned redundant roles at the time of manufacture during operations as failures are encountered changed over time or the like. The master RF network node may systematically store functional memory in multiple locations on the multiple RF network nodes in preparation of eventual RF network node failures on the RFID tag . In the event of the RF network node failure the master RF network node may reconfigure the RFID tag functionality to work around the failure. Such reconfiguration may lead to a restoration of full functionality lead to a transition back to full functionality lead to degraded functionality or the like. The master RF network node may assign one of the secondary or slave RF network nodes as a backup to the master RF network node which may assume the role of the master RF network node in the event of a failure of the primary master RF network node . In embodiments the master RF network node may report failures to the reader that may access the RFID tag . In embodiments the RFID tag s functionality may be reduced by the failure and this reduction in functionality may be reported to the reader that accesses the RFID tag . The ability of the RFID tag to self monitor manage redundancy and report failures may improve the reliability of the device especially in harsh environments that are prone to causing physical damage to the RFID tags .

Moreover in an embodiment the depicted RFID tag may be able to report the status of the RF network nodes in the RFID tag . This may allow for advance notice of a potential permanent disablement of the RFID tag which can be then used to take appropriate remedial actions. For example the RFID tag may contain four RF network nodes but two may have become damaged and the remaining two RF network nodes may be providing redundant functionality or memory the damaged RF network nodes may reduce the over all functionality of the RFID tag . The RFID tag may communicate in a transmission to the reader that there are damaged RF network nodes and that the RFID tag functionality may be reduced. This may provide advance notice to replace the RFID tag to restore full functionality and information recording.

In embodiments the master RF network node may provide for redundancy management of the antennas resident on the RFID tag . The master RF network node may monitor performance characteristics of all the antennas on the RFID tag such as received signal strength impedance transmitted signal strength as reported back from the reader and the like. The master RF network node may select the antennas that may be performing best and report a status of the antenna performance to the reader .

In embodiments the master RF network node may provide the RFID tag with functional redundancy to guard against the possibility of an entire RFID tag failing or degrading below an acceptable functional level. To accommodate this the master RF network nodes from different RFID tags may communicate with each other and provide functional redundancy of their operational memory space. Further the master RF network nodes may periodically communicate with nearby RFID tags to assess the health of these RFID tags . In the event that one of these communications were to fail or indicated reduced functionality the next RF network node may take over the operations previously assigned to the failed RFID tag .

In embodiments the data processing and controller may provide for the logging of transactional information such as commands received actions taken sensors read processes completed and the like. Logging of the transactional information may be recorded in memory as a running table time tagged priority tagged subject tagged and the like. The transactional information may be searched sorted or read in association with tagged information. A dump of the transactional log may be initiated by command performed periodically performed each time the RFID tag is powered and the like. The logged transactional information may be monitored and compared to standard parameters and actions taken or status provided if those parameters are met not met exceeded or the like. The ability to log the transactional information may enable the market applications to better monitor the activity of the RFID tag .

The data processing and controller as depicted in may provide the gateway interface to the sensors through the communications facility . In embodiments the interface between the data processing and controller and the communications facility may be associated with a buffered connection to the data processing and controller internal bus as shown in . The interface between the communications facility and the sensors may support a plurality of electrical interface types including serial digital parallel digital analog voltage source current source differential or the like. The communications facility may be associated with the sensor A signal conversion from serial digital to parallel digital parallel digital to series digital analog to digital digital to analog or the like. The sensors may be any of a plurality of transducers such as temperature humidity motion CO CO2 moisture smoke pressure light vibration and the like. Although both refer to the communications facility interfacing with sensors it is understood that sensors is a general term and may also include a plurality of external facilities and interfaces such as external memory and USB Ethernet WiFi Zigbee and the like interfaces. The ability of the RFID tag to interface with the sensors may significantly increase its market functionality and usefulness.

In an RFID tag that contains multiple RF network nodes as depicted in certain embodiments may involve the determination of a master RF network node to coordinate the activities of the other RF network nodes on the RFID tag . In an embodiment the master RF network node may manage the RFID tag distributed memory manage the redundancy of the RF network nodes receiving information from the reader transmitting information to the reader or the like. In an embodiment the RF network nodes may have a communication connection that permits the individual RF network nodes to communication information. Once a master RF network node has been determined the other RF network nodes may act as slave RF network nodes to the master RF network node .

In an embodiment there may be a number of configurations of RF network node connections that would provide for the determination of a master RF network node such as a serial connection between RF network nodes a parallel connection between RF network nodes an antenna connection between the RF network nodes or the like. In an embodiment the connection between the RF network nodes may be implemented by individual RF network nodes connected with leads physically connected RF network nodes combined into a single larger RF network node or the like. relates to the determination of a master RF network node in either a serial or parallel connection of the RF network nodes the RF network nodes may be connected by leads or may be physically connected. The master RF network node may control the function of all the RF network nodes of the RFID tag . The master RF network node may determine the memory locations for certain data the broadcast time slot for the RF network nodes additional function connections and the like.

In an embodiment the functions of the RFID tag may be controlled by a single RF network node master RF network node within the RFID tag . In embodiments the master RF network node may be any of the individual RF network nodes within the RFID tag . As discussed further below there may be a selection protocol for determining which individual RF network nodes may become the master RF network node .

In an embodiment a plurality of RF network nodes may be connected together in a serial or parallel manner shows an embodiment of a serial connection.

Referring to an exemplary protocol for determination of a master RF network node in a multiple RF network node RFID tag may be described. In the depicted embodiment there may be a number N of individual RF network nodes in the RFID tag . In this embodiment all of the N RF network nodes may contain identical functional capabilities. A protocol for determining which RF network node may become the master RF network node may involve the following steps. First each individual RF network node receives a logical setting from the previous individual RF network node . All of the individual RF network nodes may be connected by a common power lead . All of the individual RF network nodes may also contain a logical lead that may be connected to the previous individual RF network node or may be connected to another logical RF network node or another function network node. In the depicted embodiment each individual RF network node within the RFID tag may sense from its logical input lead if there is an open or closed circuit on the lead connection.

According to this protocol if the logic lead is open it may indicate that a previous RF network node is not the master RF network node . The open logic lead may indicate to a next RF network node that it should attempt to function as the master RF network node . An open logic lead may indicate that the RF network node may be the first RF network node in the line or that the previous RF network node may be incapable of acting as the master RF network node . Any particular RF network node may not be capable of being the master because of damage to the RF network node damage to the lead not programmed to be the master RF network node or the like.

According to this protocol if the logic lead is closed it may indicate that the previous RF network node is the master RF network node and that the next RF network node and additional RF network nodes should act as slave RF network nodes to any commands transmitted by the master RF network node . In an embodiment the closed logic lead setting between two RF network nodes may be communicated to the other RF network nodes . For example if the logical lead is closed between the first and second RF network nodes the closed logical lead setting may be transmitted to a third RF network node and all the other RF network nodes on the RFID tag .

In an embodiment the determination of which RF network node is the master RF network node may cascade down all N RF network nodes until a master RF network node is determined or that no RF network node is determined to be a master RF network node . In an embodiment the determination whether a first RF network node is to become the master RF network node may be determined in the logic of the first RF network node . If the first RF network node is capable of functioning as a master RF network node the logic of the RF network node may close the logic lead circuit to the second RF network node to indicate that it is the master RF network node . If the first RF network node is not able to function as the master RF network node the logic lead circuit may remain open indicating that the next RF network node in line should attempt to be the master RF network node . In this manner the master determination process may proceed to each RF network node in the RFID tag until a master RF network node has been determined.

In an embodiment this process may be considered a fail safe master RF network node selection method because each RF network node in the RFID tag may be capable of being the master RF network node . In an embodiment as long as one RF network node is functional a master RF network node may be determined.

In an embodiment in addition to the common power and logic leads between the RF network nodes there may be other connections as described below in such as other functional connections serial bus connections parallel bus connections or the like. In an embodiment the determination of the master RF network node may be substantially the same in these connection methods.

Another embodiment of a master RF network node determination in a multiple RF network node sub system is shown on and . An arbitration and synchronization protocol in a RF network node multi RF network node environment may be used to control the operation of non attached RF network nodes on the same RFID tag. The master RF network node may be selected through a process of sending a synchronization signal transmitting a random number seed signal transmitting a completion of the synchronization and the like. The other non master RF network nodes may use the transmitted random number seed signal for any functions the RF network nodes may require such as broadcast time slot determination.

As described above there may be a plurality i.e. two or more of RF network nodes on an RFID tag e.g. passive or active connected to antenna leads of the RFID tag. The plurality of RF network nodes may be randomly placed on the antenna lead zone and may randomly connect to the antenna leads. In embodiments not all of the RF network nodes applied to the antenna lead zone may make a connection to the antenna leads. In an embodiment all of the RF network nodes on the RFID tag may be the same type of RF network node or there may be more than one RF network node type on the RFID tag. In an embodiment the master RF network node may be any one of the RF network nodes on the RFID tag and the master RF network node may coordinate the transmissions and activities of the other RF network nodes on the RFID tag.

Another exemplary protocol for determining a master RF network node may involve the individual RF network nodes communicating using the antenna as a communication bus. Referring to an embodiment of a RF network node connection to an antenna as a communication bus for determination of a master RF network node is shown. As previously described there may be a plurality of RF network nodes connected to a single or multiple antennas the plurality of RF network nodes may be able to communicate using the antenna . In an embodiment any of the plurality of RF network nodes on an RFID tag may be a master RF network node. The antenna leads and the antenna may provide a connection between each of the plurality of RF network nodes and the antenna may act as communication bus to the connected RF network nodes . In an embodiment the plurality of RF network nodes connected to the antenna may use the antenna as a communication path between the plurality of RF network nodes thereby permitting the plurality of RF network nodes a method of inter communication. The RF network nodes may communicate data on the antenna bus to support RFID tag capabilities such as coordinated data backscattering improved signal strength flexible data storage security reliability power efficient system and the like. In an embodiment because of the different communication frequencies used the antenna may be able to act as a communication bus between the plurality of RF network nodes and broadcast information from the RFID tag without the inter RF network node communication interfering with the broadcast information.

In an embodiment a RF network node may include an ESD and impedance matching facility an RF section and demodulation facility an inter RF network node communication circuit and other logic circuits for data storage and transmission.

As previously described the ESD and impedance matching facility may provide electro static protection for the RF network node and impedance matching between the antenna and RF network nodes . The impedance matching facility may receive commands to switch elements on off within the RF network node to improve the impedance match between the antenna and a RF network node .

As depicted in the RF section and demodulation facility may receive and transmit data for the RF network node not shown to and from the antenna bus not shown . The RF and demodulation facility may demodulate the received data signal from the antenna bus and may provide input to the RFID clock for transmission timing of the RF network node transmissions.

The inter node communication circuit may contain an amplifier for the amplification of the received information the amplified received information may be received information from the antenna bus. In an embodiment the amplified information may be transmitted to a data processing unit that may be part of the RF network node described in previous figures. In an embodiment the inter node communication functionality described herein may be included as part of the RF section and demodulation facility .

In an embodiment as described in the plurality of RF network nodes accessing the antenna bus may provide a distributed functionality for the RFID tag with a master RF network node coordinating the functionality of the other RF network nodes on the RFID tag . The distributed functionality may include combined memory locations separate multiple memory locations secure memory locations public memory locations multiple frequencies selective power reduction encryption decryption and the like.

In an embodiment the determination of a master RF network node on an RFID tag may occur during the power up of the RFID tag. With reference to the power up may for example be in response to an RFID tag reader requesting the RFID tag to broadcast information. There may be a period of time during the RFID tag power up that may be used for the determination of a master RF network node. In an embodiment with each power up a different RF network node may be selected to become the master RF network node . In an embodiment there may be a protocol sequence to determine which of the plurality of RF network nodes would become the master RF network node .

Referring to a simplified protocol sequence for determining a master RF network node is shown. In an embodiment a RF network node as described in attempting to become a master RF network node may transmit information to the antenna bus such as a synchronization signal wait periods and a random number seed a complete signal and the like. In an embodiment during the RFID tag power up each RF network node may attempt to transmit the random number seed to the antenna bus for the other RF network nodes to read. In an embodiment the RF network nodes may use the new random number seed to determine functions such as transmission time slot for synchronization of operation encryption decryption security combined memory function frequency selection or the like.

In an embodiment the master RF network node transmission signal may consist of a plurality of equal time period signals for the transmission of information. For example the time period for the synchronization signal completion signal and wait signals and may be of equal length. In an embodiment as will be discussed in greater detail below the synchronization signal may be used to indicate that a master RF network node is transmitting a random number seed . The random number seed signal may be an integer multiplier of the time period of the equal time periods e.g. start completion or wait . In an embodiment this may provide for equal length time periods for the master RF network node transmission signal the equal length period signal may provide for simple master RF network node transmission detection. The total master RF network node transmission signal length may be TotalSignal periodSync Wait of Waits Random Number Complete

In an embodiment as shown above the time period for the transmission of the random number seed may be a period equal to any of the synchronization wait and or complete signals times the number of bits in the random number seed . Therefore the random number seed transmission period may be a multiple of any of the synchronization wait and or complete signal periods in the signal.

In an embodiment when an RFID tag receives a power up signal the plurality of RF network nodes may attempt to become the master RF network node. With the power up signal all of the RF network nodes may attempt to transmit the synchronization signal the individual RF network nodes may transmit the synchronization signal at a time determined by the random number. In an embodiment the plurality of RF network nodes may transmit their synchronization signals in different time slots therefore avoiding transmission collisions.

In an embodiment when the first RF network node transmits a synchronization signal the remainder of the RF network nodes on the RFID tag may refrain from transmitting and may read the random number seed signal that has been transmitted to the antenna bus. In a non collision situation only one RF network node may transmit the synchronization start signal to the antenna bus. Once one RF network node has transmitted a synchronization signal it may then transmit a random number seed onto the antenna bus that the other RF network nodes may then read. The other RF network nodes may use this new random number to determine the transmission time slot for backscattering data or other RF network node function.

In an embodiment with all of the RF network nodes using the same random number seed all of the RF network nodes may transmit their information at the same time or at a time determined by the use of the random number seed . In an embodiment this may allow for the storage of the same information on the plurality of RF network nodes coordination of information storage across a plurality of RF network nodes or the like. In an embodiment this may enable the plurality of RF network nodes to act as a single large memory location with different RF network nodes storing different information.

In an embodiment there may be more than one type of RF network node on the RFID tag in this embodiment each RF network node may use the new random number seed to transmit different information in different time slots. This may allow for the storage of different data across the more than one type of RF network node thereby providing for distributed memory storage on the plurality of RF network nodes .

Referring now to an embodiment of a communication protocol for arbitration and synchronization in a multiple RF network node sub system depicted in more detail in is shown. As shown in collisions may occur when more than one RF network node attempts to transmit a synchronization signal at the same time. When the synchronization signal is transmitted by more than one RF network node all the other RF network nodes may stop transmitting and wait for the complete signal .

A protocol may be advantageous to determine if the RF network nodes that may transmit at the same time need to retransmit the random number for the determination of a master RF network node i.e. collision management . As part of the protocol there may be a check sequence to verify that the transmitted random number seed is not corrupt the random number seed may become corrupt if different random numbers were transmitted.

As shown in if a first RF network node and a second RF network node transmit a synchronization signal and and random number seed and at the same time there may be a transmission collision. As depicted in this figure other RF network nodes that have not yet transmitted a synchronization signal would then not transmit a synchronization signal wait signals and random number seed and complete signal all shown by dashed lines until a complete signal has been transmitted to the antenna bus. In an embodiment a complete signal may not be transmitted until all transmission collisions are resolved.

As depicted in if there is a collision of the transmission from the first RF network node and the second RF network node the combined random number seeds and from the first RF network node and the second RF network node may collide on the antenna bus and may become corrupt. In an embodiment there may be a check sequence in each RF network node that transmits a random number seed to verify that the random number seed on the antenna bus matches the transmitted random number seed and . In an embodiment each RF network node that transmits a random number seed and may store the random number seed and in a storage location for comparison to the transmitted random number seed and . In an embodiment if the random number seeds and are transmitted at the same or different times the resulting antenna bus random number seed may become corrupted and may not match the transmitted random number seeds and .

As depicted in if the antenna bus random number seed does not match the transmitted random number seed and the first RF network node may not transmit the complete signal and the second RF network node may not transmit the complete signal both shown as dashed lines . In this case the non matching random number seeds may be an indication that there was a collision between at least two RF network nodes attempting to be the master RF network node.

In an embodiment after the collision of the random number seeds the first RF network node and the second RF network node may attempt to retransmit a second synchronization signal and and a second random number seed and at random times to avoid another transmission collision. For example the second RF network node may use a random wait time before attempting to retransmit its second synchronization signal .

In the example of the first RF network node is shown re transmitting the synchronization signal before the second RF network node synchronization signal . In an embodiment this may cause the second RF network node to not transmit the synchronization signal random number seed and complete signal all shown by dashed lines because the first RF network node transmitted the synchronization signal first. The first RF network node may then compare the transmitted random number seed with the random number seed on the antenna bus . If they are the same number the first RF network node may transmit the complete signal . In an embodiment the transmission of a complete signal to the antenna bus may indicate to the other RF network nodes that a master has been determined and to use the random number seed on the antenna bus for control of any RF network node functions. In an embodiment each of the other RF network nodes may receive and store each random number seed transmitted to the antenna bus. Once the other RF network nodes receive a complete signal the other RF network nodes may retain the last received random number seed as the master RF network node random number seed.

In an embodiment this sequence of transmitting a synchronization signal and random number seed checking the transmitted random number seed for corruption and re transmitting as necessary may be repeated until the transmitted random number seed on the antenna bus is not corrupted. The random number seed may be considered not corrupt if the antenna bus random number seed matches the transmitted random number seed . In an embodiment a non corrupted antenna bus random number seed may indicate that a master RF network node has been selected.

In an embodiment more than one master RF network node may be selected if more than one RF network node transmits the same random number seed at the same time. In an embodiment the selection of more than one RF network node as a master RF network node may indicate that more than one RF network node transmitted the same random number seed at a synchronized time.

As a result of the above described transmission by the first RF network node and the second RF network node the antenna bus received signal may be as shown in . In an embodiment the antenna bus may receive a combined synchronization signal wait time and a combined random number seed from the first RF network node and the second RF network node . The random number seed may have been a corrupt signal because of the random number seed and being transmitted at the same time. There may then be a random length wait time while the first and second RF network nodes wait random times to retransmit their signals. In an embodiment the antenna bus may then receive the synchronization signal random number seed and complete signal from the first RF network node to retransmit. As depicted in the first RF network node may transmit first.

In an embodiment receiving the complete signal on the antenna bus may be an indication to the other RF network nodes that a master RF network node has been determined and the random number seed on the antenna bus is to be used for any RF network node functions. In an embodiment the determined master RF network node s may continue to operate as the master RF network node of the RFID tag for the length of the RFID tag read. In an embodiment a different RF network node may be selected as the master RF network node with the next power up sequence.

In another embodiment of a master RF network node determination all the RF network nodes may operate as peers and a discovery protocol may be used to assign a role to each of the nodes. The role assignment may provide a distinct number assignment to each RF network node which may be used by the RF network node to understand its role in becoming a master RF network node or a slave RF network node. In an embodiment each RF network node may include a table that may define the role of each RF network node on the RFID tag . In an embodiment the table may be the same for each RF network node different for each RF network node or the like. For example the RFID tag may include four RF network nodes. The table included with each RF network node may indicate that node two is to become the master RF network node and the other three RF network nodes are to become slave RF network nodes. During power up RF network node two may become the master network node of the RFID tag . In an embodiment the table may also include information of which RF network node may be redundant to one of the other RF network nodes in the situation where the RF network node was to stop functioning.

Using one of the above described master RF network node determination protocols it may be determined which RFID tag RF network node is a master RF network node and which are the slave RF network nodes. In determining the master RF network node the functions of the multiple RF network nodes on an RFID tag may be coordinated by a single RF network node to provide increased functionality such as distributed memory RF network node redundancy multiple communication frequencies multiple antenna interfacing and the like. As previously described any of the more than one RF network nodes on the RFID tag may become the master RF network node.

In an embodiment the master RF network node may provide the interface function between the RFID tag and the reader inter RF network node communication memory management redundant RF network node protocol or the like as depicted in . In an embodiment with one RF network node coordinating the functionality of the RFID tag the multiple RF network node RFID tag may appear as a single chip RFID tag to a standard RFID reader . The master RF network node may provide management of the RFID tag functionality that may include coordination of all the RF network node memories that may provide for increased amounts of accessible memory for a single RFID tag . In embodiments coordination may be according to a network topology among RF network nodes and may be associated with the inter node interface common antenna connection communications facility and the like. In embodiments coordination may be through tag to tag communications as described herein. The network topology may be a ring network topology a mesh network topology a serial topology a packet based network topology or the like where topology may refer to the configuration of a communication. In embodiments the serial topology may utilize serial bus technologies and configurations described herein. As will be described below the accessible memory may be accessed as combined memory increased memory a combination of combined and increased memory for redundancy private memory public memory user memory and the like.

In an embodiment the slave RF network nodes any of the non master RF network nodes may receive commands from the master RF network node to be executed. In an embodiment as a slave RF network node may perform any function command memory request or the like that may be transmitted from the master RF network node. In an embodiment the slave RF network nodes may become specialized in functions that are performed. For example the individual slave may provide the encryption password protection communication interface control or the like for the master RF network node. Additionally the slave RF network node may provide certain amounts of memory types of memory e.g. private public redundant memory or the like that may be coordinated by the master RF network node.

In an embodiment the RF network node redundancy may be executed by either the master RF network node or slave network node. For example if a slave RF network node was to become damaged and stop functioning the master RF network node may determine the protocol for at least one other RF network node providing redundant functionality memory or the like for the damaged slave. In another example if the master RF network node was to become damaged and stop functioning the slave RF network nodes may follow a protocol in determining which slave RF network node will become the master RF network node.

In an embodiment referring to the RFID tag may communicate with the RFID reader using a single RF network node using a single master RF network node using a plurality of RF network nodes or the like. Using the single transmitting RF network node the single RF network node may coordinate the information requested by the reader from the other RF network nodes that may be on the RFID tag . In an embodiment the single RF network node may receive the reader request and depending on the request the single RF network node may request information from the other RF network nodes on the RFID tag. After all the information has been received from the other RF network nodes the single RF network node may transmit the requested information back to the reader .

Using a plurality of transmitting RF network nodes some or all of the plurality of RF network nodes may transmit the requested reader information all at the same time at different times or the like. In one embodiment the plurality of RF network nodes may transmit in ordered time slots to transmit individual parts of the total requested information in an ordered sequence back to the reader . In another embodiment all the RF network nodes may simultaneously transmit information to the reader . In an embodiment the simultaneous transmission and ordered time slot transmission from the plurality of RF network nodes may require a synchronizing of the plurality of RF network nodes .

In one embodiment after the multiple RF network nodes have been applied to the RFID tag information related to the transmission protocol e.g. as single or multiple RF network nodes may be programmed into the RF network nodes . As shown in the transmission protocol information may be programmed to the RF network nodes . In an embodiment the programming may be the storing of the transmission protocol into the RF network node non volatile memory to be recalled during a read of the RFID tag . In an embodiment the programming may be performed by a reader type device that is able to communicate with the RF network nodes and store the transmission protocol information within the RF network node memory. In another embodiment the transmission protocol may be part of the firmware or hardware of the RF network nodes as part of the RF network node manufacture. Therefore the transmission protocol of the RFID tag may be determined when the RF network nodes are assembled to the RFID tag .

Referring to an embodiment of the RFID tag communicating with the reader is shown. In embodiments the reader may communicate with the RFID tag in different protocols based on whether the RFID tag is communicating with a single RF network node or a plurality of RF network nodes . In an embodiment of communicating with a plurality of RF network nodes the RFID tag may communicate with the reader . The reader may be a stand alone device or may include a synchronicity device an interrogator device a reader device or the like. In an embodiment the process of reading the plurality of RF network nodes may include sending a synchronicity signal and an interrogator signal and the RFID tag may respond by reflecting or broadcasting an RF signal containing the information stored in the RFID tag memory.

In an embodiment the synchronicity device may send an RF signal that may initialize and synchronize the internal clocks of a plurality of RF network nodes . In certain embodiments the RF network node may not have a physical internal clock. In these embodiments receipt of the synchronicity signal by the plurality of RF network nodes may initiate a process within the plurality of RF network nodes that may result in synchronization. In a situation where there are multiple RF network nodes associated with an antenna the plurality of RF network nodes may receive the synchronicity signal and the synchronicity signal may initiate a substantially identical process within each RF network node . This may result in a substantially identical transmission of data from the multiple RF network nodes for example. This step may allow all of the RF network nodes to reflect or broadcast an RF signal at the same time and therefore reflect or broadcast as if there were one RF network node. As another example the synchronicity may allow the plurality of RF network nodes to transmit information in a timed sequence from each of the plurality of RF network nodes in this manner the reader may receive information as if a single RF network node transmitted it. In an embodiment the synchronicity device may be included in the RF network node . When the RF network node is energized a signal may be received from the interrogator device or the reader device to calibrate the RF network node the calibration may initiate the logic and internal clock synchronization. In another embodiment when the RF network node is energized the RF network node may initiate a calibration sequence to initialize all the nodes in the RFID tag . This may include RF network node functionality configuration clock frequencies and the like.

In an embodiment the interrogator device may send an RF signal that may request the RFID tag to reflect or broadcast its information stored in memory. For a passive RFID tag the interrogator device RF signal may also energize the RFID tag . In an embodiment the interrogator device may include the synchronicity device and therefore may initialize the plurality of RF network nodes and request information to be reflected or broadcast.

In an embodiment the reader device may receive reflected or broadcast information from the RFID tag . This information may relate to the item with which the RFID tag is associated. The reader device may listen for a certain frequency to be reflected or broadcast or may listen for a plurality of frequencies. The reader device may be connected to a computer device e.g. computer server or network for aggregation of the received information.

In an embodiment involving communicating with a single master RF network node the RFID tag may communicate with the reader . The reader may be a stand alone device or may include the interrogator device the reader device or the like the synchronicity device may not be required when communicating to a master RF network node . As previous described with master RF network nodes upon power up the slave RF network nodes may respond to the command request from the master RF network node.

In an embodiment when communicating with a RFID tag using a master RF network node the interrogator device may transmit an information request to the RFID tag . The plurality of RF network nodes may power up and determine which RF network node will become the master RF network node. Once the master RF network node has been determined the master RF network node will receive the information request from the interrogator . In an embodiment the master RF network node may coordinate any information that may be provided by the other RF network nodes on the RFID tag .

In an embodiment once the master RF network node has received information required from the other RF network nodes the master RF network node may transmit the requested information. Within the reader the reader device may receive the information. Once the information is received it may be communicated to a connected computer server network or the like.

As previously described the RFID antenna may provide the reflecting or broadcasting means for the RFID tag by reflecting or broadcasting the signal generated by the RF network nodes that may be connected to the antenna leads. The antenna may be configured in various shapes such as a bar loop patch or the like. The antenna leads may be used to connect the antenna to the RF network nodes . The antenna leads may be in a configuration that may have the leads of a first half of the antenna in close proximity to a second antenna lead. The two antenna leads may be close enough to allow the leads on the RF network node to make contact between the first antenna lead and the second antenna lead. The configuration of the two antenna leads may be of any shape as long as the space between the two leads may be bridged by the RF network node . The RF network node may contain at least two external leads that may be connected to the antenna leads. The RF network node leads may be configured on the RF network node advantageously for bridging the space between the two antenna leads for example on different sides of the RF network node .

The RF network node may provide an information radio frequency signal using the antenna in response to an interrogator s request. Upon the request from the interrogator the RF network node may reflect or broadcast information stored in the memory. The information previously may have been stored in the memory the information may relate to the item to which the RFID tag is attached. The RF network node may reflect or broadcast at a set frequency that may be received by a particular reader type.

Referring to an embodiment of a schematic of four RF network nodes A B C D associated with an antenna is shown. An aspect of the systems and methods described herein may involve more than one RF network node A B C D communicating and functioning as a single RFID tag . In an embodiment redundancy may be achieved by at least one RF network node A B C D providing a backup to another RF network node A B C D that may have become damaged or has otherwise lost functionality. The backup may be either functional where the backup RF network node provides the function of the damaged RF network node or memory where the RF network node provides a backup for the memory of the damaged RF network node A B C D . For example if RF network node A were to become damaged one or more of the other RF network nodes B C D may assume the function or memory of the damaged RF network node A. In an embodiment there may be more than one method of determining which of the other RF network nodes B C D will assume the function of the damaged RF network node A.

In an embodiment the simplest method of redundancy may involve all of the RF network nodes A B C D having the same function and memory so that the RFID tag will continue to function as long as one RF network node A B C D continues to function. In another embodiment there may be RF network nodes A B C D that have different functions within the RFID tag . The different functions may include encryption sensor reading private memory public memory or the like. In an embodiment the RF network nodes A B C D while having different functions may have a common core of logic to allow one RF network node A B C D to perform the requirements of another RF network node A B C D . In an embodiment all of the RF network nodes A B C D may be identical but during power up the different RF network nodes may assume different roles on the RFID tag .

In the case of an RF network node A being damaged one of the other RF network nodes B C D may be able to assume the role of the damaged RF network node A . In an embodiment when an RF network node A is damaged and another RF network node B C D assumes the function of the damaged RF network node A there may be a loss of some functionality of the RFID tag . In an embodiment the function of the damaged RF network node A may be assumed by more than one of the other RF network nodes B C D to provide all the functionality of the damaged RF network node A . It should be understood by someone knowledgeable in the art that there may be many different configuration methods of one RF network node A B C D providing redundancy to another RF network node A B C D .

In another embodiment there may be a pre assignment as to which RF network node A B C D becomes the redundant RF network node A B C D for another RF network node A B C D . In an embodiment the assignment of redundancy may be in the firmware of the RF network nodes A B C D in the data of the RF network nodes A B C D or the like. In this configuration if an RF network node A B C D is damaged there may be a pre assigned replacement for the non functioning RF network node A B C D . For example if one RF network node A is damaged it may be predetermined that a second RF network node B will provide the redundant function for the damaged RF network node A. It should be understood that there may be a series of pre assigned redundancy for damaged RF network nodes A B C D . The pre assignment may provide for a single RF network node A B C D redundancy a combination of RF network node A B C D redundancies or the like. It should be understood that there may be a number of pre assigned redundancy configurations that would be consistent with the systems and methods described herein.

In another embodiment a communication protocol may determine which RF network node A B C D is to be the redundant RF network node A B C D . In an embodiment similar to the master RF network node communication described in and the remaining functional RF network nodes A B C D capable of being a redundant RF network node A B C D may transmit a signal to indicate that any one of them is available to replace the damaged RF network node A B C D . In an embodiment more than one RF network node A B C D may signal to become the redundant RF network node A B C D and a protocol of collision resolution may be used to determine which will be the redundant RF network node A B C D . For example two RF network nodes A and B may each attempt to signal to be the redundant RF network node. Following the signal protocol each RF network node A and B may determine a time slot to send the redundant signal the first to transmit the signal may become the redundant RF network node. In the case of both RF network nodes A and B signaling at the same time a protocol may be employed to resolve the collision and retransmit the signal to determine which one becomes the redundant RF network node. In an embodiment the resolution protocol may continue until it is determined which one of the RF network nodes A or B will become the redundant RF network node.

In an embodiment the RFID tag may be able to report the status of the RF network nodes A B C D in the RFID tag . This may allow for advance notice of a potential permanent disablement of the RFID tag which can then provide the basis for appropriate remedial actions. For example the RFID tag may contain four RF network nodes A B C D but two may have become damaged and the remaining two RF network nodes are providing redundant functionality or memory. In this example the damaged RF network nodes may reduce the over all functionality of the RFID tag . The RFID tag may communicate in a transmission to the reader that there are damaged RF network nodes and that the RFID tag functionality has been reduced. This may provide notice to replace the RFID tag to restore full functionality and information recording.

In a similar manner to the functional redundancy the RF network node A B C D memory may also have a redundancy protocol. In an embodiment the plurality of RF network nodes A B C D may create a distributed memory to be used in configurations such as redundant memory or increased memory to the RFID tag . The redundant memory configuration may have each of the more than one RF network nodes A B C D storing the same information thereby providing a memory configuration that may maintain the RFID tag information as long as one of the RF network nodes A B C D is operational. The increased memory configuration may access the individual RF network node A B C D memory as a single memory to store increased amounts of memory for the RFID tag . In an embodiment either of these memory configurations may support public memory private memory encrypted memory read once write many read write read only or the like.

In an embodiment each of the more than one RF network nodes A B C D may store the same memory information in the redundant memory configuration so that on the same RFID tag the same information may be stored on each of the individual RF network nodes A B C D . In this redundant memory configuration the RFID tag information may be maintained as long as one of the RF network nodes A B C D continues to operate. In an embodiment the redundant memory configuration may be used on components that operate in environmentally challenging locations such as high temperatures high stress or the like where there may be a possibility of the RFID tag being damaged.

In an embodiment the distributed memory may provide for increased memory where the memory of the more than one RF network nodes A B C D function as a combined single memory store so that the memory may be the sum of all the RF network node A B C D memory. For example if each of the RF network nodes A B C D have 8K of memory the total memory of a four RF network node RFID tag would be 32K of memory. In an embodiment the increased memory RFID tag may be used on components that are in a less stressful environment where the RFID tag is less likely to be damaged.

In another embodiment the distributed memory may store a combination of data and metadata. In an embodiment the RFID tag may store data only until a reader reads the data. As part of the data read the RFID tag data may be cleared and metadata indicating an external network storage location of the data just read from the RFID tag may be written to the RFID tag . In this manner the RFID tag may be able to record and store more data than would otherwise be possible with the limited amount of memory on the RFID tag . Over time data recorded by the RFID tag may be stored on an external data store with only metadata stored on the RFID tag .

An additional advantage to this memory configuration may be that data would not be lost if the RFID tag were damaged and stopped functioning. In an embodiment if the RFID tag is damaged it may be replaced with a new RFID tag and the existing metadata loaded to the new RFID tag thereby providing for continued data recording from the same component without a loss of data by means of the new RFID tag .

In an embodiment the different memory configurations may be used individually or in combination to provide the memory configuration required for the RFID tag type. For example in a four RF network node A B C D RFID tag two RF network nodes A B storing the same information may create redundant memory this may be repeated for the other two RF network nodes C D with a final result of two sets of redundant RF network nodes A B and C D . Additionally the two sets of RF network nodes A B and C D may then be combined as increased memory for the RFID tag . This configuration may result in two sets of redundant increased memory for the RFID tag . It may be understood by one knowledgeable in the art that the RF network nodes A B C D may use in a number of different redundant and increased memory configurations.

In an embodiment the RF network node memory configuration may be set in the hardware firmware software configured or the like. In an embodiment the memory configuration may be programmed into the RFID tag when it is associated with a component.

In an embodiment in either a redundant or increased memory configuration the master RF network node may manage the memory of the RFID tag . As part of the hardware firmware software or like configurations of the RFID tag different parts of the RFID tag memory may be assigned different read write permissions. For example there may be private memory public memory user memory read only memory write once read many memory read write and the like that may be used for different information dependent on the different entities that needed access to the information. In an embodiment the master RF network node may manage the different memories memory configurations memory read types and the like within the RFID tag . In an embodiment the may be predetermined memory locations and memory allocations for the different types of memory within the RFID tag .

In an embodiment public memory may be used for information that can be read may any entity or enterprise that is able to read the information from the RFID tag . For example any enterprise along a distribution route for a product with an RFID tag may be able to read the name and quantity information of the product. But only certain enterprises may be able to read the distribution history of the product the owner information serial number information final delivery information or the like. This information may be in private memory and may be encrypted protected with a password or the like.

In an embodiment the RFID tag may have user specific memory that only the owner of the product may access. The user memory may be structured or non structured memory that may allow the user to write any information to these locations. The user memory may be encrypted password protected or the like.

In an embodiment public private or user memory may be read only write once read many read write or the like. In an embodiment information in the read only memory may be written to the RFID tag when the RFID tag is initially associated with the object. This may be information that the owner of the object does not want to have replaced or lost during the life span of the object such as the object name the object quantity the object serial number or the like.

In an embodiment information in the write once read many memory may be information that is added to the RFID tag during the life span of the object. This may be information that the owner of the object does not want to have replaced or lost during the life span of the object. For example the object may be in a distribution system. At each stop change of transportation system change of carrier or the like that occurs during the distribution of the object information may be written to the RFID tag to provide a distribution history of the object. The owner of the object may want the distribution information written to the RFID tag but may not want to have the information overwritten or erased because this information may provide a distribution history of the object. But once the information is written to the RFID tag the owner of the object may want to read the distribution information many times. In an embodiment the write once read many memory may be public private or user memory.

In an embodiment information in the read write memory may be information that is temporary information to the RFID tag during the life span of the object. The read write memory may be overwritten during the life span of the object and may be used to provide temporary information information of the last state of the object information containing the changing state of the object e.g. changing weight or the like. For example the RFID tag may be on a pallet that holds a number of identical objects. Every time an object is removed from the pallet the number of objects remaining on the pallet may be revised in the read write memory of the RFID tag . In this example the read write memory may be public private or user memory.

As previously described herein the RFID tag may include a communication facility that may provide communication to external facilities such as devices networks interfaces or the like that are external to the RFID tag . Referring to an embodiment is shown of the RFID tag communicating with a plurality of sensors AA AB AC a gateway facility C and a cellular network EA. In an embodiment the communication facility may be connected to more than one external facility at the same time. For example the communication facility may be connected to a self powered sensor AA and a gateway facility C. This may allow the RFID tag to read the self powered sensor and communicate the reading to a network that may be connected to the gateway facility C.

In an embodiment the gateway facility C may provide communication to an external network that may include a LAN a WAN a peer to peer network an intranet an Intranet or the like. In an embodiment the connection between the gateway facility C and the communication facility may be wired or wireless. The wireless connection may include WiFi Bluetooth wireless USB ultra wideband or the like. In an embodiment the gateway facility C may be able to transmit and receive information to and from the network. In an embodiment by connection to a gateway facility C the RFID tag may be considered computer device on a network where information may be input and output. For example as information is stored on the RFID tag from a reader or sensor AA AB AC the stored information may be transmitted to the network using the communication facility connected to the gateway facility C. Additionally information may be stored on the RFID tag from the network. For example during a read cycle the RFID tag may check the connected gateway facility for any information that may be waiting to be transferred from the network.

In another embodiment RFID tags may be able to communicate with each other using the connected gateway facility C. In this embodiment a group of RFID tags may form an RFID tag network where information may be communicated between the each other using the gateway facility C network connection. For example in addition or instead of communicating information to the reader when the RFID tag is powered up by a reader signal the RFID tag may communicate information to other RFID tags using the gateway facility C. There may be more than one RFID tag within an area that also have gateway facility C connections that may receive and transmit information to and from other RFID tags . The RFID tags may be able to communicate any information stored within the RFID tag memory using the gateway facility C. The inter RFID tag communication may provide a method of data backup among the RFID tags may provide an RFID tag distributed memory may provide an RFID tag shared memory or the like.

In an embodiment the cellular network EA connection may provide another method of communicating information to a network. In certain situations the RFID tag may not be directly connected to a gateway facility C network but may have connectivity through the cellular network EA. The cellular network EA may provide the RFID tag access to a cellular network provider and thereby access to a network for communicating the RFID tag information. Similar to the gateway facility C connection the RFID tag may be able to transmit information to and from the cellular network EA as information is written to the RFID tag .

In an embodiment the gateway facility C and cellular network EA connections may provide traceablity of the RFID tag throughout its life cycle. For example as a product moves through a distribution system it may have a plurality of read cycles that may write information to the RFID tag . As the RFID tag receives information the RFID tag may be able to communicate the new information through the gateway facility C or cellular network EA. In this manner the information on the RFID tag may be recorded and tracked from a remote location connected to the network. For example the owner of the RFID tag product may be able to track the progress of the product through the distribution system from the remotely connected location.

In an embodiment the RFID tag communication facility may be connected to both the gateway facility C and the cellular network EA. Depending on the location of the RFID tag when new information is written the RFID tag may select either the gateway facility C or cellular network EA to communicate the new information to the network. For example in a more remote location the cellular network EA may provide the network connection when the gateway facility may not have connectivity to a network.

In an embodiment the RFID tag may be able to connect to the network through the gateway facility C or cellular network EA during power up at full power or the like. In embodiments the RFID tag may be powered up by ambient electro magnetic waves by a reader signal by an electro magnet signal device or the like. For example the RFID tag may power up every time there is an ambient electro magnetic wave that is strong enough to provide power to the RFID tag . During any of the ambient wave power ups the RFID tag may attempt to communicate with the network using the gateway facility C or cellular network EA. In another example there may be a device that periodically generates a signal that may power up the RFID tag to communicate with the network.

In an embodiment the sensors AA AB AC may provide information such as temperature humidity stress acceleration or the like to the RFID tag . In an embodiment the sensors AA AB AC may be self powered AA RFID tag powered AB require no power AC or the like.

In an embodiment the communication facility may provide connectivity between the RFID tag and the sensors AA AB AC . In embodiments the communication facility may be a direct interface a serial interface a parallel interface a gateway interface a network interface or the like. In an embodiment any of the interface types may be implemented as a wired or wireless connection. In an embodiment the wireless connections may be a cellular connection a WiFi connection an infrared connection a Bluetooth connection wireless USB ultra wideband or the like. In an embodiment the communication facility may provide a connection to the sensors a network other RFID tags or the like.

In an embodiment the RFID tag using a wireless communication interface may be located remotely from the sensors AA AB AC . This may allow the RFID tag to be in a location that may be less susceptible to damage and still collect data from a sensor AA AB AC that may be in an environment that would be damaging to the RFID tag .

Additionally using the communication facility the RFID tag may be able to communication with more than one sensor AA AB AC using either a wired or wireless connection. In this embodiment the RFID tag may network a number of sensors together to collect and save the sensor information.

In an embodiment the communication facility may be a separate device from the RFID tag part of the RFID tag a combination of separate and part of the RFID tag or the like.

In an embodiment the RFID tag may read the sensors AA AB AC during power up at full power or the like. In embodiments the RFID tag may be powered up by ambient electro magnetic waves by a reader signal by a electro magnet signal device or the like. For example the RFID tag may power up every time there is an ambient electro magnetic wave that is strong enough to provide power to the RFID tag . During any of the ambient wave power ups the RFID tag may read the data from the sensors AA AB AC . In another example there may be a device that periodically generates a signal that may power up the RFID tag to read the sensors AA AB AC . In another example the sensors AA AB AC may contain memory for the sensor readings taken during a read using ambient waves and the RFID tag may read the sensor stored data when the RFID tag receives a reader signal.

In an embodiment the self powered sensor AA may be powered by an external source such as AC power DC power battery power or the like. Because of the constant power source the self powered sensor AA may continuously measure and provide data to the RFID tag . The RFID tag may only read the continuously provided data when the RFID tag is powered up.

In an embodiment the RFID powered sensor AB may be powered only from the RFID tag . In an embodiment when the RFID is powered up the RFID tag may provide power to the RFID powered sensor AB. For example the RFID tag may power up from a received signal the RFID tag may send power to the RFID powered sensor AB the RFID powered sensor AB may read data and the RFID tag may then read and store the RFID powered sensor AB data.

In an embodiment the no power sensor AC may not require any power to read data and may instead wait for the RFID tag to request data. For example the RFID tag may power up from a received signal the RFID tag may request data from the no power sensor AC the no power sensor AC may read data and the RFID tag may then read and store the no power sensor data.

It may be understood by someone knowledgeable in the art that there may be a number of different types of sensors AA AB AC used individually or in combination with at least RFID tag .

In embodiments there may be a number of methods of assembling the RF network nodes as described herein to the RFID tag . The RF network nodes may be applied by mechanical direct placement conductive ink transfer thermal ink transfer silkscreen or the like. In an embodiment non precise RF network node placement processes such as conductive ink transfer thermal ink transfer silkscreen or the like may be applied to an area of the RFID tag where there are antenna leads that are closely spaced. As depicted in the antenna may have connection leads these leads may be of various designs that may provide for small gaps between the two antenna halves. The small gap between the antenna leads may allow the RF network node leads to bridge the gap and make contact to both halves of the antenna . The two antenna leads may branch into a plurality of leads the plurality of leads of the two antennas may be in close proximity in a certain area on the RFID tag . This certain area may be where the RF network nodes are applied to the RFID tag . In embodiments the gap between the leads may be small enough to allow the RF network node to bridge the antenna lead gap.

In embodiments the mechanical direct placement method may include traditional chip placement such as flip chip direct attach strap attach PICA and the like. Using the mechanical direct placement the RF network node may be place on a substrate using mechanical means. The mechanical direct placement method may be able to precisely place the RF network node to the antenna leads.

In embodiments the RFID tag may be assembled with the use of a super strap where the super strap may be a substrate carrier interposer and the like with the function of packaging a system of integrated circuits IC chips. By providing a physical place holder for multiple IC chips such as RFID nodes RFID chips sensors memory and the like several chips may be interconnected. These interconnections may be a network of series parallel series parallel and the like between IC chips located on a super strap. For instance shows a representation of how multiple ICs may be connected in a series configuration how multiple ICs may be connected in a parallel configuration and how multiple ICs may be connected in a series parallel configuration. These three representative configurations are meant to illustrate the possible interconnections and not to be limiting in any way. One skilled in the art will recognize that there are a wide variety of configurations for interconnecting multiple ICs. In embodiments a super strap may provide convenience during manufacturing. In addition it may provide design advantages for electrical and RF performance for a multi node or composite type RFID tag. In embodiments a use model of the super strap may be similar to a typical strap used in RFID tags.

In manufacturing a super strap may improve the assembly time of a multi node tag where it may be manufactured prior to the attachment of the antenna with a network of multiple chips. Although a super strap may carry multiple chips there may be only a limited number of connections e.g. only two connection points for a dipole antenna . Therefore a typical high volume manufacturing process may maintain its production throughput by attaching just a single super strap to an antenna at high speed. A super strap may provide improved electrical performance when connecting multiple ICs. For instance the close proximity of the chips on a super strap may deliver the most desired positioning of the chips and thus lower electrical losses when sharing data or power between different IC chips.

In embodiments the assembly of the RFID tag may be performed by attaching an IC chip such as RFID node s RFID chip s to an antenna using a flip chip assembly process. In some cases an interposer strap super strap and the like may be used in conjunction with the assembly process. In practice an IC chip may only have a small number of external connections such as two to three external connections implemented as pads pins and the like. As RFID chips incorporate more functionality as is the case in various embodiments of the present invention one may extrapolate scenarios where the input output complexity of the devices creates a need for more external connections. For example the present invention may be implemented in an application for driving an external facility such as a display B as described herein where the input output demands of the external facility may increase with the number of display segments the size of the display the technology of the display the functionality of the display and the like. As the number of external connections increases a challenge may occur in terms of manufacturing complexity. For instance a chip attach process may dictate minimums on pad spacing and other mechanical limits translating into a possibility that the IC chip die size would need to increase in order to accommodate the assembly process limits. This may have the disadvantage of making the die more costly. Additionally this may make the IC chip more vulnerable to mechanical damage in the course of assembly such as in roll to roll processes. In embodiments the present invention may accommodate the increased input output demands of an external facility without substantially increasing the input output count of the IC chip by utilizing intermediate electronics between the IC chip and external facility . For example an IC chip of the present invention may provide an RFID device IC chip where the number of external interface signals to one or more external facilities is minimized or reduced by the use of an external multiplexing and or de multiplexing arrangement or other like intermediate electronics so as to minimize the size of the chip or to provide other benefit. In embodiments the IC chip may interface to the intermediate electronics via a serial bus a time sequenced signal a phase sequenced signal and the like. The intermediate electronics may be implemented using printed electronics printed in a roll to roll process and the like attached in the same line as printing the intermediate electronics circuit. In embodiments the intermediate electronics circuit may be implemented as conventional silicon based circuitry attached in a roll to roll process attached in the same line as attaching the multiplexing circuit. The intermediate electronics circuitry may interface to or be present within an external facility such as a display B a plurality of external facilities and the like or any other external facility as described herein. In embodiments the IC chip may receive and or transmit power from or to external facilities . In embodiments the power signal itself may be used as a communications signal. In embodiments the application of the intermediate electronics between the IC chip and the external facility may be for any of the applications described herein.

In passive RFID tags the maximum power transfer may be a critical factor in achieving the best performance in terms of operating e.g. reading from and writing to a tag. In order to facilitate the maximum power transfer the input impedance of the IC chip may be matched to the corresponding antenna input. In embodiments a super strap may provide a desired flexibility in terms of matching multiple loads to a single antenna . Thus the antenna may better deliver power to all IC chips on a super strap. A series parallel series parallel or the like interconnection configuration may provide for the most flexible way of controlling and achieving the desired impedance of a super strap i.e. load . Depending on the interconnect configuration the impedance of a super strap may be controlled to achieve the desired value. For example in the series connection there may be an improvement of the delivered voltage sharing amongst networked ICs. Whereas in the parallel arrangement of the IC chips on the super strap there may be an improvement of the delivered current sharing among networked ICs.

In an embodiment the RF network node may be placed using conductive inks. The RF network node may be mixed into the conductive ink solution and deposited onto a RFID tag substrate. The conductive ink applications may be an ink jet application a spray application a brush application silkscreen application or the like. In an embodiment there may be a controlled density of RF network nodes within the conductive ink solution that allows a certain number of RF network nodes to be applied to the RFID tag substrate with a certain volume of conductive ink. For example if a spray process is used a spray of a certain duration may yield a known amount of RF network nodes being applied to the RFID tag substrate.

Referring to an embodiment of a screen printing method for the application of RF network nodes to a substrate is shown.

In an embodiment the RF network node may be any shape that may include round square rectangular or the like.

In an embodiment the antenna contacts for the RF network nodes may be on opposite faces of the RF network nodes . For example the antenna contacts may be on the top and bottom faces of the RF network nodes . This embodiment may permit one antenna contact to connect with the first antenna half and the second contact to be available for connection to the second antenna half. In an embodiment the shape of the RF network node substantially matching the shape of the mesh opening may facilitate the proper alignment of the RF network node with the substrate so that proper contact may be made with an antenna.

In an embodiment the mesh may have at least one mesh opening to create a pattern of RF network nodes being placed on a substrate . In an embodiment the dimensions of the mesh openings mesh thickness mesh distance from the substrate the mesh shape and the like may be configured to orient the RF network node to the substrate . For example the RF network node may be a rectangular shape with the mesh having a similar rectangular shape opening . The mesh opening may be substantially the same rectangular shape and the mesh thickness may be matched to the thickness of the RF network node . Thus the mesh opening and thickness may act as a guide for the RF network node to be properly placed on the substrate. In an embodiment the mesh to substrate distance may also be matched to the RF network node thickness so that only one RF network node may be placed per mesh opening . It may be understood by those of skill in the art that any given mesh may contain more than one mesh pattern or any arrangement of mesh openings for the application of more than one RF network node pattern on the substrate .

In an embodiment of a rolling process to press the RF network nodes into contact with the substrate is shown.

As depicted in this figure a roller may be used to roll over the screen printed RF network node pattern to press the RF network nodes onto the substrate . In an embodiment the roller may rotate around a center axis. In an embodiment the roller may be made of a material that will not cause damage to the RF network node . In an embodiment the roller material may include a silicone rubber or the like.

As shown in view B after the process to press the RF network node into contact with the substrate the RF network node may be in contact with the substrate and antenna. As shown in view B after the RF network node has been pressed into contact with the substrate the solution may be cured with heat so that the RF network node is fixed in its position relative to the substrate .

Referring to an embodiment of the screen printing process of applying RF network nodes to an antenna is shown. In an embodiment as shown in view A the antenna may be applied to the substrate using an inkjet process screen printing process or the like. In an embodiment as shown in view B the RF network nodes may be applied to the antenna using the screen printing as previously described in . In an embodiment the screen printing process may be able to apply the RF network nodes in a position required to make contact with the antenna . In this case the RF network node may be applied to one side of the antenna . In an embodiment as previously discussed in the RF network node may have two antenna leads that may be positioned on opposite sides of the RF network node . In an embodiment the screen printing process may orient the RF network node to position the RF network nodes to the substrate providing for one of the RF network node antenna leads to be in contact with the antenna . In an embodiment as shown in view B of one of the antenna leads may be in contact with the left half of the antenna .

In an embodiment after the RF network nodes have been screen printed in place and cured a non conductive layer may be applied over the RF network nodes to the other half of the antenna as shown in view C of . In an embodiment the application of the non conductive layer may be optional. In an embodiment the non conductive layer may provide a transition material layer to allow a smooth contact path for a contact layer to follow. In an embodiment the non conductive layer may be a non conductive solution that may be applied by a process that may include ink jet screen printing spray brush or the like.

In an embodiment the RF network nodes may be applied to one side of the antenna applied to both sides of the antenna bridge across the antenna or may be arranged in any other orientation that allows the RF network node to make contact with both halves of the antenna .

In an embodiment thermal printing may be another printing method that may be used for the application of multiple RF network nodes to a substrate as shown in . shows an embodiment of a thermal printer ribbon applying ink wax resin or the like to a substrate .

In an embodiment the node network may comprise multiple RF network nodes that are connected to communicate in a coordinated manner. The multiple RF network nodes may be connected as previously described using a serial connection parallel connection antenna connection or the like. In an embodiment thermal printing may be used in addition to other multiple network node application methods such as screen printing or thermal printing may be a stand alone application that applies both the multiple RF network nodes and the antenna .

In an embodiment the thermal printer ribbon may be constructed using at least two layers that may include a backing surface an ink surface and the like. In an embodiment the ink may be a wax resin or the like that may melt with the application of heat. In an embodiment a thermal element not shown may apply heat to the ribbon to melt the ink surface and apply the ink to the substrate . In an embodiment the ink may be a conductive ink.

In an embodiment the network nodes may be pre applied to the substrate using another application method. In an embodiment the substrate may be a continuous feed substrate on a roll a set of individual substrates or the like. In an embodiment the substrate with the multiple network nodes may be fed into a thermal printer. In an embodiment the substrate may have antenna leads pre applied to the substrate that may connect to the multiple network nodes. In an embodiment the thermal printer may apply an antenna pattern to the substrate that may connect to the pre applied antenna leads.

In an embodiment the applied antenna pattern may be matched to the type of container to which the RFID tag is attached including containers for substances such as liquid metal wood or the like. For example if the RFID tag is to be applied to a container for liquids the thermal printer may print an antenna that performs best when in close relation to a liquid. Similarly the thermally printed antenna may be adapted for the surface of the container upon which it is printed or it may be adapted for the environment in which the container exists e.g. hot or cold conditions humidity levels proximity to corrosive gases or liquids and the like .

As an example the antenna pattern that may be printed onto the substrate may be selected from a set of antenna patterns that may be used for the different materials on which the RFID tag may be attached. In an embodiment as a RFID tag is being printed the proper antenna may be selected from the set of antenna patterns based on the object bearing the RFID tag . In an embodiment the antenna pattern that is printed may be different for each RFID tag that is printed. For example a first RFID tag that is applied to a water bottle may receive an antenna that is suited for a water application while the next printed RFID tag that is applied on a metal container may receive an antenna that is suited for the metal application. In an embodiment the antenna pattern that may be printed on an RFID tag may be any antenna pattern chosen from the available antenna pattern set.

It will be understood by skilled artisans that any type of information such as bar code information man readable information or the like may be printed on the RFID tag by the thermal printer in addition to an antenna pattern.

In another embodiment the thermal printer may apply both the multiple RF network nodes and the antenna pattern onto an RFID tag . In an embodiment the multiple RF network nodes may be applied to the thermal ribbon and may be applied along with a matched antenna during the thermal printing of the RFID tag . In an embodiment the substrate may be blank and all the RFID tag components e.g. multiple RF network nodes and antenna may be applied to the blank substrate. In this manner the substrate may be any type of blank substrate to be applied to an object and the proper multiple RF network nodes and antenna may be applied as the RFID tag is printed.

In an embodiment the multiple RF network nodes may have been applied to ribbon as shown in . In an embodiment the multiple RF network nodes may be applied using methods previously described methods such as screen printing spray brush or the like. In an embodiment the multiple RF network nodes may be applied in a generic manner so that multiple RF network nodes may be printed based on the object to which the RFID tag may be attached. For example a first item may require a smaller amount of storage space for product data and therefore require fewer RF network nodes . A second item may be more complicated and may require more memory functionality and the like and therefore may require more RF network nodes . In an embodiment the memory used for the second item may include public and private memory.

In an embodiment the multiple RF network nodes may be applied to the ribbon using ink wax resin or the like that hold the multiple nodes in place on the ribbon . In an embodiment during the printing process the multiple RF network nodes may be applied to the substrate by melting the ink wax resin or the like that is holding the multiple RF network nodes to the ribbon. In an embodiment once the ink wax resin or the like is melted the multiple RF network nodes may be applied to the substrate. In an embodiment the connections between the multiple RF network nodes may also be applied by the thermal printing process.

In an embodiment the generic application of the multiple RF network nodes may be a grid of RF network nodes on the ribbon applied to the substrate as required for the item that will bear the RFID tag . For example there may be an N M grid of nodes on the ribbon applied as required to create the multiple network nodes on the substrate . The multiple RF network nodes required for a particular application may require an N 3 M grid of RF network nodes to provide the application with the necessary memory and functionality requirements. The thermal printing process would apply the N 3 M nodes to form the multiple RF network nodes the remainder of the nodes may remain on the ribbon .

In an embodiment the thermal printer may apply an antenna pattern to the substrate that may connect to the multiple RF network nodes that may have been applied by the thermal printing.

When using ink or fluid RF network node placement methods the RF network nodes may not be in contact with the antenna may not be close enough to the antenna may not be in the correct orientation to the antenna or the like. In these cases as illustrated in the RF network nodes may be pulled into contact with the antenna using a vacuum device . Referring to a method and system to provide a maximum number of randomly placed RF network nodes contacting the antenna leads is shown. A vacuum device may be used to pull the randomly placed RF network nodes to the antenna leads in the attachment zone . This method may increase the percentage of randomly placed RF network nodes in electrical contact with the antenna leads in the attachment zone . The attachment zone may be where the leads from the antenna s are in close proximity to each other to allow contact with the randomly placed RF network nodes . As previously described herein the RF network nodes may be applied using a conductive ink method of depositing the RF network nodes to the attachment zone . In embodiments the RF network nodes may be applied by other random placement methods that place the RF network nodes on the attachment zone . In an embodiment the RF network nodes may be randomly placed in the attachment zone by any placement process.

The randomly placed RF network nodes may not be flat on the attachment zone and therefore all the RF network nodes may not make an electrical connection with the antenna leads . If the conductive ink application process is used the RF network node may be partially on top of another RF network node . In an embodiment the RF network nodes may be angled between the antenna leads and part of another RF network node . There may also be a plurality of RF network nodes suspended in the conductive ink solution and not close enough to the antenna leads for the conductive ink to allow electrical contact between the RF network nodes and the antenna leads .

As depicted in a vacuum device may be used to draw RF network nodes that are not in contact with the antenna leads into contact with the antenna leads . In an embodiment the attachment zone or the entire substrate may be made of a porous material that allows air or fluid flow through the porous material using a vacuum device . The vacuum device may be on the opposite side of the substrate from the RF network nodes to draw air or fluid over the RF network nodes and through the porous substrate . The antenna and antenna leads may have previously been applied to the porous substrate . The vacuum device may be used to draw air or fluids through the porous substrate and may pull the RF network nodes flat to the antenna leads . To further aid the positioning of RF network nodes that are partially or fully on top of another RF network node the substrate may be vibrated to allow the RF network nodes to be pulled flat to the antenna leads . The substrate vibration in conjunction with the vacuum device may allow the RF network nodes that are partially or fully on top of other RF network nodes to move to a flat contact with the antenna leads .

As previously described herein and with reference to the RFID tag may include at least one antenna associated with the multiple RF network nodes . In embodiments the multiple antennas may be used to provide different antenna selections to match the type of object to which the RFID tag is attached such as a metal object liquid object or the like. The RFID tag may be able to select the antenna that provides the best reception and transmission characteristics for the RFID tag and object combination. In an embodiment the RFID tag may select one of the antennas to improve the impedance match between the antenna and the RF network nodes the object to which the RFID tag is attached may influence the antenna impedance.

In an embodiment the at least one antenna may be all the same type of antenna different types of antennas a combination of similar antenna and different antennas or the like. For example an RFID tag that includes four antennas may have two pair of similar antennas. This may allow the RFID tag a choice of two different types of antenna for different object types e.g. liquids or metals and a choice within the antenna types to adjust the impedance of the selected antenna type to the RF network nodes . In an embodiment there may be a plurality of different antenna designs that may be used on an RFID tag such as a bar antenna a loop antenna a patch antenna and the like. Additionally in a multiple antenna configuration the individual antennas may be shaped to simulate other antenna configurations. For example more than one loop antenna may be applied in a circular configuration to simulate a patch antenna.

In an embodiment the antenna may have a plurality of antenna leads in the area of the RFID tag where the RF network nodes are attached to the RFID tag . The antenna leads may be of various designs that may provide for small gaps between the two antenna halves. The small gap between the antenna leads may allow the RF network node leads to bridge the gap and make contact to both halves of the antenna . The two antenna leads may branch into a plurality of leads the plurality of leads of the antenna may be in close proximity in the area on the RFID tag . This area on the RFID tag may be an area where the RF network nodes are applied to the RFID tag . In embodiments the gap between the leads may be small enough to allow the RF network node to bridge the antenna lead gap.

In an embodiment the antenna may be made of different materials such as metal conductive inks or the like. In embodiments the conductive ink antennas may be applied using ink jet silkscreen thermal printing or the like using for example a method that is similar to the previously described conductive ink application of the RF network nodes .

In an embodiment the ink jet application of antennas may use a computer device to apply a selected antenna pattern to the RFID tag using conductive ink. The ink jet process may be similar to printing using a standard ink jet printer. In an embodiment the selected antenna pattern may be stored in a database and at the time of the antenna printing the database may be searched to identify a suitable antenna for the RFID tag . In an embodiment the application of the antenna may include the application of the antenna leads or the antenna leads may be applied at a separate time.

In an embodiment the silkscreen application of the antenna may be similar to the silkscreen application of RF network nodes depicted in . There may be an antenna pattern provided in the mesh to apply the selected antenna. In an embodiment the antenna may be applied at the same time as the RF network nodes as part of the silkscreen printing process.

In an embodiment the thermal printing application of antennas may use a thermal printer and ink ribbon to apply an antenna to the RFID tag similar to the application thermal printing RF network nodes as described with reference to . In an embodiment the selected antenna pattern may be stored in a database and at the time of the antenna printing the database may be searched to identify a suitable antenna for the RFID tag . In an embodiment the application of the antenna may include the application of the antenna leads or the antenna leads may be applied at a separate time.

In an embodiment the antenna may be applied to the RFID tag substrate before the RF network nodes are applied. As the RF network nodes are applied to the antenna lead area of the RFID tag the RF network node antenna contacts may make a connection between the antenna leads for the two antenna halves thereby making a complete connection with the antenna . As previously described the RF network nodes may be precision placed onto the antenna leads or may be randomly placed on the antenna leads. In an embodiment if a conductive ink process is used to apply the RF network nodes to the antenna the antenna may be applied at the same time using conductive inks.

In another embodiment the RF network nodes may be randomly placed on the substrate before the antenna and antenna leads are applied to the substrate. The RF network nodes may be randomly applied to the substrate using any random application process including one of the conductive ink application processes. In an embodiment the antenna and antenna leads may then be applied over the RF network nodes the antenna and antenna leads may be applied at the same time or at separate times. In an embodiment the antenna leads may be applied using one of the conductive ink processes. In an embodiment the antenna leads may be applied using a non intelligent application of the antenna leads or an intelligent application of the antenna leads.

In an embodiment the non intelligent method of applying the antenna lead pattern may involve applying the antenna leads in a preset pattern regardless of the placement of the RF network nodes . By applying the antenna leads after the RF network nodes the RF network nodes may not have to be completely flat on the substrate for the antenna leads to make contact with the RF network nodes as the antenna leads are applied over the RF network nodes . For example the RF network nodes may be positioned at an angle to the substrate but may still make contact with the antenna lead if the antenna lead is applied over the RF network node using the methods described herein. Thus this method may yield a satisfactory percentage of RF network nodes in contact with the antenna leads. It may be understood that this process may connect a high percentage or some other percentage of the randomly applied RF network nodes to the antenna leads.

In an embodiment the RF network nodes may be applied to the RFID tag substrate first and the antenna lead may be applied over the RF network nodes using an intelligent application process. In an embodiment using the intelligent application of antenna leads a pattern recognition system may be used to recognize the position of the RF network nodes on the substrate and may apply a unique antenna lead pattern based on the placement of the RF network nodes . In an embodiment a software application may determine the antenna lead pattern that may contact a maximum number of the RF network nodes a required number of RF network nodes a minimum number of RF network nodes or the like. It may be understood that not all of the randomly applied RF network nodes may be connected to the antenna leads using this process. For example some RF network nodes may not be accessible to the determined antenna lead pattern.

In an embodiment the antenna pattern may be applied either before or after the RF network nodes are applied and may be matched to the type of container or object to which the RFID tag is attached including containers for substances such as liquid metal wood or the like. For example if the RFID tag is to be applied to a container for liquids the antenna that is applied may be selected from antennas that perform best when in close relation to a liquid. Similarly the applied antenna may be adapted for the surface of the container upon which it is printed or it may be adapted for the environment in which the container exists e.g. hot or cold conditions humidity levels proximity to corrosive gases or liquids and the like .

As an example the antenna pattern that may be printed onto the substrate may be selected from a set of antenna patterns that may be used for the different materials on which the RFID tag may be attached. In an embodiment as a RFID tag is being applied the proper antenna may be selected from the set of antenna patterns based on the object bearing the RFID tag . In an embodiment the antenna pattern that is applied may be different for each RFID tag . For example a first RFID tag that is applied to a water bottle may receive an antenna that is suited for a water application while the next RFID tag that is applied on a metal container may receive an antenna that is suited for the metal application. In an embodiment the antenna pattern that may be printed on an RFID tag may be any antenna pattern chosen from the available antenna pattern set.

In an embodiment the set of antenna patterns may be a stored set of antenna patterns in a database that may be applied by a conductive ink process may be preprinted on the thermal ink ribbon to be selected at the time of printing may be a silkscreen pattern selected at the time of printing or the like.

In an embodiment using a conductive ink antenna application method the antenna type may be selected and printed when it is determined which object to which the RFID tag will be attached. For example on a thermal ink printer the user may use a computer device to indicate the RFID tag will be applied to a certain object. As part of the RFID tag printing process the computer device may search a database of antenna patterns for a suitable antenna to be applied to the object. Once the antenna is selected from the database the printer may print the selected antenna pattern on the RFID tag . In this manner a suitable antenna for use with the object may be printed on the RFID tag based on the indicated object.

The RFID tag may interface with the reader and include a plurality of functions as shown in . The reader sometimes referred to as a scanner or interrogator may include a radio frequency transmitter and receiver that may both read and write information to the RFID tag . The reader may come in a plurality of configurations including fixed portable embedded smart or the like for a plurality of functionality and applications. For example a fixed reader may allow for automatic data capture from a specific location while a portable reader may enable verification functionality. In embodiments the right combination of portable readers and fixed readers may be important in maintaining the greatest visibility of a RFID tagged item throughout a supply chain. Another example may be a smart reader where the reader may have functionality that allows the reader to process and store information associated with the RFID tag . Functionality included in a reader may include a network interface a processor a memory a firmware a control facility a transmitter and receiver facility a reader antenna or the like.

In embodiments the reader may include the control facility the transmitter and receiver facility and the reader antenna as part of its core functionality. For example the control facility may provide for the control and flow of data to and from the transmitter and receiver facility which may modulate and demodulate data through the reader antenna . The reader antenna may in turn provide for the RF communications interface to the RFID tags antenna s . In embodiments these three core functional blocks may be an integral part of the reader configuration providing its basic functionality. This basic functionality may include the emitting of an RF carrier signal that may activate the RFID tag enabling the RFID tag to exchange data with the reader .

In embodiments when a RFID tag passes through a region where the reader is actively transmitting an activating RF carrier wave the RFID tag may detect the reader s activation signal and power up. Communications between the reader and the RFID tag may now commence. The reader may transmit commands to the RFID tag that may initiate a return of information. The information transmitted from the RFID tag may be decoded and passed to the processor . The processor may perform a plurality of processing steps on the returned RFID tag data including filtering operations to reduce the numerous and often redundant reads of the same RFID tag to a smaller and more useful data set. In embodiments the protocols for exchanging of information between the RFID tag and the reader may be governed by international standards national standards private standards proprietary standards or the like.

In embodiments the reader may provide for an interface to the network by processing information through the computer server . The data collected from the RFID tag may be transferred to the network resource such as the mass data storage the application servers the markets or the like. The network resources may provide for market specific applications processing of data collected from a plurality of RFID tags and or from a plurality of locations. For instance the reader may collect data from the RFID tags as the RFID tag enters the reader s proximity. As an example the market application may be associated with the tracking of inventory in a supply chain. The reader may collect data as the product nears the reader and may transfer the data to the network through the reader s network interface and the computer server . The application server may then transfer the data into the mass data storage and make the data available for use to the appropriate market . In embodiments the ability of markets to access data collected from the plurality of RFID tags through the plurality of readers may be a powerful market tool in the collection and management of information associated with the RFID tagged items.

In embodiments the reader may provide for data processing or storage as an embedded function of the reader . This functionality may provide for an intelligent reader or smart reader capable of providing data processing functions that may be independent or in addition to the network resources. Functional blocks that may be associated with these additional capabilities may include the processor the memory the firmware or the like. The processor may be a central processor a digital signal processor a network processor or the like. The memory and the firmware may be RAM DRAM ROM PROM EEPROM Flash or any other memory technology known to the art. In embodiments the reader embedded processing and storage may enable data processing capabilities that distribute or localize processing that would otherwise be performed by the network resources. This may increase the speed and accessibility of the RFID tag data. Additionally the reader embedded processing and storage may enable data processing capabilities that may not be possible with the network resources such as real time processing of data for immediate local use closed loop processing in association with the RFID tag processing capabilities the RFID tag integrated mesh network data distribution and transfer or the like. In embodiments intelligent capabilities of the reader may be associated with the distributed and or shared processing and memory storage capabilities of the multiple RF network node RFID tag .

In embodiments information stored in the reader s memory may be for a plurality of uses. Examples may include information transmitted from the RFID tag and stored for future processing either within the reader or by the network resources information transferred into the memory from the network resources and used by the reader s processor information transferred into the memory from the network resources and subsequently transferred to one or more of the RFID tags or the like. In embodiments the combination of the reader processor and the memory may enable a plurality of processing capabilities that may be utilized in conjunction with the increased multiple RF network node functionality. For example the smart reader local to the number of multi RF network node tags may provide for a distributed monitoring and detection network. In this example the RFID tags may utilize their extended processing capabilities to read convert and compare the sensor A data interfaced to the RFID tag . The RFID tags may periodically provide the sensor A processed data to the reader upon request. The reader may utilize an embedded stored or downloaded processor capability to monitor collected sensor A data. This may be based on parameter limits set by the network resources such as the market application. In this way the market application may have many such reader monitoring sites but may only receive feedback from the reader when parameter limits have been exceeded thus decreasing the complexity of the market data collection system.

In embodiments the firmware stored in the reader may contain fundamental operability routines and data for the reader such as communication protocols for the network interface control algorithms for the control of the transmitter and receiver the processor initialization routines or the like. The firmware may be upgradeable to help ensure compatibility with future standards and to changes in the reader s market applications. In embodiments changes to the reader s firmware may be associated with the functionality and the market applications embedded in the RFID tags .

In embodiments the processing capabilities of the reader and the processing capabilities of the RFID tag s RF network nodes may enable system functionality beyond typical passive RFID devices. For example the extended functionality of the system may enable the RFID tag to have an extended contact with the reader sometimes referred to as a session. Another example is the ability for the system to support encryption. Standard cryptographic techniques may require more resources than are available with typical RFID devices. In embodiments the increased functionality of the RFID tag may better enable the use of cryptographic techniques.

In embodiments cryptography implemented between the reader and the RFID tag may prevent RFID tag cloning a form of security breach associated with unauthorized reading and reuse of the RFID tag commands. Some of the RFID tags may use a form of rolling code scheme wherein the RFID tag identifier information may change after each scan from the reader thus reducing the vulnerability of the RFID tag to previously stolen responses. More sophisticated devices may engage in challenge response protocols where the RFID tag may interact with the reader . In these protocols secret RFID tag information may be sent over a secure communication channel between the RFID tag and the reader where the reader issues a challenge to the RFID tag . The RFID tag may respond with a result computed using a cryptographic circuit keyed with some secret value. Such protocols may be based on symmetric or public key cryptography as described herein. Still other cryptographic protocols may protect privacy against unauthorized readers . One major challenge in securing the RFID tags may be the shortage of computational resources within the typical RFID device. In embodiments the RFID systems described herein may provide greater resources so that standard cryptographic techniques may be more easily implemented.

In embodiments the reader may be operating in proximity to a plurality of RFID tags and within range of other readers . In such circumstances anti collision techniques may be employed. Anti collision algorithms may permit the simultaneous reading of large numbers of RFID tagged objects while ensuring that each of the RFID tags is read only once. The chance of interference of the two readers attempting to interrogate the same RFID tag may be small if the bandwidth of the reader s frequency is wide enough. The RFID tag collision in RFID systems may occur when multiple tags are energized by the reader simultaneously and reflect their respective signals back to the reader at the same time. This problem may be seen when a large volume of RFID tags are read together in the same RF field. The reader may be unable to differentiate between these signals with the resulting RFID tag collision causing contention within the reader . When the reader recognizes that RFID tag collision has taken place it may send a special signal sometimes referred to as a gap pulse. Upon receiving this signal each of the RFID tags may consult a random number generator to determine the interval to wait before sending its data. Since each of the RFID tags receives a unique number interval the RFID tags may send their data at different times.

The reader collision may also occur in RFID systems when the coverage area of one reader overlaps with that of another reader . This may cause signal interference with the RF fields of two or more readers overlapping and interfering. Having the readers programmed to read at fractionally different times may solve this.

Another technique that may be used to avoid collisions is frequency hopping. Frequency hopping is understood to be a technique useful for keeping two or more readers from interfering with each other while reading the RFID tags in the same area. For example UHF readers in the United States may operate between 902 and 928 MHz jumping randomly or in a predetermined sequence to frequencies in between 902 and 928 MHz.

In embodiments the reader may only be able to communicate with the RFID tag when the RFID tag is in range. A number of factors may affect the distance from the reader also known as read distance at which a RFID tag may be read. Examples may include the frequency used for identification antenna gain orientation and polarization of the reader antenna orientation and polarization of the RFID tag s antenna placement of the RFID tag on the object to be identified or the like. In embodiments the choice of modulation scheme used to communicate between the reader and the RFID tag may change the effective read distance or communication data rate. The modulation technique used in the demodulator may be any modulation technique known to the art such as ASK PSK FSK QAM or the like. In embodiments the systems and methods described herein may employ the ability to change the modulation technique of the reader and or the RFID tag as a way to increase read distance and or data rate. For instance the system may change the order of a QAM scheme to increase a reception parameter such as raising the QAM order to increase the bit rate when the RFID tag is close to the reader lowering the QAM order to improve bit error rates when the RFID tag is at an increased distance from the reader or the like. By accommodating various modulation schemes the system may be able to improve its data rate and or its read range.

In embodiments the reader may provide resources and capabilities that are associated with the increased resources and capabilities of the RFID systems described herein. For instance the reader s interface to the network may better enable the RFID tag to remain responsive to the market needs even after the RFID tag has been deployed in application the reader s processor the memory and the firmware may better enable the RFID tag to provide the market pre processing localized processing encryption or the like the reader s control transmitter and the receiver and the reader antenna may better enable the RFID tag to communicate at a plurality of different frequencies a plurality of simultaneous frequencies varying modulations to improve data rate and or read range or the like. In embodiments the reader may provide an extension of the RFID tag s resources and capabilities as well as providing an interface through which the RFID tag s resources and capabilities may be extended to the market applications.

Referring to a method and system for providing increased capability for an RFID tag using distributed architecture is shown. The increased capabilities may allow for different types of RFID memory e.g. secure memory extended memory encryption engines and the like to be provided within a single RF network node .

In an embodiment a wafer may be designed with a plurality of individual adjacent RF network nodes to be combined into one larger increased capacity RFID distributed RF network node . The increased capacity RFID distributed RF network node may permit individual RF network nodes to be integrated to allow the functionality of the individual RF network nodes to be combined. The increased capability RFID distributed RF network node may be singulated out of the wafer as a single combined RF network node . In an embodiment the wafer may include the same or a combination of different types of RF network nodes such as individual RF network nodes increased capacity RFID distributed RF network nodes and the like.

In an embodiment the increased capability RFID distributed architecture RF network node may incorporate at least two contacts that may be common to all or some of the individual RF network nodes . The common contacts may be additional antenna contacts power contacts data bus contacts connection to other RF network node contacts or the like. In an embodiment the increased capability RFID distributed RF network node may have internal data connections between the individual RF network nodes to allow communication of information to be passed between the individual RF network nodes . The information may be memory data commands and the like.

In an embodiment the individual RF network nodes within the increased capability RFID distributed RF network node may continue to function as individual RF network nodes with individual functionalities and may store individual data commands information or the like. In this case the multiple individual RF network nodes within the increased capacity RFID distributed RF network node may provide data and information redundancy that may act the same as a plurality of individual RF network nodes .

In an embodiment the individual RF network nodes may be coordinated within the increased capacity RFID distributed RF network node with one individual RF network node acting as a master RF network node to coordinate the functionality of the other individual RF network nodes as described herein.

In an embodiment one or more RF network nodes may be coordinated to contain data that may include a secure method for reading and writing the data. Depending on the application the combination of different RF network nodes public or secure may vary to provide the required memory capability for a particular application. In an embodiment a single increased capacity RFID distributed RF network node may contain both public and secure data memory locations. In an embodiment the public information may include the item name the amount of the item the weight of the item and the like. In an embodiment the secure information may include the price of the item the owner information the destination and the like. In an embodiment the secure information may require a particular reader that may decrypt the secure information.

In an embodiment the increased capacity RFID distributed RF network node may provide additional encryption features to the standard functionality. For example the different memory locations may be associated to an encryption integrated circuit within the same distributed architecture. A data read write may first pass through the encryption function before performing the read write of the RFID tag data. In an embodiment some public access memory may not be encrypted while other security memory may be encrypted.

An additional benefit to the increased capacity RFID distributed RF network node configuration may be an increased predictability of placement on an antenna lead. The increase size of the increased capacity RFID distributed RF network node may provide for the RF network node more predictably to be flat to the substrate. The increased length may also allow for more predictability of the RF network node contacts connecting with the antenna leads.

Referring to three embodiments of RF network node communication methods between RF network nodes or other functional network nodes are shown. The RF network node may be able to provide a signal to an additional function network node using an additional lead two or more RF network nodes may be able to communicate in a serial means or two or more RF network nodes may be able to communicate using a parallel means . The added RF network node communication may provide additional functionality function sharing between RF network nodes memory combination or the like. The RF network nodes communication may provide for communication of commands from a master RF network node redundancy of functions or memory increased memory capability or the like.

In View A of an embodiment of a RF network node communicating with an antenna and an external additional function network node is shown.

The combined memory locations may be at least two RF network nodes coordinated to store information. In an embodiment there may be a plurality of combined memory locations within an RFID tag . In an embodiment the plurality of combined memory locations may contain different types of information e.g. public or secure redundant information information for more than one item or product e.g. more that one type of product on a pallet different aspects of information about an item or the like. For example an RFID tag may contain N combined memory locations each may be capable of storing information about N items on a single pallet. This may permit having N mixed items on a pallet and having just one RFID tag on the pallet to track the N items. In an embodiment a master RF network node may control each of the plurality of combined memory locations there may be a plurality of master RF network nodes in an RFID tag.

In an embodiment the at least two RF network nodes may be separated or may be in contact with each other. In an embodiment if the RF network nodes are in contact they may form a single larger RF network node the single larger RF network nodes may be able to communicate in a serial manner with each other to combine functions or memory capabilities.

In an embodiment if the RF network nodes are separated they may be randomly placed in a serial connection zone where the serial connection leads may be in close relation to each other. In an embodiment the randomly placed RF network nodes may make contact with the serial connection leads in a similar manner as making contact with antenna leads as described herein.

In an embodiment there may be a master RF network node as described herein which may provide commands for the other RF network nodes . In an embodiment each of the individual RF network nodes may contain communication logic to coordinating data reads and writes from the RFID tag the coordination may include time slot transmission for each RF network node memory combination function combination or the like.

In an embodiment there may be common connections between the RF network nodes . In an embodiment the common connections may be provide connections to the antenna leads power additional function network nodes or the like.

Referring to an embodiment of using the number of active RF network nodes match the antenna impedance is shown. Placing an unknown number of multiple RF network nodes on a known antenna or the placement of RF network nodes on an antenna with an unknown impedance an impedance mismatch may be created that may reduce the ability to energize the RF network nodes . In an embodiment the impedance of the combined RF network nodes may be adjusted to compensate for some of the antenna impedance mismatch.

In the application of the RF network nodes to the RFID tag the antenna or the surrounding environment may not be a constant and therefore the impedance may change with each situation. For example RF network nodes may be used with various antenna designs with various impedances. In another example an RFID tag may be placed on items such as liquids and metals that may change the impedance of the RFID tag antenna . In addition in multiple RF network node RFID tags the impedance of the combined RF network nodes may not be a constant depending on the number of active RF network nodes on the RFID tag .

Referring to View A of an antenna may have an impedance of Za . In an embodiment the antenna impedance may not be constant for each application of the RF network node . For example many different enterprises that may use different and unique antennas on the RFID tags may use the RF network nodes . The different antennas may present different impedance to the RF network nodes .

Additionally having more RF network nodes that are active on an RFID tag may affect the impedance created by the RF network nodes . In an embodiment with the random placement of RF network nodes on an RFID tag a variable number of RF network nodes may be active depending on the number of RF network nodes making contact with the antenna leads. For example a first tag may have N active RF network nodes while a second tag may have M active RF network nodes where N M . Each of these RFID tags may have different RF network node impedance but may be associated with the same type of antenna . The impedance of the RF network nodes may be the total impedance of all the active RF network nodes .

In order to properly energize the passive RF network nodes in the RFID tag the antenna impedance must be matched to the impedance of the RF network nodes on the RFID tag. Za Zc where Zc is the equivalent impedance of all the active RF network nodes .

Referring to View B of the RF network nodes on an RFID tag may have their impedance Zc matched to the antenna by adjusting the impedance of the RF network nodes impedance matching block . This may be accomplished by the use of a logic RF network node that may be able to send a control command to the impedance matching block . The command may be to adjust the impedance of the RF network nodes . The adjustment of the active RF network nodes may adjust the total impedance of the impedance matching block and therefore attempt to make an optimal impedance match with the antenna .

In an embodiment the impedance matching block may be a set of individual RF network nodes or may be a RF network node group connected by a serial parallel bus antenna bus or the like. In an embodiment the control command may be a number that relates to the number of switch elements to turn on or off in the impedance matching block . In an embodiment the control command may be a function command that is executed by the impedance matching block that may result in switch elements being turned on or off. In an embodiment the logic RF network node may make the determination of the number of switch elements to turn on or off in the impedance matching block . In an embodiment the logic RF network node may send more than one control command for the adjustment of the impedance matching block . For example there may be a control command sent after each read attempt by the RFID tag reader .

In an embodiment the RFID reader may have an algorithm to receive the RFID tag transmissions measure the strength of the response calculate a command function and resend the read signal with the command function. The command function may be a command to adjust the RFID tag impedance and resend the RFID tag data. The command function may be received by the logic RF network node the logic RF network node may determine the control command to be sent to the impedance matching block to turn switch elements on or off to match the impedance of the antenna . An improved impedance match may result in the improved strength RFID tag second return signal. In an embodiment the process of the RFID tag reader sending a read request and a function command to adjust the RFID tag impedance may be repeated until an acceptable RFID tag transmission strength is achieved.

Aspects of the systems and methods described herein may be used in many different environments where material parts products processes and the like may benefit from history traceability movement tracking identification data recording or other information recording information. One environment may be the aviation industry where information may be tracked for individual components assemblies systems or the like for quality safety traceability service tracking maintenance tracking counterfeit part prevention life cycle management identification or the like. While the aviation industry may presently collect and store information on hardcopy or internal data stores the hardcopy or data stores may not follow the component or system through the components life cycle making it difficult to verify the history of a component at the point of use. Additionally the life cycle of an aviation component may be twenty years or more under variable often harsh conditions. As a result the environment requires durable recording devices for maintenance of life cycle information. The life cycle information to be recorded may include date of production dates of maintenance in use dates amount of time in service number of flight cycles quality checks information of the enterprise providing the component or service and the like.

In an embodiment an aviation component may include a commercial component RFID tag that may be used for the recording and maintaining of information about the aviation component. Information may be related to safety component traceability service tracking maintenance quality counterfeit part prevention life cycle management part identification or the like.

In an embodiment safety information may be related to airworthiness checks at the component or system level recording of service bulletins maintaining the airworthiness document of the component aircraft security or the like. In an embodiment using commercial RFID tags each component may be safety checked before a flight at regular safety check intervals after a set number of flights after a service bulletin has been received or the like to verify the compliance of the component or set of components. The commercial RFID tag may contain the memory requirements to store all the safety information pertaining to the component for the life cycle of the component.

In an embodiment the set of commercial RFID tag on an aircraft may be used to verify the airworthiness of the aircraft before a flight. For example there may be an aircraft safety check prior to takeoff where all of the commercial RFID tags are read to verify the airworthiness of the entire aircraft system. This check may be performed at a certain location at the airport by ground personnel before leaving the loading gate by an automatic check as part of the pilots preflight check list or the like. In another embodiment while at one of the aircraft check locations the airworthiness of the aircraft may be read and verified by a person at a location remote from the aircraft such as by an airline enterprise quality center a control tower a central airworthiness control center or the like. The remote location may not be located at the airport but may be located at a distant facility that may monitor airworthiness of aircraft at one or more airports. In an embodiment the aircraft may not be cleared for takeoff until the airworthiness of the aircraft was verified. In an embodiment the verification may include a check for components beyond the permitted number of flight cycles proper airworthiness documentation properly functioning systems and the like.

In another embodiment commercial RFID tag at entry points to the aircraft may enhance aircraft security. In an embodiment the aircraft entry points such as aircraft doors cargo doors maintenance access doors or the like may have commercial RFID tag that may require verification that the person attempting to gain access is authorized to open the entry point. For example a cargo door used for loading passenger luggage may have a commercial RFID tag that may record the identification of the personnel accessing the cargo door. In an embodiment when the aircraft airworthiness check is performed the cargo door may transmit identification of all personnel that accessed the cargo door the aircraft airworthiness may not be cleared if the identification of all access personnel does not match a permissible personnel list. In another embodiment an aircraft access door may not unlock unless the personnel requesting access matches a list of permitted personnel stored on the commercial RFID tag .

In another embodiment commercial RFID tag associated with critical components may be constructed to survive catastrophic events such as an aircraft crash component catastrophic failure or the like. For these aviation components the commercial RFID tag may survive the catastrophic event and be able to transmit the last recorded information the information from the commercial RFID tag may be useful in the catastrophic event investigation. For example the commercial RFID tag may provide rapid on location information on the airworthiness of the various components the flight cycles maximum and minimum data points part identification maintenance history an the like. As another example a commercial RFID tag associated with a critical component may be able to sense an overwhelming overrun of system parameters such as would occur with a catastrophic component or system failure and may collect information from a plurality of other commercial RFID tag associated with critical components. This information may then be recorded and or transmitted to an offsite location so as to provide a snapshot of system wide component status at the moment of crucial component failure.

In an embodiment component traceability information may be related to the type of repairs to a component the repair history tracking of the component within an assembly of components when a component is retired from service or the like. During the life cycle of a component many actions such as repairs component upgrades reassemblies or the like may be performed on the component. The commercial RFID tag may record information once the action has been completed thereby providing a history of the actions performed on the component. The recorded information may provide for traceability of the actions back to a time an enterprise a repair an assembly or the like if there is a question of the components airworthiness. For example an airworthiness bulletin may be received and an enterprise may need to determine if components within the enterprise comply with the bulletin. All the enterprises commercial RFID tags may be read for information related to the bulletin to verify the airworthiness of the enterprise s components.

In an embodiment service tracking may be recorded on the commercial RFID tag to track the actual flight cycle information of a component such as the number of flight cycles of the components the latest flight cycle number of the component storing the last service of the component storing the next required service of the component or the like. Some aviation components may have requirements for inspections based on the number of flight on which the component has been used. In an embodiment the commercial RFID tag may be associated with a sensor to record flight parameters that may be indicative of a component flight such as air pressure temperature component stress e.g. landing forces or the like. Using the sensor the commercial RFID tag may automatically record the actual flight characteristics as applied to the component. For example a component may only be considered having a flight cycle if it experienced a certain stress load during the flight. If the certain stress load was exceeded the commercial RFID tag may record that the component has experienced a flight cycle. The number of flight cycles may be read during the next data reading from the component and may be compared to the flight cycle service requirements.

In an embodiment component maintenance may be recorded on the commercial RFID tag to track maintenance information about the component such as the type of repair the repair technician the repair dates the repair enterprise or the like. In an embodiment as the component has maintenance e.g. repair upgrade the maintenance information may be recorded to the commercial RFID tag to provide a maintenance history of the component. In an embodiment the maintenance history may be read from the commercial RFID tag any time during the components life cycle. For example there may be a question of the type of repair performed on a class of components and an enterprise may be able to query all of their commercial RFID tag to determine if any of the enterprise s components may have had this type of repair. This capability may provide the enterprise a rapid method of component verification to quickly resolve a question of component airworthiness.

In aviation maintenance repair and overhaul facilities aviation components and aviation assemblies may undergo a number of maintenance and repair cycles during the life cycle of the component or component assembly. The components may have defects that have developed during normal operation. These defects may be repaired or sub components of the aviation component may be replaced as part of the repair. The commercial RFID tag may be used to record the maintenance history of the aviation component during overhaul and repair of the aviation component.

During the life cycle of the aviation component the commercial RFID tag that is associated with the component may record the operational history of the component such as the number of flight cycles operating environment maintenance dates maintenance history and the like. The increased memory capability of the multi RF network node commercial RFID tag may allow for storing these various types of information in segmented memory e.g. set memory locations for each type of information redundant memory protected memory public memory and the like. The enhanced memory capabilities of the commercial RFID tag may allow for the continuous storing of the operational history of the component throughout the life cycle of the component.

A critical part of aviation component maintenance may be the determination of the cause of the operational defect to be repaired. There may be a number of quality protocols used to determine the cause of the defect such as a root cause analysis. Root cause analysis attempts to determine not just the immediate cause of the defect but the root manufacturing process or design characteristic that may have contributed to the development of the defect. Root cause analysis depends on reviewing past history of the component that may include the OEM manufacture operational parameters previous maintenance materials used to produce the component and the like. The commercial RFID tag may store these types of information in its enhanced memory and may be reviewed during the initial review of the component being repaired the information stored on the commercial RFID tag may be read and reviewed as part of the root cause analysis. The root cause determination may require the information from a number of components to be reviewed over time the operational history of components stored on the commercial RFID tag may be aggregated for an analysis of a plurality of the same components for development of trends that may contribute to component defects.

During the maintenance of the component information may be written to the commercial RFID tag to provide a maintenance history of the component. As the repair is performed the commercial RFID tag may record the mechanic performing the repair the repair process performed the date of the repair the identification of the quality assurance personnel materials used in the repair and the like. The repair information may be written to the commercial RFID tag for every repair sequence performed at the completion of the repair at the certification of the repair or the like to form the maintenance history of the repair. In an embodiment each time the component is repaired during its life cycle the repair information may be written to the commercial RFID tag .

During the repair of the component it may be determined to replace a part of the component replace a sub component retire the component and provide a replacement component or the like. The replacement of the sub components and parts of a component may be recorded on the commercial RFID tag as part of the maintenance history of the component. The recording of the replacement of the sub component within a component assembly may provide for configuration control of the component. For example repairing an assembly may require replacing a damaged heat shield by installing a new heat shield into the assembly. When the new heat shield is installed into the assemble the new configuration information may include the new heat shield part number serial number manufacture date or the like may be written to the commercial RFID tag of the assembly. The information stored to the commercial RFID tag may also include information about the damaged heat shield such as the part number serial number date of manufacture date of removal from the assembly and the like.

In an embodiment the maintenance history of the component may be available to the airline enterprise field maintenance personnel FAA inspectors or the like by reading the commercial RFID tag maintenance information with a reader or portable reader. The maintenance history may be read and verified by a maintenance enterprise that is responsible for assembling the repaired component into an aircraft. The maintenance personnel may be able to read the commercial RFID tag to verify the repair performed the mechanic performing the repair final FAA certification of the repair or the like. The reading of the information on the commercial RFID tag may also be stored into the configuration information for the entire aircraft to provide configuration control for the aircraft. The maintenance personnel may be able to verify that the component should be assembled into the aircraft by verifying that the part number of the component is part of the aircraft configuration. This check may prevent a wrong component from being assembled into an aircraft.

The commercial RFID tag may also be used to store Air Transport Association ATA Spec 2000 standards information. The ATA Spec 2000 is a comprehensive set of e business specifications products and services that are used to streamline the aircraft component supply chain. Information related to component maintenance component history component ordering and the like may be written to and read from the commercial RFID tag using the ATA Spec 2000 standard. The ATA Speck 2000 information may be stored in XML format to allow rapid transmission of information over a network including the Internet. Information read from the commercial RFID tag may be transmitted to a network for increased speed in ordering replacement components requesting a repair of a component aggregation of a components operational history and the like. In an embodiment the XML formatted ATA Spec 2000 information may be stored in the enhanced memory of the commercial RFID tag .

In embodiments the enhanced memory capabilities of the commercial RFID tag may be a point of use information source reduce maintenance cycle times improve configuration management improve component tracking increase asset value improve product integrity document abuse misuse document no fault found history and the like. Storing component history information with the component may provide readily accessible critical component information that may be read at any point of use e.g. at an aircraft . Maintenance cycle time and configuration control may be easily stored and maintained electronically with the component on the enhanced memory commercial RFID tag to allow verification of repairs and configuration control at the component and aircraft level. Component tracking may be greatly enhanced by permitting the commercial RFID tag to be read at a plurality of access points in the distribution system in storage in the aircraft or the like. Documenting the history of the component may prevent the misuse of components by providing information on the airworthiness of a component information if the component has a valid serial number verification if a component has been retired from service and the like. Additionally the documented history of a component including the flight cycle history may provide information to reduce the no fault found determinations when a component fault cannot be reproduced on the ground or away from the aircraft. Flight cycle history may provide the needed information to successfully complete a root cause analysis and therefore may allow for a repair that may not have been possible without the stored information on the commercial RFID tag .

In an embodiment component quality information may be recorded on the commercial RFID tag to track quality related information such as inspection dates flight cycle tracking component configuration material information supplier information or the like. This information may be used in the quality confirmation of a component used in defect root cause analysis verification of a proper assembly comparing the components actual life cycle information with industry and FAA requirements or the like. In an embodiment quality control personnel may be able to read the component quality information for an aircraft before a flight to verify that all of the components with the commercial RFID tag are airworthy. Additionally an aviation enterprise may be able rapidly to perform a quality check of all their aircraft in response to a supplier notification FAA request airworthiness bulletin or the like by reading all the commercial RFID tags within their aircraft.

In an embodiment the commercial RFID tag may be used in counterfeit part prevention by storing the component supplier information component identification component serial numbers or the like. Counterfeit parts may be produced by an enterprise that is not certified to produce airworthy components components produced from other components that have been retired from service e.g. scrapped or the like a counterfeit part may not be airworthy. In an embodiment an aviation enterprise may receive a component from a supplier. The component information may be read from the commercial RFID tag for verification that the part is airworthy and not counterfeit. For example the received component information may be verified against a component database to verify the components identification verify that the serial number is still an active serial number e.g. not retired view the history of the components life cycle or the like.

In an embodiment component life cycle management may be recorded on the commercial RFID tag to allow tracking of the component s life cycle. The life cycle management information may contain life cycle information from the original equipment manufacturer OEM to the current time period record past maintenance dates future maintenance dates particular flight information e.g. stress levels or the like. Life cycle management may be related to other aspects of the component such as safety maintenance quality or the like. In an embodiment an aviation enterprise may be able to rapidly determine the status of the life cycle of any or all components of an aircraft that has a commercial RFID tag . For example the aviation enterprise may periodically read all the commercial RFID tags on an aircraft to record the life cycle information for the entire aircraft. The aviation enterprise may use the life cycle information to manage the maintenance schedules of the aviation enterprise s aircraft fleet.

In an embodiment component identification may be recorded on the commercial RFID tag to include the OEM information repair enterprise information component number serial number component revision level or the like. This information may be applied as the component is produced revised repaired or the like to provide a traceable history of the manufacture of the component. The component identification may become the base information to allow the component to be tracked though out the component s operational life cycle.

In an embodiment the storing of information for the above capabilities may be implemented using different memory configurations such as public memory private memory encrypted memory read write memory write once read many memory read only memory or the like. For example the component identification may have information that should not be changed such as component number and serial number therefore the some or all of the component identification may be stored in write once read many memory. This would allow the OEM to write the component identification but not allow anyone else to change this information. In another example there may be enterprise only information that may be stored using encryption memory so only the enterprise may read the information. It may be understood by someone knowledgeable in the art that the memory of the commercial RFID tag may be configured based on the requirement of the commercial RFID tag .

Aspects of the systems and methods described herein may be used in many different markets where material parts products processes or the like may benefit from history traceability movement tracking identification data recording or other information recording and processing. Referring to a market example may be the industrial field where product information and history may be tracked through industrial RFID tags . Product information and history may be followed through the entire life cycle of the product from the receiving of raw materials to the shipment of finished goods for sale including factory process factory inventory warehouse systems factory transportation industrial quality control or the like. The use of industrial RFID tags as described herein may significantly increase the ability of an industrial facility to track the location and history of the final product as well as the components that are included as a part of the final product. Further through access to location and history information for the product and its components post sale attributes may be tracked such as product performance quality reliability return rate customer complaints or the like. An industrial facility may feed these post sale attributes back into the manufacturing process and product design to further improve the quality of the product and reduce post sale costs. The use of the systems and methods described herein may therefore contribute to the future quality of the produced product.

The factory process may benefit from the systems and methods disclosed herein in a number of ways including the identification tracking of components and sub assemblies included in the final production product the production history of the components and sub assemblies of the final production product such as the location of manufacture the date of manufacture the time of manufacture the personnel that participated in the manufacture of the components and sub assemblies or the like the transportation history of components and sub assemblies the tracking of the manufacturing process for the final production product such as where it is in the process the control of the manufacturing process for the final production product such as implementation of unique processing steps the history of the manufacturing process for the final production product such as the date of production the time sequence of each subassembly process step personnel involved in the production or the like the tracking of issues encountered during production of the product a history of all inspections performed on the product date of final packaging of the product or the like. In embodiments the factory process may be made more efficient and reliable due to the expanded capabilities of the systems and methods described herein.

In embodiments manufacturing control may be made more efficient through the use of the disclosed systems and methods. Manufacturing control includes factory processes that effect the production of a product being manufactured such as what color the product is to be selection of optional features for the product selection of optional processing steps for the product or the like. For example in an embodiment a product may have the option of being painted red green or blue. The product may have an attached industrial RFID tag . The product s industrial RFID tag may have been previously loaded with an identification number and data to indicate what color the product is to be painted. As the product is brought near the paint facility the reader may extract the identification number and color data and send that data to the painter. During the painting various paint parameters such as paint mix spray time temperature or the like may by be recorded by the paint facility. Upon completion of the painting step in the manufacturing process the paint parameters may be downloaded onto the industrial RFID tag through the reader . In this way the product that has been painted now may contain the paint parameters through its useful life. If the product was a car for example and the car showed premature rusting the industrial RFID tag may be accessed to help determine whether the painting during manufacturing may have contributed to the premature rusting. In embodiments the systems and methods described herein may be able to utilize RFID tag capabilities to not only control the manufacturing step such as painting but also to record the conditions of manufacture to be stored on the industrial RFID tag and to stay with the product through its operational life.

In an embodiment the product being manufactured may be a motherboard of a personal computer. The motherboard containing an industrial RFID tag may have options associated with it such as amount of memory type of processor clock speed or the like recorded in the memory of the industrial RFID tag . As the blank printed circuit board approaches the component placement facility the reader may access the industrial RFID tag for component information. The component placement facility may then choose the appropriate components and mount them on the motherboard. Further the component history for the parts placed on the motherboard such as part number date code lot code or the like may be recorded by the component placement facility. The component placement facility may write this component history to the industrial RFID tag attached to the motherboard. This information may stay with the motherboard through the remaining stages of manufacturing and on through its operational life.

In embodiments the industrial RFID tag may be read by a technician to aid in the diagnosis of problems associated with the motherboard either during test stages in manufacturing or during the operational life of the unit. In embodiments the industrial RFID tag attached to the motherboard may be able to communicate with an industrial RFID tag associated with the higher assembly personal computer. The industrial RFID tag associated with the personal computer may have access to an Internet interface which may be used to monitor recalls or other issues related to the components on the motherboard. Further this type of informational connection between the industrial RFID tag on the motherboard and the Internet may enable a technical support facility connected to the internet to extract information contained on the industrial RFID tag on the motherboard. In embodiments the industrial RFID tag may utilize the capabilities of the systems and methods described herein to aid in the control of manufacture as well as to record associated component and process history of the components to more efficiently diagnose future failures for issues associated with the components.

In embodiments the industrial RFID tag may be associated with the manufacturing of a material component that is formed from raw materials and integrated into a larger assembly. One such example of such a material component may be a steel bridge member that is formed from molten steel and integrated into a road bridge. In this instance the forging and forming facility that manufactures the bridge member may record the history information associated with the raw materials the conditions and environments experienced during forming post forming performance test results or the like. This information may be downloaded onto an industrial RFID tag that is mounted on the bridge member. This information may now be utilized in mechanical testing of the bridge member prior to shipment as well as placement information on the site of the bridge assembly. Further in embodiments the information stored in the bridge member s industrial RFID tag may be utilized during periodic bridge inspections along with environmental information that may be collected by industrial RFID tags associated with the entire bridge assembly.

In embodiments tracking and location of manufacturing parts may be made more efficient through the use of the systems and methods described herein. Each part may be associated with an industrial RFID tag either by direct mounting or through mounting to the part s packaging. The ability for a manufacturing facility to track and locate all of the parts within the facility may be advantageous to the efficiency of the manufacturing facility. For example one of the most fundamental steps in the assembly of a component may be the gathering of parts sometimes referred to as kitting required to complete the assembly procedure. If an assembly is begun without all parts accounted for the assembly may have to be halted breaking the flow and time efficiency of the production line. The systems and methods described herein may aid in the automated determination of whether a kit is complete or not and if not reporting shortages. With industrial RFID tags on all parts within the facility it may become easier to locate parts that are needed determine what assemblies have priority within the manufacturing flow and move those parts in order to maintain a smooth running assembly flow.

The systems and methods described herein may also better enable the aggregation of part histories. For instance industrial RFID tags associated with parts may contain history associated with those parts. As these parts are integrated into higher assemblies their histories may be requested through readers and transferred to an industrial RFID tag associated with the higher assembly. In this way the higher assembly s industrial RFID tag may contain the history information of all the parts that make it up. In embodiments the disclosed systems and methods may have expanded capabilities to better enable the tracking of information pertaining to an assembly s parts.

In embodiments the tracking and location scheme that starts with parts or raw materials may be extended up through the sub assembly and assembly stages that lead to the finished product. For instance an industrial RFID tag may be associated with each part with all its history and performance data written into the memory of its industrial RFID tag . As the parts are integrated into sub assemblies an industrial RFID tag may be attached and associated with each sub assembly. The sub assemblies may get an identification number to track and locate them allowing the facility to track and locate a particular sub assembly to be kitted for the next level of assembly integration. In addition the industrial RFID tag associated with the sub assembly may contain all the history data from the parts that constitute it. This may be accomplished through a facility associated with the reader reading the data from all parts and subsequently writing the data into the sub assembly s industrial RFID tag or having the sub assembly industrial RFID tag communicate directly with the part s industrial RFID tags . With industrial RFID tags associated with parts sub assemblies assemblies finished products and the like all components used in the manufacturing process may be tracked and located. In embodiments the ability to track and locate any part sub assembly or assembly in the manufacturing facility may improve the efficiency of the manufacturing facility.

The tracking and location of parts within the manufacturing facility may begin with parts being received at the manufacturing facility. Parts may be received with industrial RFID tags already attached or the industrial RFID tags may have to be attached when the part is received. Whether the industrial RFID tag is attached to the part itself or attached to its container the industrial RFID tag may allow for a simple and quick way to perform stocking and vending of inventory. For instance the stocking and vending facility may have an array of readers that covers the entire stockroom area including the receiving area and the vending or outgoing area. As parts with industrial RFID tags are received the stocking and vending facility logs the part in and tracks its location. Similarly when parts come in with no industrial RFID tag the part is tracked from the time an industrial RFID tag is attached. As parts are placed into stock their industrial RFID tag may be always accessible and the part s location and history data may be always available. As parts are vended out of stores the stocking and vending facility may log the part out of stores and onto the manufacturing floor. In this way the stocking and vending facility may have a continuous log of what is received stored and vended within inventory. In addition because parts may come with an industrial RFID tag containing history data the stocking and vending facility may have access to history information for parts in inventory. Further the stocking and vending facility may utilize these part histories to create a database that may enable the manufacturing facility immediate access to real time inventory. In embodiments the systems and methods described herein may better enable real time inventory control and may provide easy access to a real time part history database.

Warehouse systems may benefit from the systems and methods described herein in ways similar to those described above for monitoring factory inventory such as the tracking and location of all products in the warehouse system a real time database of stock automated addition of stock at receiving automated material stocking and return systems automated tracking of vending systems at departure history information on all stock in the warehouse system or the like. Material location and tracking systems may be applied at all levels of warehouse packaging such as container level pallet level case level product level or the like. In embodiments the systems and methods described herein may enable more efficient stock management within the warehouse system .

In addition warehouse stock as well as inventory stock may have time expiration codes or environmental limits that require monitoring. Typically this monitoring may have been done with a database system. But logging in and out all the information associated with stock especially with the warehouse system where there turnover of stock may be high can be time consuming and prone to human error. The systems and methods described herein provide extended memory and functionality that may support an automated way to have stock self report warnings due to such variables as time expiration environmental limits handling limits or the like. Through such extended memory these variables may be stored in the industrial RFID tag s memory. Through such extended functionality these variables may be actively compared to external references such as current time provided by the reader signal or sensor A data such as temperature humidity shock or the like. Periodic interrogations by warehouse system readers may provide the power for the industrial RFID tag to assess and report on any conditions that may warrant caution or warning.

As an example the warehouse system may be storing a perishable food product such as milk. The milk may have perishable limits that cannot be exceeded without loss of the product such as a sell buy date code minimum and maximum temperature extremes maximum shock to the shipping container or the like. This information along with its identification number may be stored in the milk s industrial RFID tag and may be transferred to the warehouse system database when the milk is received. The milk may then be stored in the warehouse system for some time duration before being shipped out. The warehouse system may be a company separate from the company that produced packaged and transported the milk to the warehouse system site. It is essential for a warehouse system that handles perishables to prevent the product from expiring and if it does expire to identify the point in the supply chain where the product experienced the out of limit parameter. Therefore the warehouse system may read these parameters from the product s industrial RFID tag upon receiving the product for example to determine whether the milk has expired prior to receiving. Once the milk is determined to be good and not to have exceeded any product parameters the milk may be stored. During storage the warehouse system may monitor the product s parameter limits within its database. But the database may not be monitoring the product itself and parameters such as temperature and shock may only be accurately monitored at the product location. For example the database may not be able to detect whether the milk s shipping container was dropped or whether local temperature variations within the warehouse system caused temperature parameters to be exceeded. Monitoring parameters at the product s location may be the most accurate way to ensure that product parameters are not exceeded.

In an embodiment the systems and methods described herein may provide for monitoring product parameters at the location of the product and reporting status and warnings to the warehouse system . For example the bottle of milk with an industrial RFID tag attached may be continuously monitored for time temperature shock or the like. Readers distributed throughout the warehouse system may periodically interrogate the industrial RFID tags within the warehouse system . Sensors may be continuously monitoring parameters and when the industrial RFID tag is interrogated the industrial RFID tag may then read sensor A data and compare their values to parameter limits. Sensors may be independently powered and so the industrial RFID tag may be reading a data history since the sensor s last access by the industrial RFID tag . If conditions were near or in excess to parameter limits the industrial RFID tag may report a warning to the warehouse system to indicate a possible problem. The systems and methods described herein may take advantage of extended memory and or functionality to perform this self monitoring and self reporting. In embodiments the systems and methods described herein may help reduce the loss of product during warehousing locate where the product experienced the out of limit condition track the conditions under which the product was warehoused or the like.

In embodiments the warehouse system may have need of navigation system to locate products for shipment out of the warehouse system . The systems and methods described herein may provide a way for locating product within the warehouse system . For example at times warehouses or other industry facilities may utilize a forklift for factory transportation to help facilitate the storage and retrieval of products. In embodiments it may be useful for the forklift to have a navigation system that leads the forklift operator to the location of the desired product. The initial directions provided by the navigation system may be provided though the network of readers throughout the warehouse system . The forklift may also have its own reader . As the forklift reader comes into range with the industrial RFID tag of the product the forklift may be directed to the exact location of the product possibly even employing triangulation methods with multiple readers within the warehouse system . When the forklift has successfully retrieved the product the forklift navigation system may list all products that are currently being transported by the forklift. This information may then be relayed to the warehouse system database to transport facilities for departure to receiving facilities to indicate space available or the like. A forklift embodying certain systems and methods described herein may be automated that is not requiring a human operator. Where as the forklift has been used as an example of how the systems and methods described herein may be used in product location and transport other examples such as handheld readers wand readers winch readers or the like may also be utilized. In embodiments the systems and methods described herein may provide a more efficient way to locate products within the warehouse system .

Other industrial transportation facilities may include industrial elevator systems industrial escalator systems industrial conveyor systems cargo terminal systems or the like. In transporting products primary concerns may include products being misplaced or mishandled which may cause loss of time and or loss of product. The systems and methods described herein may allow a product associated with an industrial RFID tag to be located within a network of reader facilities reporting not only its identification but its handling and environmental history. For example a series of ten part kits may be sent down a conveyor system to an assembly area but only nine kits are counted at the end of the conveyor system. Typically this would initiate a search for the missing kit at the sending end along the conveyor and at the receiving end of the conveyor system. This would typically involve personnel and reduce the efficiency of the assembly facility. With the systems and methods described herein and in conjunction with a portable reader or network of readers the part kit may be quickly located. In addition the handling and environmental history for the parts kit may be read to determine if any degradation to components within the kit may have occurred.

The transportation systems outside the warehouse facility may benefit from the parameter monitoring capabilities using the systems and methods described herein in similar ways to warehouse systems such as having readers on transport facilities that are able to determine the state of the product when received monitor product parameter limits during transport locate products with portable or mobile reader navigation systems or the like. For example in loading a product onto a truck for transportation to a distribution site the systems and methods described herein may be utilized to determine whether product parameter limits have been exceeded prior to loading onto the truck. With all product loaded onto the truck a reader on the truck may monitor products with industrial RFID tags and alert the driver if parameter limits are being approached or exceeded. When the truck reaches a distribution point and some product is to be off loaded hand held readers possibly in conjunction with the truck s reader may be utilized to locate specific products. Receiving personnel may access product industrial RFID tag memory to transfer the status and history of the products being off loaded into a local database. For instance if a product has been dropped or mishandled sensor A data may indicate this when read from the memory of the industrial RFID tag . In embodiments the systems and methods described herein may increase the ability to monitor product handling and environment during transportation.

Global factory product transportation may involve containerization a system of inter modal cargo transport using standard ISO containers also known as isotainers that can be loaded and sealed intact onto container ships railroad cars planes and trucks. Typically the cargo is loaded into containers mounted on rail or truck and transported to a container terminal for sea or air transport. The contents of the containers are not typically removed from the containers as they are shifted between truck rail ship and air in transit from source to destination. Given the potentially long durations for global shipment of factory products via containerization and the great variety of environmental conditions that the products may experience it may be paramount to maintain a history including time mode of transport owner of transport environmental conditions during transport shock environments during transport or the like. The capabilities of the systems and methods described herein may be ideal for maintaining reliable long term monitoring of the product s conditions while in transport. A reader network on the various transportation modes may be utilized for monitoring and or activation of the product s industrial RFID tag .

Factory transportation through the system of containerization may provide a varied shock environment to the container and associated cargo. For example moving containers from one mode of transport to another such as from truck to train train to dock dock to ship or the like may impart shock to the cargo. Transporting a fragile product such as glass may cause breakage as a result of handling. The transport agency may specify maximum instantaneous accelerations due to shock that are to be taken as acceptable in shipment. In embodiments these values along with other specified environmental conditions for transport may be stored in the memory of the industrial RFID tag associated with the product. The industrial RFID tag may monitor its associated sensors and compare sensor A values to the stored specified maximums. If the measured values exceed the specified maximums the industrial RFID tag may transmit a status or warning to resident readers as well as to a running log to be read by the cargo s eventual recipient. In this way it can be determined quantitatively whether any breakage was due to poor packaging or to excessive shock during transport. Industrial RFID tags may also communicate with local readers or with other industrial RFID tags to attempt to report or cross correlate its readings with the readings of other industrial RFID tags . In embodiments the industrial RFID tag reporting the anomalous reading may read and record data provided from the network of readers or from other local industrial RFID tags .

A number of other parameters may be specified by the transport agency where certain limits are not to be exceeded. For example in the transport of perishable goods or livestock certain temperature maxima or minima must not be exceeded. Industrial RFID tags incorporated in the packaging or containers for perishable goods or incorporated in the pens or shipping crates for livestock may indicate exposure temperatures. Such tags may also be attached to individual animals for livestock shipments. It can be determined by reading the data on the industrial RFID tags whether temperature tolerances have been exceeded during the shipment to the potential detriment of the goods or livestock. In addition to large scale or bulk shipments industrial RFID tags may be affixed to or imbedded into unique items of livestock such as performance animals e.g. circus animals rodeo animals and the like laboratory animals or pets. Because such specialized shipments may have detailed requirements for their transportation and narrow tolerance ranges industrial RFID tags may be used to collect data regarding transportation conditions to determine whether for example contractually determined transportation requirements have been met.

In addition to industrial RFID tags on the products or their packaging there may be industrial RFID tags on the shipping container itself providing a unique identification number for each container. Additionally the container s industrial RFID tag may collect the information resident on product level industrial RFID tags internal to the container. Since the container s industrial RFID tags may be external and the container may be metallic there may be an interface between the industrial RFID tags on products internal to the container and the industrial RFID tag for the container mounted on the container. In this way external readers may more easily read the contents of the container. In embodiments the container s industrial RFID tag may be mounted on the external surface of the container and as such may be more exposed to the outside elements and to physical contact with container handling equipment and other containers. As a result damage to the industrial RFID tag may be more likely and may require greater reliability than is typical for RFID tags. The systems and methods described herein may have significant redundancy capabilities due to the multiple RF network node configuration of the tag . In embodiments the systems and methods described herein may provide significantly greater redundancy than typical RFID tags and may be an advantageous solution to the requirements of the container s industrial RFID tag .

In industrial applications quality control is involved in ensuring products are produced to meet or exceed customer requirements. The systems and methods described herein may enable the tracking and logging of quality control history for a product. This history may begin at the parts level including information such as lot date part testing at source or the like. The quality testing results and information for parts may then be aggregated into the sub assembly level and then to the assembly and finished product level. In this way information recorded on the industrial RFID tags of a lower assembly may be collected and transferred to the industrial RFID tag of a higher assembly which may allow all information associated with a finished product to build as an integral part of the assembled product. In embodiments the systems and methods described herein may eliminate the need for an external file to keep track of quality control results and logs. This may allow the quality control information to be networked via readers and or accessed by hand held readers by quality control personnel. In embodiments the systems and methods described herein may lead to more efficient quality management and greater reliability in quality control record keeping.

Aspects of the systems and methods described herein may be used in many different markets where material parts products processes and the like may benefit from history tacking movement tracking identification data recording or other recording information. Referring to a market example may be military applications where information may be for tracking munitions inventory tracking food inventory food expiration dates tracking personnel tracking battle movements supply material tracking automatic identification maintenance casualty tracking and the like. The military and the Department of Defense DoD in general is a large and complex organization that has requirements to track large supply chains provide security for locations and personnel track movements of personnel and vehicles within a military facility and the like.

The military may benefit from the use of automatic tracking systems that may be provided by the systems and methods disclosed herein. The multi RF network node RFID tag may provide increased memory for additional storage of information related to the type of product to which the RFID tag is attached information related to the movement of the product information related to the personnel in possession of the product and the like. The increased memory may be implemented as redundant memory to provide a more robust RFID tag for situations where the product may be in a harsh environment. The RFID tag as described herein may also provide functional redundancy where the RFID tag may be able to incur some damage and continue to provide normal functions.

Additionally the RFID tag s capability of multiple frequencies and multiple antennas may allow the military to transmit and receive information from the RFID tag using a number of different frequencies. Certain parts of the RFID tag memory may only be accessed by certain frequencies and or encryptions. These capabilities may provide secure storage of information for many different products for which the military has responsibility.

Referring to the military RFID tag may be applicable to munitions tracking food personnel tracking battle movement material tracking automatic identification vehicle maintenance and casualty tracking . It should be understood by someone knowledgeable in the art that the military RFID tag may have other applications in the military and the listed applications is not intended to be limiting.

As may be readily understood the military has a significant amount of munitions to store transport track disperse and the like ranging from small caliper to larger munitions. The military may be interested in tracking the amount of munitions available the type of munitions available the distribution of the munitions the munitions available to a unit and the like. The military RFID tag may be attached to the munitions may be attached to the munitions container or the like. In an embodiment the increased memory of the military RFID tag of the systems and methods described herein may allow for increased amounts of information to be stored about the munitions such as the type of munitions the amount of munitions within the storage container the age of the munitions the location of the munitions part numbers serial numbers and the like. Depending on the security requirements some or all of the information may be stored with a password with encryption with a combination of password and encryption or the like.

Using the information stored on the military RFID tag the military warehouses and stores could utilize smart shelf inventory for munitions. Using the military RFID tag associated to the munitions and at least one reader within a warehouse the munitions may be inventoried rapidly. The read or series of reads may be able to determine the amount of all the munitions within the warehouse the amount of certain munitions within a warehouse the age of the munitions and the like. This type of smart shelf inventory may be used in large base warehouses and smaller field munitions stores to allow for rapid munitions determination. With this RFID tag technology the inventory of munitions in many widely separated warehouses may be determined within a short period of time. For example an entire Command may inventory the munitions in a plurality of munitions warehouses by reading the military RFID tags associated with the munitions. The military RFID tag readers may be associated with a network as described herein to allow a remote site to initiate a read of information and receive information for the munitions inventory. The munitions information may then be aggregated for the Command to provide the overall munitions readiness of the Command. The aggregation of munitions information may allow the Command to determine the number and type of munitions that are stored in all of the units within the Command.

The military RFID tag may also be used to track the movement of munitions into and out of the munitions warehouse. For example as new munitions are stored in the warehouse the military RFID tag may be read and added to the inventory of the warehouse. Similarly when munitions are removed from the warehouse the munitions information may be removed from the warehouse. Additionally the personnel removing the munitions may also have a military RFID tag that may identify the personnel. As the munitions are checked out of the warehouse the personnel identification may also be read to create a history record of the munitions movements and the personnel that moved the munitions. Furthermore when certain munitions are added to the inventory of another warehouse e.g. a field munitions storage the munitions military RFID tag may be read and the munitions information added to the other warehouse.

During the movements of the munitions from one warehouse to another the munitions information may be read by a reader and stored to the network allowing for aggregation searching sorting or the like of the munitions information from remote locations. Additionally as the reader reads the movement information the movement information may be stored onto the munitions military RFID tag . Therefore the munitions military RFID tag may contain the entire distribution history that may be read by a reader within a warehouse a portable reader or the like.

Using the smart self inventory within the warehouse and the tracking of munitions being added and removed from the warehouse automatic munitions ordering may be implemented based on preset inventory level requirements. For example when munitions are removed from a central warehouse and dispersed to smaller field warehouses the automatic inventory levels determined by the military RFID tag information may initiate an order for replacement munitions.

As an additional aspect of the munitions inventory the munitions military RFID tag may be read as it is moved within the munitions distribution system. There may be checkpoints along the distribution system such as at airports at rail stations at trucking stations on loading docks on transports e.g. aircraft trains trucks and the like. In this manner the munitions may be tracked from the starting point of the distribution system until it is received at the final destination. Using readers that are associated with the network a remote site may be able track the munitions throughout the entire distribution system. In an embodiment the remote site may be provided with an alert when the munitions do not move within the distribution system in a predictable manner.

The DoD may require a significant amount of food to supply all the military personnel within its responsibility. The military food similar to retail or commercial food may require inventory tracking distribution tracking shelf life determination and the like. Military RFID tags of the systems and methods described herein may be used to track inventories distribution freshness and the like by storing information about the product to which it is associated. The increased memory in a multi RF network node military RFID tag may allow for storing information about the type of food the amount of food the original supplier of the food the time on the shelf the environment in which the food has been stored and the like. This information may be stored in public memory private memory encrypted memory or the like. The increased memory of the military RFID tag of the systems and methods described herein may allow for redundant memory for foods that may be stored in harsh environments such as hot dry environments wet environments cold environments and the like. The redundant memory may allow for damage to the military RFID tag that still provide memory storage and functionality.

Using the information stored on the military RFID tag the military warehouses and stores could utilize smart shelf inventory for food. Using the military RFID tag associated to the food and at least one reader within a warehouse the food may be inventoried rapidly. The read or series of reads may be able to determine the amount of all the food within the warehouse the amount of certain food within a warehouse the age of the food expiration dates of the food and the like. This type of smart shelf inventory may be used in large base warehouses and smaller field stores to allow for rapid food supply determination. With this RFID tag technology the inventory of food in many widely separated warehouses may be determined within a short period of time. For example an entire Command may inventory the food in a plurality of food warehouses by reading the military RFID tags associated with the food. The military RFID tag readers may be associated with a network as described herein to allow a remote site to initiate a read of information and receive information for the food inventory. The munitions information may then be aggregated for the Command to provide the overall food readiness of the Command. The aggregation of food information may allow the Command to determine the amount and type of food that are stored in all of the units within the Command.

The military RFID tag may also be used to track the movement of food into and out of the food warehouse. For example as new food is stored in the warehouse the military RFID tag may be read and added to the inventory of the warehouse. Similarly when food is removed from the warehouse the food information may be removed from the warehouse. Additionally the personnel removing the food may also have a military RFID tag that may identify the personnel. As the food is checked out of the warehouse the personnel identification may also be read to create a history record of the food movements and the personnel that moved the food. Furthermore when the food is added to the inventory of another warehouse e.g. a field food storage the food military RFID tag may be read and the food information added to the other warehouse.

During the movements of the food from one warehouse to another the food information may be read by a reader and stored to the network allowing for aggregation searching sorting or the like of the food information from remote locations. Additionally as the reader reads the movement information the movement information may be stored onto the food military RFID tag . Therefore the food military RFID tag may contain the entire distribution history that may be read by a reader within a warehouse a portable reader or the like.

Using the smart self inventory within the warehouse and the tracking of food being added and removed from the warehouse automatic food ordering may be implemented based on preset inventory level requirements. For example when food is removed from a central warehouse and dispersed to smaller field warehouses the automatic inventory levels determined by the military RFID tag information may initiate an order for replacement food.

As an additional aspect of the food inventory the food military RFID tag may be read as it is moved within the food distribution system. There may be checkpoints along the distribution system such as at airports at rail stations at trucking stations on loading docks on transports e.g. aircraft trains trucks and the like. In this manner the food may be tracked from the starting point of the distribution system until it is received at the final destination. Using readers that are associated with the network a remote site may be able track the food throughout the entire distribution system. In an embodiment the remote site may be provided with an alert when the food does not move within the distribution system in a predictable manner.

In another aspect of inventory and movement of food associated with military RFID tags may be the availability of food within the DoD. For example by reading the military RFID tag information within food warehouses the DoD may be able to aggregate a snap shot of food information within the warehouse and distribution system. The snap shot may provide the ability to determine the amount and type of food that may be stored in which warehouses and or within the distribution system. For example if one branch of the DoD requires a certain type of meals ready to eat MRE the DoD may be able to determine the supply and location of the required MRE and determine if the MRE can be distributed to the requiring branch or if additional MREs need to be ordered.

As described herein the food military RFID tag may be associated with at least one sensor A the sensor A may measure temperature humidity acceleration and the like and provide the measured information to the military RFID tag . In an embodiment during a read of the military RFID tag the military RFID tag may read the information from the sensor A. The sensor A information may be stored on the military RFID tag transmitted to the reader stored on the military RFID tag and transmitted to the reader or the like. The sensor information may provide a storage history of the food and may be used to indicate the shelf life of the food.

For example perishable foods such as fruits and vegetables may have a limited shelf life if stored at elevated temperatures. The military RFID tag associated with the food may have a temperature sensor A that may provide a temperature history of the food that may be used to determine the freshness of the food. In this manner the shelf life of military food may be determined from a remote location by requesting a read of the food military RFID tag . In an embodiment the foods self life may be calculated on the military RFID tag calculated at a remote location after the read calculated by both the military RFID tag and the remote location or the like. In an embodiment the sensor A may be self powered and able to read temperatures continuously the sensor A may be able to store some or all of the temperature information. When the military RFID tag is read the military RFID tag may read the instantaneous temperature information the temperature history information or a combination of the instantaneous and historical information.

In another example the environment in which it is stored may affect even long life or non perishable foods. The MRE may be considered a long shelf life product but may be affected by very hot temperatures or very wet environments. In an embodiment the MRE may have a military RFID tag that tracks the temperature humidity and the like using sensors . The MRE military RFID tag may be able to read the sensors and calculate the affect the environment may have on the MRE. A portable reader may be used to read the expiration date of the MRE as it is being distributed to verify the freshness of the MRE. For example if the MRE is stored in the desert for a long period of time the shelf life may be reduced. The sensor on the military RFID tag may continuously read the environment and store the environment information to the MRE military RFID tag during each read. With each read the military RFID tag may calculate the new expiration date of the MRE. The new expiration date may be read at the distribution point before being issued to the military personnel.

The military RFID tag may be associated with military identification and may store and communicate military RFID tag information related to the military tracking . The military RFID tag may be connected to a network that may be a wireless connection a wired connection or the like. The network may be a LAN a WAN a peer to peer network an intranet an Internet or the like. The network connection may allow the military RFID tag to transmit information related to personnel identification to a military network for tracking aggregation reporting or the like.

The military information may be related to military security where the information may provide the tracking of military personnel. The military information may be the location of military personnel within a camp within a military building or the like. The military personnel location may be automatically recorded on the military RFID tag at a checkpoint at a building or the like. For example the military personnel location may be tracked within a base. The military personnel ingress and egress may be recorded on the military RFID tag that may be carried by the military personnel. The military personnel location may be tracked at a checkpoint where the military personnel ingress and egress are recorded on the military RFID tag .

The military RFID tag may be associated with a military vehicle and may store and communicate military RFID tag information related to the military vehicle tracking . The military RFID tag may be connected to a network that may be a wireless connection a wired connection or the like. The network may be a LAN a WAN a peer to peer network an intranet an Internet or the like. The network connection may allow the military RFID tag to transmit information related to vehicle identification to a military network for vehicle tracking aggregation reporting or the like.

The information may be related to a type of the military vehicle. The information may be related to a location of the military vehicle the military vehicle location may be tracked within a base at a checkpoint or the like. The information may include information about the driver of the military vehicle the contents of the military vehicle and the like.

The military vehicle information may be related to maintenance of the military vehicle. The military vehicle maintenance information may be a type of vehicle a make of the vehicle an owner of the vehicle a last maintenance date a last maintenance type performed a next maintenance date a next type of maintenance required a maintenance history of the vehicle or the like. The military vehicle maintenance information may be read while the vehicle is within a maintenance facility at a checkpoint within a base within a camp while the vehicle is moving while the vehicle is stationary or the like to determine if the military vehicle is in need of maintenance .

The military RFID tag may communicate with a vehicle communication network to receive maintenance information from the military vehicle. For example the received maintenance information may be lubricant information a fault indicator a tire pressure a part identification associated with the received maintenance information or the like.

The military RFID tag may be associated with military personnel and store and communicate military RFID tag information related to military personnel casualty information. The military RFID tag may be connected to a network that may be a wireless connection a wired connection or the like. The network may be a LAN a WAN a peer to peer network an intranet an Internet or the like. The network connection may allow the military RFID tag to transmit information related to military casualty tracking to a military network for rapid identification of information related to the medical history of the military personnel.

The casualty tracking information may relate to the military personnel information that may include a personal identification a blood type a military unit a religious affiliation allergy information a medical history or the like. In an embodiment as the military personnel are treated new medical history may be written to the casualty tracking information on the military RFID tag . The personnel information may include location history information of the military personnel that may aid in the diagnosis of the military personnel the location history may include the last movements of the military personnel prior to any injury. The RFID tag may provide an automatic identification of the military casualty information or the information may be read manually using a portable reader .

Referring to a market example may be the medical field where information may be tracked for monitoring inventories of drugs medical products and the like within health care facilities for tracking the distribution and or maintenance of medical products for monitoring the deployment and status of medical devices for tracking the progress of patients within diagnostic or therapeutic protocols for providing security within health care facilities for allocating material resources or personnel within a health care facility or system and the like.

The medical industry presently is a diverse one with a number of needs for information tracking Medical supplies including devices and pharmaceutical products are distributed from manufacturer through a distribution chain to end user. Being able to track a product s status and location is crucial in the event of a recall or if resource allocation becomes problematic as in times of widespread health care emergencies. It is advantageous therefore to be able to follow a shipment unit for example to locate it for recall to match scarce supplies with demands and the like.

Moreover while the medical industry may presently collect and store information on hardcopy or internal data stores the hardcopy or data stores may not follow a pharmaceutical product a device component or a medical system throughout the life cycle so that it is difficult to verify the history of the product or component at the point of use. For medical devices in particular the life cycle may be prolonged and may take place under variable conditions where a durable recording device with memory capabilities to maintain the life cycle information would be desirable. This is of particular importance for medical applications where component failure may have catastrophic implications for patient care.

Furthermore as patient care becomes more complex it may be desirable to permit tracking an individual patient as he or she moves through a diagnostic or therapeutic treatment protocol. A tracking system may permit data to be gathered at a central location about patient status to give care providers a unified view of the progress that a patient has made in accomplishing the steps of a treatment plan. For example a patient s progress can be monitored as he obtains each of a series of diagnostic tests so that the care provider can be sure that all necessary information has been obtained and is obtained in the proper sequence. The tracking information may be part of an electronic medical record that the patient carries from test site to test site or it may be imbedded in an electronic hospital bracelet or the like so that the patient s progress through a sequence of tests may be determined by interrogating the electronic medical record or electronic hospital bracelet.

In addition tracking information can monitor the physical location of a patient or a hospital employee. This can answer staff questions about where a patient may be within the hospital or where a particular service provider may be. Tracking information may also be incorporated into a larger scale surveillance system so that the location of critical personnel within the facility may be determined for example in case of an emergency. Information about patients or personnel may be carried on an electronic hospital bracelet or an electronic employee ID card or the like. Such information may be combined with credentials that allow or forbid access to certain areas of the hospital. An electronic employee ID card for example may permit a pharmacist to enter a pharmacy storage room but may prevent an EKG technician from entering the same area. Tracking information may also identify which employees enter which areas and how many times. Temporary access cards may allow non employees such as visitors or vendors to enter certain areas while barring them from others. Such information may enhance security in a health care facility or may identify potential security risks. On a system wide scale such information may assist in locating medical and ancillary personnel for example during emergencies.

With reference to a medical RFID tag may be used for instrument and inventory tracking . The RFID tag may be affixed to medical equipment or instruments to permit monitoring their status. Life cycle information may be recorded for an apparatus or a component thereof including such information as when a component was produced when the component was maintained when the component is in service amount of time in service number of duty cycles quality checks information about of the enterprise providing the component or service and the like. The information may relate to safety component traceability service tracking maintenance life cycle management quality part identification and the like.

In an embodiment safety information borne on the medical RFID tag may be related to electrical grounding physical integrity proper fitting of components sterility indications and contraindications for use and the like. Safety information may be stored on the medical RFID to document safety testing maintenance schedules or updates. In an embodiment using medical RFID tags each component may be safety checked before a medical instrument is used or at regular intervals or after a set number of uses or the like to verify the conformity of the component or set of components to safety protocols. The medical RFID tag may contain the memory requirements to store all the safety requirement of the component for the life cycle of the component.

In an embodiment the medical RFID tag may be related to component traceability. Traceability information permits a component to be tracked throughout its lifecycle allowing monitoring of the repair history component utilization component malfunctions and the like. Traceability information may also permit the component to be located physically in the event of a component recall. Tracking a component within an assembly of components may permit evaluation of each individual element of a larger unit so that potential problems may be anticipated and pinpointed. During the life cycle of a component many actions such as repairs component upgrades reassemblies or the like may be performed on the component or assembly of components. The medical RFID tag may record information once the action has been completed providing a history of the actions performed on the component.

In embodiments the information recorded on a medical RFID tag may provide for traceability of the actions back to a time an enterprise a repair an assembly or the like if there is a question of the component s safety or efficacy. For example a particular instrument may require certain maintenance to preserve its safe functionality. As an example an anesthesia machine for delivering inhalable anesthetics may require routine maintenance and inspection of a number of its parts including supply hoses valves fittings waste gas scavengers vaporizers carbon dioxide absorbers and the like. A medical RFID tag may document proper maintenance and or calibration of each crucial component. As another example a medical RFID tag may document that a surgical instrument has undergone proper cleaning and sterilization.

In an embodiment service tracking may be recorded on the medical RFID tag to track the actual usage information of a component such as the number of uses for a particular component the patients for whom the component was used the service for the component or the like. Some medical components may have requirements for inspections based on the number of patients or patient hours for which the component has been used. In an embodiment the medical RFID tag may be associated with a sensor to record parameters that may be indicative of a particular use such as temperature pressure component stress chemical composition or the like. Using the sensor the medical RFID tag may automatically record the characteristics to which a particular component is exposed.

In an embodiment component maintenance may be recorded on the medical RFID tag to track maintenance information about the component such as the type of repair the repair technician the repair dates the repair enterprise or the like. In an embodiment as the component undergoes has maintenance e.g. repair upgrade the maintenance information may be recorded to the medical RFID tag to provide a maintenance history of the component. In an embodiment the maintenance history may be read from the medical RFID tag any time during the component s life cycle. For example there may be a question of the type of maintenance performed on a class of components and an enterprise may be able to query all of the pertinent medical RFID tags to determine if the components have undergone proper maintenance. This capability may provide the enterprise a rapid method of component verification to quickly resolve a question of device safety.

In an embodiment information may be recorded on the medical RFID tag to track quality related information such as inspection dates patient use tracking component configuration material information supplier information or the like. This information may be used in the quality confirmation of a component used in defect root cause analysis verification of a proper assembly comparing the components actual life cycle information with manufacturer requirements or the like. In an embodiment quality control personnel may be able to read the component quality information for a medical instrument or piece of equipment before its use in a patient to verify that all of the components with appropriate medical RFID tags are properly maintained and or properly functioning. Additionally a health care facility may be able to perform a rapid quality check of all their equipment bearing a particular component in response to a supplier notification FDA notification risk management alert or the like by reading all the relevant medical RFID tags .

In embodiments medical RFID tags may provide information about the physical location of equipment and supplies within a facility. A medical RFID tag may transmit a signal indicating the position of the equipment within the facility indicating its availability for use and the like. Such information may assist a facility manager in determining what resources are available e.g. how many unused ventilators are on hand and where the resources may be located at any particular time e.g. where the ventilators may be found in the hospital . In addition the medical RFID tag may allow components within the facility to be readily located for example if routine maintenance is due or if a product or component has been recalled or if a mechanical problem has been found in a component such that all like components may need to be checked.

In embodiments medical RFID tags may facilitate managing inventories of medical supplies medical kits medical instruments and the like. A medical RFID tag may allow an inventory system to track the number of a particular item that is on hand and may also allow the tracking of the usage pattern for the item. Raw usage data may then be associated with other data pertaining to patterns of hospital admissions diagnostic or therapeutic patterns demographics and the like. In addition usage of one item may be associated with usage of other supplies kits instruments and the like. By accumulating and organizing such information a health care system may make predictions about the inventory that it needs to maintain. For example by monitoring the medical RFID tags associated with medical supplies a health care system may determine that use of bandages IV setups suture materials and surgical instrument kits all rise and fall together correlated with the number of trauma patients seen in the emergency room. The emergency room may see an increase in trauma patients on weekend nights on holidays and in association with certain sporting and entertainment events. A health care facility may then organize its inventory to match its anticipated needs.

In embodiments a medical RFID tag associated with medical supplies may permit a smart shelf functionality permitting the use of supplies to be monitored and optionally correlated with usage patterns and further permitting efficient ordering and stocking of supplies in a timely manner to avoid overstocking and to avoid shortages. The medical RFID tag may contain information about expiration dates associated with medical supplies so that supplies may be made available for use before the expiration date and so that supplies whose expiration dates have passed are readily identified for discard.

In embodiments a medical RFID tag associated with may be associated with kits containing individual pieces of equipment used for medical or surgical interventions. The medical RFID tag may permit tracking of the components in kits e.g. stents catheters implants implantable devices and components thereof as well as tracking of the kits themselves. The medical RFID tag may permit the location of components within kits for emergency purposes for maintenance or for recalls.

In an embodiment identifying information may be recorded on the medical RFID tag to include for example the OEM information repair enterprise information component number serial number component revision level or the like. This information may be applied as the component is produced revised repaired or the like to provide a traceable history of the manufacture of the component. The identifying information may become the base information to allow the component to be tracked though out the component s operational life cycle.

In an embodiment the storing of information for the above capabilities may be implemented using different memory configurations such as public memory private memory encrypted memory read write memory write once read many memory read only memory or the like. For example the medical RFID tag may have information that should not be changed such as component number and serial number therefore the some or all of the component s identifying information may be stored in write once read many memory. This would allow the OEM to write the component identifying information but not allow anyone else to change this information. In another example there may be enterprise only information that may be stored using encryption memory so only the enterprise may read the information. For example a medical RFID tag worn or carried by a patient may contain medical record information that is encrypted to be read only by properly authorized health care personnel so as to protect patient privacy.

As previously described a medical RFID tag providing the above information capabilities may include such features as RFID node chip redundancy distributed memory environmental capability capability of reading external sensor information or the like. In an embodiment these capabilities may be used individually or in combination. The medical RFID tag may further have two or more RFID node chips that provide redundancy increased memory environmental resistance and external sensor reading. In an embodiment the RFID node chip redundancy may be provided by at least one RFID node chip redundant to at least one other RFID node chip on the medical RFID tag . The redundancy of the RFID node chips may allow the medical RFID tag to continue to provide functionality even if one or more of the individual RFID note chip become damaged. For example a medical RFID tag containing four RFID node chips may continue to read and write information even if one of the RFID node chips was to become damaged and stop functioning. In an embodiment at least one of the remaining three RFID node chips may assume the function of the damaged RFID node chip so the medical RFID tag may continue to store and transmit information.

In embodiments a medical RFID tag may be implanted within a patient in association with an implantable medical device. Such an implantable medical RFID tag may be integrated with the medical device in such a way as to be biocompatible. For example the medical RFID tag may be imbedded beneath the surface of the implanted medical device or it may be covered with a biocompatible material. A medical RFID tag that is implanted may carry out the same functions as a medical RFID tag that is associated with a medical device or component thereof used externally. For example the implanted medical RFID tag may permit tracking of the device or a component thereof. As another example the medical RFID tag may be associated with sensors that record parameters indicating the environmental or physiological conditions to which the sensor is exposed. The medical RFID tag may record the parameters to document device performance. The medical RFID tag may also transmit a signal in the event that the sensor indicates an environmental or physiological condition outside an acceptable range. A sensor incorporated in a vascular graft for example may identify a blood pressure outside the normal range. An associated medical RFID tag may then provide a signal to a monitoring system that indicates the abnormal parameter. A sensor incorporated in an implanted insulin pump for example may identify an abnormally high or low blood glucose level. An associated medical RFID tag may then provide a signal to a monitoring system or alternatively may signal the pump itself to alter its insulin dose. A sensor incorporated in a heart valve for example may monitor each valve cycle and transmit this information to the medical RFID tag which in turn may record the number of valve cycles or record the stresses placed on valve components or transmit signals corresponding to such information to monitoring systems. The exposure of the valve to stresses imposed by the cardiac cycle may then be monitored and abnormal stresses or stress responses may be signaled.

If dimensionally adapted to the size and shape of a particular medical device the medical RFID tag may be attached thereto or incorporated therein. In other embodiments the medical RFID tag may be implanted at the same time as a medical device to receive signals from sensors or to carry information regarding the device itself or its use. For example a medical RFID tag may be implanted subcutaneously at the same time that a heart valve vascular graft infusion pump or the like is implanted at the appropriate anatomic location. A medical RFID tag associated with an implanted medical device may also be wearable or portable by the patient e.g. as an electronic medical identification card band or medical alert bracelet.

A medical RFID tag associated with a medical device may receive information from sensors may use a wireless interface or may be hardwire connected to the sensors as the anatomic placement position permits. Additionally the medical RFID tag may be able to communicate with more than one sensor using either a wired or wireless connection. In an embodiment a medical RFID tag may network a number of sensors together to collect and save the sensor information. A networking interface may be a separate device from the medical RFID tag or may be part of the medical RFID tag or a combination of separate and integrated or the like. Sensors may be associated with an implantable medical device as described above. Sensors may also be associated with a wide range of non implantable medical devices and pieces of apparatus as would be understood by those of skill in the art.

In embodiments a medical RFID tag may be powered by ambient electromagnetic waves by a reader signal by an electromagnet signal device or the like. In an embodiment the medical RFID tag may read the associated sensors during power up. For example the medical RFID tag may power up every time that a piece of equipment e.g. a ventilator or an anesthesia machine is turned on. During the power up the medical RFID tag may read the data from the associated sensors. In another example there may be a signal generator that powers up the medical RFID tag on a periodic basis to read the associated sensors and record the readings. A signal generator may be associated with the power supply for the device for example the battery pack for a pacemaker or an implantable defibrillator. In an embodiment a powered sensor may be powered by an external source to provide a constant power supply so that the sensor may continuously measure and provide data to the medical RFID tag . A powered sensor may be powered by battery by AC by DC by solar power or the like. In an embodiment a powered sensor may be powered by the same supply that the medical RFID tag uses. It may be understood by someone knowledgeable in the art that different types of sensors would be useful in different medical contexts and that a variety of medical RFID tags may be employed in association with such sensors.

Referring to a medical RFID tag may be used to facilitate pharmaceutical product tracking in ways similar to the medical supplies devices and instruments tracking functionalities described above. A container for a pharmaceutical product for example may bear a medical RFID tag with information about the drug its lot number its production history and the like. In addition a container for a pharmaceutical product may bear a medical RFID tag with medical information associated with the product for example its dosage its indications and contraindications its interactions with other drugs and the like. The medical RFID tag may permit tracking of the physical location of a pharmaceutical product within an enterprise or within a distribution network. Such tracking becomes useful for example if a certain lot number of the product needs to be recalled.

Referring to a medical RFID tag may be used to manage and streamline pharmaceutical supply inventory and vending in ways similar to the medical supplies devices and instrument inventory management described above. The medical RFID tag may allow monitoring of available supplies of a pharmaceutical product. Such monitoring may be integrated with systems for ordering pharmaceutical supplies so that appropriate amounts of the product will be on hand as needed for patient care without overstock or undersupply. As described above an ordering system may be associated with a usage pattern recognition system so that pharmaceutical products that tend to be used together may be ordered in relation to each other. For example if the usage of coumadin is noted to vary with the incidence of elective orthopedic procedures in patients over forty five an ordering system may use the schedule for such procedures as a factor in ordering appropriate amounts of coumadin. Medical RFID tags for pharmaceutical products may comprise part of a smart shelf ordering protocol whereby inventory is tracked use is monitored and predicted and appropriate orders are placed.

In embodiments a medical RFID tag associated with a pharmaceutical product may interface with a medical RFID tag associated with an individual patient. In embodiments a patient based medical RFID tag may bear information about a patient s medical condition may contain data from the patient s medical record and the like. Prescription data may be input into the patient based medical RFID tag . As one example a pharmaceutical product medical RFID tag may be designed to query the patient based RFID to ensure a match between the product for example and the patient s prescription information. As another example the pharmaceutical product medical RFID tag may be designed to query the patient based medical RFID tag to ensure that the indications for the product correspond to the patient s diagnosed conditions. As another example the pharmaceutical product medical RFID tag may be designed to query the patient based medical RFID tag to ensure that the patient has no recorded allergies or contraindications for the product.

In embodiments the medical RFID tag for a pharmaceutical product may durably bear information pertaining to the particular patient who will be receiving it. A prescription for a patient for example may be conveyed to a pharmacy and the medical RFID tag for the prescribed product may be updated by the pharmacist with information relating to the prescription e.g. dose administration schedule timing with respect to meals drug interactions and the like . In embodiments the information may be read by the patient or by the health care personnel who are monitoring the patient s care. Information from the medical RFID tag may be downloaded or transmitted for example to a handheld device portable computer desktop computer computer network or other electronic reader device as would be understood by skilled artisans.

In embodiments the prescription information from the patient based medical RFID tag may interface with a medical RFID tag or other security system on the product s container to create a smart pillbox wherein the container may be opened for example only at designated intervals or after the entry of an appropriate security code. Such arrangements may prevent use of the medication by unauthorized users children etc. or may be useful with patients who have trouble remembering a dosage schedule or recalling when they last took their medication.

As an alternative to correlating the product medical RFID tag with a patient based medical RFID tag a health care worker administering a medication may access the information on the product medical RFID tag and correlate it with information from other sources such as handheld devices laptop computers desktop computers computer networks hardcopy manuals or textbooks or the like. The health care worker may have to sign off after the administration of the medication by creating an electronic or hardcopy record or by inputting the administration accountability information into the product medical RFID tag . In this way the medical RFID tag may come to contain information about its own utilization permitting accountability recording accumulation of information for patient medical records and enterprise records and the like.

In embodiments a medical RFID tag for a product may acquire and retain information about the particular patient who has used the product consistent with the requirements of medical privacy confidentiality and informed consent so that the product container bearing the medical RFID tag may provide the pharmaceutical manufacturer with information about the clinical use of the product. This may facilitate acquiring data for clinical studies such as those required by the FDA. In embodiments the medical RFID tag for a product may contain data indicating that the product had been administered to a particular patient. This information may be transmitted to other systems within a health care facility interfacing for example with patient billing systems utilization management systems automated product ordering systems or the like. Data carried on a product s medical RFID tag may be encrypted or otherwise protected so that medical privacy and confidentiality is ensured.

In embodiments an interlock system may prevent administration of a pharmaceutical product to a patient where the product s and the patient s RFIDs do not match. For example such an interlock system may prevent the administration of an overdose to a pediatric patient prevent the administration of a drug to a patient known to be allergic to it prevent the administration of a drug to a patient with known contraindications or drug interactions and the like. In embodiments an interlock system may be imposed at any point in the supply chain for a product with the product RFID having to match the code for a particular institution patient care unit or the like. In this way inappropriate medications would be detected upon delivery to a particular institution patient care unit or the like minimizing the risk that inappropriate medications would be provided to patients in such settings e.g. pediatric unit doses would not be accepted when erroneously delivered to a nursing home or erectile dysfunction products would not be accepted when erroneously delivered to a pediatric floor in a hospital . An interlock system may be absolute or it may permit override by a medical practitioner. In the event of override the interlock system may record the identity of the practitioner and the circumstances of the override. A system that requires a match between product and patient information via RFID interaction and or a system that provides an interlock in the event of product patient mismatch may lead to fewer medication errors and improved risk management.

By integrating pharmaceutical inventory systems and pharmaceutical delivery systems a medical RFID tag associated with a pharmaceutical product may permit the tracking of the product from its point of production or delivery throughout its product cycle to its ultimate administration to the patient. The medical RFID tag may record the individuals involved at the different stages of the administration process from the individual who receives the shipment in the facility to the individual in the pharmacy who receives the bulk shipment to the pharmacist who distributes the product to the health care personnel to the individual who administers the product to the patient. A pharmaceutical tracking system may enhance accountability at every step throughout the distribution chain. In embodiments a pharmaceutical tracking system may assist in surveillance for the distribution of controlled substances which otherwise may be diverted from legitimate uses.

In another embodiment the pharmaceutical product medical RFID tag may contain information about that product which is accessible by a medical practitioner. A medical RFID tag on a pharmaceutical product may act as a virtual PDR for the medical practitioner with information about doses indications and contraindications drug interactions and the like. Such information may be downloadable by the practitioner to a handheld device a portable computer a desktop computer a computer network and the like. The medical RFID tag on a pharmaceutical product may be updatable with new information as such information becomes available. A pharmaceutical company may provide updates of indications and the like for example as such data is accumulated and is approved by the FDA. In this way the pharmaceutical product itself may bear the most up to date information about itself its doses indications and contraindications drug interactions and the like.

A medical RFID tag for a pharmaceutical product may be dimensionally adapted for the particular product its container or its packaging in such a way as to permit the medical RFID tag to achieve its goals. For example a medical RFID tag may be attached to a cap or a lid of a container in combination with an interlock or usage recording mechanism the so called smart pillbox. As another example a medical RFID tag may be associated with the membrane of a product for intravenous injection so that each withdrawal of the product through the membrane may be recorded on the medical RFID tag or that each withdrawal of the product would require correlation with a patient s RFID tag and or accountability tracking. In embodiments the medical RFID tag may be associated with a sensor system. A sensor system may comprise one or a plurality of sensors that record information such as twisting of a lid change in pressure within a container flow of fluid out of a container administration of a diluting agent to the container or the like.

With reference to a medical RFID tag may be used for patient tracking . Patient tracking may involve physical tracking within a health care facility. Patient tracking may involve monitoring the progress of a patient throughout a protocol so that a health care worker may determine whether a patient has carried out all the steps of a prescribed diagnostic or therapeutic sequence. In embodiments patient tracking via a medical RFID tag may be associated with the creation of an electronic medical record aspects of which may be transported with the patient for example as a hospital bracelet a medical ID card a medical alert bracelet a set of dogtags or the like. Medical record information on the medical RFID tag may then be accessed by health care providers or updated by health care providers as appropriate.

In embodiments a medical RFID tag may permit patient tracking within a health care institution or health care system. Patient tracking using a medical RFID tag may permit a nurse on a hospital floor for example to locate a particular patient who has gone off the floor for tests or a nurse in the operating room to keep track of a trauma patient who is en route from the emergency department. The medical RFID tag may be associated with sensors within the hospital facility that act as virtual checkpoints tracking the patient s physical location as the patient passes the particular sensor. The medical RFID tag may also interface with check in stations at different parts of the hospital so that the patient s medical RFID tag records her arrival at the XRay department physical therapy the EKG lab and the like. The virtual checkpoint or the check in system or the like may permit patient tracking in association with a patient based medical RFID tag .

In embodiments a medical RFID tag that permits patient tracking as a patient checks in at particular units within a health care system may provide data that other information systems may use. For example patient tracking using a medical RFID tag may allow a patient s presence at a particular unit to be recorded so that an attendance history may be recorded. This may allow the documentation of patient compliance with a treatment regimen for example physical therapy diet counseling Alcoholics Anonymous or the like. Patient tracking as recorded on a medical RFID tag may be accessible by a variety of patient care personnel so inpatient and outpatient tests and treatments may be followed. A visiting nurse for example may access the tracking information on the medical RFID tag to determine that the patient has followed the recommended steps for diabetes diagnosis treatment and lifestyle counseling. As another example a visiting nurse may be able to determine that an anticoagulated patient has had prothrombin times measured on a regular schedule that are within the proper range. As yet another example a visiting nurse may be able to determine that a patient has taken her medications on an appropriate schedule by interrogating the patient associated medical RFID tag by interrogating the product based medical RFID tag in a patient s home the smart pillbox or the like.

In embodiments patient tracking system may also permit a patient s progress to be followed through a complex sequence of diagnostic and or therapeutic steps. For example a diagnostic protocol may require that tests be carried out in a certain sequence and the patient may be tracked from test to test to ensure that the sequence is followed in the proper order. As an example a patient being evaluated for breast cancer for example may first need a mammogram then an ultrasound then a breast MRI then a mammogram guided biopsy. As that patient receives each test her medical RFID tag may be updated to record that the test was performed so that she may proceed to the next step. In this way a patient would not erroneously undergo testing out of order. As another example a patient tracking may ensure that a patient undergoing a procedure has accomplished all preliminary diagnostic tests. In this example a patient s medical RFID tag may be updated as she has her pre operative tests to indicate that they had been performed and this information would be read by operating room personnel before any surgery would be performed. A medical RFID tag associated with a patient may serve a checklist function so that the patient cannot advance to a subsequent diagnosis or treatment step until the previous steps have been satisfactorily completed. Individuals performing diagnostic or therapeutic steps or checking the results of such steps may update the patient associated medical RFID tag with their identifying data so that accountability may be maintained for each step.

In embodiments a satisfactory completion of a diagnostic therapeutic or pre procedure sequence may be required before the patient undergoes a particular intervention. The medical RFID tag may record the satisfactory completion of each step and may further be associated with an interlock system so that the patient may not undergo the intervention unless the sequence as recorded on the medical RFID tag is satisfactory. Entry into the operating room for example may involve the communication of a patient s medical RFID tag with an interlock programmed in accordance with the preoperative requirements. In this example a patient whose medical RFID tag indicates lack of test results or unsatisfactory test results may be denied physical admission to the operating room. Similarly progress to the next stage in a diagnostic or therapeutic sequence may be protected by interlock so that the satisfactory completion of all preceding stages may be required before undergoing the next step in the sequence. A variety of applications combining a medical RFID tag with an interlock will be apparent to skilled artisans.

In embodiments medical RFID tags used for patient tracking may interface with other error management systems to decrease the incidence of clinical errors. As an example a medical RFID tag may prevent wrong side surgery by containing independent information about which side of the patient needs the surgery or by allowing a patient s position for surgery to be mapped to a protocol for operating on a particular side. A patient undergoing a left lung resection for example may require positioning on the operating table with his right side down. A medical RFID tag containing information about the procedure planned for this patient may communicate with a position sensor affixed to the patient so that a right side down position for the left thoracotomy is ensured with the proper right side down the wrong right lung cannot be removed. As another example a medical RFID tag containing information about an organ to be removed may need to be checked off at several different stages of patient preparation in the operating room e.g. positioning prepping draping so that all personnel are reminded on a number of occasions about which side requires the operation. A reader for the medical RFID tag may include display means that provide a visual or an audible signal regarding the side for surgery.

A medical RFID tag may be dimensionally adapted for placement within the body so that a biocompatible RFID may be implanted during initial procedures to identify tissues or organs for subsequent excision radiation treatment etc. A medical RFID tag may be placed directly during an exploratory procedure or a resection to indicate where post operative radiation should be directed. A medical RFID tag may be placed endoscopically in an abnormal organ or tissue to indicate which organ or organ section may require further treatment e.g. resection radiation intraarterial chemotherapy and the like thereby enhancing error management. A medical RFID tag may be placed at the time of a biopsy for example if a frozen section is abnormal to designate the location of the tumor for further treatment e.g. so that the leg with the bone tumor is removed instead of the other leg or so that the correct region of the body is irradiated to treat a tumor . A medical RFID tag placed during a first procedure may be used with an interlock system alert system display system or the like to ensure that a subsequent procedure is directed to the proper organ or anatomic region.

With reference to a medical RFID tag may be used to monitor or control patient ingress and egress and or ingress and egress of employees or other personnel. As described above a medical RFID tag may allow the tracking of a patient s physical location. In other embodiments the medical RFID tag may permit the monitoring or control of a patient s entry into various areas within the health care facility. In other embodiments the medical RFID tag may be useful to monitor or control the ingress or egress of employees from the health care facility or certain areas thereof.

In embodiments the medical RFID tag may record the physical location of a patient. A patient associated medical RFID tag may record a patient s passage into certain areas or the patient s passage past certain checkpoints. Moreover a medical RFID tag may control a patient s entry into or egress from certain areas. Patients in general are restricted from certain areas within a health care facility such as pharmacies storage areas clinical areas that are inappropriate and the like. A medical RFID tag associated with a patient may prevent access into a prohibited or restricted area for example by locking the entryway or by interfacing with an alarm system. A medical RFID tag may also prevent a patient from leaving the ward in a similar manner creating a virtual locked ward. 

In embodiments personnel within a health care facility may be tracked in ways similar to the patient tracking systems and methods described above. A medical RFID tag may be used to determine the physical location of health care personnel within a facility or may be used to follow the path of a particular health care individual. The tracking of personnel may interface with other systems permitting for example system wide information to be gathered about the whereabouts of particular categories of individuals. In the event of an emergency for example it may be useful to know where within the facility the anesthesiologists and respiratory therapists are located. A medical RFID tag worn by or carried by such individuals may permit their locations within the facility to be identified.

In embodiments identifying the location of certain personnel within a hospital may be correlated with other features of communication or other systems within a hospital. For example a selective paging system may page those individuals closest to a particular emergency situation or may page those individuals whose location indicates that they are most likely to be available. In this example a medical RFID tag may show the location of the cardiologist nearest to a cardiac arrest using that information the selective paging system may send out an emergency STAT page for that specific cardiologist. Other examples may be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill.

A tracking system for personnel may be correlated with other features of a health care information system for example to assist with staffing or other personnel management issues. In this example a medical RFID tag worn by or carried by nursing personnel may allow each individual to check in at the beginning of a shift when he or she reaches the assigned duty station within a hospital or the like. The location of each individual may be mapped onto a personnel chart that shows which duty stations are adequately staffed and which duty stations require additional staffing. Such information may for example allow redistribution of available personnel to meet staffing needs or may allow additional personnel e.g. off duty or temporary nurses to be called upon to meet the staffing needs. As another example such information may interface with systems to permit adjustment or redistribution of patient admissions based on personnel numbers and locations of short staffed areas. For example information regarding the numbers of nursing staff in a surgical ICU may be collected by medical RFID tags worn by or carried by nursing personnel and relayed to a control center the control center may respond to a shortage of nurses in the surgical ICU by recruiting nurses from other hospital areas medical ICU recovery room and the like by restricting new admissions from other hospital floors by redistributing patients to other ICUs by closing the emergency room to new patients or the like. Other examples may be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill.

In embodiments a medical RFID tag may track employee ingress egress and or be used as an adjunct to other security systems. A medical RFID tag may allow personnel to check into or out of the facility so that there is a record of who is on site. Such information may be integrated with other systems in the facility e.g. communications systems. In such an example a physician checking into a hospital facility may have a data set about the status of his in hospital patients downloaded into a handheld device or portable computer after his medical RFID tag is recognized upon check in by the hospital information system.

In other embodiments a medical RFID tag may be used by an employee to gain access to certain areas within the health care facility. Access regulated by a medical RFID tag may be organized according to the individual person s identity the job description the time of day or the like. As an example a pharmacy supervisor may carry or wear a medical RFID tag providing her access to all areas of the pharmacy including receiving areas formulation areas storage areas and the like. The medical RFID tag worn or carried by a physical therapist by contrast may provide him access to none of these areas. An anesthesia technician may carry or wear a medical RFID tag granting access only to operating room pharmacy areas and only during her working hours. The anesthesia technician attempting to use the medical RFID tag to gain access to an operating room pharmacy area during non working hours may be denied access moreover a record of the access attempt and or an alarm may be generated. As another example a specifically encoded medical RFID tag may be necessary for accessing patient medical records so that only individuals involved in caring for a particular patient may have access to that patient s medical records.

In other embodiments a medical RFID tag may be employed to grant or restrict access for other individuals who are not employed by the health care facility. A vendor for example may be provided with a medical RFID tag that allows him access to an area of the hospital for a specified period of time. In this example an individual like a medical devices sales representative may use his medical RFID tag to gain access to the operating suite where he is to demonstrate the use of a particular product. However the medical RFID tag issued to this individual may not grant him access to any other area and may be time limited so that his failure to leave the premises and check out by a certain time may for example send an alarm to hospital security personnel. As another example a visitor to a hospital may be issued a medical RFID tag that allows him or her to enter a specified area of the hospital where he or she will be visiting a patient. The medical RFID tag may be time limited so that the visitor s failure to leave the premises and check out by a certain time may for example send an alarm to hospital security personnel. Prior to obtaining a medical RFID tag the visitor may have to check in with security. Certain individuals visitors whom the patient does not wish to see abusive spouses etc. may for example be placed on a no visit list and may be denied a medical RFID tag granting hospital access. Alternatively a prospective visitor s name may need to be registered on a visitor list before a medical RFID tag granting hospital access is issued. Other examples may be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill.

In embodiments a plurality of RFID tags may be programmed such that they operably act as a composite multi tag that is multiple RFID tags may be configured in the system to present such that they are treated as if they were configured as one device. In embodiments the plurality of RFID tags may be realized as a composite multi tag at the physical tag to reader interface level or at a higher level of abstraction in the system such as in the reader the computer server the application servers in markets or the like. For example and as illustrated in the composite multi tag may be realized at the tag to reader interface by configuring the EPC numbers of the plurality of RFID tags A C so that one RFID tag A is identified as the primary and the remaining of the plurality of RFID tags B C are identified as secondary. The primary RFID tag A may thereafter act as the primary communications point between the composite multi tag and the reader the primary RFID tag A may provide a group interface to the reader the primary RFID tag A may provide a central memory collection point for the plurality of RFID tags A C the primary RFID tag A may provide a central functional coordination point for the plurality of RFID tags A C and the like. In embodiments the secondary RFID tags B C may be communicated through the primary RFID tag A directly with the reader through an RF coupling between RFID tags through a physical connection between RFID tags and the like. In addition the primary RFID tag A may be chosen to be physically capable of longer range communications than the secondary RFID tags B C and the plurality of RFID tags A C may have different physical memory allocations. In embodiments due to the connectivity between the plurality of RFID tags A C secondary RFID tags B C may not need to be configured with an antenna .

In embodiments when memory is spread across the plurality of RFID tags A C the system may need to maintain certain associations. For instance if there is a risk of multiple such RFID tag A C combinations presenting at a reader simultaneously it may be necessary to maintain a reference or other means of determining which RFID tags are part of which combination. In addition in order to determine the logical ordering of memory individual tags within the combination may need to be uniquely identifiable such that the memory they contain may be properly mapped. One such means of maintaining grouping and ordering may be to assign one RFID tag A as the primary tag A and supplemental tags B C being assigned as secondary tags B C. In embodiments all to the RFID tags A C may be linked via data in their EPC banks. In embodiments any functionality spread across multiple devices including sensor inputs alerting mechanisms and the like may also be abstracted to present as if they were implemented as one device.

Continuing in reference to an example is presented to show how programming of the RFID tags A C may identify the set of RFID tags A C as a composite multi tag . This example is meant to be illustrative and not limiting in any way. One skilled in the art will recognize alternate configurations for establishing the plurality of RFID tags A C such that they act as a composite multi tag . In this example one of the RFID tags A is chosen as the primary where the serial number of the primary in this case AAA may then be used as the start of the EPC number for all the secondary RFID tag B C members of the composite multi tag . In addition each of the RFID tag A C members may be assigned a member number where for instance the primary RFID tag A is numbered 1 the next RFID tag B is numbered 2 the next RFID tag C is numbered 3 and so on for the rest of the plurality of RFID tags A C that make up the composite multi tag . In embodiments the primary RFID tag A may also have an indication of the number of RFID tags A C that make up the composite multi tag such as by an identifier provided after the primary RFID tag s A EPC number in this case the number 3 to indicate that there are three RFID tag A C members making up the composite multi tag . With this programmed configuration the reader may determine the configuration and EPC numbers of all RFID tag A C members by reading only the primary RFID tag A information. For instance when the reader extracts the EPC and supplemental number XXXX 3 and the primary RFID tag s A serial number AAA the reader may then be able to derive the EPC numbers for the rest of the RFID tags B C making up the composite multi tag . That is from the primary RFID tag s A serial number of AAA and the EPC supplemental number of 3 the reader now knows there are a total of three RFID tag A C members including the primary RFID tag A where the secondary RFID tag B C EPC numbers are AAA2 and AAA3 . In embodiments all of the RFID tag A C members may also be provided a group number to identify all the member RFID tags A C within a composite multi tag such as a group number of 1 in this example.

In embodiments the plurality of RFID tags may be realized as a composite multi tag at a higher level of abstraction in the system. For example and referring to each of the plurality of RFID tags A C may be individually read by the reader where the reader may not be required to immediately recognize that the plurality of RFID tags A C are associated with one another and where the reader may collect information from the plurality of RFID tags and either processes the collected information to associate the plurality of RFID tags as a composite multi tag or send the information on to other components in the system for like processing such as to the computer server the data storage the application servers the markets and the like. In embodiments the processing may be performed through software that associates the plurality of RFID tags to a composite multi tag . Further the information collected from the plurality of RFID tags may be associated together as a part of the single composite multi tag entity. For instance the memory collected from the plurality of RFID tags A C may be assembled into a contiguous memory where thereafter the contiguous memory is associated with the composite multi tag rather than the individual RFID tags A C. In embodiments other RFID tag functions may also be associated with the composite multi tag such as processor functions sensor functions and the like. In embodiments associations between RFID tags may be retained off the tag such as in the data storage in a database by algorithmic processing of data such as with unique Ids encoded with the RFID tags and the like.

Referring to in embodiments the plurality of RFID tags A C comprising the composite multi tag may be mounted on a placement facility where the placement facility may be a substrate a silicon wafer a ceramic platform a metal surface a box a container a shipping container and the like where the plurality of RFID tags A C may be spread out while maintaining their collective identity as a composite multi tag . In embodiments the primary RFID tag A may be capable of longer range communications A than the secondary RFID tags B C such as being physically equipped with a larger antenna A. As a result the primary RFID tag A may be detected A by the reader at greater distances than the secondary RFID tags B C which may be equipped with smaller antennas B C. In this way the primary RFID tag A may act as a beacon A to the reader for location of the composite multi tag at greater distances than the reader can detect the secondary RFID tags B C. In embodiments as the reader is brought closer to the composite multi tag the reader may be able to directly communicate B C with the secondary RFID tags B C. In embodiments a system where the composite multi tag is influenced by coupling effects with the tagged item may achieve a performance boost beyond the performance that would be expected in free space.

In embodiments the RFID tags A C comprising the composite multi tag may be able to communicate between themselves D F such as through the larger antenna A being electrically coupled by close proximity to the smaller antennas B C which may give them the benefit of a larger antenna A. This may enable the shorter range tags B C to be read at a greater distance. In embodiments electrical coupling may use capacitive coupling inductive coupling coupling through the tagged product and the like. In addition communication between the secondary RFID tags B C and the primary RFID tag A may be implemented by direct connection such as by soldering adhering crimping and the like. In embodiments there may be more than one long range RFID tag A provided on the composite multi tag in order to improve the communication between the reader and the composite multi tag . In embodiments a system where the composite multi tag may combine with a tagged item using capacitive inductive direct connection or other coupling means may use the tagged item as a primary antenna component for the purposes of communication.

In embodiments RFID tags may be applied to a spatially diverse object where the RFID tags may be associated with a substantially identical name plate function and thus may be used to maximize the probability of detection e.g. allowable read angles . In this instance user memory may be distributed across the individual RFID tags by means similar to those described herein.

In embodiments the RFID tags A C comprising the composite multi tag may be able to share RFID tag memory A C contents as a result of communications D F between the plurality of RFID tags communications A C between the RFID tags A C and the reader and the like. In embodiments the RFID tags A C may contain different amounts of physical memory A C. For instance the secondary RFID tags B C may have a larger allotted physical memory B C than the primary RFID tag A because the secondary RFID tags B C have smaller antennas B C and so have a larger space available for physical memory B C. In embodiments the physical memory A C of the composite multi tag may be identified as a continuous virtual memory space to the reader such that the reader does not have to be aware that the composite multi tag is made up of separate physical memories A C separate physical RFID tags A C and the like. In embodiments the distributed larger effective memory may allow for user memory space provide prototyping larger memories before they are available and allowing the swapping of RFID tags A C when they become available allowing for error correction in the event of a failure of an RFID tag A C and the like. In embodiments the user memory from the plurality of RFID tags may be mapped into a logical addressing space to appear as a single RFID tag such as the composite multi tag . This mapping may be implemented by software in the reader in the computer server in the application servers in the markets and the like or implemented in at least one of the RFID tags A C.

In embodiments memory configurations may utilize encoding within the RFID tags such as in data written into an EPC bank into user memory into configuration memory into program memory and the like. In embodiments a system where additional memory resources including for example EPC memory banks including unused memory beyond an EPC code password memory other available memory and the like may also be mapped into the logical memory space to appear as user memory. In embodiments a system where the memory from multiple tags may be mapped into memory arrangements other that one contiguous user bank such as for example into an extended EPC bank multiple user banks and the like.

In embodiments the composite multi tag may include any combination of RFID tag capabilities such as memory processing sensor interfaces antennas and the like. In embodiments the information associated with a composite multi tag may be associated with processing such as with compression algorithms encryption algorithms authentication algorithms encoding algorithms and the like. The composite multi tag may utilize these RFID tag capabilities in serial parallel and the like such as processing on one RFID tag B and storing information on a second RFID tag C storing the same information on multiple RFID tags simultaneously using multiple long range RFID tags on the composite multi tag to enhance communication characteristics with the reader and the like. In addition the composite multi tag may contain a mixture of different types of RFID tags such as a combination of custom RFID tags and off the shelf RFID tags all custom RFID tags all off the shelf RFID tags passive RFID tags and active RFID tags and the like where custom RFID tags may contain any configuration of nodes chips antennas sensors processing memory and the like as described herein. In embodiments a system where memory may be mapped using the techniques across multiple devices in combination with redundant encoding techniques such that the composite multi tag may achieve a level of fault tolerance when one or more devices within it fails or degrades.

In embodiments a user may be enabled to exchange data with an RFID tag through an RFID drive management facility as a seamless extension of a filing system within a computing device such that the RFID tag and associated RFID tag data may be managed in a manner that is logically consistent with other items within the file system where the computing device may be a server desktop computer laptop computer smart phone and the like. The RFID drive management facility may provide for management of the RFID tag managing the identity of an RFID tag recognizing the presence of an RFID tag and the like. For instance the RFID tag may appear to a computer in a similar way as a file folder or flash drive would appear where the user is able see that the RFID tag is present to move data to and from the RFID file system element through drop and drag actions change the identity of the RFID tag and the like where the presence of the RFID drive management facility may be transparent to the user. In embodiments the computing device may have software components to convert data structures between the format of an RFID tag memory and that of a computer file system such as for the Windows operating system the Apple operating system Android operating system iOS Windows CE Mobile and the like. Although this disclosure refers to RFID tags one skilled in the art will appreciate that the methods and systems of the present invention may be applied to any short range RF identification system such as for near field communications NFC enabled devices.

Referring to an RFID tag may be accessed via an RFID drive management facility resident on a computing device through an RFID interrogator e.g. an RFID reader connected to or integrated with the computing device . The RFID drive management system may provide a means for user and system interaction with an RFID tag where RFID tag data stored on the RFID tag s memory is transferred between the RFID tag memory and the computing device file system as data formatted for display and edit through the computer device s computer interface . The RFID drive management facility may make it much easier to use RFID tags which may not require special software consider or implement programming solutions tag memory layouts and the like. When the RFID drive management facility is deployed on a computing device with an attached or embedded RFID reader an RFID tag appearing within range may be mounted within the file system of the computing device. For instance the RFID tag may be mounted as a dedicated drive e.g. T as a folder e.g. Computer Tags Tag Name on a conventional Windows based PC as a directory on a Unix Linux or Android based system e.g. mnt tags tagname and the like.

In embodiments the RFID drive management facility may provide RFID tags and associated RFID data across a networked system where the processing RFID readers and the like may not be locally resident with the computing device such as where the file system is perceived by the local user separate from the locally resident capabilities or physical architecture associated with the RFID interrogator and the location of the RFID tag. For instance and referring to an RFID interrogator may interface with a computing device where the RFID drive management facility may manage the interface and exchange of data with the RFID tag . The computing device may interface with at least one of a plurality of computer devices across a network . In this wider network context the RFID tags may have uniform resource locations such as if they were network or web pages servers in their own right. In such a case a user might interact with a remote tag via a web browser with RFID drive management facility providing a similar conversion between tag data format and html format.

The RFID drive management facility may enable changing the identity of an RFID tag. For example changing the EPC on EPCglobal compatible tag may require the user to only have to rename the associated drive or a folder such as through using Windows Explorer the desktop environment or other conventional tools provided as part of the computer device operating system with no need for a special application.

The RFID drive management facility may allow records to be stored and recovered from the RFID tag by treating them as conventional files e.g. they may be dragged and dropped into the RFID tag by dragging and dropping them into the drive or folder representing the RFID tag and edited in situ by for example double clicking them. The RFID drive management facility may deploy advanced serialization and de serialization algorithms to convert the files to and from the RFID tag memory format and a conceptual RFID tag file system which may allow these files to be held in a manner that maps onto a hierarchical tree paradigm used by modern computer systems. In embodiments this may be transparent to the user where all the user may know is that they can see and interact with the RFID tag just like they can a computer device such as a PC a portable flash drive and the like as described herein.

The RFID drive management facility may transform the user experience when interacting with RFID tags and greatly simplify system deployment. For example consider the case where an RFID tagged asset travels through multiple locations adding information to the RFID tag at each stage such as a document requiring multiple levels of approval. A normal deployment scenario would likely involve writing a special purpose application for this function. By running the RFID drive management facility on each computing device conventional applications such as Microsoft Excel may be used for this function changing the file directory to that of the RFID tag.

In embodiments the RFID drive management facility may map RFID tags onto file system elements such as disclosed herein. Records on an RFID tag may map onto files with a tag. Using a native file rename command within the operating system may change tag identity and record names. A file name representing the tag may be a hexadecimal conversion of the tag identity a general purpose string a human readable form of the data used to encode the tag identity and the like. For example a file name may be encoded in a manner similar to the EPC URI defined in the GS1 EPCglobal Tag Data Standard 1.6. Records may be added to the RFID tag by saving by drag and drop and the like and edited by techniques such as edit double click and the like. Data held on the tag may not be an exact binary match of the mapped file contents but optimized via techniques such as indexing and compression for efficiency. Techniques used to store data on the tag may comply with a defined tag data format for example ATA Spec 2000. The RFID drive management facility may interrogate an RFID tag and assign a converter that maps between tag data format and computer file format based on the format of the tag data. Edits to records may be held as changes e.g. by diff encoding rather than by overwriting the existing record such that a full audit trail of changes may be recovered. RFID tag identity and or one or more folders or records may be secured via cryptographic means such as but not limited to encryption hashing and digital signatures. Cryptographic algorithms used to secure data may operate on and include the unique manufacturing identity of the RFID tag e.g. as its chip serial number to prevent genuine data being considered authentic when copied to another counterfeit tag. A control menu for the RFID drive management facility may be accessed by clicking or right clicking a status icon e.g. such as a user would access printer spooling controls . An engineering user interface may show tag memory contents such as optionally decoded . A secondary application programmer interface may allow RFID tags to interact with special purpose programs while retaining interoperability with the RFID drive management facility. RFID tags may be used without a dedicated tag file system and presented to the user as a raw memory dump which may be edited and hence change the tag memory using conventional tools such as spreadsheets word processors text editors and the like. Free space may be shown as a notional free space file having size equivalent to or representing the free memory on the RFID tag when the tag is mounted as a folder rather than a drive. For example it may make sense to map RFID tags to folders if more than one tag is present but folders may inherit free space from the drive rather than having their own free space. With a drive mapping the drive may show the true free space. Conventionally defined memory layouts may be mapped onto computer application files. For example a maintenance record in Spec 2000 could be edited within Microsoft Excel with the mapping converting between the Excel binary format and the ASCII name value pairs format of Spec 2000 in a manner that is transparent to users i.e. this technique may work with any defined memory format given the right mappings . Multiple layouts may coexist within the same RFID tag and be accessed by the RFID drive management facility e.g. a public region in ATA Spec 2000 format and one or more optionally private regions in a different format such as the diffing file system described herein .

In embodiments the RFID drive management facility may provide for interfaces within a web based Internet cloud environment. For instance interfacing with a cloud environment may addresses needs associated with the fact RFID tags often pass through many locations organizations collecting data e.g. maintained aviation parts where once the RFID tagged part is in the field it is traditionally difficult to get added information back to the organizations needing it until the part returns to their possession . The cloud configuration may be implemented as a trusted third party service e.g. with an enabling application where RFID tag information may be automatically synchronized with the back end systems of organizations having interest in the RFID tag information whenever the tag is read. The system may allow users to specify the data they desire and the data they allow others to have and may provide means of cryptographically ensuring privacy e.g. via encryption and authenticity e.g. via digital signatures such that information is securely disseminated. A cloud based server may be capable of communicating with client software to provide cryptographic credentials such as public private keys that can be used by the RFID drive management facility. The authentication process may optionally include the RFID tag identity as described herein to prevent counterfeit tags to be created by copying data. In embodiments the cloud implementation may be considered a switchboard that connects organizations with the data on their RFID tags whenever a tag appears at a read point i.e. a device running the RFID cloud implementation that has a network connection as a value added network VAN for EDI and the like.

In embodiments methods and systems may be provided for managing RFID tags where an RFID tag and associated RFID tag data are presented to a computing device through an RFID drive management facility as a seamless extension of a logical file system within the computing device such that the RFID tag and associated RFID tag data can be managed in a manner that is consistent with other items within the file system. The computing device or computer system may communicate with the RFID tag such as through a connection to an interrogator through a network connection and the like. In embodiments the system may be implemented as a computer implemented system of managing RFID tags such as comprising an RFID tag a memory comprising instructions a processor receiving data from the RFID tag and performing the steps of providing a RFID drive management facility on the computer system the computer system having a logical file system presenting an RFID tag as an extension of the logical file system providing the ability to manage data on the RFID tag in the logical file system and the like.

In embodiments methods and systems may provide for computer functionality where the RFID tag may be mounted as a file system element accessible within the local and network file system available to the computing device. The file system element may be a drive folder network share uniform resource location and the like. The identity of the RFID tag may be changed by changing the name of the drive folder network share uniform resource location e.g. including both local area and wide area internet locations and the like. The name may be in one of a plurality of representations such as hexadecimal human readable fields constituting the identity separated by delimiters general purpose naming string and the like. The RFID drive management facility may operate autonomously and transparently to the user with minimal interaction such that the ordinary user interface for reading and writing data is the same as the file system. The RFID drive management facility may be implemented as a process daemon or other capability within the run time or operating system a device driver either in the run time kernel or application space an application a service a remote procedure call or equivalent capability and the like. The computer device may be a server a desktop computer a laptop computer a tablet computing device a smart phone and the like.

In embodiments methods and systems may provide for editing and writing back to the tag where the RFID tag data is edited on the computing device and transferred to the RFID tag. The editing may be provided within an operating system a user interface environment and the like. The editing may include copy and paste and drag and drop techniques. The editing may provide changes to file system elements by an application run time system and the like within the computing device. The editing may comprise copying renaming deleting and the like. The editing may be provided by at least one of a spreadsheet application database application word processing application text editor application and the like on the computing device. The editing may allow an existing application to read and write data to and from tags through its conventional file handling interface versus requiring RFID specific functionality . The editing may be provided by a web browser and the RFID tag presented as if it were a web page or other named resource location.

In embodiments methods and systems may provide for cloud or local area storage transferring the RFID tag data from the computer device to a server based cloud or local area network storage facility such as where the RFID tag data may be made available to a second computer device. The RFID tag data may be mounted at a uniform resource location as a network file share and the like.

In embodiments methods and systems may provide for RFID tag structures and configurations described herein including multi node RFID configurations single node RFID configurations composite RFID tag configurations usage of one time programmable OTP memory structures on the RFID tag and the like. For instance the RFID tag interfacing with the RFID drive management facility may utilize OTP memory configured as emulated multiple time programmable eMTP memory. The RFID drive management facility may then manage reads and or writes with the RFID tag as if accessing true multiple time programmable memory such as available in RAM flash memory a hard drive and the like. In this way the RFID tag who s access is managed through the RFID drive management facility may appear to the user of the computing device as similar to other file system elements on the computing device. For example the user may access the RFID tag as a storage drive icon on the desktop of the computer device as if the RFID tag was a portable flash memory drive plugged into the computing device where in reality the memory being accessed is OTP memory on the RFID tag configured as eMTP memory as described herein. In another example the RFID tag may be a multi node RFID tag as described herein where each RF node for instance is shown as a separate memory storage icon on the desktop of the computing device. Although only a few examples have been provided for how the RFID drive management facility may be utilized in combination with the RFID structures and configurations as described herein one skilled in the art will recognize the ability of the RFID drive management facility to interface a computing device to other structures and configurations described herein.

In embodiments methods and systems may provide for file formatting where the RFID drive management facility provides a mapping of an RFID data format to a computer file format. The RFID drive management facility may simultaneously provide mapping to a plurality of computer file formats where one of the plurality of computer formats may be a raw file format showing sequential data memory content as the data is stored on the RFID tag. The RFID drive management facility may simultaneously provide mapping to a plurality of tag data formats. The RFID drive management facility may identify an RFID tag data format and assign a converter to translate and convert between the file format within the computer system and the data format within the tag. The RFID drive management facility may provide a mapping of a computer file format to an RFID data format. The data format within the RFID tag may be an exact representation of the file format within the computing system. The RFID drive management facility may provide a data format within the RFID tag with additional processing to convert between the RFID tag data format and the computing system format where the additional processing may include data compression delta coding such that changes to data are stored and resaved unchanged data is not stored and the like. Changes may be time stamped so that the exact tag state at a particular date and time may subsequently be recovered. Digital signature information may be added to validate data or tag integrity.

In embodiments methods and systems may provide for management capabilities such as where control functionality for the RFID drive management facility may be accessed from a control icon a status icon and the like within a user desktop. The status icon of the management capability may be changed to indicate the state of the reader. For instance animated green arcs within an icon may show that the RFID interrogator is reading and animated red arcs may show that the RFID interrogator is writing. The RFID drive management facility may be integrated with and managed by network management software or capabilities used to manage network and computing infrastructure.

In embodiments methods and systems may provide for an RFID interrogator e.g. an RFID reader a NFC reader . The RFID interrogator may be interfaced to the RFID drive management facility via a dedicated connection such as an RS232 connection a USB connection and the like. The RFID interrogator may be interfaced via a network. The RFID interrogator may be incorporated within the computing device. For instance the RFID interrogator may be integrated into a rugged RFID hand held an NFC enabled tablet or cell phone and the like.

The RFID drive management facility is one example of how RFID tags may become more interconnected with external computing systems in a way that is transparent to the user that is in a way that extends the familiar computer operating system environment to include information stored on an RFID tag as an extension of the computer operating system environment. However the use of RFID tags as an extension of the computer operating system environment and beyond that into the networked environment of the global Internet has much greater implications than simply making a tag a storage extension to another computer. Since RFID tags are meant to tag objects with information the extension of the RFID tag as an extension of a computer operating system and into the web based interconnection of global information access has implications for objects or things becoming a part of the Internet of things realization. The extension of the RFID tag as an extension of a computer operating system may also provide the vehicle for RFID tags expanding beyond their traditional low memory role as mere ID tags to true information storage and access devices. This may be enabled by among other things the processor based high memory RFID tag of the present disclosure where the RFID tag possesses all of the components of a micro computer including the data processor and controller block the power management block high capacity memory and the capability to extend all of the these functions to other distributed nodes on the RFID tag through a networked interface A and into external devices through a communications interface . The key to the RFID tag becoming a seamless extension to the networked Internet of things environment is the high functioning processor capability and high memory capacity of the RFID tag such as through the distributed processor and memory functionality enabled through coordinated bus communications of multiple RF network nodes on the RFID tag . As such the RFID tag becomes the end connection to any object where information stored on the tag may include data text files audio video documents event logs sensor information history auditing information and the like. The RFID capabilities may therefore increase the value of RFID tags by increasing access to data and enabling the analysis of the data collected such as at the individual asset level for a network of assets and potentially for everything things people systems places .

Referring to in embodiments the RF network node utilized alone or networked with other RF network nodes may be a processor based smart node s with functional components of a micro computer such as containing a processor memory input output facilities networking facilities memory manager security and encryption and the like. These capabilities enable the RF network node with the hardware necessary for the implementation of an operating system at least in part such as in a system involving the hardware of the RFID tag as an extension of an operating system on another computing system or in whole such as a stand alone operating system that is able to communicate with other operating systems of external computing devices . For instance a hybrid operating system may contain multiple layers of operating system functionality such as with a hardware layer on the side of the RFID tag and a software layer on the side of an external computing device firmware layers in either location and the like. For example as described herein the operating system layer on the external computing device may be the RFID drive management facility which may interface with the RFID tag hardware layer comprising facilities that enable the hybrid operating system interface such as to enable the RFID tag to act as an independent computing entity a hard drive like facility and the like and interface externally with different data formats provide memory segmentation schemes e.g. private and public apply security to data being stored and the like. For instance by way of providing a hard drive like facility the RFID drive management facility may better enable the bulk writing of data to the RFID tag. Rather than an RFID tag being used to store small amounts of information at a time the RFID drive management facility may provide a way for a user to write bulk data to the RFID tag such as in a similar fashion to a computer writing bulk data to a hard drive.

In either a unified system or as a hybrid system with external facilities the tag operating system TOS may enable the RFID tag to become a more autonomous computing device executing programmed responses to internal or external triggers. A TOS enabled processor based RFID tag also referred to herein as an RFID computing device may contain program memory programmable memory data store and the like where program memory may contain the at least part or in whole an operating system . Memory may be in the form of MTP OTP eMTP and the like where a portion of the memory may be boot memory that is accessed upon powering up the RF network node and initializes operating system capabilities upon boot up.

The RFID computing device having a greater autonomous operating capability may provide for higher level computing resources such as security management. For instance when the system segments data blocks it may be able to control read and write alternations. Security management facilities may be part of the TOS or part of a hardware implemented logic such as a state machine that goes through and verifies operating conditions and results. For instance the system may segment the memory with portions that can only be written once while other information has to be re written e.g. such as on a more ongoing basis . Segments may be dedicated as primary address locations while other segments or blocks may be reserved as back up or recovery locations. Hardware elements on the RFID tag including in cases where the tag is a passive tag operating when activated by an interrogator signal may operate with resident security and management processes with the data processing and a controller managing overall operations. In this case at least some aspects of the operating system may be implemented in hardware a an on tag hardware operating system. 

Referring to memory may store software that interfaces with an operating system for central control of the RF network node hardware resources computer programs for instructing the computer in performing tasks or solving a problem application software for performing specific tasks also referred to as an application program application program such as including functionality to implement a distributed processing capability amongst a plurality of RF network nodes. The plurality of RF network nodes may operate their own stand alone operating system operate as one node in a distributed operating system environment operate in a hybrid operating system configuration with software located on a computing device operate as either a master or a slave in a master slave distributed processing configuration and the like. The operating system may include capabilities for supporting a graphical user interface GUI GUI widgets application programming interface API software structure e.g. operating system call structure drivers e.g. RFID reader drivers bar code drivers input output drivers drivers to the communication facility drivers to external devices and the like. For example in a hybrid TOS configuration an external computing device may have a GUI template program that is utilized as a framework for a GUI to a user where the RFID tag provides the external computing device with GUI data input in implementation of the GUI to the user that then presents data stored on the RFID tag. In this way the GUI template on the external computing device may be generic such as for an RFID computing device and where the tag itself provides the data input for presenting a user interface that is customized to the application for which the RFID tag is being utilized. Programmable memory may include applications such as for providing the programming interface for operating the RFID tag for a specific user purpose including an application graphical user interface an application controller and the like. The application may perform tasks that benefit the user where the operating system e.g. system software serves the application which in turn serves the user interfacing with the RFID tag through an external computing device . Applications may include consumer enterprise industrial commercial entertainment gaming content asset tracking supply chain management and a host of other applications as well as hardware drivers functional libraries suites of services and the like. The programmable memory may interface with and control the hardware interface with users e.g. directly with users to users through a remote interface and the like. The operating system may manage RFID tag hardware resources and provide common services for computer programs operating within the data processing and controller block of the RFID tag or through computer programs operating at least in part on external computing devices . The data processing and controller block may have its own memory for the operating system with its own properties such as dedicated program memory to implementing the operating system in conjunction with the hardware.

With the inherent size parameters associated with a typical RFID computing device memory may be at a premium. Thus memory efficient capabilities may be utilized to conserve memory on the tag. For instance RFID applications may call for the storage of links URLs email addresses and the like such as to be provided to a user accessing the RFID tag. In this case shortened or compressed forms of links URLs addresses emails and the like may be utilized and then translated or uncompressed when a user accesses the tag. Compression techniques file name shortening techniques utilization of difference records delta compression techniques zip type functions for compression and the like are known in the art and may be utilized. For example URL shortening is a technique in which a URL may be made substantially shorter in length and still direct to the required page such as achieved by using an HTTP Redirect on a domain name that is short which links to the web page that has a long URL. In another example to save storage space application specific formatting may be removed saving only the data and perhaps an indicator of the original application for which the data was formatted.

In embodiments the RFID computing device may be linked to other TOS enabled RFID tags to networked computer devices to cloud computing analytics facilities to cloud computing storage and the like. For example the RFID computing device may initiate communications with other computing devices to check in for instructions when awakened by an RF interrogator device synchronize its data with an enterprise or cloud computing database and the like. The RFID computing device may provide these communications in a secure manner such as authenticating to another computing device including another RFID tag when accessed requesting authentication from another computing device and the like. In embodiments authentication may be provided by the RFID tag through data stored on the tag such that when the tag is accessed the tag provides authentication to access the cloud storage facility. User contact information e.g. email SMS may be stored on the RFID tag such that when the RFID tag is accessed the user may be contacted such as in a notification of access in order to provide data e.g. updated data differential data from last access to the user to enable the user to update data on the RFID and the like. Multiple contacts may be specified such that accesses and or data on the RFID tag may be shared with specified groups such as specified on the RFID tag in a cloud database and the like. The RFID tag may have an IP address such as to act as a node in a network or in the cloud. Through this connectivity between the RFID tag on an object and users and the network information about the object as stored on the RFID tag may be shared across the network connecting the object to the users and information systems around the world such as triggered logically through combinations of an RFID tag access changes in information on a tag sensor out of range indications synchronized data updates with a cloud database and the like.

Referring again to the RFID computing device may provide services to external market applications application servers data storage systems networked computing devices and the like. For example the RFID computing device may be linked to a targeted market advertisement such as based on events in connection with the RFID tag marketing information stored in the cloud and the like. For instance a mobile phone scanning a particular tag may trigger a particular advertisement promotion. The RFID tag may store transactional information e.g. product pricing promotions SKU information shipping information etc. . RFID tags may be updated with pricing information when it receives an email from a system e.g. via reaching out to the cloud to update itself when it is read . These capabilities combined with the RFID tag s ability to endure rugged environments required for securely storing and managing data for long periods of time may provide the user of RFID tags with a long duration solution to product marketing requirements. The RFID computing device may also interface with other RFID tags B interfacing with a common RF interrogator to RFID tags A interfacing with a separate RF interrogator B and the like. The other RFID tag A B may also be an RFID computing device it may be a traditional RFID device or some hybrid between e.g. running a simplified operating system running as a state controller and the like .

In embodiments an RFID computing device may be utilized for wide array of application and market solutions where processing and memory are required in a very small form factor. For example the RFID tag may be used as part of or in replacement of a portable memory device e.g. a USB flash drive where the RFID tag utilizes its memory directly for use as the portable memory device or indirectly where the RFID tag is used as a controller for an externally interfaced memory on the device e.g. where the memory is interfaced as an external device through the communication facility . As a portable mass storage device the RFID tag may interface with the operating system of an external computing device as well as being able to be interfaced by way of an RFID interrogator. In this way the RFID device expands the capability of a traditional portable memory device to include the interface capabilities of RFID devices. As such in a non limiting example the RFID portable memory device may include the RFID tag acting as a mass storage controller device a flash memory chip interfaced as an external device a USB interface RFID antenna write protection switch and the like. Memory configurations on the RFID portable memory device may include standards for both RFID applications and for standard computer file systems. For example the RFID portable memory device may support FAT32 or ExFat file systems allowing the device to be accessed on virtually any host device with USB support and presenting the RFID portable memory device to an external computing device as a hard drive to the host system. As such memory on the RFID portable memory device may be compatible with standard memory management facilities such as defragmenting facilities memory distribution facilities hard drive segmentation facilities and the like. Applications for the RFID portable memory device may include personal data transport e.g. accessible through either a standard computer interface or through an RFID interface secure storage of data application and software files e.g. encrypted memory private public memory segmentation computer forensics and law enforcement e.g. carrying forensics software transport of firmware for external computing devices booting the OS of a computing device carrying applications e.g. an application that runs without the need to install the application on the interfacing computer system backup facility audio player e.g. as connected via a USB wirelessly through RFID interface media storage and marketing e.g. digital audio files that can be transported on the device brand and product promotion security systems e.g. security interrogator on the device that can scan the security of an external device gaming e.g. storing high scores personal information associated with the game and the like. The RFID portable memory device may provide advantages over existing solutions including very low power requirements no moving parts hardened memory and the like.

In embodiments the RFID computing device may be an active or passive RFID device act as an initiator of control and communications to external devices act as a subordinate controller to external applications comprise a full operating system comprise a partial co processing version of an operating system and the like. For instance the RFID computing device may be a passive RFID device that is tagged onto an aircraft component on an aircraft and serves to store all information pertaining to the aircraft component including factory information life history maintenance history sensor data through monitoring sensors interfaced as external devices and the like and configured to act in a subordinate role to an airline component monitoring program that accesses the RFID computing device for information updates. Alternately the RFID computing device may be programmed to monitor parameters and send alerts to the airline component monitoring program when parameters change or are out of limits such as related to a maintenance schedule related to operating limits when the component is accessed or opened and the like. Self monitoring and alerts may be enabled and occur when the device is RF illuminated by an RF interrogator if the device is a passive device or continuously if the device is an active device. Either way the RFID computing device having its own operating system programming applications and the like may provide for an autonomous computing device that is capable of interfacing with a computing device in a way similar to the computing device interfacing with another computing device . For instance communication protocols file exchange formats secure communications encryption and the like between the RFID tag and the computing device may make it transparent to the computing device that it is interfacing with a component that is other than another computing device .

In embodiments the RFID tag may be configured as a hybrid RFID computing device with an operating system extension system that is designed to operate in conjunction with and as an extension of an operating system of a computing device . For instance an RFID tag may be configured such that its software is an extension of an operating system of a first computing device and where the first computing device then interfaces with a second computing device. In an example a mobile computing device may have an integrated RFID interrogator A where the mobile computing device has an operating system that interfaces with an RFID tag as an extension of its operating system and where the RFID tag has an operating system extension program operating within its programmable memory . In this configuration the computing device with integrated interrogator A plus the RFID tag with the operating system extension program may be seen collectively as an RFID enabled computing device where information is capable of being collected stored processed and the like in situ with an object tagged with the RFID tag. One use case for this a smart phone equipped with an interrogator that is able to access information and processing capabilities on the RFID tag as if the RFID tag where an integral part of the smart phone operating environment. For instance a user could open an app on the phone and access and operate the RFID tag directly such as viewing data e.g. sensor data stored operations data factory data execute commands e.g. request sensor data be taken change programming parameters download a new software program and the like.

In embodiments the RFID computing device may be used to track or collect information e.g. though sensors associated with a person such as a patient e.g. in the hospital during treatment a soldier e.g. on deployment on a mission an employee e.g. while on a manufacturing floor while accessing confidential resources a person monitoring their health e.g. during a run over time and the like. In an example the RFID computing device may be used to create battery free sensor monitoring body worn RFID computing devices where the user carries or mounts the device somewhere on their person and where the device monitors sensors mounted on their body. Sensors may measure heartbeat blood pressure perspiration temperature blood levels and the like where sensors may be communicatively connected by either wired or wireless means to the RFID computing device. In the case of a battery free RFID computing device the device may only power up and collect data when the RFID computing device is interrogated. For instance the RF interrogator may be integrated with the user s smart phone. Now when the RF interrogator is turned on at the smart phone the RFID computing device powers up and collects data. Alternatively the RFID computing device may have a battery where the RFID computing device is constantly collecting data.

In embodiments a store and forward or store and synchronize system may be utilized with an RFID computing device. For instance an asset s information may be stored on the RFID computing device while in an off line mode and then forwarded or synchronized with a remote storage facility. For example a manufactured component may be tagged with an RFID computing device at the factory when the device is connected to the factory s network. During transport the RFID computing device may be collecting information such as environmental information but unable to forward the information without a network connection. However once the component reaches a networked destination the RFID computing device may then upload or synchronize its information to a storage destination. Alternately the information may be provided as an update to an individual responsible for the component or may receive alert information some monitored parameter goes out of limits.

The step leading to the RFID computing device is an innovative one requiring a computing capability in a technology that has traditionally been viewed as little more than an electronic label where technology evolutions have been mainly marked with increasing the amount of information that can be written to the label. The RFID computing device is an enabler of informational connectivity including personally socially politically and economically much in a way that past digital innovations have provided. For instance globalization due to the Internet has provided the ability for international trade on a personal level. The use of the RFID computing device will extend that user level influence to potentially include all things that can be tagged where due to the RFID computing device having an interface that is universal to the digital world enables the RFID computing device to be interfaced potentially by anyone with the access privileges to do so.

The facility offered by the RFID computing device represents a convergence of the RFID label technology with the networked digital computing environment to create an entirely new information technology potentially altering traditional relationships between producers and suppliers equipment manufacturers and end users businesses and consumers and the like. The RFID computing device provides for objects what the smart phone has done for individuals providing a global interconnection of information down to the object level. It is not enough to have access to information on an object such as through traditional RFID tagging the information has to be accessible through the global digital environment using standard computer system technologies where the time for access is nearly instantaneous. An RFID computing device that is connected to the Internet can be potentially accessed as quickly as any other computer system providing users with access to information of objects with the speed as they are now used to connecting to each other.

In embodiments methods and systems for a radio frequency RF computing tag may comprise at least one antenna and at least one RF computing device enabled for RF communication on a single substrate where the antenna s and RF computing device s may be mounted on a single substrate. The RF computing device may comprise an RF and analog block for receiving and transmitting an RF signal through the antenna where the energy from a received RF signal provides power to the RF computing device e.g. a passive RFID tag . The RFID tag may contain its own power source e.g. an active RFID tag such as receiving power from a battery a solar cell a fuel cell an electro mechanical energy transducer and the like. The RF computing device may comprise a power management block for managing power requirements of the RF computing device. The RF computing device may comprise a processor based data processing and controller block for digital information management such as including an operating system a programmable memory e.g. read only firmware programmable memory e.g. read only readable and writable a data store e.g. readable and writable .

In embodiments the programmable memory may store an operating system for operation of the RF computing device where the operating system may be executable code for operating the RF computing device executable boot code that is accessed upon powering up the RF computing device and the like. The operating system may be an extension of a second operating system on a second computing system part of a hybrid operating system with a second operating system on a second computing system and the like. The operating system may respond to trigger commands received in the RF signal. The operating system may comprise capabilities for supporting an application programming interface API . The RF computing device may interface with a plurality of RF computing devices networked together each with their own operating system and where the operating system environment may be a distributed operating system environment across the plurality of RF computing devices.

In embodiments the RF computing device may interface with an external device through a communication interface such as the external device being a sensor e.g. mounted on the single substrate with the RF computing device a computing device a network interface a display and the like. The RF computing device may function as a portable memory device such as with interfaces to an external device through the communications interface through the RF signal and the like.

In embodiments the data store may have a large memory capacity such as having a minimum memory capacity of 100 kB 1 MB 10 MB and the like. The programmable memory may comprise a computer program for instructing the RF computing device. The programmable memory may comprise application software for instructing the RF computing device.

In embodiments the RF computing device may operate as an autonomous computing device that is capable of communications with an external computing device without the need for an intermediate RF device. The RF computing device may comprise a hardware implemented state machine for logical control of the RF computing device such as where the logical control has control over memory management of the data store. The operating system may comprise capabilities for supporting a graphical user interface GUI such as where the support provides a GUI template program that is utilized as a framework to an external computing device.

Since RFID tags are meant to tag objects with information they have implications for connectivity of objects people or things among each other and to the full Internet as part of the Internet of Everything IOE or Internet of Things realization of a web based interconnection of global assets and devices of many different types. The vehicle for RFID tags traversing from their traditional low memory role in ID tags to true information storage and access may include the processor based high memory RFID tag with external facility connectivity e.g. sensors actuators displays network and the like of the present disclosure where the RFID tag may possess all of the components of a micro computer or smart RFID device such as including a data processor and controller block a power management block high capacity memory and the like as well as the capability to extend all of these functions to other distributed RF nodes on the RFID tag or across a series of coordinated RFID tags through a networked interface A and into external devices through a communications interface . A key to the RFID tag or a set of coordinated tags becoming a seamless extension to the networked IOE environment is the high functioning processor capabilities and high memory capacity of the RFID tag which may be extended through the distributed processor and memory functionality enabled through coordinated bus communications of multiple RF network nodes on the RFID tag . As such the RFID tag becomes the end connection to any object where information stored on the tag may include data text documents event logs sensor information history auditing information position location information and the like. The RFID capabilities may therefore increase the value of RFID tags by increasing access to data located with the object and enabling the analysis of the data collected from the object such as at the individual asset level for a network of assets and potentially for everything things people animals devices systems places etc. .

In addition to the business value that high capacity RFID tags provide in their ability to store and process more information in a more sophisticated way is the ability for the RFID tag of the present invention to withstand harsh environments as described in this disclosure. Information stored on an RFID tag with an object such as an asset as opposed to information stored in an environmentally protected data storage facility may be exposed to harsh physical environments such as ones with high or low temperatures high humidity mechanical vibration rapid acceleration or deceleration including without limitation from being thrown or dropped or experiencing collisions with other objects ionizing radiation large amounts of pollution high magnetic or electrical fields high amounts of moisture e.g. from rainfall humidity or flooding the presents of abrasive elements and the like. Once information begins to be stored on an RFID tag with an object it becomes preferable in many cases that the memory storage medium of the RFID tag be capable of maintaining data integrity after being subjected to a harsh environment. Further the RFID tag may be required to operate while being subjected to the harsh environment. The combination of processing capabilities high memory capacity and the ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions makes the RFID tag of the present disclosure preferable for satisfying the needs of users that want to tag informational objects with assurance that data integrity will be maintained with the object despite exposure to harsh conditions.

An RFID tag attached to an object may have an external interface to the object such as to an external antenna to a sensor to a fixed or mobile network connection to a display facility to an actuator to one or more other tags to an Internet access point to a mobile device and the like where the external interface may be a wired or wireless information and or control connection. In a wireless instance the wireless connection may be through an RFID RF interface e.g. to another RFID tag or to an RFID interrogator reader such as utilizing an RFID tag integrated antenna an external antenna e.g. as associated with the object the RFID tag is mounted to an antenna connected to or embedded in an asset e.g. slot antenna integrated into the frame of a component and the like. For instance an RFID reader may act as a connection point to a network connection such that a computing device on the network is able to read and or write information with the RFID tag. In a non limiting example suppose a manager of an Internet data center wanted to track information associated with removable circuit boards e.g. a memory board processing board interface board that are used in the servers of the data center. An RFID tag may be mounted to each circuit board where each server location is within access range at a point in time of an RFID reader that is connected to a network. In addition a user may then also be able to access the RFID tags directly or through the RFID reader such that when a board is moved experiences errors is texted and the like the user may be able to update the information on the RFID tag associated with that circuit board. Each circuit board thus may carry all of the information associated with it such as factory provided information test information performance data environmental data from sensors and the like. Location data may be stored initially with the tag upon deployment of the RFID tag on the circuit board or it may be obtained by enabling the reader with a GPS or other location device so that the reader may inform the RFID tag and other systems of the physical location of the tag each time the reader interrogates the tag .

In some embodiments the RFID tag may have embedded thereon or may be in communication with a local GPS device e.g. an RFID reader with GPS capability a mobile computing device smart phone tablet or the like with embedded GPS and RFID interrogation capability or other GPS enabled device connected such as by network connection to the RFID tag and thus be enabled to utilize GPS position data in geo location tagging geo location based applications and the like. For example the RFID tag may be embedded in or placed on a mobile device such as a laptop computer smart phone tablet and the like or a connected device e.g. a device connected to the interface port of an iPhone which would enable the mobile device and the RFID tag to exchange data by way of at least one of a direct wired connection e.g. through the communication facility or an RFID interrogator signal e.g. the mobile device has an RFID reader . GPS geo location information may then be encoded into the RFID tag such as for tracking the location of a tagged asset. Alternately the RFID tag may be in proximity to or mounted on the mobile device e.g. permanently or temporarily and may be able to communicate with the mobile device by means of an RFID interrogator signal through a wireless connection facility e.g. a WiFi or Near Field Communication NFC device connected to the RFID tag through the communication facility .

This type of connectivity between the RFID tag and the GPS geo location data on the mobile device may enable the RFID tag to collect geo location data for use in geo location tagging and applications. For example an RFID tag may be mounted to or embedded in a product such as a mobile phone equipped with GPS where connectivity between the RFID tag and the GPS capabilities of the mobile phone have been established. In this instance the RFID tag may have the function of storing the component history for the mobile phone. For example the component history may include factory information transportation information environmental information and the like where through access to the GPS capacities of the mobile phone this information may be tagged with geo location information. In addition this information may be periodically stored or synchronized with a database such as in the cloud so that loss of the phone would not result in loss of the data including the data acting as a black box of information that was recorded before during and or after the loss occurred. In another example geo location information may be used to geo track assets as they are moved with historical location data by time allowing geo tracing the tagged object such as when the object has come in proximity to a certain location e.g. an RFID reader location how long the object has been at a fixed location when the object passed through a gate when the RFID tag has been in communication with a computing device or a network connection and the like.

In embodiments tagged objects may be communicatively interconnected through combinations of RFID to RFID RFID to interrogators RFID to computing devices with embedded RFID interrogators RFID to computing device through a wired connection and the like enabling information to pass amongst the interconnected devices. Thus information e.g. asset information geo location data sensor data alerts messaging may be passed from one device to another. This interconnected arrangement may take the form of a star configuration with for example an RFID reader at the center relaying information amongst the RFID devices. The interconnection may take the form of a chain ring or mesh of devices hopping from RFID device to RFID device from RFID device to RFID reader device across a network connection to another grouping of devices and the like. In this way tagged assets may be interconnected together. In the case of passive tags this interconnection is only limited by RFID tags being illuminated by an RFID interrogator such as where the RFID interrogator wakes up multiple RFID tags allowing them to exchange information such as with the RFID interrogator as the informational bridge or where RFID tags are able to communicate directly with one another.

For instance referring to an RF interrogator may transmit energy to passive RFID tags and waking them up where the RFID tags and are then able to transmit data between them. In embodiments RFID tags and may be members of a plurality of RFID tags where some of the plurality of RFID tags are energized directly by the RF interrogator and others that are out of range are energized by RFID tags that are in range e.g. where an in range RFID tag sends some of the energy received from the RF interrogator to an out of range RFID tag . The plurality of RFID tags may then communicate amongst themselves while the RF interrogator is transmitting energy. In embodiments data may be passed from one RFID tag to another in a mesh network of RFID tags where the network is active as long as energy is being transmitted by the RF interrogator. In embodiments the RF interrogator may be an active RFID tag such as a controller for the plurality of passive RFID tags. In cases where the RFID tag has an alternate power source e.g. solar piezo electric vibration thermal then the device may maintain a powered up state and maintain the interconnection chain with other RFID tags.

In embodiments active RFID tags passive RFID tags smart tags simple tags relay tags and the like may be used in combination to create a self aggregating RFID interconnected smart RFID network. For example a group of objects may contain varying degrees of smart tags with some active and some passive. An active tag may act as a local controller and periodically wake the passive tags within range where other active and passive tags could then further extend the range infinitum . Once awake the passive tags may collect sensor data execute actuator commands check status send alert messages and the like. The controller may then collect information and act based on what information was collected e.g. status alert request for update and the like . In this way an RFID interrogator is not required for the group of tagged objects to collect and self aggregate information. In embodiments an interrogator in conjunction with a passive RFID controller may provide the same or similar functionality. The IOE realization may not only allow accessing data that is stored for a given purpose but also allows collecting information that is being automatically collected and maintained for other purposes should a need arise for the information. The processing and storage capabilities described in the present disclosure may greatly expand the enablement of such self aggregating RFID networks in that processing capabilities enable smart capabilities e.g. processing control sensor and actuator interfaces and the like and large memory distributed memory enable the storage requirements for holding data in time periods between interrogator accesses e.g. a fixed reader a mobile interrogator smart phone and the like without necessarily requiring grid power a battery or harvesting environmental energy. In embodiments memory schemes may be implemented to maintain data over extended periods of time with limited memory capacity such as by decreasing the time granularity of collected data as time increases since the last RFID interrogator contact such as through a time granulation management facility executed as an algorithm on the RFID tag for thinning out data stored in memory. For instance the algorithm may search through memory and delete data with respect to the time the data was collected to create increasingly larger time gaps in the data stored as the time since the last interrogator accesses increases. Information may thus be maintained for very long periods of time without sacrificing data covering the entire period.

In embodiments the RFID tag may be linked to cloud storage facilities. For instance when an RFID tag or RFID network is accessed by an Internet connected interrogator computing device the RFID tag may initiate a data communication with the cloud storage facility such as to synchronize data between the RFID tag s and the cloud to upload data to the cloud e.g. in redundancy or to offload data collected while the tag was not connected to the network such as to free space on the RFID tag network of tags download data e.g. such as tagged for downloading to the tag by a user and the like. In embodiments authentication may be provided by the RFID tag through data stored on the tag such that when the tag is accessed the tag provides authentication to access the cloud storage facility. User contact information e.g. email SMS may be stored on the RFID tag such that when the RFID tag is accessed the user may be contacted such as in a notification of access in order to provide data e.g. updated data differential data from last access to the user to enable the user to update data on the RFID to prompt the user to enter credentials to allow the user to provide instructions and the like. Multiple contacts may be specified such that accesses and or data on the RFID tag may be shared with specified groups such as specified on the RFID tag in a cloud database and the like. The RFID tag may have an IP address such as to act as a node in a network or in the cloud. Through this connectivity between the RFID tag on an object and users and the network information about the object as stored on the RFID tag may be shared across the network connecting the object s to the users and information systems around the world such as triggered logically through combinations of an RFID tag access changes in information on a tag sensor out of range indications synchronized data updates with a cloud database and the like.

In embodiments the RFID tag may be utilized to connect a tagged object to a marketing management system such as linking the object to a targeted market advertisement based on events in connection with the RFID tag marketing information stored in the cloud and the like. For instance a mobile phone scanning a tagged object may trigger a particular advertisement promotion. The RFID tag may store transactional information e.g. product pricing promotions SKU information shipping information logistics information etc. . RFID tags may be updated with pricing information when receiving communication such as email from a system e.g. via reaching out to the cloud to update itself when it is read . These capabilities combined with the RFID tag s ability to endure rugged environments required for securely storing and managing data for long periods of time may provide the user of RFID tags with a long duration solution to product marketing requirements.

Areas of application for tagging in the IOE paradigm may include tagging objects that are not typically near a power source such as in shipping mail drop locations warehousing the outdoors forest management agriculture in a user s personal life bicycle clothing jewelry personal storage for utility infrastructure locations above ground and under ground equipment and the like. For instance a mailbox may contain an RFID tag that a person through a personal RFID reader e.g. through their smart phone may attach instructions for a postman where the mail truck has a scanner that automatically reads the tag and displays the instructions to the postman in the truck. These instructions could then be forwarded when the mail truck reaches the post office. In another instance a personal application of RFID tags may enable a person to tag the contents of a storage box the contents of a collection of boxes in a similar way as in commercial warehouses where RF illumination of collection of boxes may display the contents of all the boxes. Utility companies may be able to tag utility poles aboveground components underground pipes and conduits and the like. Objects that are mobile and may be for long durations may also take advantage of RFID tagging such as in manufacturing equipment personnel and products biotech testing inventory and distribution transportation vehicles components new used part histories shipping packages tools inspection equipment and the like. RFID tags may also provide a secondary independent information source such as for security. For instance information about a mobile computing device may be stored on an embedded RFID tag that is not accessible to the computer system but available through an RFID reader to a security agent e.g. at a security checkpoint. In embodiments items that come through security at the airport or through another port or border may be tagged to aid in the customs review process such as by storing export and import forms on the tags for interrogation by a reader undertaking the review.

In embodiments high memory high data capacity enhanced function durable RFID tags as described throughout this disclosure may be used to enable elements of the Internet of Everything IOE . The IOE may involve the connection of a host of devices and other items that are enabled with the ability to collect and or process information such as operating information about devices and information collected from the environment of such devices including information from surrounding devices . This may include a wide range of devices not historically enabled with computing or networking capabilities such as home goods appliances furniture equipment agriculture and the like. As more and more devices are enabled richer and richer data is available about the environments in which items are located and the items themselves thereby potentially enriching information available to users companies enterprises and the like as well as enabling applications that use such information. However while many devices can be enabled by mere addition of communication capability e.g. devices already having power sources and a processor other items may lack regular power sources communication capability sensors or the like. In such cases an enhanced RFID tag may reside on an item and assist in connecting it to the IOE. The RFID tag may be available for interrogation such as by other IOE devices such as to indicate presence of an item in an environment to communicate stored data related to the item or the environment e.g. collected from the item from a user entering data related to the item from GPS or other sensors associated with the item or for other purposes for control of an actuator e.g. from commands received by the RFID tag and executed through the RFID tag s communication interface to external facilities and the like. Thus an RFID tag may provide a low cost easily implemented extension of the IOE to a much wider range of devices.

The enhanced functionality of the RFID tag described throughout this disclosure may enable the IOE to extend to where there are many types of objects that are not conventionally processor enabled but that could be tracked by other IOE devices that were present. For instance users connecting smart RFID tags to these objects may collect data about the objects e.g. current state status data collected through time contacts with other tagged objects without any help from people. Users may utilize this data information to track everything that is tagged greatly reducing waste loss and cost. The user may collect and view the data as the user needs it and know if the object needs replacing repairing recalling updating or any other type of attention determined from the data. An object could also be a living being such as a person an animal a plant and the like or any organic or inorganic substance such as the soil or landscape feature.

For example in the last century agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity through the introduction of industrial scale farming that utilizes large equipment synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in place of labor. Management of these large agricultural enterprises is essential in order to maximize yield while reducing the adverse environmental effects of modern practices. However farming is not a conventionally processor enabled environment and so these modern agricultural enterprises are limited in their ability to collect information for computerized management analysis and control of their processes. In an IOE realization extended into this agriculture environment everything can be RFID tagged such as equipment equipment components tools people animals plants soil buildings food produce collection containers appliances vehicles lighting worker clothing bulk storage distribution and collection of materials product and the like. Active RFID tags passive RFID tags smart tags simple tags relay tags and the like may be used in combination to create a self aggregating RFID interconnected smart RFID network across the agriculture enterprise. For instance in a plant product based agro enterprise e.g. grain fruit vegetables wine grapes and the like RFID tags may be attached to all of the equipment and personnel associated with the growing and harvesting of the crop. These RFID tags may be high memory passive RFID tags that for instance store data associated with where equipment is and has been e.g. through an integrated GPS device who has used the equipment e.g. because all the workers have mobile devices with RFID interrogators that active the RFID tag on the equipment when the person is within a certain proximity of the equipment how long it has been and how many uses the equipment has experienced since its last maintenance check e.g. because the person who maintains the equipment records the date time of maintenance on the tag and the like. In embodiments only a portion of the farm e.g. at and around facilities is actively covered by interrogators but a record of the location where equipment was last detected may be available in the system and when where the equipment transitioned out of the coverage area. Representative locations in the soil may be tagged e.g. collecting moisture levels pesticide levels fertilizer levels workers in the field may be monitored e.g. location time in the field hydration level representative sample plants may be monitored e.g. for growth and other health metrics and the like. The network of RFID tags throughout the farm may self aggregate data for use by the farmer if and when the farmer needs the data. This data may also be collected and stored for future use e.g. analysis for trends cost analysis environmental impact and the like . The high functionality and high memory capabilities of the RFID tags described throughout this disclosure enable the realization of this IOE agro enterprise solution better enabling the farmer to monitor the processes on the farm in a way that is similar to more processor based environments. RFID tags capable of withstanding harsh environments such as described herein enable this processor based monitoring capability to be utilized with objects on a farm that otherwise would be impractical.

Another example of an industry that is not normally associated with a processor enabled environment is the food industry and more specifically a restaurant. Imagine that objects used in serving customers in the restaurant e.g. plates flatware glasses chairs tables and the like are all RFID tagged and with some sensing capability suitable to their use. For instance the chair senses a pressure to determine whether someone is sitting in it. The plate senses temperature food coverage whether the flatware is stationary on the plate and the like. A glass may determine the extent of liquid in the glass. The table may be a local controller that collects the data from the table and forwards it periodically when accessed by a room interrogator an interrogator with the waiter waitress and the like. All this information may be collected and automatically analyzed to determine the state of the customers at each table and monitored at a location in the restaurant such as at the hostess station the manager s office in the kitchen and the like. In this way the management and wait staff may be able to monitor customer s dining experience even when the customer is out of sight. In addition the system may generate alerts to the wait staff such as that the customers appear to be finished eating that a glass needs to be refilled that customers are getting up without having paid the bill and the like. In addition to monitoring a hostess table or wait staff interrogator may interact with a customer s personal smart device and thus determine dining preferences allergic sensitivities and the like thus informing the wait staff before even approaching the table. One skilled in the art will recognize that many personal and business environments may benefit from the high functioning high memory rugged RFID tags as described herein for enabling the IOE realization of access self aggregation of data and resulting analysis and generation of analysis post products all available either in real time or from previously stored data.

In embodiments methods and systems for information RFID tagging facilities may comprise at least a first radio frequency RF tag and a second RF tag such as where the first RF tag and the second RF tag are adapted to operate using energy received from an RF signal e.g. a passive RFID tag where i at least one of the first RF tag and the second RF tag receives an RF signal from an RF device e.g. an RFID interrogator an active RFID tag another passive RFID and the like ii the first RF tag transmits data to the second RF tag and iii the second RF tag stores the transmitted data from the first RF tag in a memory on the second RF tag. In this way the first RF tag transfers data to the second RF tag after one or both RF tags are energized by the RF signal. For instance the first RF tag may operate using energy received from the RF device and the second RF tag may operate using energy received from an RF signal from the first RF tag. Alternately both the first RF tag and the second RF tag may receive the RF signal from the RF device. The data transferred from the first RF tag to the second RF tag may be transferred from the first RF tag to the RF device and then to the second RF tag transferred directly from the first RF tag to the second RF tag without being transmitted to the RF device and the like. The transfer of data from the first RF tag to the second RF tag may be executed without data being transmitted from the RF device to either the first RF tag or the second RF tag. The RF device may be a third RF tag powered by an external energy source such as where the external energy source is a battery a solar cell a fuel cell an electro mechanical energy transducer and the like.

The system may further comprise a third RF tag adapted to operate using energy received from an RF signal wherein the third RF tag is out of range of the RF signal from the RF device and the data transferred from the first RF tag to the second RF tag is subsequently relayed from the second RF tag to the third RF tag such as where the third RF tag operates using energy received from an RF signal from the second RF tag.

The system may further comprise a third RF tag adapted to operate using energy received from an RF signal wherein the first RF tag the second RF tag and the third RF tag are adapted to exchange data such as where the exchange of data is through a network protocol executed from only data transferred between the first RF tag the second RF tag and the third RF tag the exchange of data comprises transfer of data between the RF device and at least one of the first RF tag the second RF tag and the third RF tag and the like. The RF device may be a forth RF tag that is powered by an external energy source such as where the external energy source is a battery a solar cell a fuel cell an electro mechanical energy transducer and the like. The first RF tag and the second RF tag may be operable through effects of environmental changes due to an increase in mechanical vibration a change in temperature a change in humidity an increase in ionizing radiation due to mechanical shock and the like.
