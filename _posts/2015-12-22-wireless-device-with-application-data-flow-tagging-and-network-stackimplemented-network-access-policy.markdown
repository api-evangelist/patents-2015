title: Wireless device with application data flow tagging and network stack-implemented network access policy
abstract: A wireless end-user device has WWAN and WLAN modems. A memory stores a WWAN network access policy specific to data traffic usage and/or attempted usage by a first software application but not a second software application. An application service interface agent identifies network data traffic flows with respective tag information that associates a responsible one of a plurality of software applications with each identified network data traffic flow. One or more elements of a network stack then use the tag information to identify a network data traffic flow associated with the first software application, the one or more elements applying the network access policy to the identified network data traffic flow.

With the advent of mass market digital communications and content distribution many access networks such as wireless networks cable networks and DSL Digital Subscriber Line networks are pressed for user capacity with for example EVDO Evolution Data Optimized HSPA High Speed Packet Access LTE Long Term Evolution WiMax Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access and Wi Fi Wireless Fidelity wireless networks increasingly becoming user capacity constrained. Although wireless network capacity will increase with new higher capacity wireless radio access technologies such as MIMO Multiple Input Multiple Output and with more frequency spectrum being deployed in the future these capacity gains are likely to be less than what is required to meet growing digital networking demand.

Similarly although wire line access networks such as cable and DSL can have higher average capacity per user wire line user service consumption habits are trending toward very high bandwidth applications that can quickly consume the available capacity and degrade overall network service experience. Because some components of service provider costs go up with increasing bandwidth this trend will also negatively impact service provider profits.

The invention can be implemented in numerous ways including as a process an apparatus a system a composition of matter a computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium and or a processor such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored on and or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this specification these implementations or any other form that the invention may take may be referred to as techniques. In general the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention. Unless stated otherwise a component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. As used herein the term processor refers to one or more devices circuits and or processing cores configured to process data such as computer program instructions.

A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.

With the development and increasing proliferation of mass market digital communications and content distribution communication network capacity gains are being outpaced by growing digital networking demand. For example some industry experts project average wireless device usage of four devices per subscriber with a mixture of general purpose devices like smart phones and computers along with special purpose devices like music players electronic readers connected e.g. networked cameras and connected gaming devices. In addition wire line user service consumption habits are trending toward very high bandwidth applications that can quickly consume the available capacity and degrade overall network service experience if not efficiently managed. Because some components of service provider costs go up with increasing bandwidth this trend will also negatively impact service provider profits.

There is a need for a communication system and method that provides for flexible service plans and management of user network services to provide consumer choice of more refined service plan offerings and efficient management of network capacity.

Also it is becoming increasingly important to more deeply manage the level of services delivered to networked devices to provide cost effective services that match growing digital networking usage patterns. For example access providers can move away from only billing for basic access and move toward billing for higher level service delivery with example services including rich Internet access and email application based billing content distribution entertainment activities information or content subscription or gaming. In addition a growing number of new special purpose and general purpose networked devices are fueling demand for new service plans for example tailored to the new device usage models e.g. a special service plan for an e book reader device .

As network capabilities grow and new networked device offerings grow access network service providers will realize increasing value in opening up their networks to allow innovation and expanded offerings for network service consumers. However opening up the networks to provide efficient third party definition of alternative service and billing models requires more flexible service and billing policy management solutions. For example machine to machine applications such as telemetry surveillance shipment tracking and two way power control systems are example new applications that would require new offerings to make such available to network service customers. The need to customize service offerings for these new applications requires more efficient methods for defining testing and launching new services with more refined control of service functions and service costs. In some embodiments this means billing for different types of service elements such as total traffic content downloads application usage information or content subscription services people or asset tracking services real time machine to machine information or electronic commerce transactions.

In some embodiments network user capacity is increased and user service costs are reduced by managing and billing for service consumption in a more refined manner e.g. to satisfy network neutrality requirements . By managing service consumption in a user friendly manner the overall service capacity required to satisfy the user device needs can be tailored more closely to the needs of a given user thereby reducing user service costs and increasing service provider profits. For example managing service usage while maintaining user satisfaction includes service usage policy implementation and policy management to identify manage and bill for service usage categories such as total traffic consumption content downloads application usage information or content subscription services electronic commerce transactions people or asset tracking services or machine to machine networking services. As described herein service activity is used to refer to any service usage or traffic usage that can be associated with for example an application a network communication end point such as an address uniform resource locator URL or other identifier with which the device is communicating a traffic content type a transaction where content or other material information or goods are transacted purchased reserved ordered or exchanged a download upload or file transfer email text SMS IMS or other messaging activity or usage VOIP services video services a device usage event that generates a billing event service usage associated with a bill by account activity also referred to as billing by account as described herein device location device service usage patterns device user interface UI discovery patterns content usage patterns or other characterizations of device usage or other categories of user or device activity that can be identified monitored recorded reported controlled or processed in accordance with a set of verifiable service control policies. As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the embodiments described herein some embodiments identify various service activities for the purpose of decomposing overall service usage into finer sub categories of activities that can be verifiably monitored categorized cataloged reported controlled monetized and used for end user notification in a manner that results in superior optimization of the service capabilities for various levels of service cost or for various types of devices or groups. In some embodiments it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the terms service activity or service usage are associated with categorizing and possibly monitoring or controlling data traffic application usage communication with certain network end points or transactions and it will also be apparent that in some embodiments the term service activity is intended to include one or more of the broader aspects listed above. The shortened term service usage can be used interchangeably with service activity but neither term is intended in general to exclude any aspect of the other. In some cases where the terms service usage or service activity are used more specific descriptors such as traffic usage application usage website usage and other service usage examples are also used to provide more specific examples or focus in on a particular element of the more encompassing terms.

In some embodiments employing this level of service categorization and control is accomplished in a manner that satisfies user preferences. In some embodiments employing this level of service categorization and control is accomplished in a manner that also satisfies government rules or regulations regarding open access for example network neutrality requirements. In some embodiments service management solutions that also collect and or report user or device service usage or service activity behavior to determine how best to meet the user s simultaneous desires for service quality and lower service costs are disclosed. For example such monitoring and reporting are accomplished in a manner that includes approval by the user and in a manner that also protects the privacy of user information and service usage behavior or service activity history.

In some embodiments a system and method is disclosed for increasing network user capacity for wireless networks in the face of increasing service demand per user by providing for a greater number of base stations also sometimes referred to as access points base terminals terminal nodes or other well known acronyms to be more easily and or more cost effectively deployed. For example to simplify the process of deploying base stations the installation complexity and the network infrastructure required for the base station to obtain backhaul service to the various networks that users desire to connect with are reduced.

In some embodiments dense base station deployments are simplified by reducing the requirement to aggregate or concentrate the base station traffic through a specific dedicated core network infrastructure so that the base stations connect to the desired user networks through a more diverse set of local loop back bone and core routing options. This approach also reduces network infrastructure equipment installation and maintenance costs. In some embodiments this is accomplished by distributing the network traffic policy implementation and control away from the core network by providing for more control for service policy implementation and management on the end user device and in some embodiments in the end user device with respect to certain service policies and the network e.g. control plane servers with respect to other service policies. For example this approach facilitates connecting the base stations directly to the local loop Internet with a minimum of specific dedicated networking infrastructure.

In some embodiments service and transaction billing event capture and logging are distributed to the device. For example providing service and transaction billing event capture and logging at the device provides a greater capability to monitor classify and control deeper aspects of service usage or service activity at the device as compared to the relatively less capability for the same in the network infrastructure e.g. for certain traffic flows such as encrypted traffic flows . Furthermore billing at the device provides for very specialized with many different billing and service plans for different device and service usage or service activity scenario combinations without the problem of attempting to propagate and manage many different deep packet inspection DPI and traffic shaping profiles in the networking equipment infrastructure. For example service billing at the device can provide for more sophisticated more specialized and more scalable billing and service plans.

Another form of billing that needs improvement is electronic commerce transaction billing with device assisted central billing. Today most central billing and content distribution models require either centralized content distribution maintained by the central service provider or central billing authority or a centralized ecommerce website or portal traffic aggregation system controlled by the central service provider or central billing provider or both. In such systems content and transaction providers such as media providers application developers entertainment providers transaction website providers and others must adapt their mainstream electronic offering and commerce systems such as shopping experience websites to fit within the various proprietary customized infrastructure and content storage solutions for ecommerce markets such as BREW Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless from Qualcomm Inc. Symbian OS from Symbian Software Ltd and Apple iPhone 3G App Store from Apple Inc. . This approach requires a large amount of unnecessary custom interface development and stifles open market creativity for HTTP WAP or portal widget based shopping destinations and experiences. As disclosed below a superior approach includes device based transaction billing for an open ecosystem in which a central billing provider provides users and ecommerce transaction providers with a central billing solution and experience that does not require extensive custom development or ecommerce infrastructure interfacing.

In some embodiments products that incorporate device assisted service policy implementation network services and service profiles e.g. a service profile includes a set of one or more service policy settings for the device for a service on the network are disclosed as described below. For example aspects of the service policy e.g. a set of policies policy settings for the device for network services typically referring to lower level settings such as access control settings traffic control settings billing system settings user notification settings user privacy settings user preference settings authentication settings and admission control settings that are moved out of the core network and into the end user device include for example certain lower level service policy implementations service usage or service activity monitoring and reporting including for example privacy filtering customer resource management monitoring and reporting including for example privacy filtering adaptive service policy control service network access control services service network authentication services service network admission control services service billing transaction billing simplified service activation and sign up user service usage or service activity notification and service preference feedback and other service capabilities.

As discussed below product designs that move certain aspects of one or more of these service profile or service policy implementation elements into the device provide several advantageous solutions to the needs described above. For example benefits of certain embodiments include the ability to manage or bill for a richer and more varied set of network services better manage overall network capacity better manage end user access costs simplify user or new device service activation simplify development and deployment of new devices with new service plans e.g. service profile and billing costs information associated with that service profile equip central service providers with more effective open access networks for new third party solutions simplify the equipment and processes necessary to deploy wireless base stations and simplify the core networking equipment required to deploy certain access networks.

As discussed below there are two network types that are discussed a central provider network and a service provider network. The central provider network generally refers to the access network required to connect the device to other networks. The central provider network generally includes the physical layer the Media Access Control MAC and the various networking functions that can be implemented to perform authentication authorization and access control and to route traffic to a network that connects to the control plane servers as discussed below. The service provider network generally refers to the network that includes the control plane servers. In some embodiments a central provider network and a service provider network are the same and in some embodiments they are different. In some embodiments the owner or manager of the central provider network and the owner or manager of the service provider network are the same and in some embodiments they are different.

In some embodiments control of the device service policies is accomplished with a set of service control plane servers that reside in the access network or any network that can be reached by the device. This server based control plane architecture provides for a highly efficient means of enabling third party control of services and billing such as for central carrier open development programs or Mobile Virtual Network Operator MVNO relationships. As device processing and memory capacity expands moving to this distributed service policy processing architecture also becomes more efficient and economical. In some embodiments several aspects of user privacy and desired network neutrality are provided by enabling user control of certain aspects of device based service usage or service activity reporting traffic reporting service policy control and customer resource management CRM reporting.

In many access networks such as wireless access networks bandwidth capacity is a valuable resource in the face of the increasing popularity of devices applications and content types that consume more bandwidth. To maintain reasonable service profit margins a typical present service provider practice is to charge enough per user for access to make service plans profitable for the higher bandwidth users. However this is not an optimal situation for users who desire to pay less for lower bandwidth service usage or service activity scenarios.

Accordingly in some embodiments a range of service plan pricing can be enabled that also maintains service profitability for the service provider for example by providing a more refined set of management and control capabilities for service profiles. For example this approach generally leads to service management or traffic shaping where certain aspects of a service are controlled down based on service policies to lower levels of quality of service. Generally there are three problems that arise when these techniques are implemented. The first problem is maintaining user privacy preferences in the reporting of service usage or service activity required to set manage or verify service policy implementation. This problem is solved in a variety of ways by the embodiments described below with a combination of user notification preference feedback and approval for the level of traffic information the user is comfortable or approves and the ability to filter service usage or service activity in some embodiments specifically traffic usage or CRM reports so that only the level of information the user prefers to share is communicated. The second problem is satisfying network neutrality requirements in the way that traffic is shaped or services are managed. This problem is solved in a variety of ways as described in the embodiments described below by empowering the user to make the choices on how service usage service activity traffic usage or CRM data is managed down to control costs including embodiments on user notification and service policy preference feedback. By allowing the user to decide how they want to spend and manage their service allowance or resources a more neutral or completely neutral approach to network usage can be maintained by the service provider. The third problem is to help the user have an acceptable and enjoyable service experience for the lower cost plans that will result in much wider scale adoption of connected devices and applications but are more constrained on service activity usage or options or bandwidth or traffic usage. As lower cost service plans are offered including plans where the basic connection service may be free these service plans will require service provider cost controls to maintain profitability or preserve network capacity that result in lower limits on service usage or service activity. These lower service usage or service activity limit plans will result in more users who are likely run over service usage limits and either experience service shutdown or service cost overages unless they are provided with more capable means for assistance on how to use and control usage for the lower cost services. This problem is solved in a variety of ways with a rich collection of embodiments on user notification service usage and cost projection user notification policy feedback user service policy preference feedback and adaptive traffic shaping or service policy implementation. As described herein some embodiments allow a wide range of flexible and verifiable service plan and service profile implementations ranging from examples such as free ambient services that are perhaps sponsored by transaction revenues and or bill by account sponsored service partner revenues to intermediately priced plans for basic access services for mass market user devices or machine to machine communication devices to more expensive plans with very high levels of service usage or service activity limits or no limits at all. Several bill by account embodiments also provide for the cataloging of service usage that is not a direct benefit to end users but is needed for basic maintenance of the device control channels and access network connection so that the maintenance traffic service cost can be removed from the user billing or billed to non user accounts used to track or account for such service costs. These embodiments and others result in a service usage or service activity control capability that provides more attractive device and service alternatives to end users while maintaining profitability for service providers and their partners.

In some embodiments the above described various embodiments for device based service policy and or service profile communications control are implemented using network based service control for example for satisfying various network neutrality and or privacy requirements based on indication s received from the device e.g. user input provided using the device UI using the service processor and network based service control e.g. using a DPI service monitor or DPC policy implementation and or other network elements .

In some embodiments a virtual network overlay includes a device service processor a network service controller and a control plane communication link to manage various aspects of device based network service policy implementation. In some embodiments the virtual network overlay networking solution is applied to an existing hierarchical network e.g. for wireless services and in some embodiments is applied to simplify or flatten the network architecture as will be further described below. In some embodiments the large majority of the complex data path network processing required to implement the richer service management objectives of existing hierarchical networks e.g. for wireless services are moved into the device leaving less data path processing required in the edge network and in some cases even less in the core network. Because the control plane traffic between the service control servers and the device agents that implement service policies can be several orders of magnitude slower than the data plane traffic service control server network placement and back haul infrastructure is much less performance sensitive than the data plane network. In some embodiments as described further below this architecture can be overlaid onto all the important existing access network architectures used today. In some embodiments this architecture can be employed to greatly simplify core access network routing and data plane traffic forwarding and management. For example in the case of wireless networks the incorporation of device assisted service policy implementation architectures can result in base stations that directly connect to the Internet local loop and the data traffic does not need to be concentrated into a dedicated core network. This results for example in a large reduction in backhaul cost core network cost and maintenance cost. These cost savings can be re deployed to purchase and install more base stations with smaller cells which results in higher data capacity for the access network leading to better user experience more useful applications and lower service costs. This flattened networking architecture also results in latency reduction as fewer routes are needed to move traffic through the Internet. In some embodiments the present invention provides the necessary teaching to enable this powerful transformation of centralized network service architectures to a more distributed device based service architectures.

Device based billing can be compromised hacked and or spoofed in many different ways. Merely determining that billing reports are being received from the device that the device agent software is present and properly configured e.g. the billing agent is present and properly configured is insufficient and easily spoofed e.g. by spoofing the agent itself providing spoofed billing reports using a spoofed billing agent or providing spoofed agent configurations . Accordingly in some embodiments verifiable device assisted and or network based service policy implementation is provided. For example verifiable service usage and or service usage billing can be provided as described herein with respect to various embodiments.

While much of the below discussion and embodiments described below focus on paid service networks those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many of the embodiments also apply to other networks such as enterprise networks. For example the same device assisted network services that create access control services ambient activation services and other service profiles can be used by corporate IT managers to create a controlled cost service policy network for corporate mobile devices. As another example embodiments described below for providing end user service control can also allow a service provider to offer parental controls by providing parents with access to a website with a web page that controls the policy settings for the access control networking service for a child s device.

As shown the central provider access network is both 3G and 4G capable the devices can be either 3G 4G or multi mode 3G and 4G. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that in the more general case the network could be 2G 3G and 4G capable or the device could be 2G 3G and 4G capable with all or a subset of Global System for Mobile GSM General Packet Radio Service GPRS Code Division Multiple Access CDMA 1 High Speed Packet Access HSPA Evolution Data Optimized EVDO Long Term Evolution LTE and WiMax modem capability. If the devices are single mode then the 3G devices will be activated with a service profile applied to service processor that is consistent with the 3G network capacity and speed and the 4G devices will be activated with service profiles applied to service processor that are consistent with 4G network capacity and speed. In both cases the same service controller manages services for both sets of devices in accordance with some embodiments. If the devices are multimode then the service processor can be activated with a dual mode service profile capability in which the service profile for 3G offers a similar rich set of services as the service profile for 4G but with for example scaled back bandwidth. For example this approach is allows central providers to offer a richer set of service offerings with 3G and then migrate the same set of service offerings to 4G but with higher performance. In particular this approach allows 3G to 4G rich service migration to occur for example with the only change being the increased bandwidth settings in the service profiles that will be available in 4G at the same cost as 3G with lower service profile bandwidth settings.

In some embodiments if the devices are multimode a network selection policy implementation within service processor is provided or in some embodiments a network selection policy is driven by policy decisions made in service controller based on service availability reports received from service processor . The network selection policy allows the selection of the network that corresponds to the most desirable service profile to meet the user s service preferences. For example if the user specifies within the framework of the service notification and user preference feedback embodiments described below that maximum performance is the most important factor in selecting which access network to connect to then the best profile is likely to be the 4G network as 4G is typically faster except perhaps for example if the device is closer to the 3G base station so that there is a much stronger signal or if the 4G network is much more heavily loaded than the 3G network. On the other hand if the user preference set specifies cost as the most important factor then depending on the central provider service costs the 3G network may prove to be the most desirable service profile. This is a simple example and many other selection criteria are possible in the network selection embodiment as discussed further below.

In some embodiments if the base station data plane traffic is transmitted via the Internet as discussed above then IPDRs Internet Protocol Detail Records also sometimes and interchangeably referred to herein as Charging Data Records or CDRs which as used herein refer to any network measure of service usage or service activity for voice and or data traffic e.g. IPDRs can include a time stamp a device ID and various levels of network measures of service usage for the device associated with that device ID such as perhaps total traffic usage network destination time of day or device location are generated by and collected from the access network equipment. Depending on the specific network configuration as discussed herein for a WWAN network the IPDRs can be generated by one or more of the following base station RAN or transport gateways and AAA . In some access network embodiments the IPDRs are transmitted to equipment functions that aggregated the IPDRs for the purpose of service billing and other functions. Aggregation can occur in the AAA the transport gateways or other functions including the billing system . As discussed below it is often the case that the IPDRs is assumed to be obtained from the AAA server and or a service usage data store e.g. a real time service usage collection stored in a database or a delayed feed service usage collection stored in a database or some other network function. However this does not imply that the IPDRs may not be obtained from a variety of other network functions and in some embodiments the IPDRs are obtained from other network functions as disclosed herein. In some embodiments existing IPDR sources are utilized to obtain network based service usage measures for multiple purposes including but not limited to service policy or profile implementation verification triggering service verification error responds actions and service notification synchronization. Certain types of IPDRs can be based on or based in part on what are sometimes referred to as CDRs Charging Data Records which can track charges for voice and data usage or modifications of CDRs. Although the capability to monitor categorize catalog report and control service usage or service activity is in general higher on the device than it is in the network and as described herein device based service monitoring or control assistance is in some ways desirable as compared to network based implementations as described herein many embodiments take advantage of network based service monitoring or control to augment device assisted service monitoring or control and vice versa. For example even though many embodiments work very well with minimal IPDR service usage or service activity information that is already available in a network deeper levels of IPDR packet inspection information in general enable deeper levels of service monitoring or service control verification which can be desirable in some embodiments. As another example deeper levels of network capability to control service usage or service activity can provide for more sophisticated error handling in some embodiments for example providing for more options of the Switched Port Analyzer SPAN and network quarantine embodiments as described herein. As another example in some embodiments it is advantageous to take advantage of network based service monitoring or control for those service aspects the network is capable of supporting while using device assisted service monitoring or control for the service aspects advantageously implemented on the device.

In some embodiments where base station data plane traffic is backhauled and concentrated in a central provider core network then the IPDRs can originate in the base stations or a router or gateway in the central provider network and the IPDRs are collected at the AAA server and stored in the service usage data store . In some embodiments the central billing system collects the IPDRs from the AAA server for service billing accounting purposes. In some embodiments a central billing system collects the IPDRs directly from the initial IPDR source or some other aggregator. In some embodiments outside partners like MVNOs gain access to the IPDRs from the central billing system . As discussed below it is assumed that the IPDRs are obtained from the AAA server and it is understood that the source of the IPDRs is interchangeable in the embodiments.

In some embodiments the IPDR information is used by the service processor the service controller and or other network apparatus or device apparatus to implement service control verification is provided as described below. In some embodiments an IPDR feed e.g. also referred to as a charging data record CDR flows between network elements. For example an IPDR feed can flow from the RAN gateway e.g. SGSN BSC packet control or RNC and the transport gateway e.g. GGSN or PDSN . In other embodiments the IPDRs originate and flow from the base station or some other component element in the network. In some embodiments one or more of these IPDR feeds is transmitted to an IPDR aggregation function e.g. also referred to as a charging gateway . For example this aggregation function can be located in the AAA in the mobile wireless center and or in the home location register HLR or other similar function referred to by other common industry names in the transport gateway or in some other network element. This aggregation function collects the IPDR feeds into a database with an entry for each device . In some embodiments an intermediate aggregation function is provided that feeds a higher level aggregation function for example the transport gateway can receive IPDR feeds from the RAN gateway or the base station before sending them to another aggregation function. At some point in time e.g. at the end of a specified time period at the end of a device network connection session and or at a specified time of day the IPDR aggregation function sends summary information or detailed information of the IPDRs for a given device or group of devices to the billing system for billing and or reconciliation. In some embodiments in which the IPDR aggregation feed to the billing system is frequent enough for one or more of the IPDR information purposes described herein the IPDR feed for the service controller is derived from the aggregated feed either by having the billing system transmit it to the service controller or by copying it from the IPDR aggregation function.

In some embodiments the IPDR feed is obtained from the network function that is generating or aggregating the IPDR feed as described herein. In some embodiments the IPDR feed is copied from the aggregation function in a manner that does not interrupt the operation of the network. For example a switch based port analysis function can be used to copy the traffic to a traffic analysis or server element that filters out the IPDR traffic and records it to a data base that is then either pushed to the service controller or any other network element that uses IPDR information as described herein or is queried by the service controller or any other function that uses the IPDR information as described herein . In some embodiments if the aggregated IPDR information transmitted to the billing system is delayed from real time traffic usage events by an amount of time that is for example too long for desired operation or for any other reason that makes it less desirable to obtain the IPDR information from the same aggregated feed used for the billing system the IPDR information can be collected from one or more of the sources discussed above including for example from another aggregation point e.g. the feed to the charging gateway AAA server and or mobile wireless center HLR one or more of the gateways the base station and or another network element. In some embodiments the IPDR feeds from these or other network functions are copied to a database as described above which is either pushed or queried to get the information to the service controller or other network elements that request the IPDR information.

In some embodiments the service processor includes various components such as device agents that perform service policy implementation or management functions. In some embodiments these functions include service policy or implementation verification service policy implementation tamper prevention service allowance or denial application access control traffic control network access control services various network authentication services service control plane communication device heartbeat services service billing transaction billing simplified activation services and or other service implementations or service policy implementations. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the division in functionality between one device agent and another is a design choice that the functional lines can be re drawn in any technically feasible way that the product designers see fit and that the placing divisions on the naming and functional breakouts for device agents aids in understanding although in more complex embodiments for example it can make sense to the product designer to break out device agent functionality specifications in some other manner in order to manage development specification and testing complexity and workflow.

In some embodiments network control of the service policy settings and services as discussed above is accomplished with the service controller which in various embodiments includes one or more server functions. As with the service processor agent naming and functional break out it is understood that service controller server naming and functional breakout is also a design choice and is provided mainly to aid in the discussion. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the server names and functional breakouts do not imply that each name is an individual server and for example a single named function in the various embodiments can be implemented on multiple servers or multiple named functions in the various embodiments can be implemented on a single server.

As shown there are multiple open content transaction partner sites e.g. open content transaction servers which represent the websites or experience portals offered by content partners or ecommerce transaction partners of the service provider. For example transaction servers can provide an electronic commerce offering and transaction platform to the device. In some embodiments the central provider has ownership and management of the service controller so the central provider and the service provider are the same but as discussed below the service provider that uses the service controller to manage the device services by way of service processor is not always the same as the central provider who provides the access network services.

In some embodiments further distribution of central provider access networking functions such as access network AAA server DNS DHCP server and other functions are provided in the base stations . In some embodiments network based device service suspend resume control are also provided in the base stations or in some embodiments for hierarchical or overlay networks this function is provided by one or more of the following RAN gateways transport gateways AAA or some other network function . As shown the following are connected e.g. in network communication with the central provider network central provider billing system dedicated leased lines e.g. for other services providers central provider service controller a content management e.g. content switching content billing and content catching system central provider DNS DHCP server access network AAA server service usage data store and central provider mobile wireless center . These embodiments may be advantageous particularly for flat networks as that shown in that are provided by the present invention.

In some embodiments the base stations implement a firewall function via firewall and are placed directly onto the local loop Internet for backhaul. Voice traffic transport is provided with a secure protocol with Voice Over IP VOIP framing running over a secure IP session for example Virtual Private Network VPN IP Security IPSEC or another secure tunneling protocol. In some embodiments the VOIP channel employs another layer of application level security on the aggregated VOIP traffic trunk before it is placed on the secure IP transport layer. Base station control traffic and other central provider traffic can be provided in a number of ways with secure transport protocols running over Transmission Control Protocol TCP Internet Protocol IP or User Datagram Protocol UDP although TCP provides a more reliable delivery channel for control traffic that is not as sensitive to delay or jitter. One example embodiment for the control channel is a control link buffering framing encryption and secure transport protocol similar to that described below for the service control link between a device and the network. In some embodiments a service control heartbeat function is provided to the base stations similar to that implemented between the service controller and the service processor as described below. If the need to maintain a bandwidth efficient control plane channel between the base stations and the central provider base station control network is not as critical as it is in the case of access network connection to the device then there are many other approaches for implementing a secure control channel over the Internet including for example one or more of various packet encryption protocols running at or just below the application layer running TCP Transport Layer Security TLS and running IP level security or secure tunnels.

In some embodiments the device based services control plane traffic channel between the service processor and the service controller is implemented over the same control plane channel used for the flat base station control architecture or in some embodiments over the Internet. As discussed below it is assumed that the device bases services control plane channel for service processor to service controller communications is established through the Internet or through the access network using IP protocols as this is the more general case and applies to overlay network applications for various embodiments as well as applications where various embodiments are used to enable flattened access networks.

In some embodiments by enabling the device to verifiably implement a rich set of service features as described herein and by enabling the base station to connect directly to the Internet with a local firewall for device data traffic tunnel the voice to a voice network with VOIP and secure Internet protocols and control the base station over a secure control plane channel using base station control servers located in a central provider network base stations can be more efficiently provisioned and installed because for example the base station can accommodate a greater variety of local loop backhaul options. In such embodiments it is advantageous to perform certain basic network functions in the base station rather than the central provider network.

In some embodiments a basic device suspend resume function for allowing or disallowing the device Internet access is provided by the base stations or in some embodiments for hierarchical or overlay networks in some embodiments this function is provided by one or more of the following RAN gateways transport gateways AAA or some other network function . This functionality as will be discussed below is important for certain embodiments involving taking action to resolve for example service policy verification errors. In some embodiments this function is performed at the base station e.g. base stations thereby eliminating the need for a more complex networking equipment hierarchy and traffic concentration required to perform the suspend resume function deeper in the network. Access network base stations control media access and are therefore designed with awareness of which device identification number a given traffic packet group of packets packet flow voice connection or other traffic flow originates from and terminates to. In some embodiments the suspend resume function is implemented in the base station by placing an access control function in the traffic path of each device traffic flow. The suspend resume function can be used by various network elements and in the context of the present embodiment can be used by the service controller e.g. in some embodiments access control integrity server of service controller or other service controller elements to suspend and resume device service based on the assessment of the service policy implementation verification status as described below.

In some embodiments at least a basic traffic monitoring or service monitoring function is performed at the base station e.g. base stations similar to the service history records or IPDRs collected deeper in the network in more conventional hierarchical access network infrastructure architectures. For example the service or traffic monitoring history records are advantageous for tracking device network service usage or service activity behavior and for certain verification methods for device based service policy implementation or higher device based services as discussed below. In some embodiments a traffic monitoring function is provided in the base station in which the traffic for each device is at least counted for total traffic usage and recorded. In some embodiments traffic inspection beyond simply counting total traffic usage is provided. For example the base station traffic monitor can record and report IP addresses or include a DNS lookup function to report IP addresses or IP addresses and associated Uniform Resource Locators URLs . Another example allows the base station to attach location data to the IPDR to provide device location data in the records. In some embodiments traffic inspection includes recording deeper levels of traffic or service monitoring.

In some embodiments device traffic associated with service verification conditions indicating service usage is out of policy or profile limits or allowances is routed to a quarantine network rather than or as an initial alternative to a suspending service. For example the advantages for this approach and a more detailed description of the quarantine network are discussed below. In some embodiments the quarantine network capability is provided for in which rather than simply suspending device traffic completely from the network as described above the base station includes a firewall function e.g. firewall that is capable of passing device access traffic with the quarantine network destinations and blocking device access to all other destinations. In some embodiments when it is discovered that service verification conditions indicate that service usage is out of policy or profile limits or allowances then one or more of the following actions are taken the user is notified of the overage condition the user is required to acknowledge the overage condition the user account is billed for the overage condition and the device is flagged for further analysis by a network device analysis function or a network manager.

In some embodiments network complexity is reduced using the device without moving completely to a flat base station network as described above. Device participation in the core network services implementation provides for numerous measures for simplifying or improving network architecture functionality or performance. For example two approaches are discussed below ranging from a simple overlay of the service processor onto devices and the service controller in a conventional hierarchical access network as illustrated in to a completely flat network as illustrated in . Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the disclosed embodiments provided herein can be combined with the above embodiments and other embodiments involving flat network base stations to provide several advantages including for example richer service capability less access network complexity lower access network expenses more flexible base station deployments or less complex or less expensive base station back haul provisioning and service costs.

In most of the discussion that follows the network based service history records and the network based suspend resume functionality used in certain embodiments involving service implementation verification are assumed to be derived from the device service history as shown in central provider network element and the AAA server central provider network element and in some embodiments working in conjunction with other central provider network elements. It is understood that these functions provided by the network can be rearranged to be provided by other networking equipment including the base station as discussed above. It is also understood that the network based device traffic monitoring recording and reporting to the device service history element can be accomplished at the base stations. Furthermore it is understood that while the AAA server is assumed to provide the suspend resume functionality quarantine network routing or limited network access called for in some embodiments the AAA server can be a management device in which the actual implementation of the traffic suspend resume firewall routing re direction forwarding or traffic limiting mechanisms discussed in certain embodiments can be implemented in the base stations as discussed above or in another network element.

In some embodiments an activation server or other activation sequencing apparatus provides for provisioning as described below of the devices and or network elements in the central provider network so that for example the device credentials can be recognized for activation and or service by the network. In some embodiments the activation server provides activation functions as described below so that for example the devices can be recognized by the network gain access to the network be provided with a service profile be associated with a service account and or be associated with a service plan. As shown in the activation server is connected to the central provider core network . In this configuration the activation server acts as an over the network or over the air activation function. In some embodiments the activation server or variations of the activation server as described below is connected to apparatus in the manufacturing or distribution channel or over the Internet or as part of the service controller to service provisioning or activation functions. In some embodiments the activation server is connected to the central provider core network . In some embodiments the activation server is connected to other network extensions such as an MVNO network or the Internet if for example the routers in the service gateways or base stations have the capability to direct traffic from devices that are not fully activated or provisioned to an Internet destination or if the service processor is used for such direction. In some embodiments the activation server is included in the service controller .

By showing two service controllers one connected to e.g. in network communication with the MVNO network and one connected to the central provider network also illustrates that some embodiments allow two entities on the same access network to each use the service controller and service processor to control different devices and offer different or similar services. As described below the unique secure communication link pairing that exists between the two ends of the service control link and as shown in ensure that the two service controllers can only control the devices associated with the correct service provider service profiles.

In some embodiments the devices are again assumed to be multimode 3G and 4G devices e.g. the mobile devices are assumed to have a dual mode wireless modem that will operate on both a 4G network for example LTE and a 3G network for example HSPA or EVDO with the devices being billed for service by Central Provider 1 being for example EVDO and LTE capable and the devices being billed for service by Central Provider 2 being for example HSPA and LTE capable. For example the devices can roam using the 4G LTE network of the roaming central provider when neither the 3G nor 4G networks are available with the home central provider. As similarly discussed above with respect to the above described roaming embodiments the service processors and service controllers are capable of providing similar services on the 4G roaming network and the 3G home network as on the 4G home network however the varying costs and available network capacity and speed differences of 3G home 4G roaming and 4G home may also encourage the use of different such as three different service profiles to allow for the most effective and efficient selection and control of services based on the current network.

As shown in as discussed elsewhere service usage data store is a functional descriptor for a network level service usage information collection and reporting function located in one or more of the networking equipment boxes attached to one or more of the sub networks in the figure e.g. RAN transport and or core networks . As shown in service usage is shown as an isolated function connected to the central provider core network and the intention of this depiction is to facilitate all the possible embodiments for locating the service usage function. In some UMTS network embodiments the service usage function is located or partially located in the GGSN gateway or gateway cluster . In some embodiments service usage functionality is located or partially located in the SGSN gateway or gateway cluster . In some embodiments service usage functionality is located or partially located in the equipment cluster that includes the AAA and or the mobile wireless center . In some embodiments service usage functionality is located or partially located in the base station base station controller and or base station aggregator collectively referred to as base station in and many other figures described herein. In some embodiments service usage functionality is located or partially located in a networking component in the transport network a networking component in the core network the billing system and or in another network component or function. This discussion on the possible locations for the network based service usage history logging and reporting function can be easily generalized to all the other figures described herein by one of ordinary skill in the art e.g. RAN Gateway and or Transport Gateway and this background will be assumed even if not directly stated in all discussion above and below.

In some embodiments a central provider provides open development services to MVNO Master Value Added Reseller MVAR and or Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM partners. In some embodiments all three service providers central provider service provider MVNO 1 service provider and MVNO 2 service provider have service control and billing control of their own respective devices through the unique pairing of the service processors and service controllers . For example MVNO 1 and MVNO 2 can each have open development billing agreements with the central provider and each can own their respective billing systems . As shown in MVNO 1 core network is in communication with the central provider core network via the Internet and MVNO 2 core network is in communication with the central provider core network via an alternate landline LL VPN connection . In some embodiments the two MVNOs each offer completely different devices and or services and the devices and or services also differ significantly from those offered by the central provider and the service profiles are adapted as required to service the different devices and respective service offerings. In addition the central billing system allows all three service provider user populations to access ecommerce experiences from transaction provider partners operating transaction servers to choose central provider billing options that combine their third party transaction bills on their service provider bill and each subscriber population can experience a service provider specified look and feel that is unique to the respective service provider even though the different user populations are interfacing to the same transaction servers and the transaction partners do not need to require significant custom development to provide the unique central billing and unique consistent user experience look and feel.

In some embodiments a central provider offers open network device and service developer services using one service controller server e.g. a service controller server farm and allows the open development partners to lease server time and server tools to build their own service profiles. The central provider also provides service billing on behalf of services to the open development partners. For example this reduces costs associated with setting up an MVNO network for the open development partners and does not require the partners to give up significant control or flexibility in device and or service control.

In some embodiments the central provider can offer improved service capabilities using a wireless access network. As shown the base stations do not connect directly to the Internet and instead the base stations connect to the wireless access network. However as in various previous embodiments the service processor still connects through the secure control plane link to service controller . In some embodiments the data plane traffic is backhauled as shown across the various network routers and gateways as is the control plane traffic and the IPDRs are obtained from the access network AAA server .

Referring to the Wi Fi connection can be replaced with a femto cell and the Wi Fi modem shown in can be replaced with a femto cell modem base station side functionality . In some embodiments the service processor is provided on the femto cell to control subscriber access in a verifiable manner as similarly described herein with respect to various embodiments e.g. the Wi Fi related embodiments . For example the femto cell service provider e.g. the entity that owns the spectrum the femto cell is using can operate the femto cell as a local access mechanism for the home subscriber or other who purchased or installed the femto cell and then also use it to provide pay for service or additional free services with controlled access and or traffic control and or service control and or billing control performed locally or in combination with network equipment as described herein. In some embodiments the WWAN devices being used at home or work with the femto cell include a portion of the service processor functionality. For example this allows the service provider for femto cells to provide service and monetize service in a controlled way even though the femto cell is not connected to the service provider network the way conventional base stations are connected to the service provider network but is connected through the Internet . For example the secure heartbeat function can be extended to include data traffic so that it is encrypted and secured along with the control plane traffic. The decision of whether or not to admit a device onto the femto cell can be made through the service processor connection to the service controller and subsequent look up of the credentials for the device and the associated service plan and service profile that is then programmed into the service processor on the femto cell and or the device itself. The femto cell can also offer a landing page to devices through the service processor so that devices that do not belong to the network can gain access to the network by signing up over the femto cell. For example the intermediate device embodiments for Wi Fi on one end and WWAN on the other can be accomplished by using the Wi Fi connection in the cell phone in AP mode so that it becomes the intermediate device. The service processor on the cell phone can then act in the same manner as described for the intermediate device as described herein.

As shown the service processor can reside on a number of different types of devices that work on 3G or 4G wireless DSL or DOCSIS and the service controller is capable of controlling each of these types of devices with a consistent service experience for example using different service profiles service capabilities and service profile cost options depending on which network the device is connected to and or other criteria. For example a download of a High Definition HD movie can be allowed when the service controller is managing service profile policies for a service processor residing on a DOCSIS device e.g. a computer or laptop connected to a cable modem but not when the same service controller is managing service profile policies for a service processor residing on a 3G device e.g. a smart phone connected to a mobile 3G network .

As will now be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the above description of the present invention can be provided across any access network and a set of service profiles can be defined in a variety of ways including for example to user preference feedback access network performance access network cost access network central provider partnership status with the service provider central provider and roaming deals and costs. For example as discussed below various embodiments allow for users to have superior service experiences based on the ability to control certain of their service settings and service providers can also more efficiently deploy a greater variety of services service plans to users.

In some embodiments the service processor and the service controller provide an overlay for existing networks without significantly changing the billing system gateways routers or other network components elements and also provide verifiable service monitoring to control services and or service usage costs without involving for example a service provider or MVNO e.g. for smart phone devices and or laptops or netbooks or any other network accessible device with an unlimited data plan or any other service plan . For example applications that are deployed by device owners or service subscribers e.g. an IT manager and do not involve a service provider include roaming services provided as an after market product without carrier service provider involvement. In this example device activity is recorded by the service processor and transmitted to the service controller e.g. the IT manager controls the service controller . In another example a third party after market product is provided in which the service controller is hosted by the third party and the device management entity e.g. the IT manager or parents of the device user for parental controls uses a secure Virtual Service Provider VSP website to control the devices that belong to that management entity s device partition e.g. VSP partitions and techniques are described below with respect to . The VSP secure website techniques described herein can also be applied to service provider owned servers with device partitions for the purpose of controlling for example Deep Packet Inspection DPI controllers e.g. DPC policy implementation as shown in to provide similar or substantially equivalent service usage control capabilities using network based service control techniques as similarly described in detail below with respect to e.g. IT manager VSP control of a group partition and or MVNO VSP control of a group partition .

In some embodiments all or a portion of the service processor functions disclosed herein are implemented in software. In some embodiments all or a portion of the service processor functions are implemented in hardware. In some embodiments all or substantially all of the service processor functionality as discussed herein is implemented and stored in software that can be performed on e.g. executed by various components in device . illustrates an embodiment in which service processor is stored in device memory as shown in memory and or non volatile memory or a combination of both. In some embodiments it is advantageous to store or implement certain portions or all of service processor in protected or secure memory so that other undesired programs and or unauthorized users have difficulty accessing the functions or software in service processor . In some embodiments service processor at least in part is implemented in and or stored on secure non volatile memory e.g. non volatile memory can be secure non volatile memory that is not accessible without pass keys and or other security mechanisms. In some embodiments the ability to load at least a portion of service processor software into protected non volatile memory also requires a secure key and or signature and or requires that the service processor software components being loaded into non volatile memory are also securely encrypted and appropriately signed by an authority that is trusted by a secure software downloader function such as service downloader as discussed below and as shown in . In some embodiments a secure software download embodiment also uses a secure non volatile memory. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that all memory can be on chip off chip on board and or off board.

User interface devices such as keyboards display screens touch screens specialized buttons or switches speakers and or other user interface devices provide various interfaces for allowing one or more users to use the device .

In some embodiments the service processor is implemented on a modem processor e.g. WWAN modem or WWAN Wi Fi modem and the service processor can be installed and or executed in protected and or secure memory or processor hardware on the modem. The modem memory can be made robust to hacking or tampering and in some embodiments is only accessible from a secure network management channel or secure device management port and not by most end users. In some embodiments a portion of the service processor is implemented on a modem processor e.g. WWAN modem hardware or software and a portion of the service processor is implemented on another device processor . For example the device service monitor agent and one or more service usage measurement points see discussion associated with can be implemented on a modem processor and other service processor elements can be implemented in the main device operating system processor .

In some embodiments certain portions of the service processor that deal with application layer service monitoring or traffic flow identification e.g. tagging or traffic flow shaping as disclosed elsewhere are implemented on a main processor and other portions of the service processor are implemented on a modem processor e.g. WWAN modem .

In some embodiments the WWAN modem is a wide area access technology modem such as 2G 2.5G 3G or 4G. As discussed above and below the connection to the WWAN modem can be a connection internal to device for example a USB GPIO AMBA or other bus or can be a connection that extends external to the device such as for example a USB Ethernet Wi Fi Bluetooth or other LAN or PAN connection. Three example embodiments in which the bus is internal to the device are as follows a PCIe modem card running over USB or PCIe a GPIO connection running from a processor chipset to a modem chipset inside a mobile device or a Wi Fi connection running from a Wi Fi modem inside of device to an intermediate modem or networking device combination that forwards the access network traffic between the access network connection and the device via the Wi Fi connection. In some embodiments in addition to the service processor being implemented on the WWAN modem either internal or external to the device similarly service processor can be implemented on a wire line modem such as DSL Cable or fiber another wireless LAN or PAN modem such as Wi Fi Zigbee Bluetooth modem White Space or some other modem connected internal to device or external to device via a LAN or PAN extension of internal or external communications bus structure .

In some embodiments a complete turn key reference design product for the device modem one or more of combined with a built in service processor possibly with a well defined and documented application interface and a well defined and documented service processor developers kit SPDK provides for a powerful product embodiment for the purpose of achieving mass market distribution and usage for the modem with service processor and associated service controller features. For example embodiments that include the WWAN modem possibly in combination with one or more additional modems including Wi Fi modem bluetooth modem USB modem and Ethernet modem can be combined with a pre tested or pre certified integrated embodiment of the service processor possibly in combination with a well defined API for writing software applications that interface to reside on or communicate with this turn key modem embodiment. As disclosed herein the advantageous capabilities of the service processor possibly in conjunction with the service controller to assist in monitoring control billing and verification for services is made more available for device manufacturers in such a form because the manufacturers do not need to spend as much time and resources to develop a custom modem only for a subset of devices that the turn key modem can be used to support. In some embodiments the service processor as discussed herein can be configured to provide device assisted service monitoring control billing and or verification across not just when connected to the WWAN network via the WWAN modem but also when connected to the other networks corresponding to the other access modems included in the turn key combined module plus service processor or SPDK or chipset plus service processor design.

The module form factor can be well documented to simplify integration into various device designs. The SPDK embodiments can be designed to contain one or more of the following hardware integration and use documentation software integration documentation software programming documentation application interface documentation service controller documentation overall testing guidelines and overall use guidelines. In some embodiments the modem module can be integrated with the service processor functionality as a combined chipset firmware and or software product with other SPDK features very similar to those listed above. The service controller programming guide for these turn key embodiments can also be documented for the SPDK service processor software turn key module with service processor or integrated chipset with service processor . Accordingly these embodiments provide various solutions to simplify the OEM task of integrating developing testing and shipping device products or integrated networking device products with any of the device assisted service monitoring control billing or verification capabilities disclosed herein.

As discussed above various embodiments include product designs in which the service processor resides on device volatile or non volatile memory see the device application processor or CPU see the wireless access modem see or any other modem or another I O device see . While these are just a few of the example service processor placement embodiments these embodiments show that the placement of where the software or hardware for implementing the service processor can reside in the device is very flexible and can be implemented in a myriad of places and ways depending on the device and or other technical design choices.

As similarly discussed above with respect to various embodiments include product designs including the SOC chipset in which the service processor resides on internal volatile or non volatile memory of the SOC chipset see the device application processor or CPU and or sub processor the modems and or or any other modem another I O device and or external memory see and or any combinations thereof . While these are just a few of the example service processor placement embodiments these embodiments show that the placement of where the software or hardware for implementing the service processor can reside in the SOC chipset and or the external memory of the device is very flexible and can be implemented in a myriad of places and ways depending on the device and or other technical design choices.

The above discussion with respect to illustrating various internal hardware embodiments for device applies equally to this partitioning of device functionality or any other partitioning of how the components in device are configured whether they are all separate components some of the components are combined into a single chipset but there are still multiple chipsets or all of the components are combined into a chipset. For example illustrating various internal hardware embodiments for device show several access modem components including the wire line modem wireless wide area network WWAN modem USB modem Wi Fi modem Bluetooth modem and Ethernet modem . In some embodiments wire line modem is a DSL or cable modem such as DOCSIS or some other modem with a hard connection such as fiber. In some embodiments as discussed above and below connection to the wire line or wireless access network is accomplished through an extension of the internal or external communications bus structure . For example such an extension is accomplished using one or the other modems such as Wi Fi modem or Ethernet modem connecting to a local area network that in turn connects to the access network via a device that bridges the local area network to the access network. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that when discussing device connection to any access network the connection can be via a direct connection to the network such as a 3G or 4G WWAN modem connection to a 3G or 4G WWAN network or can be a connection to the access network through an intermediate connection such as a Wi Fi modem connection to a modem or networking device combination that has a Wi Fi LAN connection and a 3G or 4G network access network connection. Another example of an extended modem connection embodiment includes a Wi Fi modem device connection to a modem or networking device combination that includes a Wi Fi LAN connection and a DOCSIS or DSL network access connection. Other examples of such combinations will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.

In some embodiments device includes a 3G and or 4G network access connection in combination with the Wi Fi LAN connection to the device . For example the intermediate device or networking device combination can be a device that simply translates the Wi Fi data to the WWAN access network without implementing any portion of the service processor as shown in . In some embodiments an intermediate device or networking device combination includes a more sophisticated implementation including a networking stack and some embodiments a processor as is the case for example if the intermediate networking device or networking device combination includes a router function in which case the service processor can be implemented in part or entirely on the intermediate modem or networking device combination. The intermediate modem or networking device combination can also be a multi user device in which more than one user is gaining access to the 3G or 4G access network via the Wi Fi LAN connection. In the case of such a multi user network the access network connection can include several managed service links using multiple instantiations of service processor each instantiation for example being implemented in whole or in part on device with the intermediate modem or networking device combination only providing the translation services from the Wi Fi LAN to the WWAN access network.

Referring now to in some embodiments the service processors are implemented in part or in whole on the intermediate modem or networking device combination. In the case where the service processor is implemented in part or in whole on the intermediate modem or networking device combination the service processor can be implemented for each device or each user in the network so that there are multiple managed service provider accounts all gaining access through the same intermediate modem or networking device combination. In some embodiments the functions of service processor are implemented on an aggregate account that includes the WWAN access network traffic for all of the users or devices connected to the Wi Fi LAN serviced by the intermediate modem or networking device combination. In some embodiments the central provider can also provide an aggregated account service plan such as a family plan a corporate user group plan and or an instant hotspot plan. In the case where there is one account for the intermediate modem or networking device combination the intermediate modem or networking device combination can implement a local division of services to one or more devices or users in which the services are controlled or managed by the intermediate modem or networking device combination or the device but the management is not subject to service provider control and is auxiliary to the service management or service policy implementation performed by service processors . In some embodiments another service model can also be supported in which there is an aggregate service provider plan associated with one intermediate modem or networking device combination or a group of intermediate modems or networking device combinations but where each user or device still has its own service plan that is a sub plan under the aggregate plan so that each user or device has independent service policy implementation with a unique instantiation of service processor rather than aggregate service policy implementation across multiple users in the group with a single instantiation of service processor .

As shown in in some embodiments device includes a Wi Fi modem a Wi Fi modem combined with a 3G and or 4G WWAN modem on intermediate modem or networking device combination and the intermediate modem or networking device combination forwards WWAN access network traffic to and from device via the Wi Fi link. For example the service processor can be implemented in its entirety on device and the service provider account can be associated exclusively with one device. This is an embodiment associated with one or more of discussed below in which the modem bus represents the Wi Fi LAN connection via the Wi Fi modem . Similarly as shown in such an implementation can be provided using a different access modem and access network such as a 2G and or 3G WWAN DSL wire line cable DOCSIS wire line or fiber wire line configuration in place of the 3G and or 4G access network connection to the intermediate modem or networking device combination . In addition various other embodiments similarly use DSL as shown in USB Ethernet Bluetooth or another LAN or point to point connection from device to the intermediate modem or networking device combination .

In some embodiments a portion of the service processor is implemented on the device such as the application interface agent and other supporting agents see and another portion of the service provider is implemented on the intermediate modem or networking device combination such as policy implementation agent or possibly modem firewall as well as other agents see . This is an embodiment associated with one or more of discussed below in which the modem bus in the figure represents the Wi Fi LAN connection via the Wi Fi modem . In this example the service provider can still offer individual service plans associated exclusively with one device or can offer an aggregate plan in which the portion of the service processor located on the intermediate modem or networking device combination aggregates service plans into one WWAN connection but each individual device has a unique service interface via the application interface agents and associated agents located on device . Similarly such an implementation can be provided using a different access modem and access network for example a 2G and or 3G WWAN DSL wire line cable DOCSIS wire line or fiber wire line configuration in place of the 3G and or 4G access network connection to the intermediate modem or networking device combination . In addition various other embodiments similarly use USB Ethernet Bluetooth or another LAN or point to point connection from device to the intermediate modem or networking device combination .

In some embodiments all of the service processor is implemented on the intermediate modem or networking device combination and the aggregate device or user traffic demand from the LAN port is serviced through one service provider service plan account. This is an embodiment associated with in which as discussed below the modem bus in the figure represents the Wi Fi LAN connection via the Wi Fi modem . Similarly such an implementation can be provided using a different access modem and access network for example a 2G and or 3G WWAN DSL wire line cable DOCSIS wire line or fiber wire line configuration in place of the 3G and or 4G access network connection to the intermediate modem or networking device combination . In addition various other embodiments similarly use USB Ethernet Bluetooth or another LAN or point to point connection from device to the intermediate modem or networking device combination .

In some embodiments the device uses the on board WWAN modem when it is outside of Wi Fi LAN coverage area for one or more trusted access networks for the device and when the device comes within range of a Wi Fi network associated with a intermediate modem or networking device combination connected to a trusted wire line access network the device can switch to the Wi Fi link service to connect service processor to the trusted wire line access network. In some embodiments the decision to switch to the Wi Fi LAN associated with a trusted wire line access network can be made automatically by the device based on the policy implementation rules settings for the modem selection and control and or the policy control agent can be made by the user or can be made by the service controller see . In addition various other embodiments similarly use USB Ethernet Bluetooth or another LAN or point to point connection from device to the intermediate modem or networking device combination .

As described herein various embodiments provide many service policy implementation options that can enhance the service provider control of the service experience and cost or enhance the user control of the service experience and cost by providing a verifiable or compromise resistant solutions to manage service policy implementation on the intermediate modem or networking device combination for one or both of the WWAN or wire line access networks when the WWAN access network is active or when the WWAN access network is inactive. The level of service control user preference feedback and service policy implementation verification or compromise resistance enabled by these embodiments improves the offered back up services and primary wire line services. One of ordinary skill in the art will also now appreciate that any number of wire line and or wireless network access connections can be supported by the various embodiments as described herein with any number of device architectures and architectures for intermediate modem or networking device combinations bridging the device to the access network of choice. Accordingly various embodiments provide a verifiable managed service architecture design and implementation for any number of single access and or multi access networks in which the service account can be consistent across multiple networks and the service policies can be changed from network to network as deemed appropriate by the service provider with service notification service cost control and privacy preference inputs from the user.

In various embodiments the verification embodiments discussed herein for service policy implementation verification or service policy implementation compromise protection can be applied. In some embodiments rather than attaching a service provider service plan account to a single device it is attached to e.g. associated with a user. For example when the user logs onto an access network with a service controller controlled by a service provider regardless of what device the user logs onto with the user s service plan profile can be automatically looked up in the central billing system and dynamically loaded e.g. downloaded onto the device from the service controller e.g. a service profile provided on demand based on the user s identity . In some embodiments in addition to dynamically loading the user s service policy implementation and control settings one or more of the user s preferences including notification service control traffic monitor reporting privacy and Customer Relationship Management CRM reporting privacy are also dynamically loaded. For example this allows the user to have the same service settings performance and experience regardless of the device the user is logged into and using on the network. In addition as discussed herein in the various embodiments that call for roaming from one type of access network to another the user service plan profile that includes all of the above in addition to the service plan profile changes that take effect between different types of access network can be used on any device and on any network providing the user with a verifiable or compromise resistant consistent service experience regardless of network or device.

Many of the embodiments described herein refer to a user using device . It is understood that there are also applications for these various embodiments that do not involve user interfaces. Examples of such applications include equipment apparatus or devices for automation telemetry sensors security or surveillance appliance control remote machine to machine data connections certain remote access configurations two way power metering or control asset tracking people tracking or other applications in which a human user interface is not required for device .

Various embodiments of the device described above include other I O devices . In some embodiments these other devices include other modems other special purpose hardware components and or other I O devices or drivers or modems to connect to other I O devices. In some embodiments these other devices include a Subscriber Identity Module SIM or Universal Subscriber Identity Module USIM device. In some embodiments it is advantageous to implement some or all of the service processor functions on an embodiment of device that includes a SIM and or a USIM. In some embodiments the other I O devices include a hardware device designed to implement a portion or all of the service processor functions. For example this is advantageous in cases in which the original device was not manufactured with the service processor in cases in which dedicated hardware is desired to improve one or more aspects of service processor performance allowing users for example to have the same service settings performance and experience regardless of the device the user is using on the network by using such a SIM and or USIM e.g. or implemented as a type of dongle and or in cases in which a separate component is desired to assist in compromise protection for one or more aspects of service processor .

As discussed above some embodiments described herein provide for billing of certain access services. In some embodiments various applications do not require or involve billing of certain services. For example applications like enterprise IT Information Technology group management of enterprise workforce access policy implementation or access cost control or access security policy privacy control parental control network quality of service control or enhancement private network services free access services publicly funded access services flat rate no options service and other services or other examples that will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art do not require billing functionality but benefit from many other aspects of various embodiments.

As shown service processor includes a service control device link . For example as device based service control techniques involving supervision across a network become more sophisticated it becomes increasingly important to have an efficient and flexible control plane communication link between the device agents and the network elements communicating with controlling monitoring or verifying service policy. In some embodiments the service control device link provides the device side of a system for transmission and reception of service agent to from network element functions. In some embodiments the traffic efficiency of this link is enhanced by buffering and framing multiple agent messages in the transmissions. In some embodiments the traffic efficiency is further improved by controlling the transmission frequency or linking the transmission frequency to the rate of service usage or traffic usage. In some embodiments one or more levels of security or encryption are used to make the link robust to discovery eavesdropping or compromise. In some embodiments the service control device link also provides the communications link and heartbeat timing for the agent heartbeat function. As discussed below various embodiments disclosed herein for the service control device link provide an efficient and secure solution for transmitting and receiving service policy implementation control monitoring and verification information with other network elements.

In some embodiments the service control device link agent messages are transmitted asynchronously as they are generated by one or more of the service agents. In some embodiments the service control device link performs collection or buffering of agent messages between transmissions. In some embodiments the service control device link determines when to transmit based potentially on several parameters including for example one or more of the following parameters periodic timer trigger waiting until a certain amount of service usage or traffic usage has occurred responding to a service controller message responding to a service controller request initiated by one or more agents initiated by a verification error condition initiated by some other error or status condition. In some embodiments once a transmission trigger has occurred the service control device link assembles all buffered agent communications and frames the communications.

In some embodiments the transmission trigger is controlled by waiting for an amount of service usage such as waiting until a certain amount of data traffic has passed which reduces the control plane communication channel traffic usage to a fraction of the data plane traffic. For example this approach preserves network capacity and reduces service cost even in traffic scenarios in which data traffic is light.

In some embodiments the transmission trigger is based on waiting for an amount of service usage and also including a minimum transmission rate that triggers a transmission according to one or more of the following parameters a maximum time between transmissions clock to keep the service processor in communication with the service controller when little or no service usage is occurring a polling request of some kind from the service controller a response to a service controller heartbeat a transmission generated by a service verification error event or a transmission generated by some other asynchronous event with time critical service processor or service controller messaging needs such as a transaction or service billing event or a user request. For example service control plane traffic down is reduced to a relatively inexpensive and capacity conserving trickle when device data traffic is not significant. At the same time this approach also provides an effective flow of real time or near real time service control plane traffic that is both cost and capacity efficient because the service control plane traffic is a relatively small percentage of the data plane traffic when data plane traffic usage is heavy. For example when data plane traffic usage is heavy is generally the time when close monitoring of service policy implementation verification or compromise prevention can be particularly important and by keeping the control plane overhead to a fraction of data plane traffic close monitoring and control of services are maintained at a reasonable cost in terms of percentage of both bandwidth used and network capacity. In some embodiments the service usage or service activity trigger occurs based on some other measure than traffic usage such as a number of messages transacted one or more billing events number of files downloaded number of applications run or time that an application has been running usage of one or more specified applications GPS coordinate changes roaming event an event related to another network connection to the device and or other service related measures.

In some embodiments the service control device link provides for securing signing encrypting or otherwise protecting communications before sending. For example the service control device link can send to the transport layer or directly to the link layer for transmission. In some embodiments the communications are further secured with transport layer encryption such as TCP TLS Transport Control Protocol Transport Layer Security or another secure transport layer protocol. In some embodiments communications are encrypted at the link layer such as IPSEC Internet Protocol Security various VPN Virtual Private Network services other forms of IP layer encryption and or another link layer encryption technique.

In some embodiments the service control link includes the above discussed agent heartbeat function in which the agents provide certain required reports to the service controller for the purpose of service policy implementation verification e.g. verification related reports on certain aspects of the service processor or for other purposes. For example such agent heartbeat messages can be in the open clear unencrypted or encrypted signed and or otherwise secured. In some embodiments these messages include one or more of the below described types of messages an agent information message an agent check in message and or agent cross check message.

In some embodiments an agent information message is included in the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message which includes for example any information the agent needs to communicate to the service controller as part of the operation of the service policy implementation system. For example an agent response to a service controller challenge as described below can be included in the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message.

In some embodiments an agent check in message is included in an agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message which includes for example a transmission of a unique agent identifier secure unique identifier and or hashed encrypted and signed message beginning with some shared secret or state variable for the hash. For example an agent self check can be included in the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message which includes reporting on agent configuration agent operation agent code status agent communication log agent error flags and or other agent associated information potentially hashed encrypted signed or otherwise secured in the message e.g. using a shared secret unique to that agent .

In some embodiments an agent cross check message is included in the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message which includes for example reports on the status configuration operation observations communication log or other aspects of another agent. For example agent environment reports can be included in the agent heartbeat service policy implementation verification message which includes for example reports on certain aspects of the service processor operating environment such as software presence e.g. installation status of certain operating system and or application software and or components thereof observed communication with agents or communication attempts memory accesses or access attempts network accesses or access attempts software downloads or attempted downloads software removal or download blocking service policy implementation verification or compromise event error conditions with respect to the operating environment for the service processor and or other messages regarding the verification or possibility of compromise associated with the service processor operating environment or agents.

In some embodiments the agent heartbeat function also provides regular updates for information important to user service notification services. For example the network based elements can provide regular synchronization updates for the device based service usage or service activity counters in which service usage or service activity measures available from one or more network service history elements is transmitted to the device . This allows the service usage counter errors between the device service counter and the counters used for central billing to be minimized. A common service usage or service activity measure is total traffic usage measured to date within a time frame over which a service limit is applicable. Other service usage or service activity measures can also be tracked and reconciled in a similar manner.

In some embodiments for the heartbeat function the service controller verifies that the scheduled agent reports are being received and that the reports are within expected parameters. In some embodiments the access control integrity server issues signed challenge response sequences to the policy implementation agent . For example the challenges can be asynchronous issued when an event or error condition occurs issued on a schedule or issued when a certain amount of data has passed. This approach for example provides a second layer of service policy implementation verification that strengthens the service usage or service activity measurement verification. For example a challenge response can be sent over the heartbeat link for the purpose of verifying device agent integrity. Various challenge response related verification embodiments are described below.

In some embodiments the challenge response heartbeat message can include sending any kind of command or query secure or transmitted in the open receiving a response from the agent and then evaluating the response to determine if the response is within a range of parameters expected for a correctly configured agent an agent that is operating properly an agent that is not partially compromised or an agent that is not entirely compromised. In some embodiments the agent is only required to respond with a simple acknowledgement of the challenge. In some embodiments the agent is required to respond with a message or piece of information that is known by the agent. In some embodiments the agent is required to respond with a message or piece of information that is difficult for the agent to respond correctly with if it were to be partially or entirely compromised. In some embodiments the agent is required to respond back with information regarding the operation or configuration of the agent that is difficult for the agent to respond properly with if the agent is not properly configured not operating properly is partially compromised or is entirely compromised. In some embodiments the first agent is required to respond back with information regarding the operation configuration status or behavior of a second agent that is difficult for the first or second agent to respond properly with if the first or second agent is not properly configured not operating properly is partially compromised or is entirely compromised. In some embodiments the agent is required to respond with a response that includes a shared secret. In some embodiments the agent is required to respond with information regarding the presence configuration operating characteristics or other information regarding other programs in the operating environment of the agent. In some embodiments the agent is required to respond with hashed information to be portions of code or a code sample e.g. the code portion or code sample can be specified by the service controller .

In some embodiments the information the agent responds with is a response to a signed or encrypted message from the service controller in which the agent must know how to decode the encrypted controller message in order to respond correctly or it would be difficult for the agent to respond properly if the agent is not configured properly is not operating within appropriate limits is partially compromised or is entirely compromised. In some embodiments the agent signs or encrypts information in such a manner that it is difficult to respond correctly when the message is decoded by the service controller unless the agent is configured properly is operating within appropriate limits is not partially compromised and is not entirely compromised. In some embodiments the agent is required to respond with a signed or encrypted hash of information that is difficult for the agent to generate unless the agent is configured properly is operating within appropriate limits is not partially compromised and is not entirely compromised. For example the hashed information can be local device configuration information portions of code or all of the code and or the code portion to be used in the response can be specified by the service controller. In another example the hashed information the agent responds with can include a shared secret and or the hashed information can be information regarding the presence configuration operating characteristics or other information regarding other programs in the operating environment of the agent.

Accordingly as described above the agent heartbeat function provides an important and efficient system in some embodiments for verifying the service policy implementation or protecting against compromise events. For example there are many other functions the agent heartbeat service can perform and some are described herein while others will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art given the principles design background and various embodiments provided herein.

In some embodiments the service control device link facilitates another important function which is the download of new service processor software elements revisions of service processor software elements and or dynamic refreshes of service processor software elements. There are many embodiments for such operations. In some embodiments the software is received as a single file over the service control device link . For example the file can have encryption or signed encryption beyond any provided by the communication link protocol itself. In some embodiments the software files are segmented into smaller packets that are communicated in multiple messages sent over the service control device link . In some embodiments once the file s are received or the segmented portions of the file s are received they are communicated to a service downloader for file aggregation and installation which in some embodiments is performed after further measures to verify the service processor software are completed. In some embodiments the files are sent using other delivery means such a direct TCP socket connection to the service downloader or some other software installer which can also involve secure transport and additional levels of encryption.

As shown in an agent communication bus represents a functional description for providing communication for the various service processor agents and functions. In some embodiments as represented in the functional diagram illustrated in the architecture of the bus is generally multipoint to multipoint so that any agent can communicate with any other agent the service controller or in some cases other components of the device such user interface and or modem components. As described below the architecture can also be point to point for certain agents or communication transactions or point to multipoint within the agent framework so that all agent communication can be concentrated or secured or controlled or restricted or logged or reported. In some embodiments the agent communication bus is secured signed encrypted hidden partitioned and or otherwise protected from unauthorized monitoring or usage.

In some embodiments as described below there are multiple layers of security applied to the agent communication bus communication protocols such as including one or more of the following point to point message exchange encryption using one or more keys that are partially shared or shared within the service processor agent group and or the service controller point to point message exchange that using one or more keys that are private to the two endpoints of the communication a bus level message exchange encryption that can be in place of or in addition to other encryption or security or using one or more keys that are partially shared or shared within the service processor agent group and or the service controller a set of secure messages that can only be decoded or observed by the agents they are intended for a set of secure messages that allow communication between certain agents or service processor functions and entities outside of the service processor operating environment. In some embodiments and as described herein the service control device link is assumed to be equivalent to an agent for communication purposes and in the case of the service control device link the communication is not restricted to the agent communication bus but also extends to the service control communications link . In some embodiments the system has the capability to replace keys or signatures on occasion or on a regular basis to further secure against monitoring eavesdropping or compromise of the agent communication system.

For example various forms of message encryption and security framework techniques can be applied to encrypt and or secure the agent communication bus including one or more of the following agent bus encryption using shared key for all agents provided and updated by the secure server agent bus encryption using point to point keys in which the secure server informs the bus and agents of keys and updates as appropriate agent level encryption using agent to agent shared keys in which the secure server informs agents of the key and updates the key as appropriate agent level encryption using agent to agent point to point key in which the secure server informs agent of the point to point keys that are required and updates the keys as appropriate agent level access authorization which only allows access to the agents that are on the secure authorization list and in which the list is provided by the secure server and signatures are provided by the secure server UI messages are only analyzed and passed in which the UI cannot have access to configuration information and cannot issue challenges agent level heartbeat encryption which can be point to point or shared key for that agent control link level heartbeat encryption TLS Transport Layer Security communication protocols server level heartbeat encryption which can be point to point or shared key for that secure server and or the access control integrity agent or heartbeat function can become point to multipoint secure communications hubs.

In some embodiments of the agent communication bus the design of the agent communication bus depends on the nature of the design embodiments for the agents and or other functions. For example if the agents are implemented largely or entirely in software then the agent communication bus can be implemented as an inter process software communication bus. In some embodiments such an inter process software communication bus is a variant of D bus e.g. a message bus system for inter process software communication that for example helps applications agents to talk to one another or another inter process communication protocol or system running a session bus in which all communications over the session bus can be secured signed encrypted or otherwise protected. For example the session bus can be further protected by storing all software e.g. software components applications and or agents in secure memory storing all software in encrypted form in secure memory and or executing all software and communications within a secure execution environment hardware environment and or protected memory space. In some embodiments if the agents and other functions are designed with a mixture of software and hardware or primarily with hardware then the implementation of the bus design will vary and the principles and embodiments described herein will enable one of ordinary skill in the art to design the specifics of the agent communication bus to meet a particular set of product and desired functional requirements.

As shown in an access control integrity agent collects device information on service policy service usage or service activity agent configuration and agent behavior. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent also cross checks this information to identify integrity breaches in the service policy implementation and control system. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent also initiates action when a service policy violation or a system integrity breach is suspected. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent also performs asynchronous or periodic agent checks to verify presence configuration or proper operation of other agents. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent also performs challenge response sequence verification of other agents.

In some embodiments the access control integrity agent obtains service usage or service activity measures from a service monitor agent and compares one or more first service usage measurement points against one or more second service usage measurement points to verify service policy implementation. For example as shown in if the service usage at measurement point IV is inconsistent with measurement point III which for example can indicate for example that an unauthorized or unmonitored usage of the access modem e.g. modems or is taking place. As another example as also shown in if one or more aspects of upstream traffic usage measurement point II which represents the upstream demand side of policy implementation agent is inconsistent with upstream traffic measurement point III which represents delivered traffic from the policy implementation agent then the policy implementation agent may not be operating properly. As another example as also shown in if service measurement point III and IV indicate that firewall agent is passing traffic to URLs or IP addresses that are in the blocked policy settings then a verification error condition can be set for the access control policy. As another example if the policy controller reports traffic usage statistics that are inconsistent with traffic usage policy settings then a traffic usage policy verification error may have occurred. As another example if the service usage counter synchronization information received from the service controller the device service history and or the central billing system is compared to the service usage history reported by the service monitor agent and the two are found to be outside of acceptable tolerance limits for the comparison then there may be a verification error in the service monitor service usage or service activity accounting. There are numerous additional embodiments of such comparisons as described herein and others as will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art given the principles design background and specific examples and various embodiments described herein.

In some embodiments device service policy implementations are verified by comparing various service usage measures used at the device against expected service usage or service activity behavior given the policies e.g. one or more service policy settings service profile or service profile settings for network based access services and or service plan or service plan for network based access services . For example verification is performed based on a measure of total data passed at the device as compared to the service policy for total data usage. For example verification is performed based on a measure of data passed in a period of time at the device as compared to the service policy for data passed in such a period of time. For example verification is performed based on a monitoring of communications from the device based on IP addresses as compared to the policy for permissible IP addresses. For example verification is performed based on a measure of total data passed from the device per IP address as compared to the policy for total data usage per IP address. Other examples include such actual versus policy comparisons based on other measures at from to the device such as location downloads email accessed URLs and or any other data location application time or other criteria or any combination of criteria that can be measured for comparing with various policy settings and or restrictions.

In some embodiments the access control integrity agent monitors agent self check reports to verify that agents are properly configured. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent reports the agent self check reports to the service controller . In some embodiments the access control integrity agent performs a role in service usage test transmission reception and or monitoring with the usage test being tailored to test monitoring or control aspects for any subset of service activities. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent performs a role in billing test event generation and or monitoring. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent checks and reports the result of service usage monitoring verification tests service usage billing verification tests and or transaction billing verification tests.

In some embodiments the access control integrity agent receives agent access attempt reports to determine if unauthorized agent access attempts are occurring. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent acts as a central secure communications hub for agent to agent or service controller to agent communication. For example the access control integrity agent can be used so that no other software or function can access other agents or so that agents cannot access other agents except through the secure point to multipoint communications hub. In some embodiments this approach further enhances compromise resistance for the agents. In some embodiments some or all of the agent communications including agent to agent or service controller to agent communications and possibly including unauthorized attempts to communication with agents are monitored and logged so that a trace log of some or all agent communications can be maintained. For example the agent communication trace log can be summarized and or compressed for transmission efficiency or regularly reported such as through the heartbeat function or the agent communication trace log can be reported only when the service controller requests the agent communication trace log or when there is a verification error event. As similarly described above the partitioning of agent functions and server functions is provided herein mainly to aid in disclosing various embodiments but those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other partitioning of agent functions and server functions can be used based on different design choices. For example the central agent communication hub function is performed in some embodiments by the access control integrity agent however in other embodiments that function is performed by the service control device link . For example when the central agent communication hub function is located in the service control device link then architecturally the device link can be a single point to multipoint secure communications hub for all agent to agent and service controller to agent communications. In some embodiments this approach has certain advantages from a service policy implementation verification or compromise protection robustness perspective or has certain advantages from a communications protocol efficiency perspective or simply can be more efficient to implement. It should be noted that in other embodiments described herein the agent to agent and agent to service controller communications can be multipoint to multipoint with each agent having the capability to communicate with other agents or the service controller this communication can be secure signed or otherwise encrypted or protected in some embodiments and in the open clear in others. Also as discussed in some embodiments the agents can maintain their own communications or attempted communications log which can then be reported to the service controller . In some embodiments the agents implement restrictions on which device components or agents the agents will conduct communications with so that only agents that need to communicate with one another can do so.

In some embodiments the service control device link reviews local billing event history and compares such history to billing event reports to verify that a billing agent is functioning properly e.g. has not been tampered with or compromised . In some embodiments the service control device link cross checks service usage or service activity against billing event reports from the billing agent to verify that billing events are properly billing for service usage or service activity. In some embodiments the service control device link cross checks transaction billing process or records against transaction billing reports to ensure that transaction billing events are being properly reported by the billing agent . In some embodiments the service control device link determines if one or more agents have been compromised and if so initiates a dynamic agent download process to replace any such potentially compromised agent.

In some embodiments the access control integrity agent verifies that the service usage counter is reporting service usage or service cost to the user within acceptable limits of accuracy when compared to the service usage reports obtained from the service monitor agent the service controller the device service history and or the central billing system . In some embodiments the access control integrity agent checks to verify that user privacy filter preferences are being properly implemented. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent checks to verify that the user is properly receiving UI warnings regarding service usage or roaming service usage conditions.

In some embodiments the access control integrity agent checks to verify that the device is not beginning service usage until it has been authenticated authorized or granted access to the network. In some embodiments access control integrity agent checks with the service controller or the billing system to verify that the user or device has a valid service standing and should be admitted to access on the network.

In some embodiments an Activation Tracking Service ATS is provided in which the service monitoring function e.g. performed by the service monitor agent and or some other agent component or combinations thereof on the device is used in part to determine which access networks are being connected to and to record and or report this information. In some embodiments the ATS is only enabled if the device user approves reporting of access networks connected to by the user device. In some embodiments the ATS is protected from tampering. For example the ATS can be hardened that is to be more tamper resistant using a variety of techniques including any of the following the ATS can be located e.g. stored in secure memory and or secure hardware the ATS can be implemented in the system BIOS the access modem and or another hard to access portion of the device a second device agent can confirm the presence of the ATS with a report to a network based server the second agent or the network server can initiate a reinstall of the ATS if it is missing or is found to be operating improperly and or the ATS can be placed in a secure area of the OS so that it cannot be removed or if removed must be replaced for proper device operation to resume. A variety of other tamper resistance techniques can also be used to protect the ATS from tampering as similarly described herein with respect to other device based functions software components agents.

In some embodiments the access control integrity agent verifies that ATS software or hardware is present properly configured or operating properly. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent reviews network connection or activity history and compares such to ATS reports to verify activation tracking service reports are occurring properly. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent replaces ATS software if it has been removed. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent monitors access or compromise of ATS software to determine if it may have been compromised. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent reports status of ATS functions.

In some embodiments the access control integrity agent scans the local agent execution environment to determine if there are unauthorized accesses to service processor functions settings or code. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent monitors software loading activity protected memory access or communication with service processor agents to detect unauthorized changes to service processor software or configuration. For example the access control integrity agent can have a local database of potentially malicious elements and compare entries in the database against the elements detected locally. As another example the access control integrity agent can communicate a list of some or all of the elements detected locally to the service controller to augment or take the place of the database comparison function that may be performed locally. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent detects new software downloads installs or invocations and immediately issues an error flag report when potentially malicious software is downloaded installed or invoked. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent scans the local software loading and invocation activity along with a log of other software runtime events and regularly reports this trace so that when an error or compromise event occurs the trace preceding the event can be analyzed to determine the offending software or activity trace that took place to cause the compromise or error. Once the software or activity that caused the compromise is known it can be entered into a refreshed version of the database that the device and other devices use to detect potentially malicious pre cursor conditions. Examples of such pre cursor events include software invocations software downloads attempts to uninstall certain agent and or application software components or OS components a sequence of memory I O events a sequence of software access events a sequence of network address or URL communications or downloads or a sequence of access modem I O activity. In various other embodiments of the access control integrity agent the agent performs or securely communicates with other software hardware device network components that perform other well known signature behavior blocking and or intrusion detection identification detection and or blocking techniques based on the presence of potentially unwanted and or potentially or known malicious software and or intrusion attempts by unauthorized software and or unauthorized users using for example real time on access periodic and or on demand scanning.

In some embodiments the access control integrity agent detects or blocks potentially compromising behavior of other software programs users attempting unauthorized behavior in the service processor operating environment. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent detects software that is being loaded that has the same or similar name identification memory location or function as one or more of the service processor agents. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent blocks operation or loading of such software. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent detects or blocks unauthorized access of service processor protected memory. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent verifies configuration and operation of secure service downloader . In some embodiments the access control integrity agent monitors network and I O activity to detect potentially compromising events such as a program that is downloaded from known detrimental or potentially suspect IP addresses or URLs or a program that accesses certain IP addresses or URLs. In some embodiments the access control integrity agent scans of the service processor operating environment are recorded and kept for a period of time and if a service policy verification error occurs then the scans immediately prior to the error are analyzed or reported to the service controller for analysis. In some embodiments such scans are regularly reported to the service controller without the presence of service policy verification error conditions.

In some embodiments the access control integrity agent requests a dynamic agent download of certain critical service processor functions including in some cases the access control integrity agent on a periodic basis or on a periodic basis when network access activity is not required or minimal.

In some embodiments the access control integrity agent determines if a threshold has been surpassed for a max usage trigger for ambient and or other services that should not be using significant amounts of data e.g. based on the type of device and or service profile settings .

In some embodiments the access control integrity agent determines if verification errors exist in one or more of the verification process embodiments and in some embodiments reports errors immediately or in the next agent heartbeat to the service controller . In some embodiments any number of results from the above checks monitoring activities reports or tests are reported to the service controller .

In some embodiments a policy control agent receives policy instructions from the service controller and or the user via the billing agent and adapts device service policy settings e.g. instantaneous device service policy settings in one or more of the following agents components a policy implementation agent the modem firewall and or an application interface agent . As shown in the modem firewall is in communication with a modem driver which is in communication with the agent communication bus and access network . As shown with respect to access network a central billing server an access network AAA server and device server history are also provided. As shown the Internet is accessible via the access network and firewall from which device can then access various Internet services .

In some embodiments the policy control agent adapts low level service policy rules settings to perform one or more of the following objectives achieve higher level service usage or cost objectives reduce network control channel capacity drain reduce network control plane server processing bandwidth and or provide a higher level of user privacy or network neutrality while satisfying service usage or service activity objectives. In some embodiments the policy control agent performs a policy control function to adapt instantaneous service policies to achieve a service usage objective. In some embodiments the policy control agent receives service usage information from the service monitor agent to evaluate service usage history as compared to service usage goals. In some embodiments the policy control agent uses service monitor service usage or service activity history and various possible algorithm embodiments to create an estimate of the future projected service usage. In some embodiments the policy control agent uses a future projection of service usage to determine what service usage or service activity controls need to be changed to maintain service usage goals. In some embodiments the policy control agent uses service usage history to perform a service usage or service activity analysis to determine the distribution of service usage across service usage elements within categories such as usage by application usage by URL usage by address usage by content type usage by time of day usage by access network usage by location and or any other categories for classifying service usage. In some embodiments the policy control agent uses the service usage distribution analysis to determine which service usage elements or service activities are creating the largest service usage e.g. if e mail social networking or multimedia online video application categories are creating the largest service usage .

In some embodiments the policy control agent is instructed for example by the user through billing agent to perform a service control algorithm such as traffic shaping or download management to manage service usage or service activities to assist the user in controlling service costs. As a basic example of such a traffic shaping algorithm the traffic shaping algorithm can simply reduce traffic speed for all applications and traffic types successively until the service usage projections are within service usage limits for the present service billing period. To illustrate an algorithm that is more sophisticated and provides the advantage of leaving many service usage elements or service activities unaffected while only controlling down usage on the most aggressive service usage elements or service activities the traffic shaping algorithm can identify the highest traffic usage applications and or websites and successively reduce traffic speed just for the highest usage applications and or websites until the service usage projections are within service usage limits for the present service billing period. These examples thereby reduce network traffic for the user in accordance with the user s service usage objectives while maintaining overall satisfactory service usage experience for the user in a manner that satisfies various net neutrality requirements e.g. the traffic throttling of certain applications websites based on user input in which categories based on service usage history are selected by the user for example a certain application may be using 90 of the aggregate traffic usage . For example adaptive throttling algorithms can be used to throttle application traffic that the user requests throttling such as recursively throttling of the specified application traffic e.g. to denigrate the traffic usage associated with that application and thereby reduce overall service data usage .

In some embodiments the policy control agent adjusts service policy based on time of day. In some embodiments the policy control agent obtains a measure of network availability and adjusts traffic shaping policy settings based on available network capacity. In some embodiments the policy control agent automatically and dynamically adjusts service policy based on one or more other service policy settings the service profile and or the service plan associated with the device and or user of the device.

In some embodiments various lower level service policy implementation embodiments are combined with a higher level set of service policy supervision functions to provide device assisted verifiable network access control authentication and authorization services.

In some embodiments device based access control services are extended and combined with other policy design techniques to create a simplified device activation process and connected user experience referred to herein as ambient activation. In some embodiments ambient access generally refers to an initial service access in which such service access is in some manner limited such as where service options are significantly limited e.g. low bandwidth network browsing and or access to a specific transactional service limited bandwidth limited duration access before which a service plan must be purchased to maintain service or have service suspended disabled or throttled or otherwise limited reduced downgraded and or any other time based quality based scope of service limited initial access for the network enabled device. In some embodiments ambient activation is provided by setting access control to a fixed destination e.g. providing access to a portal such as a web page e.g. for a hotspot or WAP Wireless Application Protocol page that provides the user with service plan options for obtaining a service plan for the user desired access such as the service plan options for data usage service types time period for access e.g. a day pass a week pass or some other duration and costs of service plan s . In some embodiments service data usage of the ambient activated device is verified using IPDRs e.g. using the device ID device number for the device to determine if the device has been used in a manner that is out of plan for the service plan associated with the device such as based on the amount of data usage exceeding the service plan s service data usage limits out of plan unauthorized access to certain websites and or out of plan unauthorized transactions . In some embodiments service data usage of the ambient activated device is verified by setting a maximum data rate in the policy control agent and if when it is determined that the device is exceeding a specified data rate data usage then the service data usage is throttled accordingly. In some embodiments various other verification approaches are used for ambient activation purposes.

In some embodiments the policy control agent and or another agent component of the service processor and or service controller performs a service control algorithm to assist in managing overall network capacity or application QoS Quality of Service . In some embodiments the policy control agent and or another agent component of the service processor performs an access network selection algorithm to determine which access network to connect to based on connection options and determined strengths of available wireless networks network preference or security settings service usage cost based network preferences and or any other criteria.

Accordingly as described herein with respect to various embodiments service usage or service activities can be measured by various agents at various different measurement points which provides for a more robust verification and integrity of device based services communication. For example it is much less likely and more difficult to compromise and or spoof multiple agents. As described herein various verification and integrity checks are performed including for example network based service usage measurement e.g. using IPDRs heartbeat monitoring agent based heartbeat e.g. challenge response queries agent operating environment protection monitoring agent communications agent cross checks comparing device based and network based measures e.g. service usage measures dynamic software agent download and or any combination of these and various other verification integrity check techniques described herein and or apparent from the various embodiments described herein.

In some embodiments the device is capable of connecting to more than one network and device service policies are potentially changed based on which network the device is connected to at the time. In some embodiments the network control plane servers detect a network connection change and initiate the service policy implementation established for the second network. In some embodiments the device based adaptive policy control agent as described herein e.g. policy control agent detects network connection changes and implements the service policies established for the second network.

In some embodiments when more than one access network is available the network is chosen based on which network is most preferred according to a network preference list or according to which network that optimizes a network cost function. For example the network preference list can be pre established by the service provide and or the user and or later modified adjusted by either the service provider and or the user. For example the cost function can be based on determining a minimum service cost maximum network performance whether or not the user or device has access to the network maximizing service provider connection benefit reducing connections to alternative paid service providers and or any other cost related criteria for network selection purposes.

In some embodiments the device detects when one or more preferred networks are not available implements a network selection function or intercepts other network selection functions and offers a connection to the available service network that is highest on a preference list. For example the preference list can be set by the service provider the user and or the service subscriber. In some embodiments a notification is provided to the device user when the device is not connected to a network e.g. indicating in a pop up bubble or other UI based display a notification such as You are not connected to the network. Click here to learn more get free trial use a session sign up for service . In some embodiments the notification content can be determined based on usage service patterns locally stored and or programmable logic on the device and or a server e.g. device reports that user is not connected and WWAN is available . Decisions on what bubble to present when may be in pre stored logic on device.

In some embodiments service policies are automatically adapted based on the network to which device is connected. For example the device can be a cellular communication based device connected to a macrocell a microcell a picocell or a femtocell e.g. femto cells generally provide a low power small area cellular network used for example in homes or offices which for example can be used as an alternative to Wi Fi access . In some embodiments service monitoring agent and or billing agent modify service usage counting and or billing based on whether the device is connected to a macrocell microcell picocell or femtocell. In some embodiments the device recognizes which type of network it is currently connecting to e.g. looking up in a local or network table for the current base station connected to and or the information is broadcast to the device upon the connection with the base station that is whether it is a macrocell microcell picocell or femtocell. In other embodiments the device does not recognize which type of network it is currently connected to but reports its current base station and the network uses a network lookup function to determine which type of network it is connected to. In some embodiments the device adjusts the billing based on the type of network it is connected to or in other embodiments the device calculates an offset to such billing based on the type of network it is connected to and or in other embodiments the device records such service usage associated with the type of network it is connected to and the network billing can adjust the billing accordingly. For example the billing can be lower for service data usage over a femtocell versus a macrocell. In some embodiments service policies are adjusted based on the type of network that the device is connected such as billing user notification data usage bandwidth throttling time of day who owns the cellular network connection e.g. user s home femtocell or user s work femtocell or a commercial business s femtocell like a coffee shop or any other common area like an airport and or any other service policy can be different for a femtocell connection or for any other type of connection such as a macrocell microcell or picocell . In some embodiments the local service usage counter is adjusted based on the type of network and or based on the time of day of such service activity that the device is connected such as billing user notification data usage bandwidth and or any other service policy can be different for a femtocell connection or for any other type of connection such as a macrocell microcell or picocell . In some embodiments the service policies and or billing policies are adjusted based on network congestion.

In some embodiments if adaptive service policy control is not required then the policy control agent can simply pass instantaneous service policy settings directly to the agents responsible for implementing instantaneous service policies.

In some embodiments a policy implementation agent implements traffic shaping and QoS policy rules for the device . In some embodiments the policy implementation agent provides a firewall function. In some embodiments the policy implementation agent performs traffic inspection and characterization. In some embodiments packet inspection is aided by literal or virtual application layer tagging while in other embodiments packet inspection is performed entirely in by the policy implementation agent . In some embodiments the policy implementation agent accepts service policy implementation settings from the policy control agent or directly from the service controller . More detail on specific embodiments for the policy implementation agent is provided below with respect to the figures associated with communication stack and communication protocol flow.

In some embodiments the burst size buffer delay acknowledgement delay and drop rate used in upstream and downstream traffic shaping are optimized with the goal of reducing access network traffic overhead and excess capacity usage that can result from mismatches in traffic transmission parameters with the access network MAC and PHY or from excess network level packet delivery protocol re transmissions. In some embodiments the application interface agent is used to literally tag or virtually tag application layer traffic so that the policy implementation agent s has the necessary information to implement selected traffic shaping solutions. As shown in the application interface agent is in communication with various applications including a TCP application an IP application and a voice application .

In some embodiments downstream literal or virtual application tagging are delayed until a traffic flow passes through the service policy implementation functions and to the application interface function where the service flow is then identified and associated with the underlying traffic and application parameters and the literal or virtual tag is then communicated to the first policy implementation function or service monitoring function in the downstream traffic processing stack. In some embodiments prior to being associated with a literal or virtual tag the traffic flow is allowed to pass with no traffic shaping and once the traffic flow is identified and tagged the appropriate traffic shaping is applied. In some embodiments a set of traffic shaping policy parameters are applied to the unidentified traffic flow before the flow is identified and then the traffic shaping policy for the flow is updated when the flow is tagged. In some embodiments the traffic flow can be blocked at the application interface agent even before the tag is passed to the policy implementation functions if it is found to be associated with traffic parameters that are blocked by policy once packet processing framing and encryption are removed.

In some embodiments a service monitor agent records and reports device service usage or service activities of device . In some embodiments service usage history is verified by a number of techniques including verifying against network based service usage history e.g. device service history and the various service policy implementation techniques as described herein.

In some embodiments the service monitor agent includes the capability to filter service usage history reporting with the decision on which aspects of service history to report being determined by policies including possibly privacy policies defined by the device user or control plane servers in the network. In some embodiments the service monitor agent monitors and possibly records or reports Customer Resource Management CRM information such as websites visited time spent per website interest indications based on website viewing advertisements served to the device advertisements opened by the user location of the user searches conducted by the user application usage profile device user interface usage history electronic commerce transactions music or video files played applications on device and or when the user is actively working or playing or inactive. In some embodiments to protect the privacy of this user CRM information the user is provided with options on how much of the information to share and the user s response to the options are recorded and used to determine the filtering policy for how much of the CRM data to report e.g. CRM filter level options selected by the user via the device UI and or via various service plan or service profile or service policy options and how much to suppress or to not even monitor record store in the first place. In some embodiments to protect the privacy of this user s GPS location tracking related information the user is provided with options on how much of the information to share and the user s response to the options are recorded and used to determine the filtering policy for how much of the GPS location tracking related data to report e.g. GPS location tracking filter level options and how much to suppress or to not even monitor record store in the first place. In some embodiments the service processor allows the user to provide feedback on the user s preferences such as for privacy CRM data to report. In some embodiments the user can also specify their preference s for notification e.g. related to service usage cost traffic reporting and other service usage monitored information and or service controls. In some embodiments the service monitor agent observes and possibly records or reports service usage categorized by network possibly including roaming networks paid service networks or free service networks. In some embodiments the service monitor agent observes and possibly records or reports service usage categorized by sub accounts for various types of traffic or various types of network.

For example service monitor reports can be provided to the service controller . Service is monitored through various embodiments that can involve service usage logging or traffic inspection and usage logging at the application level various levels in the networking communication stack or the access modem. Some embodiments involve multiple levels of service or traffic measurement at various levels in the communications stack as described further below.

In some embodiments service or traffic monitoring includes monitoring one or more of the following traffic associated with one or more users traffic downstream and or upstream data rate total traffic received and or transmitted over a period of time traffic transmitted and or received by IP addresses domain names URLs or other network address identifiers traffic transmitted and or received by email downloads or uploads traffic transmitted and or received by an application traffic transmitted and or received by network file transfers traffic transmitted and or received by file download or upload content types traffic transmitted and or received by mobile commerce transactions traffic transmitted and or received by one or more time periods traffic transmitted and or received by differing levels of network activity and network capacity availability traffic transmitted and or received by one or more delivered levels of quality of service traffic transmitted and or received by software downloads traffic transmitted and or received by application downloads traffic transmitted and or received by one or more activities associated with the service control plane link or other network related functions or traffic that may not directly result in service usage or service activity that the user values or desires traffic transmitted and or received to support one or more service provider third party service partner offerings software usage history application usage history device discovery history for UI components applications settings tutorials ads served history ads visited history and or device location history.

In some embodiments some or all of the service usage monitoring occurs at the application layer. In some embodiments the service monitor agent implements traffic inspection points between the applications and the networking stack application interface such as the sockets API. In other embodiments the application interface agent performs traffic inspection and reports the results to the service monitor agent . Traffic inspection can be accomplished in several ways including for example implementing a T buffer at each socket connection and feeding the side traffic into a traffic flow analyzer which in combination with a mapping of application to socket provides much of the information listed above. In cases in which it is necessary to obtain traffic information from the application itself some embodiments call for the application to be adapted to provide the information to either the application interface agent or the service monitor agent . As an example the application interface agent or the service monitor agent can monitor and decode advertisements downloaded via HTTP but if the browser and HTTP server employ security above the sockets protocol stack layer then the application interface agent can communicate with the browser via a java applet or some other inter process communication method. In some embodiments the service monitor agent the billing agent and or the policy control agent or some other software or hardware function on the device can monitor and or control e.g. allow block and or replace advertisement traffic flow into the device. In some embodiments the monitoring and control of advertisement traffic flow into the device is also used for bill by account purposes e.g. charges such as service charges billed to the advertiser sponsor and or service or transactional service provider .

In some embodiments some or all of the service usage monitoring occurs below the application interface for the networking stack. In this case some portion of the information listed above may not always be available due to encryption applied at the higher layers and or the computational costs associated with performing deep packet inspection on mobile devices.

In some embodiments the service monitor agent is also monitors the operating software install or loading systems and or otherwise monitors software installs or loads and or software uninstalls deinstallations.

Some of the information above may be considered by some users advocacy groups or agencies as customer sensitive personal information. Simply sending the above information to the network for unspecified purposes may not therefore be acceptable for some service providers. However if the user provides specific approval e.g. informed consent for the device network or service provider to use some or all of the information that may be sensitive for specified purposes then the user can control the level of information that is used and the purpose the information is used for. Accordingly various embodiments described herein provide the user with control of what information is used and the purposes it is used for thereby allowing the user adequate control of any such sensitive information. In some embodiments information that is thought to perhaps be sensitive and is reported to the network must first receive user approval for the reporting. Some basic information is generally not considered sensitive and is necessary for certain basic service provider needs. For example total data transmitted and or received traffic downstream and or upstream speed overall traffic usage by time of day are generally not considered private from the service provider s perspective and are necessary in many basic service policy implementations. As additional examples perhaps other service usage history such as total traffic email downloads and uploads but not the type of files or any specifics about the email traffic the total web browsing traffic but nothing specific about the sites visited or content viewed total file transfer traffic but not the type of files transferred or the addresses involved in the transfer and other examples may not be viewed as private and in some embodiments provide valuable information for the service provider to manage services. Conversely information such as websites visited content viewed mobile commerce transactions completed advertisements visited GPS location history and other service usage history the service monitor is capable of recording may be sensitive or private for some users and would thereby benefit from the various embodiments that provide enhanced user control of the reporting of such potentially sensitive or private data. It should also be appreciated that there is an inherent advantage to implementing traffic monitoring traffic service monitoring or service control on a device because it is not necessary to report sensitive information to the network to accomplish many of these service policy implementation objectives.

In some embodiments the service monitor agent assists in virtual application tagging of traffic flows through the networking stack policy implementation by tracking the virtually tagged packets through the stack processing and communicating the flow tags to the service policy implementation agent s . In some embodiments the service monitor agent maintains a history and provides reports or summary reports of which networks in addition to the networks controlled by the service controller to which the device has connected. In some embodiments this network activity summary includes a summary of the networks accessed activity versus time per connection and or traffic versus time per connection. In some embodiments the traffic reports that go to the network possibly to service controller billing system and or device service history are first filtered according to rules defined by user preference selection at the time of service activation e.g. service plan service plan option selection time of first device use at a time the user selected the option on the service UI or at a time the user chose to change the option on the service UI or some other time mechanism allowing for user preference selection.

In some embodiments the service monitor agent monitors application usage e.g. which application the user executes on the device such as e mail applications web browsing applications and or media content streaming applications . In some embodiments the service monitor agent monitors multimedia file usage e.g. based on multimedia file type and or based on specific multimedia files such as specific movies and or songs . In some embodiments the service monitor agent monitors the device user interface application and content discovery history e.g. monitoring which applications content the user accesses from the device including monitoring the pattern by which the user accesses such applications content such as how the user navigates the user interface on the device to access such applications content and maintaining such patterns and history such as which icons the user access on a home page secondary or other portion mechanism on the device for accessing various applications content . In some embodiments the service monitor agent monitors advertisements provided to the user on the device . In some embodiments the service monitor agent monitors advertisements viewed e.g. accessed such as by clicking on a web advertisement by the user on the device . In some embodiments the service monitor agent monitors GPS location information for the device . As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art the service monitor agent can monitor a wide variety of activities performed by the device user of the device and or based on other information related to the device such as GPS location information. As described herein in some embodiments the user of the device can also specify which activities that the user authorizes for such monitoring e.g. the user may prefer to not allow for such GPS location monitoring .

In some embodiments the application interface agent provides an interface for device application programs. In some embodiments the application interface agent identifies application level traffic reports virtual service identification tags or appends literal service identification tags to assist service policy implementation such as access control traffic shaping QoS control service type dependent billing or other service control or implementation functions. In some embodiments the application interface agent assists with application layer service usage monitoring by for example passively inspecting and logging traffic or service characteristics at a point in the software stack between the applications and the standard networking stack application interface such as the sockets API. In some embodiments the application interface agent intercepts traffic between the applications and the standard network stack interface API in order to more deeply inspect the traffic modify the traffic or shape the traffic e.g. thereby not requiring any modification of the device networking communication stack of the device OS . In some embodiments the application interface agent implements certain aspects of service policies such as application level access control application associated billing application layer service monitoring or reporting application layer based traffic shaping service type dependent billing or other service control or implementation functions.

In some embodiments application layer based traffic monitoring and shaping can be performed as described below. The traffic from each application can be divided into one or more traffic flows that each flow through a traffic queue with each queue being associated with one or more additional classifications for that application e.g. the application can be a browser that is associated with multiple queues representing different destinations or groups of destinations it is connected to with each destination or group of destinations having potentially different access control or traffic control policies or the application can be associated with different content types or groups of content types with each content type having different queues the application might be an email program with email text traffic going to one queue and downloads going to another with different policies for each . In some embodiments queues are formed for all applications or groups of applications that are associated with one or more traffic parameters such as destination content type time of day or groups of applications can be similarly assigned to different queues. The functions performed by the application layer queues can be similar to the functions described for the policy implementation agent such as pass block buffer delay burst in order to control the traffic or network access associated with the queue. The drop function can also be implemented such as for application layer protocols that include reliable transmission methods but if the application layer protocol does not involve reliable retransmission of lost information this can result in lost data or unreliable communication which may be acceptable in some cases. The manner in which the queues are controlled can be constructed to result in a similar approach for controlling services or implementing service activity control similar to the other embodiments described herein including for example the policy control agent implementing an higher layer of service control to achieve a higher level objective as discussed herein.

In some embodiments the application interface agent interacts with application programs to arrange application settings to aid in implementing application level service policy implementation or billing such as email file transfer options peer to peer networking file transfer options media content resolution or compression settings and or inserting or modifying browser headers. In some embodiments the application interface agent intercepts certain application traffic to modify traffic application layer parameters such as email file transfer options or browser headers. In some embodiments the application interface agent transmits or receives a service usage test element to aid in verifying service policy implementation service monitoring or service billing. In some embodiments the application interface agent performs a transaction billing intercept function to aid the billing agent in transaction billing. In some embodiments the application interface agent transmits or receives a billing test element to aid in verifying transaction billing or service billing.

In some embodiments a modem firewall blocks or passes traffic based on service policies and traffic attributes. In some embodiments the modem firewall assists in virtual or literal upstream traffic flow tagging. Although not shown in in some embodiments the modem firewall is located on either side of the modem bus and in some embodiments it is advantageous to locate it on the modem itself.

In some embodiments the billing agent detects and reports service billing events. In some embodiments the billing agent plays a key role in transaction billing. In some embodiments the billing agent performs one or more of the following functions provides the user with service plan options accepts service plan selections provides options on service usage notification policies accepts user preference specifications on service usage notification policies provides notification on service usage levels provides alerts when service usage threatens to go over plan limits or to generate excess cost provides options on service usage control policy accepts choices on service usage control policy informs policy control agent of user preference on service usage control policy provides billing transaction options and or accepts billing transaction choices. In some embodiments the billing agent interacts with transaction servers e.g. open content transaction partner sites to conduct ecommerce transactions with central billing .

In some embodiments service processor includes one or more service usage or service activity counters. For example the service monitor agent billing agent or a combination of these agents and or other agents components of service processor can include such a local service usage counter s for the device . In some embodiments a service usage counter monitors service usage including data usage to from the device with the access network . In some embodiments the service usage counter periodically in response to a user request in response to a service processor agent s request e.g. the billing agent the policy control agent or another agent of service processor in response to the service controller and or in response to the central billing e.g. for billing purposes and or for storing in the device service history provides a service usage report including monitored service usage for the device . In some embodiments the service usage counter periodically or in response to a request synchronizes the service usage counter on the device with a network and or billing service usage counter such as that maintained potentially at central billing . In some embodiments service processor utilizes the service usage counter to provide a service usage projection. In some embodiments service processor utilizes the service usage counter to provide a service usage cost estimate. In some embodiments service usage projections from policy control agent are used to estimate the projected future service usage if user service usage behavior remains consistent. In some embodiments service processor utilizes the service usage counter to provide a cost of service usage and the service processor then periodically or in response to a request synchronizes the cost of service usage with for example the central billing . In some embodiments the service processor utilizes the service usage counter to determine whether the user is exceeding and or is projected to exceed their current service plan for data usage and then various actions can be performed as similarly described herein to allow the user to modify their service plan and or modify e.g. throttle their network data usage. In some embodiments the service usage counter can support providing to the user the following service usage related data reports service usage known usage and estimated usage projected usage present costs projected costs cost to roam cost to roam options and or projected roaming costs. For example including a local service data usage counter on the device allows the service processor to more accurately monitor service data usage because for example network and or billing service usage counters may not accurately also include for example control plane data traffic sent to from the device in their monitored service data usage count.

In some embodiments verifiable device based service billing solutions are provided. For example as described herein various device based service billing solutions can include a wide range of verification techniques to ensure that the device is properly reporting service billing events e.g. to verify ensure that the service billing is not malfunctioning and or has not been tampered with compromised such that it is not accurately or timely providing service billing information . As described herein service billing generally refers the billing for one or more services for a device such as device e.g. email service billing for data usage associated with received sent email related data over the access network web browsing service billing for data usage associated with received sent web browsing related data over the access network and or any other network based service and or any transactional based services such as for multimedia content purchases or other transactions .

In some embodiments verifiable device based service billing is provided by sending dummy test billing events such as having an access control integrity server of the service controller instruct the access control integrity agent to send a dummy test billing event to the billing agent . If the billing agent does not then send the expected report which should reflect the dummy test or fails to timely send any report then the system can verify whether the billing process is working properly. In addition a dummy test transaction can be used to verify transaction based billing through a variety of approaches e.g. the access control integrity agent can similarly send a dummy test transactional billing event to the billing agent as a test to determine whether the billing agent then provides the expected report reflecting that dummy test transaction . For example the test billing events can be trapped by a device assisted billing mediation server and removed from the user account billing.

In some embodiments verifiable device based service billing is provided by sending one or more data bursts to the device to confirm that data was received and to confirm that the service monitor agent properly logged the data burst s in the local service usage or service activity counter. In some embodiments data bursts can be used to verify data throttling e.g. if the device has exceeded service data usage limits and or is approaching such limits such that service data usage should be throttled then sending data bursts can be used to verify whether the expected throttling is properly being performed on the device . In some embodiments verifiable device based service billing is provided by submitting requests to connect to an unauthorized service website to verify if that unauthorized service usage is properly blocked. In some embodiments verifiable device based service billing is provided by submitting requests to perform an unauthorized transaction to verify if that unauthorized transaction is properly blocked.

In some embodiments verifiable device based service billing is provided by verifying device service activities relative to IPDRs for the device. In some embodiments the IPDRs for the device possibly in a modified format are periodically and or upon request sent to the device as described herein. For example IPDRs for the device can be compared to the device s local service data usage counter and or to the service plan for the device to determine if the overall service data usage limit has been exceeded whether out of plan unauthorized unrecorded websites other services have been performed by the device whether service plan profile bandwidth limits have been exceeded whether out of plan unauthorized unrecorded transactions have been performed e.g. verifying IPDR transaction logs assuming such are included in the IPDRs with the local transaction logs of the device to determine for example whether the local device records indicate that fewer than the network recorded number of content downloads such as downloaded songs were purchased and or whether any other activities verifiable based on a comparison of IPDRs indicate that the device has been used in any manner that is out of or exceeds the service plan profile for the device.

In some embodiments device based service billing includes recording billing option response history. For example this approach can be particularly important for service plan overage conditions e.g. when the use of the device is exceeding the service plan associated with the device in some manner such as service data usage bandwidth service or transaction access and or in some other manner . In some embodiments in a service plan overage condition the user is requested to confirm that user has acknowledged notification of service plan overage such as via the user interface . In some embodiments such service plan overage acknowledgements require that the user enter a unique identification to validate authorization by the user identity associated with the device e.g. another type of verification mechanism in the event a device is stolen or being used by someone other than the authorized user of the device then that unauthorized user would not be able to confirm the service plan overage acknowledgement and appropriate actions can then be taken such as throttling quarantining or temporarily suspending service network access . In some embodiments if the device is compromised hacked e.g. by the user of the device and the device is used in a manner that results in a service usage overage e.g. determined based on device assisted service usage monitoring and or network based service usage monitoring using IPDRs CDRs then the billing system determines billing for such service usage overage costs. This overage billing can be initiated by the device e.g. service processor the service controller the billing system the AAA or some other network function. In some embodiments if the device is compromised hacked e.g. by a user of the device and the device is used in a manner that results in a service usage overage one or more of the following actions is taken the user is notified the user is required to acknowledge the notification the device traffic is sent to SPAN or similar traffic sampling and analysis function and or the device is flagged for further analysis.

In some embodiments device based service billing includes an option to bill by account such as to bill different service activities and or transactions to a specified account e.g. other than the user s account associated with the general service plan for the device . For example bill by account can provide for billing according to application content type website transaction network chatter e.g. heartbeat communications and or other network traffic that is used by for example the central service provider to generally maintain network access for the device and or transaction partner sponsored activities and then report such bill by account information for billing mediation reconciliation. For example a bill by account report can be sent by billing agent from the device to central billing e.g. as a billing event or alternatively sent to an intermediate server aggregator which can then reformat and send the reformatted report to central billing e.g. providing the billing report in a format required by central billing or alternatively sent to a mediation server which can re compute the billing based on the bill by account report e.g. offset the bill based on network chatter transaction based billing transaction partner sponsored activities content providers website providers and or advertising providers and then send the recomputed and potentially reformatted report to central billing .

In some embodiments one or more of the mediation reconciliation functions for device assisted billing device generated billing events device generated bill by account events and device generated open transaction billing events can be implemented in the service controller e.g. the billing event server or in another function located in the billing system or elsewhere. This billing mediation server function accepts the device based billing events discussed immediately above reformats the billing events into a format accepted and recognized by the billing system mediates the billing event information to remove service usage billing from the user account and place it in other bill by account categories as appropriate according to the bill by account mediation rules adds other billing events for service usage or transactions to the user account as appropriate according to the device based billing rules and then applies the information to the billing information the user account to correct or update the account.

For example a bill by account can allow for a website provider such as Google or Yahoo to pay for or offset certain account usage for web browsing web based searching web based email or any other web based or other service usage activities which may also be based in whole or in part on the activities performed by the user on such transactional services e.g. based on advertisement viewing accessing or click through activities by the user by which an advertisement business model used by such website providers directly or indirectly supports such service account subsidies . As another example a bill by account can allow for an advertiser to pay for or offset certain account usage for viewing and or accessing e.g. clicking through a web placed advertisement or other advertisement sent via the network to the device. As yet another example various network chatter e.g. heartbeat related network and other network chatter related service data usage can be assigned to a dummy account and such can be used to offset the bill and or used for tracking the data usage for such activities for the device. In another example service data usage for access to a transactional service such as a multimedia content download service e.g. music eBook music video streaming and or movie or other multimedia content download service or an online shopping site e.g. Amazon eBay or another online shopping site can be billed to a transactional service account assigned to a transactional service partner that sponsors access to that sponsor s transactional service thereby allowing that transactional service partner to pays for or offset e.g. subsidize the account usage for such activities which may also be based in whole or in part on the transactions actually performed by the user on such transactional services e.g. based on the volume cost of the multimedia service download purchases by the user and or online activities .

In some embodiments device based service billing includes recording billing events on the device and then reporting such billing to the network e.g. central billing . In some embodiments device based service billing includes reporting service usage events and or applying cost look up and logging reporting service billing updates. For example this allows for reporting not only service usage but also cost of such service usage to the user via the user interface of device . Also for example the cost of such service usage can also be reported to the billing server. In some embodiments device based service billing includes reporting service usage to the network and the network determines the cost for such service usage.

In some embodiments billing information for roaming partners is provided. For example a roaming server can include a roaming service cost data table for roaming service partners. In this example when the device e.g. device connects to a roaming network provided by a roaming service partner then the device can also receive the roaming service data rate based on the roaming service cost data table provided by the roaming server. Alternatively the roaming server can send the roaming service cost data table or a modified format of the same to the device thereby allowing the device to determine the costs for such roaming network service usage or service activity. As described herein the device can also automatically use a roaming service profile when connecting to the roaming network service and or the user can be notified of the roaming service profile options based on the roaming service data costs and then select the desired roaming service profile accordingly.

In some embodiments the user is provided with a list of service costs based on locally stored roaming table and a search of available roaming partners that the device detects and can connect to. In some embodiments the user is provided with a projected cost per day for one or more roaming service provider options based on typical service usage history and the cost for each service provider. In some embodiments the user is provided with a set of options for service usage notification controlling or throttling service usage and or cost while roaming e.g. using the service notification and cost control techniques as similarly discussed herein but applied to the roaming network . In some embodiments these controls are set by a VSP or e.g. an IT manager using VSP functions . In some embodiments roaming tables are updated periodically in the background while on a home network or other low cost network and cached. In some embodiments cache updates occur based on fixed time period e.g. late at night when updates are less expensive due to network inactivity . In some embodiments the roaming partner cost table cache updates are done whenever connected to a desirable network that is not as expensive or bandwidth constrained e.g. at home work or off the WWAN . In some embodiments updates occur at time of day that network is not busy. In some embodiments updates occur based on network push when roaming table is changed e.g. one or more of the roaming partners changes the rate . In some embodiments the service cost to update the roaming service cost table is charged to bill by account and possibly not charged to end user. In some embodiments the roaming service center is provided as a service that is paid for e.g. potentially bill by account tracks all related costs . For example this type of roaming cost control can be provided as a service through central provider MVNO roaming partner provider VSP or as a third party application not associated with any service provider e.g. IT manager . For example the controls for how to update cache set service control policies and other controls can be defined by any number of VSP entities including the user through a website service.

In some embodiments a roaming service center is provided as a service in which for example the user is provided with a list of service costs based on a locally stored or remotely accessed roaming table. In some embodiments the roaming service center provides the user with a projected cost per day for one or more roaming service provider options based on typical service usage history and the cost for each service provider. In some embodiments the roaming service center provides the user with a set of options for controlling throttling usage and or cost while roaming. In some embodiments these controls are set by a VSP e.g. an IT manager using VSP functions . For example roaming tables can be updated periodically in the background while on a home network and cached. In some embodiments cache updates occur based on a fixed time period. In some embodiments the roaming partner cost table cache updates are done whenever the device is connected to a desirable network that is not as expensive or bandwidth constrained e.g. at home work and or off the WWAN . In some embodiments updates occur at time of day that network is not busy. In some embodiments updates occur based on a network push when a roaming table is changed e.g. one or more of the roaming partners changes the rate . In some embodiments the service cost to update the roaming service cost table is charged to bill by account and possibly not charged to the user. In some embodiments the roaming service center is provided as a service that is paid for by the user and or part of a service plan. In some embodiments a bill by account function tracks all related costs. For example the roaming service center can be provided as a service through central provider MVNO roaming partner provider VSP or as a third party application not associated with any service provider e.g. IT manager .

In some embodiments a synchronized local service usage counter based on time stamped central billing information is provided. For example the local service usage counter as similarly described above can also be synchronized to past service usage records e.g. time stamped central billing records of service usage for the device and use local estimates for current present service usage estimates for the device. In this example the central billing system e.g. central billing can push the time stamped central billing information to the device e.g. device the device can pull the time stamped central billing information and or an intermediate server can provide a mediated push or pull process. In some embodiments synchronization is performing periodically based on service usage levels with free running estimates between synchronizations.

In some embodiments service usage is projected based on calculated estimates of service usage based on synchronized service usage and local service usage count information. For example projected service usage can be calculated on the device or calculated on a server e.g. a billing server or an intermediate billing server which provides the calculated projected service usage information to the device such as using various adaptive algorithms for service usage projections. For example an adaptive algorithm can use historical past synchronized network service usage information e.g. synchronized with local service usage data based on time stamps associated with IPDRs to assist in service usage projections based on for example total service usage count service usage count by certain service related criteria e.g. application content service type website and or time of day . In another example an adaptive algorithm synchronizes to past service usage data e.g. the local estimate of past service usage data is updated to be synchronized up through the point in time associated with the latest IPDR time stamp that has been received and current local estimates of service usage collected since the latest time stamp are then added to the time stamped IPDR service usage counter to minimize the service usage counter offset so that it is no greater than the difference between the network service usage measure and the local service usage measure since the latest IPDR time stamp. In some embodiments these adaptive algorithm techniques are performed on the device and or performed on the network e.g. on a network server for processing. In some embodiments if there is an offset in the local device based service usage count between IPDR synchronization events and the IPDR service usage count between IPDR synchronization events then an algorithm can be employed to estimate any systematic sources for the offset and correct the local service usage count to minimize the offsets. As an example if the IPDR service usage count is typically off by a fixed percentage either high or low then an algorithm can be employed to estimate a multiplier that is applied to the local service usage count to minimize the offset between IPDR service usage synchronization events. In another example there can be a consistent constant offset and a multiplier offset both of which can be estimated and corrected for. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that more sophisticated algorithms can be employed to estimate the nature of any systematic offsets including for example offsets that occur due to specific service usage activities or network chatter to manage the device and such offsets can then be minimized between IPDR service synchronization events. In some embodiments synchronized service usage data is used to create an improved analysis of the statistical patterns of service usage to provide more accurate service usage projections. Those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that a variety of additional adaptive algorithm techniques can be used including those that provide for various statistical analysis techniques and or other techniques.

In some embodiments service usage is projected for the end of a billing service period for a service plan versus the service usage allowed under the service plan for that billing service period. A display of excess charges is also provided for the projected rate of service usage based on the monitored service usage behavior through the end of the billing service period e.g. this can be zero if the service usage is projected to be less than that allowed under the service plan and a positive cost number if it is projected to be more than the service plan . For example this can be implemented in numerous ways such as on a server in the network on a gateway router switch in the network and or on the device as discussed below and generally described herein with respect to other service cost usage monitoring and notification embodiments. If implemented in the network server or gateway router switch then the service cost usage projections and related information can be pushed to the device or the device can be notified that such information is available to pull and or periodically pushed pulled. The service usage information estimates can be collected from the device the network or both e.g. reconciled and or synchronized as similarly described herein. The service usage information estimates are then analyzed to determine service usage cost projects as similarly described herein and compared to the service plan for the device to determine the projected service cost usage overage if any . In some embodiments one or more of the following are determined by reported to and or displayed on the device service usage value projected service usage value service usage plan limit projected service usage overage projected service cost overage service plan period time duration service plan time remaining before end of period and or other pertinent information.

In some embodiments the device also determines service costs based on the synchronized service usage count thereby allowing the device to also report the service cost information to the user. For example the device can locally store a service cost look up table s locally store different service cost look up tables for different networks and or for roaming networks and or request such information from a billing or intermediate billing server and or a roaming server on the network. As another example the device can obtain the calculated service costs based on the synchronized local service usage count and or network service usage count from an intermediate server e.g. a billing or intermediate billing server thereby offloading the computational costs associated with calculated these projections and the data storage for service cost lookup tables onto the intermediate server on the network using the network service usage counter with or alternatively without the synchronized local service usage counter.

In some embodiments service usage count categorization by network e.g. a home network such as a Wi Fi WAN femtocell or other home network versus a roaming network is provided. Similarly the synchronized local service usage counter can be synchronized by network. Also a synchronized local service usage count for networks controlled by a central provider for networks controlled by other providers e.g. MVNO and or free networks can similarly be provided.

In some embodiments a service notification and billing interface is provided. For example service usage and projected service usage such as described herein can be displayed to the user of the device e.g. via user interface . Similarly expected projected service or cost overrun overage such as described herein can also be displayed to the user. As another example a most cost effective plan can be determined projected based on historical and or projected service usage and this determined projected most cost effective plan can be displayed to the user. In yet another example a list of available networks accessible by the device can be displayed to the user. In this example one or more undesired available networks can also be blocked from display thereby only displaying to the user desired and or preferred available networks. In this example service usage plans and or service usage plan option comparison for one or more alternative networks or roaming networks can also be displayed to the user. Similarly service cost plans and or service cost plan option comparison for one or more alternative networks or roaming networks can also be displayed to the user. In addition roaming service usage projected roaming service usage estimated roaming service cost and or projected estimated roaming service cost can also be displayed to the user. These roaming service usage costs can also be displayed to the user so that the user can utilize this information for selecting various roaming service billing options. In another example alternative and or least cost networks are determined and displayed to the user. In another example alternative warnings are displayed to the user for any or specified roaming networks.

In some embodiments the service notification and billing interface notifies the user of expected network coverage e.g. based on the device s current geography location and the accessible networks for the device from that current geography location and displays options to the user based on the expected network coverage information. In some embodiments the service notification and billing interface notifies the user of their current service usage at specified service usage points and displays various options to the user e.g. service usage options and or billing options . For example the user s responses to the presented options are recorded e.g. stored locally on the device at least temporarily for reporting purposes or permanently in a local configuration data store until such configuration settings are otherwise modified or reset and reported such as to the billing server e.g. central billing . For example user input such as selected options and or corresponding policy settings can be stored locally on the device via a cache system. As another example the service notification and billing interface displays options to the user for how the user wants to be notified and how the user wants to control service usage costs the user s input on such notification options is recorded and the cost control options e.g. and the billing agent and policy control agent are configured accordingly. Similarly the user s input on service plan options changes can be recorded and the service plan options changes e.g. and the billing agent and policy control agent are configured updated accordingly. In another example the service notification and billing interface provides various traffic control profiles such as for where the user requests assistance in controlling service usage costs e.g. service data usage and or transactional usage related activities costs . Similarly the service notification and billing interface can provide various notification options such as for where the user wants advance warning on service coverage. In another example the service notification and billing interface provides options for automatic pre buy at a set point in service usage. In another example the service notification and billing interface provides the option to choose different notification and cost control options for alternative networks or roaming networks.

In some embodiments an online portal or web server is provided for allowing the user to select and or update policy settings. For example user input provided via the online portal web server can be recorded and reported to the billing server e.g. central billing . In another example the online portal web server can display transaction billing information and or accept input for a transaction billing request which can then be reported to the billing server accordingly.

As shown in the service processor includes a service interface or user interface . In some embodiments the user interface provides the user with information and accepts user choices or preferences on one or more of the following user service information user billing information service activation service plan selection or change service usage or service activity counters remaining service status service usage projections service usage overage possibility warnings service cost status service cost projections service usage control policy options privacy CRM GPS related options and or other service related information settings and or options. For example the user interface can collect service usage information from service monitor agent to update the local service usage counter and or alternatively the service usage information is obtained from the service controller to update user interface service usage or service cost information for display to the user. As another example service billing records obtained from central billing system can be used to synchronize local service usage counters and service monitor agent information to perform real time updating of local service usage counters between billing system synchronizations. As another example the user interface can display options and accept user preference feedback such as similarly discussed above with respect to user privacy CRM GPS filtering traffic monitoring and service controls. For example the user interface can allow the user of the device to modify their privacy settings provide user feedback on service preferences and or service experiences modify their service profiles e.g. preferences settings configurations and or network settings and options to review service usage data e.g. based on local service usage counters and or other data monitored by the service processor to receive various events or triggers e.g. based on projected service usage costs and or the user interface can provide support various other user input output for service control and service usage.

In some embodiments by providing the service policy implementation and the control of service policy implementation to the preferences of the user and or by providing the user with the option of specifying or influencing how the various service notification and control policies or control algorithms are implemented the user is provided with options for how to control the service experience the service cost the capabilities of the service the manner in which the user is notified regarding service usage or service cost the level of sensitive user information that is shared with the network or service provider entity and the manner in which certain service usage activities may or may not be throttled accelerated blocked enabled and or otherwise controlled. Accordingly some embodiments provide the service control to beneficially optimize user cost versus service capabilities or capacities in a manner that facilitates an optimized user experience and does not violate network neutrality goals regulations and or requirements. For example by offering the user with a set of choices ranging from simple choices between two or more pre packaged service control settings options to advanced user screens where more detailed level of user specification and control is made available some embodiments allow the service provider device manufacturer device distributor MVNO VSP service provider partner and or other entity to implement valuable or necessary service controls while allowing the user to decide or influence the decision on which service usage activities are controlled such as how they are controlled or throttled and which service usage activities may not be throttled or controlled in some manner. These various embodiments allow the service provider device manufacturer device distributor MVNO VSP service provider partner or other entity to assist the user in managing services in a manner that is network neutral with respect to their implementation and service control policies because the user is making or influencing the decisions for example on cost versus service capabilities or quality. By further providing user control or influence on the filtering settings for the service usage reporting or CRM reporting various levels of service usage and other user information associated with device usage can be transmitted to the network service provider device manufacturer device distributor MVNO VSP service provider partner and or other entity in a manner specified or influenced by the user to maintain the user s desired level of information privacy.

As shown in the service processor includes the service downloader . In some embodiments the service downloader provides a download function to install or update service software elements on the device. In some embodiments the service downloader requires a secure signed version of software before a download is accepted. For example the download can require a unique key for a particular service downloader . As another example the service downloader can be stored or execute in secure memory or execute a secure memory partition in the CPU memory space. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are a variety of other security techniques that can be used to ensure the integrity of the service downloader .

As shown in the service processor includes a modem driver . In some embodiments the modem driver converts data traffic into modem bus not shown traffic for one or more modems via the modem firewall . As shown in in some embodiments modem selection and control selects the access network connection and is in communication with the modem firewall and modem drivers convert data traffic into modem bus traffic for one or more modems and are in communication with the modem selection and control . As shown in in some embodiments modems which are in communication with the modem bus connect the device to one or more networks. In some embodiments different profiles are selected based on the selected network connection e.g. different service profiles policies for WWAN WLAN WPAN Ethernet and or DSL network connections which is also referred to herein as multimode profile setting. For example service profile settings can be based on the actual access network e.g. home DSL cable or work network behind the Wi Fi not the fact that it is Wi Fi or any other network such as DSL cable satellite or T 1 which is viewed as different than accessing a Wi Fi network at the coffee shop. For example in a Wi Fi hotspot situation in which there are a significant number of users on a DSL or T 1 backhaul the service controller can sit in a service provider cloud or an MVNO cloud the service controls can be provided by a VSP capability offered by the service provider e.g. as described herein with respect to or the service controller can be owned by the hotspot service provider that uses the service controller on their own without any association with an access network service provider. For example the service processors can be controlled by the service controller to divide up the available bandwidth at the hotspot according to QoS or user sharing rules e.g. with some users having higher differentiated priority potentially for higher service payments than other users . As another example ambient services as similarly described herein can be provided for the hotspot for verified service processors.

In some embodiments the service processor and service controller are capable of assigning multiple service profiles associated with multiple service plans that the user chooses individually or in combination as a package. For example a device starts with ambient services that include free transaction services wherein the user pays for transactions or events rather than the basic service e.g. a news service eReader PND service pay as you go session Internet in which each service is supported with a bill by account capability to correctly account for any subsidized partner billing to provide the transaction services e.g. Barnes and Noble may pay for the eReader service and offer a revenue share to the service provider for any book or magazine transactions purchased form the device . In some embodiments the bill by account service can also track the transactions and in some embodiments advertisements for the purpose of revenue sharing all using the service monitoring capabilities disclosed herein. After initiating services with the free ambient service discussed above the user may later choose a post pay monthly Internet email and SMS service. In this case the service controller would obtain from the billing system in the case of network based billing or in some embodiments the service controller billing event server in the case of device based billing the billing plan code for the new Internet email and SMS service. In some embodiments this code is cross referenced in a database e.g. the policy management server to find the appropriate service profile for the new service in combination with the initial ambient service. The new superset service profile is then applied so that the user maintains free access to the ambient services and the billing partners continue to subsidize those services the user also gets access to Internet services and may choose the service control profile e.g. from one of the embodiments disclosed herein . The superset profile is the profile that provides the combined capabilities of two or more service profiles when the profiles are applied to the same device service processor. In some embodiments the device service processor can determine the superset profile rather than the service controller when more than one stackable service is selected by the user or otherwise applied to the device. The flexibility of the service processor and service controller embodiments described herein allow for a large variety of service profiles to be defined and applied individually or as a superset to achieve the desired device service features.

As shown in the service controller includes a service control server link . In some embodiments device based service control techniques involving supervision across a network e.g. on the control plane are more sophisticated and for such it is increasingly important to have an efficient and flexible control plane communication link between the device agents e.g. of the service processor and the network elements e.g. of the service controller communicating with controlling monitoring or verifying service policy. For example the communication link between the service control server link of service controller and the service control device link of the service processor can provide an efficient and flexible control plane communication link a service control link as shown in and in some embodiments this control plane communication link provides for a secure e.g. encrypted communications link for providing secure bidirectional communications between the service processor and the service controller . In some embodiments the service control server link provides the network side of a system for transmission and reception of service agent to from network element functions. In some embodiments the traffic efficiency of this link is enhanced by buffering and framing multiple agent messages in the transmissions e.g. thereby reducing network chatter . In some embodiments the traffic efficiency is further improved by controlling the transmission frequency and or linking the transmission frequency to the rate of service usage or traffic usage. In some embodiments one or more levels of security and or encryption are used to secure the link against potential discovery eavesdropping or compromise of communications on the link. In some embodiments the service control server link also provides the communications link and heartbeat timing for the agent heartbeat function. As discussed below various embodiments described herein for the service control server link provide an efficient and secure mechanism for transmitting and receiving service policy implementation control monitoring and verification information between the device agents e.g. service processor agents components and other network elements e.g. service controller agents components .

In some embodiments the service control server link can employ the counterpart service control plane secure transmission methods discussed above with respect to the service control device link . For example one or more layers of security can be used to secure the communications link including for example basic IP layer security TCP layer security service control link layer security and or security specific from service controller servers to service processor agents.

In some embodiments the service control server link reduces network chatter by efficiently transmitting service control related communications over the link. For example the service control server link can transmit server messages asynchronously as they arrive. As another example the service control server link can perform collection or buffering of server messages between transmissions. As another example the service control server link can determine when to transmit based potentially on several parameters such as one or more of periodic timer trigger waiting until a certain amount of service usage or traffic usage has occurred responding to a service agent message responding to a service agent request initiated by one or more servers initiated by a verification error condition and or initiated by some other error condition. For example once a transmission trigger has occurred the service control server link can take all buffered agent communications and frame the communications. In addition the service control server link can provide for an efficient communication link based on various embodiments related to the timing of transmissions over the service control link as similarly discussed above with respect to the service control device link description. For example the timing functions such as asynchronous messages or polling for messages constant frequency transmission transmission based on how much service usage or data traffic usage has taken place transmission in response to device side control link message service verification error events other error events and or other message transmission trigger criteria can be determined controlled and or initiated by either the device side or the network side depending on the embodiment.

In some embodiments the service control server link provides for securing signing encrypting and or otherwise protecting the communications before sending such communications over the service control link . For example the service control server link can send to the transport layer or directly to the link layer for transmission. In another example the service control server link further secures the communications with transport layer encryption such as TCP TLS or another secure transport layer protocol. As another example the service control server link can encrypt at the link layer such as using IPSEC various possible VPN services other forms of IP layer encryption and or another link layer encryption technique.

In some embodiments the service control server link includes the agent heartbeat function in which the agents provide certain required reports to the service processor for the purpose of service policy implementation verification or for other purposes. For example the heartbeat function can also be used to issue queries or challenges messages service settings service control objectives information requests or polling error checks and or other communications to the agents. As another example agent heartbeat messages can be in the open or encrypted signed and or otherwise secured. Additional heartbeat function and the content of heartbeat messages can be provided as similarly described herein such as described above with respect to the service control device link and the access control integrity agent and other sections. In some embodiments the service controller and or agents of the service controller are programmed to periodically provide reports such as upon a heartbeat response e.g. an agent can repeatedly send necessary reports each heartbeat and appropriate actions can then be taken based upon such received reports. Accordingly the heartbeat function provides an important and efficient system in various embodiments described herein for verifying the service policy implementation and or protecting against compromise events. There are many other functions the agent heartbeat service can perform many of which are discussed herein while many others will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art given the principles design background and various embodiments provided herein.

In some embodiments the service control server link also provides a service control software download function for various embodiments which for example can include a download of new service software elements revisions of service software elements and or dynamic refreshes of service software elements of the service processor on the device. In some embodiments this function is performed by the service control server link transmitting the service control software as a single file over the service control link. For example the file can have encryption or signed encryption beyond any provided by the communication link protocol itself for service control link . In another example the service control software files can be segmented divided into smaller packets that are transmitted in multiple messages sent over the service control link . In yet another example the service control software files can be transmitted using other delivery mechanism such as a direct TCP socket connection from a service download control server which can also involve secure transport and additional levels of encryption. In some embodiments the service control server link and or service download control server use s an agent serial number and or a security key look up when agents are updated and or when a dynamic agent download occurs.

As shown in the service controller includes an access control integrity server . In some embodiments the access control integrity server collects device information on service policy service usage agent configuration and or agent behavior. For example the access control integrity server can cross check this information to identify integrity breaches in the service policy implementation and control system. In another example the access control integrity server can initiate action when a service policy violation or a system integrity breach is suspected.

In some embodiments the access control integrity server and or some other agent of service controller acts on access control integrity agent reports and error conditions. Many of the access control integrity agent checks can be accomplished by the server. For example the access control integrity agent checks include one or more of the following service usage measure against usage range consistent with policies e.g. usage measure from the network and or from the device configuration of agents operation of the agents and or dynamic agent download.

In some embodiments the access control integrity server and or some other agent of service controller verifies device service policy implementations by comparing various service usage measures e.g. based on network monitored information such as by using IPDRs and or local service usage monitoring information against expected service usage behavior given the policies that are intended to be in place. For example device service policy implementations can include measuring total data passed data passed in a period of time IP addresses data per IP address and or other measures such as location downloads email accessed URLs and comparing such measures expected service usage behavior given the policies that are intended to be in place.

In some embodiments the access control integrity server and or some other agent of service controller verifies device service policy and the verification error conditions that can indicate a mismatch in service measure and service policy include one or more of the following unauthorized network access e.g. access beyond ambient service policy limits unauthorized network speed e.g. average speed beyond service policy limit network data amount does not match policy limit e.g. device not stop at limit without re up revising service policy unauthorized network address unauthorized service usage e.g. VOIP email and or web browsing unauthorized application usage e.g. email VOIP email and or web service usage rate too high for plan and policy controller not controlling throttling it down and or any other mismatch in service measure and service policy.

In some embodiments the access control integrity server and or some other agent of service controller verifies device service policy based at least in part on for example various error conditions that indicate a mismatch in service measure and service policy. For example various verification error conditions that can indicate a mismatch in service measure and service policy include one or more of the following mismatch in one service measure and another service measure agent failure to report in agent failure to respond to queries e.g. challenge response sequence and or expected periodic agent reporting agent failure to respond correctly to challenge response sequence agent improperly configured agent failure in self checks agent failure in cross checks unauthorized agent communication or attempted unauthorized communication failure in service policy implementation test failure in service usage reporting test failure in service usage billing test failure in transaction billing test failure in download sequence environment compromise event such as unauthorized software load or execution or attempt unauthorized memory access or attempt unauthorized agent access or attempt known harmful software and or known harmful communications signature and or failure to respond to various messages such as send message and suspend and or send message and quarantine. In some embodiments the access control integrity server and or some other agent of service controller verifies device service policy by performing automated queries and analysis which are then reported e.g. anomalous suspicious report results can be reported for further analysis by a person responsible for determining whether such activities indicate out of policy activities or to provide information to the user to inform the user of such anomalous suspicious report results that may indicate out of policy activities . For example the user can review the report to authorize whether such activities were performed by the user e.g. website access requests specific transactions and or phone calls and or indicate that such activities were not authorized by the user e.g. indicate a potential compromise of the device such as by malware or other unauthorized software user use of the device . In another example the user can also be connected to communicate with service support of the service provider regarding such reported activities e.g. by text chat voice phone and or video conference to a service support . Accordingly in some embodiments the access control integrity server and or some other agent of service controller provides a policy service control integrity service to continually e.g. periodically and or based on trigger events verify that the service control of the device has not been compromised and or is not behaving out of policy.

In some embodiments upon detection of one or more service verification errors such as the various service verification errors discussed above the device is directed to a quarantine network status in which the device can for example only access network control plane functions billing functions and other functions generally controlled by the access network service provider or the central service provider. For example quarantine network access restrictions and routing can be accomplished with the access network AAA and routing system e.g. access network AAA server and one or more of the gateways or can be accomplished with device based access control or traffic control policy implementation. Quarantine network equipment or servers can for example be located within the access network or within another network with access to the access network. Communication with the quarantine network infrastructure can be accomplished for example with a secure link with one or more encryption levels or a dedicated private link. In some embodiments quarantining a device includes for example a two step process for routing quarantine network device traffic first to a quarantine traffic handling router or server and second from there to the actual quarantine network infrastructure with the route being determined by device parameters user parameters access service provider parameters or other parameters associated with the quarantine network routing. In some embodiments the device is completely suspended from the network in which for example the device can first issue a user interface message to the user or issuing another form of a message to the user or service subscriber such as via email hard copy message and or voice message. In some embodiments the device network access service capabilities and or traffic shaping are limited partially restricted or completely restricted service capabilities. For example these limitations and or restrictions can be implemented in the device and or in the network. For example implementing a device quarantine e.g. using a RADIUS server to quarantine the device can involve assigning the device to a different billing profile.

In some embodiments upon detection of one or more service verification errors such as the various service verification errors discussed above switch based port analysis is performed to further monitor the device e.g. referred to as Switched Port Analyzer SPAN on Cisco switches and various other vendors have different names for it such as Roving Analysis Port RAP on 3Com switches . In some embodiments the device service policy implementation behavior is monitored at a deeper level in the network by copying device traffic in the switch so that it goes to both an intended data path destination and to a specified port for switch based port analysis e.g. the traffic content can be analyzed and recorded using deep packet inspection DPI techniques which can provide a finer level of detail than the typical IPDR . For example an advantage of performing a switch based port analysis function is that the traffic need not be analyzed in real time and a sample subset of the devices on the network can be selected for such analysis based on for example either identifying devices that have suspect service policy implementation behavior and or a regular sampling algorithm that eventually samples all devices or some other selection approaches. As another example a scheduled switch based port analysis sampling can be applied that eventually rotates through all devices and designates a higher priority in the sampling queue for devices that are suspect.

In some embodiments switch based port analysis allows for off line sampled or non real time DPI as described above as a verification measure for the device based service control measures that are implemented. In some embodiments sophisticated DPI techniques are used to enhance the content of the IPDRs so that they provide detailed information that can be made available in the network. For example some of the DPI packet analysis may be redundant between the device and the network but this approach provides for a much finer grain validation for the device based service and less reliance on the device for some of the service traffic analysis that service providers need. In some embodiments the device control server functions and the service control policy verification functions are implemented in an integrated hardware software system e.g. a gateway server router switch base station base station aggregator AAA server cluster or any other hardware or hardware software system located in the network that the network level traffic inspection is accomplished in or in one or more servers integrated to operate in a coordinated manner with the DPI boxes. In some embodiments the device control server functions and the service control policy verification functions are implemented in an integrated hardware software system e.g. a gateway server router switch base station base station aggregator AAA server cluster or any other hardware or hardware software system located in the network that provides deep service control capability e.g. using DPI techniques for devices that have some or all of the service processor functions installed and in some embodiments also providing coarser network control of the basics for devices that do not have a service processor installed in the device e.g. such coarser network control functions include max data rate and or max total data .

In some embodiments the SPAN function is used in a revolving periodic manner as well to augment CDR data with deeper packet information for the purpose of spot checking device based service usage measures. Examples of where this can be beneficial include spot checking network address access policies spot checking ambient access policies spot checking billing event reports spot checking intermediate networking device end point device count via checking network source or destination addresses token cookies or other credentials etc . For example the periodic SPAN can be scheduled for all devices equally for certain devices or users with higher priority frequency or depth of SPAN than others higher priority higher frequency or immediate priority for devices with higher usage patterns or unusual usage patterns immediate or very high priority for devices with a policy violation status.

In some embodiments a combination traffic inspection and service control approach implements traffic and service control functions in the network that are conducive for a network based implementation and implements traffic and service control functions in the device that are either more conducive for performing in the device or can only be performed in the device e.g. activities involving inspection of traffic that is encrypted once it is transmitted to the network . For example using this approach activities that can be done in the network are generally performed in the network and or are more efficiently performed in the network than the device and activities that are more efficiently performed in the device or can only be performed in the device are performed in the device e.g. depending on device processing storage capabilities and or other design security considerations . For example the following are various traffic and service control functions that in some embodiments are preferably or can only be performed in the device network based packet processing capability limitations e.g. encrypted traffic application layer information unavailable once the traffic goes into the networking stack other application usage context information available on the device but not in the network information that is generally preferably maintained and processed locally in the device for network neutrality reasons e.g. network neutrality issues can generally be efficiently implemented by keeping all substantially all or at least some aspect of decisions on how to implement algorithms to control traffic local to the device and under user decision control and or by providing the user with a set of pre packaged choices on how to manage service usage or service activity usage or manage service usage versus service cost or price information that is generally preferably maintained and processed locally in the device for user privacy reasons e.g. deeper levels of traffic monitoring and service usage monitoring data where it is available for assisting the user in achieving the best lowest cost experience and implementing a CRM filter function to the user so that the user can control the level of CRM the network is allowed to receive such as with the higher levels of information being exchanged for something of value to the user and or user location information information that is generally preferably maintained and processed locally in the device for the purpose of informing the user of service control settings or service activity usage or to adjust service activity control settings or receive user feedback to choices regarding service usage policies or billing options e.g. providing the user with a UI for the purpose of monitoring an estimate of service usage and or notifying the user of at least some aspect of estimated service usage or projected service usage providing the user with a UI for the purpose of monitoring an estimate of service cost and or notifying the user of at least some aspect of estimated service cost or projected service cost providing the user with a UI for the purpose of providing the user with one or more service usage and or service cost notification messages that require user acknowledgement and or a user decision and obtaining or reporting the user acknowledgements and or decisions providing the user with a UI for the purpose of providing the user with service options and or service payment options providing the user with a UI for the purpose of obtaining user choice for such options when service usage or cost estimates are about to run over limits or have run over limits or are projected to run over limits providing the user with a UI for the purpose of monitoring or conducting open central billing transactions or other transactions providing the user with a UI for the purpose of selecting the service control techniques and or policies and or algorithms and or pre packaged configurations that can be used to define or partially define the service activity usage control policies implemented in the device service processor or the network service control equipment billing system or a combination of both service control for roaming on different networks that typically do not have compatible DPI type techniques with the home network certain service notification and traffic control algorithms e.g. stack ranked activity statistical analysis and control of only the high usage activities and or a function for assigning a device to a service experience or ambient activation experience or virtual service provider VSP at various times from manufacturing to device distribution to a user of the device. In some embodiments certain activities are implemented in the device as a solution for networks in which a new centralized DPI approach is not possible not economically feasible or for any number of reasons not an option or not a preferred option.

In some embodiments a network based solution is provided for a more basic set of services for all devices that do not have service control capabilities and a super set of services and or additional services are provided for devices that include a service processor. As described herein a service controller function can be located in various places in the network in accordance with various embodiments. It should also be noted that various other embodiments described herein also employ a hybrid service control function performing certain service control functions in the network e.g. collecting network service usage information such as IPDRs and or performing DPI related functions in the network for collecting network service usage information and or throttling shaping traffic and service control functions in the device e.g. service processor which for example monitors service usage in the device and or performs throttling or traffic shaping in the device and or performs certain billing event recording and reporting functions that are aptly performed on the device .

In some embodiments lower level service policy implementation embodiments are combined with a higher level set of service policy supervision functions to provide device assisted verifiable network access control authentication and authorization services.

In some embodiments device based access control services are extended and combined with other policy design techniques to create a simplified device activation process and connected user experience referred to herein as ambient activation. As similarly discussed above ambient activation can be provided by setting access control to a fixed destination verifying access with IPDRs verifying access by setting a max data rate and triggering off in the network if it exceeds the max data rate and or by various other techniques.

As shown in service controller includes a service history server . In some embodiments the service history server collects and records service usage or service activity reports from the Access Network AAA Server and the Service Monitor Agent . For example although service usage history from the network elements can in certain embodiments be less detailed than service history from the device the service history from the network can provide a valuable source for verification of device service policy implementation because for example it is extremely difficult for a device error or compromise event on the device to compromise the network based equipment and software. For example service history reports from the device can include various service tracking information as similarly described above. In some embodiments the service history server provides the service history on request to other servers and or one or more agents. In some embodiments the service history server provides the service usage history to the device service history . In some embodiments for purposes of facilitating the activation tracking service functions described below the service history server maintains a history of which networks the device has connected to. For example this network activity summary can include a summary of the networks accessed activity versus time per connection and or traffic versus time per connection. As another example this activity summary can further be analyzed or reported to estimate the type of service plan associated with the traffic activity for the purpose of bill sharing reconciliation.

As shown in service controller includes a policy management server . In some embodiments the policy management server transmits policies to the service processor via the service control link . In some embodiments the policy management server manages policy settings on the device e.g. various policy settings as described herein with respect to various embodiments in accordance with a device service profile. In some embodiments the policy management server sets instantaneous policies on policy implementation agents e.g. policy implementation agent . For example the policy management server can issue policy settings monitor service usage and if necessary modify policy settings. For example in the case of a user who prefers for the network to manage their service usage costs or in the case of any adaptive policy management needs the policy management server can maintain a relatively high frequency of communication with the device to collect traffic and or service measures and issue new policy settings. In this example device monitored service measures and any user service policy preference changes are reported periodically and or based on various triggers events requests to the policy management server . In this example user privacy settings generally require secure communication with the network e.g. a secure service control link such as with the policy management server to ensure that various aspects of user privacy are properly maintained during such configuration requests policy settings transmitted over the network. For example information can be compartmentalized to service policy management and not communicated to other databases used for CRM for maintaining user privacy.

In some embodiments the policy management server provides adaptive policy management on the device. For example the policy management server can issue policy settings and objectives and rely on the device based policy management e.g. service processor for some or all of the policy adaptation. This approach can require less interaction with the device thereby reducing network chatter on service control link for purposes of device policy management e.g. network chatter is reduced relative to various server network based policy management approaches described above . This approach can also provide robust user privacy embodiments by allowing the user to configure the device policy for user privacy preferences settings so that for example sensitive information e.g. geo location data website history is not communicated to the network without the user s approval. In some embodiments the policy management server adjusts service policy based on time of day. In some embodiments the policy management server receives requests or otherwise obtains a measure of network availability and adjusts traffic shaping policy and or other policy settings based on available network capacity.

In some embodiments the policy management server performs a service control algorithm to assist in managing overall network capacity or application QoS. In some embodiments the policy management server performs an algorithm to determine which access network is best to connect to such as based on network capacity or application QoS service usage costs and or any other criteria. In some embodiments the device is capable of connecting to more than one network and accordingly device service policies can be selected modified based on which network the device is connected to. In some embodiments the network control plane servers detect a network connection change from a first network to a second network and initiate the service policy implementation established for the second network. In other embodiments the device based adaptive policy control agent e.g. policy control agent described herein detects network connection changes from the first network to the second network and implements the service policies established for the second network.

In some embodiments when more than one access network is available the network is chosen based on which network is most preferred according to a network preference list or according to the network that optimizes a network cost function. For example the preference list can be pre established by the service provide and or the user. For example the network cost function can be based on a minimum service cost maximum network performance determining whether or not the user or device has access to the network maximizing service provider connection benefit reducing connections to alternative paid service providers and or a variety of other network preference criteria. In other embodiments the device detects when one or more preferred networks are not available implements a network selection function or intercepts other network selection functions and offers a connection to the available service network that is highest on a preference list. For example the preference list can be set by the service provider the user and or the service subscriber.

As shown in service controller includes a network traffic analysis server . In some embodiments the network traffic analysis server collects receives service usage history for devices and or groups of devices and analyzes the service usage. In some embodiments the network traffic analysis server presents service usage statistics in various formats to identify improvements in network service quality and or service profitability. In other embodiments the network traffic analysis server estimates the service quality and or service usage for the network under variable settings on potential service policy. In other embodiments the network traffic analysis server identifies actual or potential service behaviors by one or more devices that are causing problems for overall network service quality or service cost.

As shown in service controller includes a beta test server . In some embodiments the beta test server publishes candidate service plan policy settings to one or more devices. In some embodiments the beta test server provides summary reports of network service usage or user feedback information for one or more candidate service plan policy settings. In some embodiments the beta test server provides a mechanism to compare the beta test results for different candidate service plan policy settings or select the optimum candidates for further policy settings optimization.

As shown in service controller includes a service download control server . In some embodiments the service download control server provides a download function to install and or update service software elements e.g. the service processor and or agents components of the service processor on the device as described herein.

As shown in service controller includes a billing event server . In some embodiments the billing event server collects billing events provides service plan information to the service processor provides service usage updates to the service processor serves as interface between device and central billing server and or provides trusted third party function for certain ecommerce billing transactions.

As shown in the Access Network AAA server is in network communication with the access network . In some embodiments the Access Network AAA server provides the necessary access network AAA services e.g. access control and authorization functions for the device access layer to allow the devices onto the central provider access network and the service provider network. In some embodiments another layer of access control is required for the device to gain access to other networks such as the Internet a corporate network and or a machine to machine network. This additional layer of access control can be implemented for example by the service processor on the device. In some embodiments the Access Network AAA server also provides the ability to suspend service for a device and resume service for a device based on communications received from the service controller . In some embodiments the Access Network AAA server also provides the ability to direct routing for device traffic to a quarantine network or to restrict or limit network access when a device quarantine condition is invoked. In some embodiments the Access Network AAA server also records and reports device network service usage e.g. device network service usage can be reported to device service history .

As shown in the device service history is in network communication with the access network . In some embodiments the device service history provides service usage data records used for various purposes in various embodiments. In some embodiments the device service history is used to assist in verifying service policy implementation. In some embodiments the device service history is used to verify service monitoring. In some embodiments the device service history is used to verify billing records and or billing policy implementation. In some embodiments the device service history is used to synchronize and or verify the local service usage counter.

As shown in the central provider billing server is in network communication with the access network . In some embodiments the central provider billing server provides a mediation function for central provider billing events. For example the central provider billing server can accept service plan changes. In some embodiments the central provider billing server provides updates on device service usage service plan limits and or service policies. In some embodiments the central provider billing server collects billing events formulates bills bills service users provides certain billing event data and service plan information to the service controller and or device .

Establishing Coordinated Service and Verification Policies for Service Processor Service Controller and Network Functions

In some embodiments device and network apparatus coordinate one or more of the following network service policy implementation settings device service policy implementation settings network service profile implementation settings device service profile implementation settings network service usage measures used for the purpose of verifying service policy implementation device service usage measures used for the purpose of verifying service policy implementation network actions taken upon detection of service usage policy violation and device actions taken upon detection of service usage policy violation. In some embodiments local device settings for the service monitoring usage and or billing profile or policy settings used for example by a device service processor are associated with corresponding records for the various network apparatus that also rely upon the service policy and profile settings to monitor control and or bill for services or to respond to out of policy service usage conditions. For example such network apparatus include the service controller or similar functions the billing system or similar functions the network AAA gateways or other networking equipment. In some embodiments the service profile or policy settings are associated between the device and network in a manner that allows for effective and coordinated operation between the device service processor and the network apparatus but does not require an explicit function that simultaneously controls coordinates the service policy or profile implementation and or verification actions taken by the device e.g. the service processor and the network apparatus. As an example such embodiments can be applied in overlay applications as discussed below.

In some embodiments a network function e.g. the service controller and or more specifically the policy management server function or other similar function obtain derive or otherwise determine the association of the service profile or policy settings to program a device service processor and the various network apparatus functions e.g. possibly including but not limited to the service controller or similar functions the billing system or similar functions the network AAA gateways or other networking equipment by reading receiving querying pulling or otherwise obtaining the settings from one or more of the network apparatus functions or from a data base that stores the service policy or profile settings for one or more of the network apparatus functions. After obtaining one or more of the network apparatus settings a mapping e.g. an association of the network apparatus settings to the appropriate device service processor settings can be determined to advantageously support the service usage monitoring service usage control service usage billing or service usage verification objectives being addressed. The policy or profile settings for the device can be a direct translation of the policy or profile settings used for the network apparatus or the device policy or profile settings can be less directly derived from the network apparatus policy or profile settings. For example service usage limits contained in the billing system service plan can be either directly mapped to usage limit settings on the device service processor e.g. service usage stops when the limit is hit or the user is notified or the user is billed or the usage limits can be mapped to a number of service profiles the user may select from e.g. as discussed herein the user can select from options involving various actual usage versus usage limit notification policies and or service usage control limitations or throttling policies .

For example the service usage policy or profile limits or allowances maintained for the network apparatus functions e.g. the service profile or service plan usage limits stored in the billing system or AAA can be read or queried by a network function e.g. the service controller or the service controller through a second intermediary server connected to the billing system and or the AAA system and the service usage limits stored in these networking apparatus can be either directly translated to the settings for the service processor or may need to be interpreted expanded or otherwise modified to obtain the required service processor policy and or profile settings.

In some embodiments the service usage limits set in the billing system service plan record and or the service profile record stored in the AAA system can be acquired e.g. from the apparatus or from a database storing the settings for the apparatus by the service controller or another network function and directly translated and used to program the settings in the service processor . In some embodiments the service usage limits are determined or obtained by the activation server apparatus embodiments other apparatus embodiments associated with service activation or the virtual service provider embodiments as described herein. In this manner once the association of the service usage profile or policy settings used by a device service processor and the profile or policy settings used by the various network apparatus functions is established then the service policy or profile for service monitoring control billing verification and or actions taken on verification error can be coordinated between device and network even if some of the network functions act independent of some of the device functions.

For example associating the service usage policies and or profiles between the device service processor and the various network apparatus functions and then allowing for independent operation or action by the various functions in a manner that results in a coordinated outcome facilitates an overlay of the device assisted services technology onto existing network equipment in a manner that results in reliable and verifiable service enhancements while minimizing the need for major existing network equipment upgrades.

In some embodiments the association of the service profile or policy settings used by a device service processor and the service profile or policy settings used by the various network apparatus functions can be provided by a centralized network function that determines the appropriate settings for the network apparatus and the service processor and sets one or more settings to each function. In some embodiments this networking function is provided by a centralized network management function or service account activation function e.g. the activation server apparatus embodiments one of the other disclosed apparatus embodiments associated with service activation or the virtual service provider apparatus embodiments as described herein .

In some embodiments the association of the service profile or policy settings used by a device service processor and the service profile or policy settings used by the various network apparatus functions can be provided by a network function that by reads receives queries pulls or otherwise obtains the setting used by the service controller or the service processor . The network function can then determine the association of the service profile or policy settings used by a device service processor and the service profile or policy settings required by the various network apparatus functions before writing transmitting pushing or otherwise recording the appropriate settings required by each of the other network apparatus functions. In some embodiments this functionality can be implemented in the service controller e.g. the policy management server possibly acting in coordination with another network function or server which then links into the databases used for storing the policy or profile settings for the other network apparatus.

In some embodiments once the association is established between service policy or profile settings in the network apparatus and the service policy or profile settings in the service processor then the network based service usage measures e.g. IPDRs communicated to the billing system the AAA service controller or other network functions used to verify service usage and or take actions used for verification of device service usage versus service policy or profile can be monitored by the network apparatus e.g. billing system and AAA independent of coordination with the service processor and or independent of the service controller . In some embodiments in addition to independent monitoring and verification of service usage versus policy independent service profile or policy verification error response actions can be taken by the network apparatus e.g. suspend quarantine SPAN or flag device notify the user and possibly require acknowledgement or bill the user account for service usage overage without direct involvement by the service processor and or the service controller .

Accordingly the association between service profile and or service policy that is implemented on the device e.g. service processor and the service profile and or policy usage limits recorded in network apparatus can be associated with one another by one or more of the following A implementing a function to read from the network database e.g. the billing data base AAA data base service controller data base etc. and mapping the network profiles and or policies to device e.g. service processor profiles and or policies B implementing a function that simultaneously sets the device profile and or policy and the network equipment profile and or policy recorded in the appropriate data base records and C implementing a function that reads the profile and or policy on the device e.g. service processor or the service controller and then sets the network equipment profile and or policy recorded in the appropriate data base records. This allows for a simplified but coordinated response to monitoring controlling and billing for service usage for verifying service usage versus service usage profile or policy and or initiating or carrying out network actions in response to service usage versus profile or policy verification errors and or device actions in response to service usage versus profile or policy verification errors.

Referring to in some embodiments many of the service policy implementation verification and compromise protection techniques are similarly provided using these simplified configurations of the service processor and the service controller as described above with respect to for example . For example the service control device link and service control server link can be used for downloading service policies to the policy implementation agent but in some embodiments cannot perform the heartbeat or authentication function .

For example a basic service profile or service policy implementation verification technique for this reduced configuration calls for the access control integrity server to obtain IPDRs from access network AAA server or e.g. or other network functions as described herein and compare the service usage exhibited by device with a range of expected service usage that would be expected if the intended service policies were in place on the device. In some embodiments the access control integrity server initiates or carries out one or more of the service usage profile or policy verification error response actions disclosed herein including for example one or more of the following notify the user of the out of policy or overage condition require the user to acknowledge the condition and or acknowledge a subsequent billing event to proceed bill the user for service overage suspend the device from the network quarantine the device SPAN the device or notify a network manager or device management or error handling function.

In some embodiments a service profile or service policy implementation verification technique for this reduced configuration calls for the billing system to obtain IPDRs from access network AAA server or or other network functions as discussed herein and compare the service usage exhibited by device with a range of expected service usage that would be expected if the intended service policies were in place on the device. In some embodiments the billing system initiates or carries out one or more of the service usage profile or policy verification error response actions disclosed herein including for example one or more of the following notify the user of the out of policy or overage condition require the user to acknowledge the condition and or acknowledge a subsequent billing event to proceed bill the user for service overage suspend the device from the network quarantine the device SPAN the device or notify a network manager or device management or error handling function.

In some embodiments a service profile or service policy implementation verification technique for this reduced configuration calls for the AAA server or itself to compare the service usage exhibited by device with a range of expected service usage that would be expected if the intended service policies were in place on the device. In some embodiments the AAA server or initiates or carries out one or more of the service usage profile or policy verification error response actions disclosed herein including for example one or more of the following notify the user of the out of policy or overage condition require the user to acknowledge the condition and or acknowledge a subsequent billing event to proceed bill the user for service overage suspend the device from the network quarantine the device SPAN the device or notify a network manager or device management or error handling function.

Accordingly this approach provides a basic first layer of service policy implementation verification that does not depend on device based agent behavior for the verification. If the service policy is in error in a way that violates the expected service policy usage limits then the access control integrity server will detect this condition and appropriate action can be taken. In some embodiments if one or more service policy integrity verification tests fail the appropriate responsive actions can include routing the device to quarantine status sending an error message to the device or device user interface and then suspend access for the device and or limiting access in some way without completely suspending access as similarly described above. In some embodiments if one or more service policy integrity verification tests fail the appropriate responsive actions can include logging excess service usage above the intended service policy limits and billing the user for some or all of the excess usage sending the user a notification and or acknowledgement response request possibly including a simple keystroke acknowledgement or a password a biometric signature or other secure response and or limiting access in some way without completely suspending access as similarly described above.

In some embodiments a billing system technique provides another verification overlay. For example the service processor can have a set of service policy implementations or service profile that calls for maintaining service usage within a certain limit or assisting the user or network to maintain service usage to that limit. The billing system can be implemented in a way to provide a back stop to the service usage controls or limits provided for by the service processor so that even if the service processor is compromised hacked spoofed or is otherwise in error the billing system protects the service provider service owner carrier VSP or network operator from unpaid access beyond the service limits. This can be accomplished for example by assigning a service usage limit within the billing system so that if the service processor is compromised and the service usage runs over the desired limit the billing system automatically charges the user account for the overage. The billing system can receive service usage information from the IPDRs that are aggregated in the network as in the case of a conventional billing system and because these network based measures are independent from the device agent operation they cannot be spoofed by merely spoofing something on the device or service processor . In this manner defeating the service processor service agent control mechanisms described herein simply results in a billing charge and not free service. In some embodiments if the service usage runs over the service usage limit specified in the service profile the user can be notified as discussed herein and the user can be required to acknowledge the overage and approve a billing charge for the overage as also discussed herein with the acknowledgement being communicated back to the network in some embodiments. This positive acknowledgement also provides a layer of protection and verification of the service control and usage limit control for the device service processor . In some embodiment also discussed herein the user is requested to input a password biometric or other secure response to the usage overage notification providing yet another layer of protection to verify that the user intends to pay for the service usage overage. In these embodiments taken individually or in combination the service processor assistance for service usage control can be verified and or protected from compromise.

In some embodiments the service control device link and service control server link are used to implement the service processor heartbeat authentication and communication functions to strengthen the verification of a proper service policy implementation of the embodiments of . For example the heartbeat function can be used as authentication for service monitoring versus network reports. In addition the heartbeat function can be used as authentication for challenge response queries of agents. Also the heartbeat function can be used as authentication for access control. In some embodiments to strengthen verification of the basic system illustrated in the communication access to the policy implementation agent is restricted so that software or hardware on device and or on a network cannot have authorized access to the policy implementation agent . For example authorized access to the policy implementation agent can be restricted to include only the service controller through the service control device link and the service control server link . For example the agent control bus can be secured with encryption and or other security techniques so that only the service control device link can have authorized access to the policy implementation agent . As another example the agent level message encryption can be used as described herein.

In some embodiments the service policy implementation agent of the embodiments of can be further strengthened against errors intrusion tampering hacking and or other inadvertent or intentional integrity degradation by using various other techniques. For example the dynamic agent download feature of the service controller can download a new version of the policy implementation agent . In this example the new agent code can be identical in functionality and also hashed obfuscated or ordered differently before signing and encryption so that any hacking attempt must be reinitiated and this process can be periodically repeated or repeated upon a triggering event. Additionally once the new dynamically loaded agent is in place it can be required to perform an environment scan to determine if the system configuration or operation are as expected and or it can seek to detect elements in the execution environment that can be harmful or threatening to the integrity of the policy implementation. The agent can also be required to report back on the scan within a relatively short period of time so that any attempt to compromise the agent does not have sufficient time to be effective.

In some embodiments the service policy implementation agent of the embodiments of can be further strengthened to protect the policy implementation from compromise attempts by locating the software and or hardware used onto an access modem associated with the service. For example the modem can make it difficult to get access to the policy implementation agent by employing one or more security elements on one or more access ports into the modem such as the device bus an I O port a network connection or the debug port. The modem can also store and or execute the policy implementation agent in secure memory. The modem can also require a secure download key or a secure software signature to accept any updates to the agent software.

In some embodiments the service policy implementation agent of the embodiments of can be further strengthened against compromise attempts by performing scans of the device code execution environment and or code storage environment to identify potentially malicious and or unwanted untrusted software or hardware. For example this function can be performed by the policy implementation agent . The agent can have a local database of potentially malicious elements and compare the entries in the database against the elements detected locally using various malicious code behavior blocking intrusion detection and or other well known techniques for security analysis. Alternatively or in addition the agent can communicate a list of some or all of the elements detected locally to the service controller to augment or take the place of the database comparison function that can be performed locally thereby performing such or further such security analysis on the network e.g. by the service controller and in some embodiments if not automatically detected such elements detected locally e.g. and or samples of such detected potentially malicious code or logs of potentially malicious suspicious behavior intrusions forwarded to security analysts for the service provider for further security analysis e.g. service provider security analysts and or an outside security vendor engaged to protect the service provider s network and supported devices . In some embodiments the agent detects new software downloads installs and or invocations and immediately issues an error flag report when potentially malicious software is downloaded installed or invoked e.g. file and network based on access security detection techniques . In some embodiments the agent scans the local software loading and invocation activity along with a log of other software runtime events and regularly reports this trace so that when an error or compromise event occurs the trace preceding the event can be analyzed to determine the offending software or activity trace that took place to cause the compromise or error. For example once the software or activity that caused the compromise is known or otherwise detected it can be entered into a refreshed version of the database that the device and other devices use to detect potentially malicious precursor conditions. Examples of such precursor events can include software invocations software downloads a sequence of memory I O events a sequence of software access events a sequence of network address or URL communications or downloads or a sequence of access modem I O activity.

As shown in measurement point I occurs at the application interface agent interface to the applications. At this measurement point the application traffic can be monitored before it is framed packetized or encrypted by the lower layers of the networking stack. For example this allows inspection characterization tagging literal or virtual and in some embodiments shaping or control of services or traffic. At this measurement point traffic can be more readily associated with applications URLs or IP addresses content type service type and other higher level parameters. For example at this level email traffic and downloads web browser applications and end points media file transfers application traffic demand URL traffic demand and other such service monitoring parameters are more readily observed e.g. accessible in the clear without the need for deep packet inspection and or decryption recorded and possibly shaped or controlled. As described herein it is also possible to monitor upstream traffic demand at this point and compare it to the other measurement points to determine if the traffic policies in place are meeting overall traffic control policy objectives or to determine if traffic policy implementation is operating properly. For example the downstream delivered traffic can be optimally observed at this measurement point.

As shown in traffic measurement points II and III are situated on the upstream and downstream sides of policy implementation agent . As described herein these two locations allow potential tracking of upstream and downstream traffic through the stack portions associated with the policy implementation agent . These two locations also provide for potential cross checking of how the policy implementation agent is impacting the demand and delivery of traffic. In a similar manner measurement point III in connection with measurement point IV provide an opportunity for packet tracing through the stack components associated with the modem firewall and provide for the opportunity to observe the demand and delivery sides of the modem firewall . Traffic measurement point V provides the potential for observing the traffic at the modem bus drivers for each of the modems.

As shown in traffic measurement point VI provides in some embodiments the ultimate measure of access traffic for example the traffic that actually transacts over the access network through the modem. As shown measurement point VI is at the modem side of the internal or external communications bus and it will be appreciated that in some embodiments this measurement point can be further down the modem stack closer to the MAC or physical layer e.g. at the designer s discretion . An advantage of having a measurement point deep in the modem is for example that if the software or hardware that implements the measurement and reporting is well secured against compromise then this measure can be almost as strong from a verification perspective as the measure that comes from the network e.g. from the network elements . Accordingly this makes it possible to compare this measure against the other measures to determine if there is a traffic path that is leaking past the other measurement point or one or more policy implementation points.

In some embodiments it is desirable to provide a control plane between the service processor and the service controller using a flexible connection or communication path that for example will work between virtually any two network connection endpoints one being the service controller and one being the device in a secure yet scalable manner. In view of the embodiments described herein one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that it is possible to achieve such features with a variety of different embodiments that share similar core features to the embodiments described herein.

As described herein there are numerous ways to implement the control plane communication channel between the service processor and the service controller . Various embodiments described herein disclose a secure and bandwidth efficient control plane that is compatible with any IP based network including the ability to locate the service controller over the Internet provides for consistent device assisted service monitoring control verification and or billing while roaming across multiple networks with different access technologies and allows continuous device assisted service control verification and or authentication with a variety of mechanisms for setting the transmission heartbeat frequency. Other techniques that could be used for this function include for example encapsulating the control plane in the access network control plane channel encapsulating the control plane in IP or data packet framing mechanisms e.g. IPV6 running a more conventional VPN or IPSEC channel and or using an independent access network connection.

In some embodiments all of the service control device link communications are transformed into a continuous control plane connection with a frequency based on the rate of service usage a minimum set period between connections and or other methods for establishing communication frequency. In some embodiments this heartbeat function provides a continuous verification link by which the service controller verifies that the service processor and or device are operating properly with the correct service policies being implemented. In view of the following heartbeat function embodiments described herein it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that different approaches for implementing the various heartbeat embodiments are possible and it will be clear that there are many ways to achieve the essential features enabling a reliable sometimes continuous control link and verification function for the purpose of assisting control of service usage in a verifiable manner. As shown inside the service processor the service control device link includes a heartbeat send counter in communication with the agent communication bus . For example the heartbeat send counter can provide a count for triggering when a service processor communication e.g. periodic communication based on a heartbeat mechanism should be sent to the service controller and a heartbeat buffer also in communication with the agent communication bus buffers any such information for the next service processor communication in accordance with various heartbeat based embodiments as similarly described herein. The heartbeat buffer is in communication with a framing element and an encrypt element for framing and encrypting any service processor communications transmitted to the service controller by a transport services stack over the service control link . Similarly as shown inside the service controller the service control server link includes a heartbeat send counter in communication with a service controller network a heartbeat buffer also in communication with the service controller network buffers any such information for the next service controller communication in accordance with various heartbeat based embodiments as similarly described herein. The heartbeat buffer is in communication with a framing element and an encrypt element for framing and encrypting any such service controller communications transmitted to the service processor by a transport services stack over the service control link .

As also shown inside the service processor of the service control device link includes a decode element for decoding any received service controller communications e.g. decrypting encrypted communications an unpack element for unpacking the received service controller communications e.g. assembling packetized communications and an agent route for routing the received service controller communications e.g. commands instructions heartbeat related information or status reports policy related information or configuration settings and or updates challenge response queries agent refreshes and or new software for installation to the appropriate agent of the service processor . Similarly as shown inside the service controller the service control server link also includes a decode element for decoding any received service processor communications e.g. decrypting encrypted communications an unpack element for unpacking the received service processor communications e.g. assembling packetized communications and an agent route for routing the received service processor communications e.g. responses to instructions and or commands heartbeat related information or status reports policy related information or configuration settings and or updates challenge response queries agent status information network service cost usage and or any other reporting related information to the appropriate agent of the service controller . Accordingly as described herein with respect to various embodiments the various secure communications between the service controller and the service processor can be performed using the embodiment as shown in and those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that a variety of other embodiments can be used to similarly provide the various secure communications between the service controller and the service processor e.g. using different software and or hardware architectures to provide secure communications such as using additional and or fewer elements functions or other design choices for providing such secure communications .

In some embodiments an efficient and effective communication framing structure between the service processor and service controller is provided and the following embodiments e.g. as shown and described with respect to teach such a structure that packs the various service processor agent control plane communications and the various service controller element control plane connections into a format that does not consume excessive bandwidth to enable a continuous control plane connection between the device and service controller. In some embodiments an efficient and effective communication framing structure between the service processor and service controller is provided to buffer such communication messages for some period of time before framing and transmitting such as in a heartbeat frequency that is based on rate of service usage. In some embodiments an efficient and effective communication framing structure between the service processor and service controller is provided to allow for the frame to be easily packed encrypted decoded unpacked and the messages distributed. In view of the various embodiments described herein it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many framing structures will work for the intended purpose of organizing or framing agent communications and the uniqueness and importance of combining such a system element with the device service controller functions the service processor functions the service control verification functions and or the other purposes.

As described below various techniques are disclosed for implementing device assisted traffic shaping and service control at the lower levels of service usage policy implementation.

In some embodiments the service monitor agent and or other agents implement virtual traffic tagging by tracking or tracing packet flows through the various communication stack formatting processing and encryption steps and providing the virtual tag information to the various agents that monitor control shape throttle or otherwise observe manipulate or modify the traffic. This tagging approach is referred to herein as virtual tagging because there is not a literal data flow traffic flow or packet tag that is attached to flows or packets and the book keeping to tag the packet is done through tracking or tracing the flow or packet through the stack instead. In some embodiments the application interface and or other agents identify a traffic flow associate it with a service usage activity and cause a literal tag to be attached to the traffic or packets associated with the activity. This tagging approach is referred to herein as literal tagging. There are various advantages with both the virtual tagging and the literal tagging approaches. For example it can be preferable in some embodiments to reduce the inter agent communication required to track or trace a packet through the stack processing by assigning a literal tag so that each flow or packet has its own activity association embedded in the data. As another example it can be preferable in some embodiments to re use portions of standard communication stack software or components enhancing the verifiable traffic control or service control capabilities of the standard stack by inserting additional processing steps associated with the various service agents and monitoring points rather than re writing the entire stack to correctly process literal tagging information and in such cases a virtual tagging scheme may be desired. As yet another example some standard communication stacks provide for unused unspecified or otherwise available bit fields in a packet frame or flow and these unused unspecified or otherwise available bit fields can be used to literally tag traffic without the need to re write all of the standard communication stack software with only the portions of the stack that are added to enhance the verifiable traffic control or service control capabilities of the standard stack needing to decode and use the literal tagging information encapsulated in the available bit fields. In the case of literal tagging in some embodiments the tags are removed prior to passing the packets or flows to the network or to the applications utilizing the stack. In some embodiments the manner in which the virtual or literal tagging is implemented can be developed into a communication standard specification so that various device or service product developers can independently develop the communication stack and or service processor hardware and or software in a manner that is compatible with the service controller specifications and the products of other device or service product developers.

It will be appreciated that although the implementation use of any or all of the measurement points illustrated in is not required to have an effective implementation such as was similarly shown with respect to various embodiments described herein such as with respect to various embodiments can benefit from these and or similar measurement points. It will also be appreciated that the exact measurement points can be moved to different locations in the traffic processing stack just as the various embodiments described herein can have the agents affecting policy implementation moved to different points in the traffic processing stack while still maintaining effective operation. In some embodiments one or more measurement points are provided deeper in the modem stack e.g. such as for embodiments similarly described herein with respect to where for example it is more difficult to circumvent and can be more difficult to access for tampering purposes if the modem is designed with the proper software and or hardware security to protect the integrity of the modem stack and measurement point s .

Referring to describing the device communications stack from the bottom to the top of the stack as shown the device communications stack provides a communication layer for each of the modems of the device at the bottom of the device communications stack. Example measurement point VI resides within or just above the modem driver layer. For example the modem driver performs modem bus communications data protocol translations modem control and configuration to interface the networking stack traffic to the modem. As shown measurement point VI is common to all modem drivers and modems and it is advantageous for certain embodiments to differentiate the traffic or service activity taking place through one modem from that of one or more of the other modems. In some embodiments measurement point VI or another measurement point is located over within or below one or more of the individual modem drivers. The respective modem buses for each modem reside between example measurement points V and VI. In the next higher layer a modem selection control layer for multimode device based communication is provided. In some embodiments this layer is controlled by a network decision policy that selects the most desirable network modem for some or all of the data traffic and when the most desirable network is not available the policy reverts to the next most desirable network until a connection is established provided that one of the networks is available. In some embodiments certain network traffic such as verification control redundant or secure traffic is routed to one of the networks even when some or all of the data traffic is routed to another network. This dual routing capability provides for a variety of enhanced security enhanced reliability or enhanced manageability devices services or applications. In the next higher layer a modem firewall is provided. For example the modem firewall provides for traditional firewall functions but unlike traditional firewalls in order to rely on the firewall for verifiable service usage control such as access control and security protection from unwanted networking traffic or applications the various service verification techniques and agents described herein are added to the firewall function to verify compliance with service policy and prevent tampering of the service controls. In some embodiments the modem firewall is implemented farther up the stack possibly in combination with other layers as indicated in other figures. In some embodiments a dedicated firewall function or layer is provided that is independent of the other processing layers such as the policy implementation layer the packet forwarding layer and or the application layer. In some embodiments the modem firewall is implemented farther down the stack such as within the modem drivers below the modem drivers or in the modem itself. Example measurement point IV resides between the modem firewall layer and an IP queuing and routing layer. As shown an IP queuing and routing layer is separate from the policy implementation layer where the policy implementation agent implements a portion of the traffic control and or service usage control policies. As described herein in some embodiments these functions are separated so that a standard network stack function can be used for IP queuing and routing and the modifications necessary to implement the policy implementation agent functions can be provided in a new layer inserted into the standard stack. In some embodiments the IP queuing and routing layer is combined with the traffic or service usage control layer. Examples of this combined functionality are shown and described with respect to . For example a combined routing and policy implementation layer embodiment can also be used with the other embodiments such as shown in . Various detailed embodiments describing how the policy implementation layer can control traffic or other service usage activities are described with respect to . Measurement point III resides between the IP queuing and routing layer and a policy implementation agent layer. Measurement point II resides between the policy implementation agent layer and the transport layer including TCP UDP and other IP as shown. The session layer resides above the transport layer which is shown as a socket assignment and session management e.g. basic TCP setup TLS SSL layer. The network services API e.g. HTTP HTTPS FTP File Transfer Protocol SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol POP3 DNS resides above the session layer. Measurement point I resides between the network services API layer and an application layer shown as application service interface agent in the device communications stack of .

As shown the application service interface layer is above the standard networking stack API and in some embodiments its function is to monitor and in some cases intercept and process the traffic between the applications and the standard networking stack API. In some embodiments the application service interface layer identifies application traffic flows before the application traffic flows are more difficult or practically impossible to identify farther down in the stack. In some embodiments the application service interface layer in this way assists application layer tagging in both the virtual and literal tagging cases. In the case of upstream traffic the application layer tagging is straight forward because the traffic originates at the application layer. In some downstream embodiments where the traffic or service activity classification relies on traffic attributes that are readily obtainable such as source address or URL application socket address IP destination address time of day or any other readily obtained parameter the traffic type can be identified and tagged for processing by the firewall agent or another agent as it initially arrives. In other embodiments as described herein in the downstream case the solution is generally more sophisticated when a traffic parameter that is needed to classify the manner in which the traffic flow is to be controlled or throttled is not readily available at the lower levels of the stack such as association with an aspect of an application type of content something contained within TLS IPSEC or other secure format or other information associated with the traffic. Accordingly in some embodiments the networking stack identifies the traffic flow before it is fully characterized categorized or associated with a service activity and then passes the traffic through to the application interface layer where the final classification is completed. In such embodiments the application interface layer then communicates the traffic flow ID with the proper classification so that after an initial short traffic burst or time period the policy implementation agents can properly control the traffic. In some embodiments there is also a policy for tagging and setting service control policies for traffic that cannot be fully identified with all sources of tagging including application layer tagging.

Various applications and or a user service interface agent communicate via this communications stack as shown illustrating such communications with a reference A . Also the billing agent which is in communication with the agent communication bus communicates user information and decision query and or user input to the user service interface agent as shown. The policy control agent communicates service settings and or configuration information via this communications bus as shown illustrating such communications with a reference B via the application layer policy implementation agent layer which is lower in the communications stack as shown and or the modem firewall layer .

Various other communications e.g. service processor and or service controller related communications such as service usage measure information and or application information are provided at various levels of this communications stack as shown illustrating such communications with references D at the application layer E at the policy implementation agent layer and F at the modem firewall layer .

As shown in a service monitor agent which is also in communication with the agent communication bus communicates with various layers of the device communications stack. For example the service monitor agent performs monitoring at each of measurement points I through VI receiving information including application information service usage and other service related information and assignment information. An access control integrity agent is in communication with the service monitor agent via the agent communications bus as also shown.

In some embodiments one or more of the networking stack modifications described herein in combination one or more of the service verification and tamper prevention techniques described herein is provided. As similarly described with respect to the various example embodiments for assisting service control verification described herein and as summarized in the example tables provided in can be employed individually or in combination to create increasingly secure cross functional service control verification embodiments. In the presence of the access control integrity agent policy control agent service monitor agent and the other agents that perform verification and or tamper prevention functions illustrates verifiable service control aspects in accordance with some embodiments. Furthermore the presence of the billing agent combined with the service verification and or tamper prevention agents and techniques described herein provides for a set of verifiable billing embodiments for service billing service billing offset corrections bill by account transaction billing and other billing functions. In addition the presence of the user service interface agent in combination with the service control agent functions in the modified networking stack provide for embodiments involving a combination of service control with user preferences which as described herein provides the user with the capability to optimize service versus service cost in a network neutral manner. In some embodiments the user control of service control policy is provided along with the service control verification and or tamper prevention. The presence of the policy control agent that in some embodiments implements a higher than most basic level of policy decision and control with the policy implementation agents in the modified networking stack allows for for example the device to possess the capability to implement a higher level of service control for the purpose of obtaining a higher level service usage or service activity objective. In some embodiments the application layer tagging in combination with other embodiments described herein provides for deep service activity control that is verifiable.

In some embodiments verifiable traffic shaping as described herein can be performed using the device communications stack in a variety of embodiments for the combination of service control within the networking stack and service control verification and or tamper prevention with various embodiments depicted in . Additional levels of detail regarding how such embodiments can be used to implement verifiable traffic shaping are provided in and described with respect to which depict example functional diagrams of packet processing flows for verifiable traffic shaping or service activity control in a device service processor for both upstream and downstream flows. Along with several other interesting features embodied in application traffic layer tagging is depicted in additional detail in accordance with some embodiments. For example the application interface agent can determine service data usage at the application layer using measurement point I and a local service usage counter and can for example pass this information to the service monitor agent. If service usage exceeds a threshold or if using a service usage prediction algorithm results in predicted service usage that will exceed a threshold then the user can be notified of which applications are causing the service usage overrun or potential service usage overrun via the user service interface agent. The user can then identify which application service e.g. traffic associated with a specified high service use or non critical application such as for example a high bandwidth consumption social networking website or service media streaming website or service or any other high bandwidth website or service transmitting and or receiving data with the service network that the user prefers to throttle. As another example the user could select a service policy that allows for video chat services until those services threaten to cause cost over runs on the user s service plan and at that time the service policy could switch the chat service to voice only and not transmit or receive the video. The traffic associated with the user specified application can then be throttled according to user preference input. For example for downstream traffic packets e.g. packets that are virtually or literally tagged and or otherwise associated with the application traffic to be throttled from the access network can be buffered delayed and or dropped to throttle the identified application traffic. For upstream traffic packets e.g. packets that are virtually or literally tagged and or otherwise associated with the application traffic to be throttled can be buffered delayed and or dropped before being transmitted to the access network to throttle the identified application traffic. As similarly described above traffic shaping as described herein can be verified such as by the service monitor agent via the various measurement points and or using other agents.

The embodiments depicted in and other figures generally require enhancements to conventional device networking communication stack processing. For example these enhancements can be implemented in whole or in part in the kernel space for the device OS in whole or in part in the application space for the device or partially in kernel space and partially in application space. As described herein the networking stack enhancements and the other elements of the service processor can be packaged into a set of software that is pre tested or documented to enable device manufacturers to quickly implement and bring to market the service processor functionality in a manner that is compatible with the service controller and the applicable access network s . For example the service processor software can also be specified in an interoperability standard so that various manufacturers and software developers can develop service processor implementations or enhancements or service controller implementations or enhancements that are compatible with one another.

In some embodiments the burst size buffer delay acknowledgement delay and drop rate used in upstream and downstream traffic shaping are optimized with the goal of reducing access network traffic overhead and excess capacity usage that can result from mismatches in traffic transmission parameters with the access network MAC and PHY or from excess network level packet delivery protocol re transmissions. In some embodiments an application interface agent is used to literally tag or virtually tag application layer traffic so that the policy implementation agent s has the necessary information to implement selected traffic shaping solutions. As shown in the application interface agent is in communication with various applications including a TCP application an IP application and a voice application .

Referring to in some embodiments the upstream traffic service policy implementation step corresponds to the traffic shaping step described herein. Referring to this step is depicted as shown as an alternate exploded view including four upstream sub steps of apply QoS queue priority apply traffic shaping rules network optimized buffer delay and remove application ID tag. An additional approach shown in involves two exploded view sub steps associated with the firewall service policy implementation step and these sub steps are pass block packet and pass redirect packet. For example the functions performed by these six sub steps can be depicted in any number of sub steps the order of the steps can be appropriately performed in various different orders to provide for upstream traffic shaping within the network communication stack. For example show the two steps of policy implementation and firewall as one step and the six exploded view sub steps are included under the same policy implementation step and are performed in a different order than in . It should also be noted that a number of embodiments are possible in which the access control traffic control or firewall functions are moved to the application service interface layer or another layer.

Referring now to the downstream portion of there are two steps again termed traffic service policy implementation and firewall service policy implementation in this traffic shaping access control and firewall example. These two packet flow processing steps are depicted as shown in the exploded view as the five sub steps of tag with flow ID pass block packet apply QoS apply traffic shaping rules and network optimized buffer delay and drop. As with the upstream packet processing flow the number of sub steps the order of sub steps and the location of the sub steps in the downstream networking stack processing can be depicted in any number of sub steps order and or location and various other embodiments will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art including embodiments which locate some or all of the steps in the application service interface layer or other layers as depicted in . The details of the packet flow processing design for the downstream can be somewhat more complex in certain embodiments as compared to the upstream processing in two ways. First as described herein in some embodiments the packet tagging that requires application level information can require the initial portion of the packet flow burst to pass through the upstream networking communication stack until the application service interface layer can associate the packet flow with the appropriate information visible at the application level at which time the packet flow tag is communicated to the other service processor agent functions so that they can properly monitor or control the traffic associated with the flow.

Independently another complication arises when upper layer reliable communication protocols such as TCP are employed in the networking stack in which the downstream transmitting end repeats the packet transmission if the receiving TCP protocol stack does not send a packet receipt acknowledge ACK within a certain period of time. If packets are arbitrarily delayed or dropped then the TCP re transmission traffic can reduce completely eliminate or even reverse the network capacity advantage gained by reducing the average traffic speed or other transmission quality measure for one or more service activities. To solve this problem in some embodiments the packet traffic control parameters e.g. downstream delay drops burst length burst frequency and or burst jitter are optimized for TCP re transmission efficiency so that changes in traffic control access bandwidth or speed for one or more service activities are implemented in such a manner that the TCP re transmission delay at the network transmitting end adapts to be long enough so that wasted packet re transmission bandwidth is reduced. In addition and either in combination or in isolation in some embodiments the packet traffic control parameters e.g. downstream delay drops burst length burst frequency and or burst jitter can be adjusted so that the access network downstream MAC and or PHY efficiencies are optimized.

Numerous other embodiments for the detailed implementation of packet flow processing in both downstream and upstream will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the various embodiments described herein. In some embodiments as described herein the following are provided A traffic shaping is performed in a verifiable manner B traffic shaping is performed in a manner that results in improved network capacity by taking into account to some degree the manner in which the access network PHY layer and or MAC layer responds to packet parameters e.g. burst delay burst drops burst length burst frequency and or burst jitter C traffic shaping is performed in a manner that results in improved network capacity by taking into account how the packet parameters e.g. burst delay burst drops burst length burst frequency and or burst jitter impact layer 3 and higher ACK protocol or other network protocol network capacity efficiencies D packet shaping is performed in a manner that is aware of and optimized for the particular type of communication protocol or packets being sent e.g. TCP packets can be dropped to slow the application rate of transfer whereas UDP packets are never dropped because there is no re transmission E a virtual or literal packet tagging system is used in a verifiable traffic shaping service control system to provide a deeper level of service monitoring and control or to simplify the processing of the packets and or F starting with these low level packet processing traffic control or access control building blocks one or more additional layers of higher level policy control can be added on the device or in the network to create service profiles for the service provider network that define complete services such as ambient services and many other variations of service profile settings that each define a device or user service experience and can be associated with a billing plan. For example the use of higher layers of service profile control to form more complete service solutions starting with these relatively simple low level traffic control access control or firewall processing steps or functions is also described herein.

In some embodiments QoS is employed for devices with a service processor . For example QoS can be employed in a crowded hot spot where the service processor profile has been changed from WWAN to WLAN but the WLAN is backed up as too many users are trying to use it. The service processor can have a hierarchical access to the hotspot at that point or the service processor that pays less can be throttled while those that pay more are opened up or the service processor can initiate a policy that slows down transmissions to improve trunking efficiency.

Referring now to in another set of embodiments an open decentralized device based system for enabling central billing for third party electronic commerce transactions for mobile commerce is provided as shown. For example in these embodiments device information can be embedded in HTTP WAP or other portal browser network header request information that indicates a central billing option is available to a compatible third party transaction server as further described below with respect to .

In some embodiments device information can be embedded in HTTP WAP or other portal browser network header request information that indicates a central billing option is available to a compatible third party transaction server such as the open content transaction partner site s . For example the compatible transaction server can then send a signed confirmation request over a pre assigned control socket channel to the billing agent with the billing agent confirming the signed confirmation request by either performing the signature check locally based on a stored and synchronized list of approved transaction servers or by passing the signed request onto a billing server for confirmation. Optionally in another example a triangle confirmation can be set up in which the billing server can confirm the transaction set up with the transaction server or the transaction server can confirm the transaction set up with the billing server . Once the device confirms the compatible and approved status of the transaction server the device transaction server pair can then optionally further exchange keys for the remainder of the transaction for enhanced security. In another example the transaction server can also redirect the user browsing experience to one tailored to one or more of device type service provider device manufacturer or user. When the user selects a transaction the transaction server sends the billing agent a transaction bill that describes the transaction and the amount. The billing agent can optionally confirm that the user account has sufficient credit limit to make the purchase by either confirming the stored credit limit on the device or querying the billing server . The billing agent then invokes the device UI to display the transaction description and amount and request user approval for the billing to be conducted through the central billing option. User approval can be acquired for example by a simple click operation or require a secure password key and or biometric response from the user. Upon user approval the billing agent generates a billing approval and sends it to the transaction server the transaction server completes the transaction and then sends a bill to the billing agent . The billing agent optionally sends a confirmation to the transaction server and sends the bill to the billing server . Again optionally a triangle confirmation can be formed by the billing server sending a confirmation to the transaction server or the transaction server can send the bill to the billing server . In some embodiments the billing server can also communication such billed transactions to a central provider billing system via the carrier access network . Also in some embodiments an alternate location billing server is in communication via the Internet and an alternate location central provider billing system is also in communication via the Internet .

Referring now to the device application browses e.g. based on the user submitting a browse request using a browser application to transaction server e.g. a transaction web server such as the open content transaction partner site in which the browse request includes device ID information such as similarly described above with respect to . The transaction server establishes API contact with the device mobile agent which then confirms contact and good standing for transactional purchases from the device. The transaction server provides an offer to the device application . The device application selects a purchase e.g. based on the user s selection input . The transaction server notifies the device mobile payment agent of the purchase description and amount and the device mobile payment agent then requests user purchase confirmation. The purchase is confirmed by the device application e.g. based on the user s acknowledgement as similarly described above with respect to and the device mobile payment agent then transmits a purchase confirmation to the transaction server . The transaction server then transmits a purchase receipt and the device application confirms the receipt. The transaction server then transmits the purchase bill to the device mobile payment agent which then sends the purchase bill to the device billing server e.g. billing server . The transaction server also optionally sends a confirmation of the purchase bill to the device billing server for a triangle confirmation as similarly described above with respect to . The device billing server sends the purchase bill to the central provider billing system e.g. central provider billing system . In some embodiments the communications described above with respect to with the billing server and the central provider billing system are with the alternate location billing server and or alternate location central provider billing system via the Internet . Similarly in some embodiments the transaction servers are connected to the Internet .

Accordingly these transaction billing embodiments do not require centralized content storage or content and transaction exchange infrastructure. For example the transactions can be conducted over the Internet and the user experience and content can be tailored versions of the transaction server content provider s normal experience and content. This approach provides for a much wider array of content and transaction partners with minimal or no need to accommodate proprietary specialized systems. Moreover the compatibility between the device billing agent transaction system and the transaction provider server is easily established for example by writing specifications for the header information transmitted by the device and for the secure handshake and signed message transactions that take place between the device billing agent the transaction server and optionally the transaction server and the billing server. Once a transaction partner shows compatibility test results and concludes a business relationship with the service provider the service provider can place the transaction partner on the compatible and approved list and exchange security keys and or certificates. If a common user experience is desired by the service provider across multiple transaction partners then the experience specifications for the browser redirects can also be specified in the compatibility specification and tested before the transaction partner gains approval.

While the embodiments described below with respect to are depicted in the context of a conventional multi tier access network one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that such embodiments can also be generalized to other network topologies including the various flattened network topologies described herein. As shown the service controller is divided into two main functions e.g. as compared with the embodiments of service controller depicted in 1 a service controller device control system and 2 a service controller design policy analysis definition test publishing system . The service controller device control system performs the device service control channel functions as previously described herein with respect to various embodiments.

The service controller design policy analysis definition test publishing system separates out the service analysis control policy design and publishing from the device service control channel functions. The service controller design policy analysis definition test publishing system performs a variety of functions as described below. In some embodiments the service controller design policy analysis definition test publishing system provides service usage statistical analysis notification policy or procedure response analysis and or billing policy or procedure response analysis for single devices groups of devices types of devices groups of users classes of users or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given service. In some embodiments the service controller design policy analysis definition test publishing system detects singles out and reports device service usage notification responses or billing behavior that is outside of expected limits but may or may not be violating policy. In some embodiments the service controller design policy analysis definition test publishing system provides service cost and profitability analysis for single devices groups of devices types of devices groups of users classes of users or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given service. In some embodiments the service controller design policy analysis definition test publishing system provides user service control policy notification policy or billing policy statistical satisfaction analysis for single devices groups of devices types of devices groups of users classes of users or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given service. In some embodiments the service controller design policy analysis definition test publishing system provides statistical take rate analysis for transaction offers and billing offers for single devices groups of devices types of devices groups of users classes of users or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given service.

In some embodiments the service controller design policy analysis definition test publishing system provides service control policy definition work screens and dry lab pre beta testing against usage database for single devices groups of devices types of devices groups of users classes of users or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given service. In some embodiments the service controller design policy analysis definition test publishing system provides service control policy notification policy and or billing policy beta testing e.g. using beta test server in which the beta test profile is published to a subset of users or devices. In some embodiments beta devices users may or may not know that the service policy is being tested with them. In some embodiments if they do know then beta test apparatus includes offering system that provides user options to accept beta test and provide feedback in exchange for an offer e.g. show them an offer page that comes up with their existing subscription service or ambient service offer a free trial a discount to something and or reward zone points or other incentives rewards if they accept the trial . In some embodiments a beta test workstation e.g. in communication with the beta test server such as VSP remote workstation as shown in allows the beta test manager to define one or more beta test service policy notification policy and or billing policy control profiles. In some embodiments the beta test workstation publishes each profile to specific individual single devices groups of devices types of devices groups of users classes of users or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given service. In some embodiments the beta test workstation allows the beta test manager to analyze usage statistics notification response statistics and or billing transaction offer response statistics for devices users groups of devices or groups of users and compare actual real time usage versus beta test usage goals. In some embodiments the beta test workstation allows the beta test manager to fine tune service notification and or billing transaction policies and re publish to observe changes to actual service usage until the service policy and or notification control policies achieve the desired result. In some embodiments the beta test workstation also allows the beta test manager to collect direct user feedback to a set of pre designed user satisfaction or other questions regarding service usage. For example questions can be presented through a pre designed beta test portal or through a series of brief pop ups that come up when the user initiates a particular action or at a particular time. In some embodiments the beta test workstation also collects details of service and device usage e.g. CRM data that the beta test users have approved for collection. In some embodiments the beta test workstation can decompose this data to determine if the users are using the service in the manner intended by the beta test goals. In some embodiments the beta test workstation also allows for publishing multiple variants of the service and or notification policy control settings and compare the service usage for each group with convenient screens with information displays e.g. statistical usage versus time of day usage of particular activities billing activity device discovery activity user response to notification message and options user satisfaction with a particular notification policy or billing policy or traffic control policy . In some embodiments the screens can be designed by the beta test manager.

In some embodiments once a service is completely tested and approved for production publication the service download control server has a workstation screen that allows the service manager to specify which group of devices are to receive the new service policy configuration. In some embodiments the service download control server allows the service manager to define specific individual single devices groups of devices types of devices groups of users classes of users or an entire set of devices and users that subscribe to a given service.

In some embodiments a service e.g. a newly created or new version of an existing service is tested and or enhanced using a new service testing model. For example a new service or a new version of an existing service is loaded onto a server for testing the new service is optionally tested against existing device usage statistics a new service control definition e.g. implemented as service processor for publishing to devices and a corresponding new service controller for the service provider such as a central provider or an MVNO partner and for example the new service processor and service controller can be implemented using the below described SDK for the new service is developed and possibly adjusted based on the testing against existing device usage statistics the new service control definition is then published to beta devices e.g. various devices used for beta testing the new service which then use the new service service usage statistics and or user feedback statistics are then collected e.g. to ensure that the service is functioning properly and so that the service control definition can be tuned to ensure adequate service user experience and for service pricing profitability purposes the service service control definition is then fine tuned based on the service usage user feedback statistics. Upon completion of the above testing and refinement of the service service control definition the service control definition can be published to specified groups of devices for using the new service. In some embodiments this service control testing model for groups of devices and service partners is provided by a virtual MVNO or VSP. For example this allows for new services to be more efficiently and more effectively developed tested and proliferated.

In some embodiments service history IPDRs come from within a networking component connected to the central provider core network as depicted by e.g. real time service usage which as discussed elsewhere is a general purpose descriptor for a function located in one or more of the networking equipment boxes . In some embodiments service history IPDRs are collected aggregated in part from the central billing system . In some embodiments service history IPDRs are collected aggregated in part from the transport gateways . In some embodiments service history IPDRs are collected aggregated in part from the RAN gateways . In some embodiments service history IPDRs are collected aggregated in part from the base station s or a networking component co located with the base station s a networking component in the transport network a networking component in the core network or from another source.

In some embodiments virtual service provider VSP capabilities include making available to a third party service partner one or more of the following 1 device group definition control and security 2 provisioning definition and execution 3 ATS activation owner 4 service profile definitions 5 activation and ambient service definition 6 billing rules definition 7 billing process and branding controls 8 bill by account settings 9 service usage analysis capabilities by device sub group or group 10 beta test publishing capabilities by device sub group or group and 11 production publishing fine tuning and re publishing.

In some embodiments the service controller functionality is partitioned for a VSP by setting up one or more secure workstations secure portals secure websites secure remote software terminals and or other similar techniques to allow the service managers who work for the VSP to analyze fine tune control or define the services they decide to publish to one or more groups of devices or groups of users that the VSP owns In some embodiments the VSP owns such groups by virtue of a relationship with the central provider in which the VSP is responsible for the service design and profitability. In some embodiments the central provider receives payment from the VSP for wholesale access services. In some embodiments the VSP workstations and only have access to the service analysis design beta testing and publishing functions for the devices or users owned by the VSP. In some embodiments the user or device base serviced by the central provider network is securely partitioned into those owned by the central provider those owned by the VSP and those owned by any other VSPs.

In some embodiments the VSP manages their devices from the VSP workstations and using device based service control techniques as described herein. In some embodiments the VSP manages their devices from the VSP workstations and using device assisted and network based service control techniques as described herein. In some embodiments the VSP manages their devices from the VSP workstations and using network based service control techniques e.g. DPI techniques as described herein.

For example this approach is particularly well suited for open developer programs offered by the central providers in which the central provider brings in VSPs who offer special value in the devices or service plans and using this approach neither the central provider nor the VSP needs to do as much work as would be required to set up a conventional MVNO or MVNE system which often requires some degree of customization in the network solution the billing solution or the device solution for each new device application and or service application that is developed and deployed. In some embodiments the service customization is simplified by implementing custom policy settings on the service processor and service controller and the custom device is quickly brought onto the network using the SDK and test certification process. In some embodiments the VSP functionality is also offered by an entity other than the central provider. For example an MVNE entity can develop a wholesale relationship with one or more carriers use the service controller to create the VSP capabilities and then offer VSP services for one network or for a group of networks. In some embodiments the service customization is simplified by implementing custom policy settings through the VSP embodiments on the network equipment including in some embodiments service aware or DPI based network equipment that has a relatively deep level of service activity control capability. For example using the embodiments described herein and possibly also including some of the activation and provisioning embodiments it is possible to efficiently design and implement custom ambient service plans that are different for different types of devices different OEMs different VSPs different distributors or different user groups all using the same general infrastructure whether the service control policy implementation is accomplished primarily or exclusively with networking equipment network based service control primarily or exclusively with device based service control or with a combination of both e.g. hybrid device and network based service control .

As discussed herein various VSP embodiments for performing one or more of analyzing traffic usage and defining managing service profiles or plans dry lab testing service profiles or plans beta testing service profiles or plans fine tuning service profiles or plans publishing service profiles or plans or other policy related settings can involve programming settings in the network equipment and or programming settings or software on the device. For example as discussed herein the service processor settings are controlled by the service controller which can be partitioned to allow groups of devices to be controlled. As another example equipment in the network involved with network based service control such as DPI based gateways routers or switches can similarly be programmed to utilize various VSP embodiments to implement that portion of the service profile or service activity usage control that is controlled by network level functions and it will be appreciated that substantially all or all of the service activity control for certain embodiments can be accomplished with the network functions instead of the device. Continuing this example just as the device service processor settings control functions of the service processor can have a group of devices that are partitioned off and placed under the control of a VSP various VSP control embodiments can partition off a group of devices that have service usage activity controlled by the networking equipment including in some embodiments sophisticated service aware DPI based service control equipment to achieve similar objectives. It will be appreciated that the discussion herein regarding service controller design policy analysis test publishing and the discussion regarding device group user group and other VSP related embodiments should be understood as applicable to various embodiments described in view of device based services control control assistance and or monitoring or network based services control control assistance and or monitoring or a combination of device based services control control assistance and or monitoring and network based services control control assistance and or monitoring. The various embodiments described herein related to service activation and provisioning also make apparent how the programming of network equipment service control service control assistance and or monitoring can be implemented prior to and following activation of the device. It will also be appreciated that the VSP capabilities described herein can also be applied to those devices that have services controlled by provided by and or billed by the central provider so these techniques can be applied to central provider service embodiments MVNO embodiments and other embodiments.

In some embodiments an SDK is provided that allows developers such as device manufacturers service providers MVNO MVNE and or VSPs to develop various service processors e.g. different versions of the service processor for various devices e.g. various types of devices and corresponding service controllers e.g. different versions of the service controller for various types of services and network environments. For example a device manufacturer can use the SDK to develop a new service processor for their new device e.g. mobile phone PDA eBook reader portable music device computer laptop netbook or any other network accessible device . The device manufacturer can also preload preinstall their new service processor on their new devices. In this example users of the new device would then be able to utilize the new device to access network based services using the new service processor which communicates with the deployed new service controller as similarly discussed herein in various embodiments. For example the device can be preinstalled with the new service processor to provide ambient services as similarly discussed herein in various embodiments. For example the SDK can allow for substantially similar service processors to be installed on similar and or different devices thereby minimizing any unnecessary differences between service processor elements for device assisted services. In some embodiments for ambient services for a group of devices or devices associated with a certain service provider a set of numbers e.g. dummy numbers can be assigned for use for attempting access via the access network using a new device that is not yet otherwise subscribed for service. In some embodiments the set of dummy numbers used for ambient access by the device can also be used for associate of the device with a service provider or a type of device e.g. eReader or some other type of network accessible device and upon activation the service provider assigns a real number for the activated device e.g. which can be provided at the time of manufacture of the device point of sale of the device or after the point of sale of the device such as upon activation of the device . For example ambient access of the device can use the device ID SIM ID assigned phone real or dummy number and or other information associated with the device for assigning appropriate service control and service policy profile for the device.

In some embodiments the service processor is distributed as an SDK to any device that the central provider or the VSP desires to offer services with so that the service processor can be efficiently designed or adapted by the device OEM ODM or manufacturer for operation on the service network. In some embodiments the SDK includes either a complete set of service processor agent software designed for and or tested for the OS Operating System and processor set being used on the device or a mature reference design for the OS and processor set being used on the device or a less mature reference design potentially for the same OS and or processor set or a different OS and or processor set being used on the device that the OEM Original Equipment Manufacturer ports to the desired OS or processor set or a basic set of example software programs that the OEM or ODM Original Design Manufacturer can use to develop software compatible with the service or a set of specifications and descriptions possibly forming an interoperability standard of how to design the software to be compatible with the service. In some embodiments the SDK includes a set of OEM lab test procedures and or test criteria to ensure that the implementation of the service SDK is compatible with the service and will operate properly. In some embodiments the SDK includes a set of network certification test procedures and or test criteria to ensure that the implementation of the service SDK is compatible with the service and will operate properly. In some embodiments the certification procedures are approved for testing by the OEM the central provider the VSP and or a trusted third party. For example the central provider is typically in control of the SDK and the test procedures but others can be in control. In some embodiments the test procedures are at least in part common across multiple central provider networks. In some embodiments the SDK concept is extended to include one or more modem modules where one or more of the SDK embodiments described above is combined with a standard reference design or a standard hardware sales package for one or more modems so that the entire package forms a turn key product that allows a device manufacturer central provider VSP or other entity bring new devices or device applications onto the central provider network possibly in combination with other networks in a manner that requires less engineering time and resources and less network certification time and resources than would be required in some designs that do not use this standard SDK plus module approach. For example the standard SDK plus module product embodiments can be pre certified and tested with one or more central providers to further reduce development time and expense. The standard SDK plus module embodiments can also use a multi mode modem e.g. modems based on a multimode CDMA EVDO UMTS HSPA chipset as in the Gobi global multimode chipset product or modems based on other recently announced LTE plus HSPA chipsets WiMax plus Wi Fi chipsets or LTE plus EVDO chipsets and a multi mode connection manager agent so that the same SDK plus modem embodiment may satisfy a wide range of applications for many service providers around the world.

In some embodiments at the time of manufacture the device is associated with an MVNO. For example the MVNO can provide an ambient service that provides a service provider clearing house in which the device can access a network in ambient access mode e.g. a wholesale MVNO connection through the access network for purposes of selecting a service provider e.g. a VSP MVNO or carrier . Based on the service provider selection the device credentials and or service processor are reprogrammed and or new software is downloaded installed to activate the device with the selected service provider as described herein for provisioning the device and the account on that service provider network e.g. the ATS can track such activation for example for revenue sharing purposes as an activation incentive fee .

In some embodiments ATS is implemented entirely in the network as described below. At the time of manufacture or at sometime during device distribution the device master agent programs a unique credential in the device that cannot be re programmed or removed or is difficult to re program or remove and that can be recognized and recorded by the network at the time of activation or at some other time. In this manner even if other possibly primary device credentials are reprogrammed or removed there will still be a credential that is associated with the device master agent. The ATS process can then be implemented by using a database search function to scan through the database of activated devices to form a list of devices that have been activated for the purpose of master agent reconciliation. Example credentials that can suffice are MEID hardware MAC address and or serial number that are picked up and recorded by the service provider or other service entity at time of activation or before or after activation.

In some embodiments an interface server e.g. the billing databases historical usage billing systems component and or the billing to service controller interface component is provided that reads the IPDRs service profile and or service plan information stored in the billing and or service record database s . In some embodiments the interface server performs these functions in a manner that is compatible with communication formats of the billing and or service record database s so that little or no changes are required in the configuration communication formats or software of the existing central billing AAA and or other network components. In some embodiments the interface server e.g. including the billing databases historical usage billing systems component and the billing to service controller interface component is co located with the central billing system components as shown or in other embodiments the interface server is located elsewhere. For example the interface server can be located close to or within the components that comprise the service controller or anywhere else in the network.

In some embodiments the interface server performs certain communication protocol translation or data format translation required to interface the information stored in the billing and or service record database s to the service controller functions so that the central billing system and other existing components in the network do not need to change much if at all to enable the service controller and service processor to implement device based assisted service control. In some embodiments the central billing system or other network components are not required to be aware of the service control functions being implemented by the service controller or service processor because the interface server acquires the network based information needed by the service controller and or service processor while requiring little or no specialized awareness communication data formatting user interfacing service profile processing or service plan processing on the part of existing billing database or networking components. In this type of overlay approach various embodiments described herein can be used to quickly upgrade the capabilities of existing networks for new devices while minimizing the required changes to the existing network that supports legacy devices.

For example a new ambient service plan can be implemented within the central billing system that is associated with a zero or low cost billing plan and a usage limit e.g. ambient service that may be difficult or impossible to support in a manner that would result in high user satisfaction and a high level of control for service cost and service policy definition. Even if the central billing system is not highly involved in the process the zero or low cost plan can be implemented in a manner that results in high user satisfaction and a cost controlled service by using the service controller and or service processor and the interface server to implement the ambient services access control service usage control user interface service usage notification transaction billing or bill by account functionality. For example this approach can be implemented by reading the service plan and or service policy settings for a device in the central billing database using the interface server looking up the corresponding service policy user notification policy transaction billing policy and bill by account policy associated with the particular service profile or service plan and then implementing the policies with the assistance of the service controller and or service processor. Similarly in another definition multiple tiers of service control and user notification policies can be added to any number of new service profiles or service plans that would not otherwise be supported with the central billing system and other network components all with minimal or no modifications to the pre existing network and billing system.

Another embodiment calls for receiving a standard IPDR feed from central billing or another network component just like an MVNO would. For example the interface server function can be located in the central billing system service processor or elsewhere in the network. This provides the IPDR records for service usage policy verification and service usage notification synchronization with little or no need to modify existing billing or network apparatus.

In some embodiments duplicate the IPDRs are sent from the network equipment to the billing system and or network management system that are currently used for generating service billing or are used for device management or network management. In some embodiments duplicate records are filtered to send only those records for devices controlled by the service controller and or service processor. For example this approach can provide for the same level of reporting lower level of reporting and or higher level of reporting as compared to the reporting required by the central billing system.

In some embodiments a bill by account billing offset is provided using the interface server. For example bill by account billing offset information is informed to the billing system through an existing data feed and by updating the billing database using the interface server. In some embodiments transaction billing is provided using the interface server. For example transaction billing log information is provided to the billing system through an existing data feed and by updating the billing database using the interface server.

In some embodiments existing new service plan choice screens are displayed to the user a user choice or decision input is confirmed for a selected service plan and then the service is implemented upon confirmation of the billing system update for the new service plan. In some embodiments the service is implemented upon the user selection of a new service plan and then retracted if not confirmed as updated by the billing system within a certain period of time. In some embodiments the new service plan information is updated in the billing system through an existing data feed or by updating the database using the interface server.

In some embodiments improved and simplified processes for provisioning a device or user for service on a central provider network an MVNO network or a virtual service provider VSP on the central provider network are provided. In some embodiments provisioning includes one or more of the following a process or result of assigning programming storing or embedding into the device and or network a set of credentials or otherwise providing the credentials to the user the credentials being at least in part carried on the device or with the user and or at least a portion of or a counterpart to the credentials being stored or recognized by the network so that the various network elements responsible for admitting the device access to the appropriate service activities do so once the device or user service is active.

As an example as discussed herein the credentials can include one or more of the following phone number device identification number MEID or similar mobile device identifier hardware security device ID security signature or other security credentials device serial number device identification and or credential information via security hardware such as a SIM one or more IP addresses one or more MAC addresses any other network address identifier embedded device descriptive information block static or programmable security key security signature algorithms passwords or other secure authorization information service processor or similar device client or agent software identifier or settings or version device type identifier browser e.g. http https WAP other browser client header information or similar identifier browser token information or similar identifier browser cookie information or similar identifier embedded browser instructions portal client e.g. interface or communication agent that connects to a network portal used at least in part for provisioning or activation for the device or by the user header information or similar identifier portal client token information or similar identifier portal client cookie information or similar identifier embedded portal client instructions service provider OEM master agent service distributor VSP device service owner identifier distributor or master agent and or any information the network can use to authorize network admission provision the device provision the network activate service authorize associate or enable the device with a provisioning sequence associate or enable the device with one or more service profiles associate or assist the device with an activation sequence associate or enable the device with an ambient profile or service experience associate or enable the device with one or more service plans or service capabilities associate the device with a service provider or service owner associate the device with an OEM or master agent associate the device with a distributor or master agent or associate the device with a device group user group or user.

In some embodiments provisioning includes assigning programming or embedding into the device and or network the information to define the level of service activity referred to as a service profile that the device is authorized to receive. In some embodiments provisioning also includes establishing the device settings and or network settings to define an ambient activation experience in which the device user receives a set of services after e.g. within a short period of time after purchasing or otherwise obtaining or installing the device whether the device has or has not been registered and activated with the device user or device owner.

In some embodiments the ambient experience is the user experience that is available at the time the device is sold in the event the user has not yet signed up for a service plan. For example the ambient experience is defined by an ambient service profile an ambient service plan and or the other service usage activity control policies in effect in the network on the device or a combination of both. For example if the device service processor is used in large part to define the ambient service profile then the initial provisioning and activation settings in the service processor and possibly the service controller can define the user service upgrade offering choices network destination access control possibilities traffic control policies mobile commerce transaction capabilities e.g. which transaction websites WAP sites or portals the user can access to purchase information content music games and or eBooks possibly free news or weather or other modest bandwidth Internet services that are provided free of charge to entice the user into using upgrading the service or using the transactions or viewing advertisements what advertisements are displayed to the user or what advertisement based websites the user is exposed to certain applications may have access while others are blocked e.g. Internet based text services have access but email downloads do not or other example service capabilities. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that allowing all of these services and blocking other ambient user service attempts e.g. unpaid large file size Internet downloads or uploads or movie viewing or other access that would consume bandwidth and cause the ambient service to be a potential source of losses for the service provider is made possible by the service profile control capabilities of the service processor and or the service controller. The bill by account embodiments as discussed herein in which each service activity can for example be separately tracked with the service monitor and other agents and server functions to produce a billing offset that allows categorization and mediation of different billing entities accounts provides the capability for the service provider to individually account for the costs of each ambient service element. This allows business models wherein the free access to the end user is paid for or partially paid for by one or more service provider partners who are billed for service access using the bill by account capabilities e.g. the transaction partners pay for user access to their transaction experience and perhaps pay a revenue share for transaction billing the advertising sponsored website partners pay for their access service share .

While the service control capabilities of the service processor and the bill by account service cost sharing and transaction revenue sharing in some cases can create a profitable ambient business model in other cases the ambient services can be a potential source of losses for the service provider. Accordingly in some embodiments the ambient service capabilities can be modified over time to reduce service cost to the service provider or VSP based on a variety of decision factors. For example the user can have one level of traffic control for a period of time and if the user has not signed up for service by the end of the period the ambient service access is reduced by changing the service control policy settings in the service processor and the service level can be further reduced over time if the user continues to not sign up for service or the user does not create much transaction revenue. As another example the recursive throttling algorithms discussed herein can be utilized to one or more of the service activities offered in ambient service mode so that the user experiences what full speed service is like and if the user continues consuming appreciable bandwidth with the service activity then the activity is throttled back to reduce costs. In these examples the service processor or service controller can issue the user a notification explaining that their service is currently free so their usage is being throttled and if they desire to receive better service service plan upgrade offers can be delivered to the UI. It will now be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various ambient service parameters including the provisioning and activation processes used to create the ambient service activation can also be managed by the VSP apparatus and processes described herein. For example this allows the same service controllers and service processor solutions to be used to define a wide range of ambient experiences for various device groups or user groups that are controlled by different VSPs.

Similarly rather than controlling the ambient service profile settings using the VSP functions to control the service controller service processor provisioning and activation settings other embodiments call for the ambient service profile settings to be controlled by the network based service activity control equipment as similarly discussed herein. Depending on the level of service control and service monitoring sophistication e.g. highly advanced DPI or service aware techniques some much most or all of the above described ambient services functionality can be implemented using network based service controls and the VSP management and control embodiments described herein.

In some embodiments a device is suspended based on inactivity or the device is placed in a suspended service state or suspended account state so that the network does not get bogged down with a significant number of devices and credentials that are inactive. For example this can also result in a portion of the device credentials being assigned back to an available pool rather than reserved for that particular device e.g. phone numbers if phone numbers are scarce . The device account and or activation state can be re activated when the device comes back online. For example the suspend state can be a simple suspension of services without changing the account status in which case the re activation process can be automatically completed as a subset or entire set of the activation sequence that occurs when the device is initially used as described herein. The suspend state can also involve changing the account status to inactive in which case the re activation process can automatically reconfigure the account status back to an active state when the device re accesses the network. For example the suspend state can involve de assigning or possibly re claiming a portion of the device credentials. If a portion of the credentials are de assigned then when the device re accesses the network credentials can be automatically re assigned as described in various embodiments described herein.

In some embodiments as described herein it is desirable to implement some or all of the deep service usage monitoring service control or control assistance or service notification or notification assistance associated with a service profile in network apparatus rather than in the device or to implement some of the deep service monitoring control control assistance notification or notification assistance in the device and others in the network. This is the case for example in a mixed network in which some devices have some or at least one or all of the service processor capabilities discussed herein but other devices do not have as much or any of the service processor capabilities. Another example is for networks or devices that do not have any service processor capabilities or where it is desirable to do all of the service monitoring control and notification in the network rather than the device. As described below depict various embodiments for combinations of device based service monitoring control or control assistance usage notification or usage notification assistance and or network based service monitoring control or control assistance usage notification or usage notification assistance.

In some embodiments the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system provides for network based service monitoring or control that satisfies various network neutrality and or privacy requirements based on indication s received from the device or user e.g. user input provided using the device UI using the service processor user input provided through another website WAP site or portal or user input provided through the service contract where the user agrees to the monitoring and or service control levels and network based service control using a DPI service monitor and or the DPC policy implementation .

In some embodiments the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system provides for network based service monitoring or service control that satisfies various privacy requirements using indication s received from the device or user e.g. user input provided using the device UI using the service processor user input provided through another website WAP site or portal or user input provided through the service contract where the user agrees to the monitoring and or service control levels and network based DPI service usage monitoring or DPC policy implementation using the DPI service monitor or DPC policy implementation as described below. In some embodiments the DPI service monitor and or DPC policy implementation include a secure database for storing service monitoring and CRM information for each device device user. In some embodiments the DPI service monitor and or DPC policy implementation can be integrated with the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system as shown or provided within a separate router server and or software hardware implemented function that is in secure communication with the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system and or other network elements based on the network architecture. In some embodiments a secure data store such as a secure database is not integrated with the DPI service monitor or DPC policy implementation but is in secure communication with the DPI service monitor or DPC policy implementation the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system and or other network elements depending on the architecture e.g. a billing server or any other network element . In some embodiments the user selects limits and or restrictions on who can access remotely stored service usage history and or other CRM privacy related data e.g. CRM privacy gatekeeper settings and for example other network elements and or network administrators access to such data can be limited and or restricted accordingly. For example access to such stored service monitoring and CRM information can require certain security credentials and or using various other well known secure data storage techniques such as the various secure storage techniques described herein.

In some embodiments the secure database possessing user service usage information that is considered sensitive and has not been approved for distribution by the user can be made unavailable to the credentials possessed by network managers or network functions except for example for emergency service situations of government mandated monitoring needs where special credentials are brought out of secure storage that are not normally available. In some embodiments rather than the user selecting limits a certain set of restrictions are assumed unless the user selects information filtering settings that allow more information to be shared with the network functions network administrators or service provider partners. In some embodiments the information is filtered to remove information thought to be sensitive but still transmits service usage information needed for monitoring network services or other important parameters. For example the website destinations a user is visiting can be classified with generic identifiers that are not decodable or the individual website information can be completely removed. Many other examples will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.

For example the stored service monitoring and CRM information can also be organized into groups to define group CRM profiles to store service monitoring information for every user indexed by the user credentials e.g. such groups can also be used for various VSP related functions as described herein . The DPI service monitor or DPC policy implementation also uses the secure storage to store service monitoring information for each user indexed by the user credentials or another aspect of the device identifier or address assignment e.g. IP address or MAC address . In some embodiments a CRM information manager e.g. a supervisor program executing on the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system communicates with the other network functions and provides filtered service usage and CRM information according to CRM filtering rules for each user or for groups of users. In some embodiments the filtered CRM data can be made available using secure communications with other networking equipment by the integrated device service control usage monitoring system . In some embodiments the filter settings for some users allow more information to be shared from the secure service usage information than others due to the differences in user preference settings and or service plan agreements.

In some embodiments user privacy preference information is used to determine the privacy filter settings which are securely implemented by the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system . For example service CRM filter settings can be received at the time of service contract sign up e.g. service plan selection and or allow the user to log into service preferences web page to change settings e.g. without involving any interaction with local software on the device . As another example software on the device e.g. including the service processor can be used for selecting user CRM privacy preferences which are securely communicated to the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system e.g. the device can include credentials that can be verified to allow for selection modification of CRM privacy preferences or other user based preferences securely maintained in a network server such as the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system or another network element such as shown in various other embodiments described herein . In these examples the filtered CRM data is available from the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system for other network components over a secure or open communication link. In another example user CRM privacy preferences are input using a web server hosted by the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system or the central billing system . In another example software on the device e.g. including the service processor can be used for securely communicating user preference decisions to an intermediate server that acts as a device manager and intermediate server for devices or device groups and the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system .

In some embodiments the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system provides for network based service control as described below. In some embodiments and similar to the above described network based CRM filtering embodiments the DPI service monitor or DPC policy implementation includes secure storage e.g. a secure database for storing service monitoring information e.g. based on user selections preferences and the DPC policy implementation performs traffic shaping throttling algorithms for each user based on the stored service monitoring information from DPI service monitor . For example network based DPI traffic inspection by the DPI service monitor can use the secure storage to save service monitoring information for each user indexed by the user credentials or other parameters such as IP address or other network tag. As another example the DPC policy implementation for example which can be supervised by policy management server as described herein with respect to various other embodiments can implement service usage history statistical analysis inside the secure storage and maintain a service usage history analysis for each device user and or perform various traffic shaping and or throttling algorithms based on various device user selected and or service plan related settings e.g. for network neutrality purposes allowing for various higher level service usage goals for one or more users as similarly described herein with respect to various device based service usage monitoring embodiments e.g. except for certain encrypted network traffic flows or application related flows for which traffic control generally needs information from the application level and or content specific traffic control .

In some embodiments input is collected on how to implement service control e.g. from the user of the device . For example such input can be determined based on one or more of the following a service plan choice for the device input provided by a user via a website e.g. web based portal for indicating changes to service control policies as similarly described above input provided by a user via the device e.g. including the service processor which securely communicates the input to the DPC policy implementation for example which can be supervised by the policy management server and input provided by a user via the device e.g. including the service processor which securely communicates the input to an intermediate server for the DPC policy implementation as similarly described above. In some embodiments such service control is based on various algorithms as described herein that identify the heaviest usage service activities and recursively control the speed for those activities while leaving certain others unaffected and in a manner that is specified or selected by the user to ensure network neutrality. In some embodiments the user is offered a choice for controlling service usage and or selects an algorithm that controls all activities equally neutrally e.g. based on selected user preferences . For example by implementing service control algorithms that are network neutral e.g. throttling all activities equally or throttling the highest usage algorithms without singling out certain activities for throttling unless they satisfy certain network neutral usage history or usage statistics criteria or that are approved selected or otherwise specified by the user network neutral traffic control or service usage control can be maintained.

In some embodiments the DPI service monitor possibly in conjunction with the service usage notification and or service history server provides service usage service cost e.g. a real time service usage counter related notifications to the device based on user preferences as similarly described above with respect to various device based service usage service related notification embodiments. For example the DPI service monitor for example in conjunction with the service usage notification and or service history server can perform service usage service related notification algorithms based on one or more of the following service plans device settings and or user selected preferences e.g. such notification messages can be securely communicated to the device and or to the device via an intermediate server . For example the policies that govern how the user is notified of service usage or service cost can be determined by the policy management server and or the service usage notification . As another example user acknowledgements of important notification messages and or user choices related to important service usage decisions can be requested as similarly discussed above with respect to device based service usage control embodiments which can then be communicated to the central billing system as confirmation for any such important notification messages e.g. related to service usage overage charges and or confirmation of service upgrades . In some embodiments various other service usage algorithms related to service usage and or service cost forward projections described herein with respect device based service usage forward projection embodiments are performed in the network such as by the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system and such forward projections can then be communicated to each respective device as service usage notification messages e.g. using a push based approach initiated in the network and or pull based approach initiated by a request from the device . For example these embodiments for projected service usage methods as described herein can be helpful for determining when the user is using services in a manner that will cause the user to run over a service limit so that the user can be notified or the service can be controlled or throttled if the user has selected a control or throttling option.

In some embodiments one or more intermediate servers are provided for workload balancing and or off loading the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system and perform one or more of the functions described above with respect to various embodiments of the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system . In some embodiments service plans device settings and or user selected preferences are used to associate each device user with a preprogrammed profile to more efficiently associate such devices users with their selected service plans device settings and or user preferences. For example the process of setting a service profile for a given device can be determined by assigning the device to a service flow that has the pre defined service profile and is shared with other devices within the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system rather than individually processing the service flow manipulations for each device. In some embodiments the act of provisioning and activating a service profile for a given devices involves setting up the service flow definition and identifier within the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system if it is not already set up and then assigning the routing of the device credentials to that service flow identifier. User preferences can for example be accounted for by assigning the device service flow to one of several pre defined profiles based on user preferences that are all supported under the same service plan. For example one service flow profile can call for service usage notification but no control under the same service plan as another service flow profile that calls for less notification but active service usage control to maintain user costs to a monthly post pay limit.

In some embodiments the bill by account function is implemented in the context of the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system or other network based system embodiments described herein. For example the DPI service monitor in some cases in conjunction with service history server can operate in conjunction with bill by account policy settings stored in the billing event server so that service activities are divided into the account classifications defined by the service profile settings. The bill by account feeds can then be sent to the billing system or to an intermediate billing event aggregation server that collects this type of deep packet inspection generated information from one or more integrated device service control device usage monitoring system units to aggregate and format the information in a manner that may be used by the central billing system . In some embodiments the bill by account information collected in a network box like the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system is augmented by bill by account information collected on the device as described herein and any intermediate server that can be used to aggregate and format these bill by account feeds for the central billing system deals with both types of data from the network and from the devices.

As shown in in some embodiments integrated device service control device usage monitoring system includes the service control server link which for example can be used as described above e.g. with respect to and other embodiments described herein to communicate with device service processors . In some embodiments billing server within integrated device service control device usage monitoring system detects service usage events reported by DPI service monitor in some cases in conjunction with service history server generates a billing event that can be recorded or transmitted to the central billing system . In some embodiments billing server receives information from device billing agent and or device service monitor agent and transmits the device service usage billing events to the central billing system . In some embodiments certain billing events that are advantageously collected in the network e.g. DPI service monitor and or billing event server are combined with certain billing events that are advantageously collected on the device e.g. service monitor agent and or billing agent and both sources of billing information are transmitted to the billing system . Similarly in some embodiments certain service usage information is collected with service usage monitor agent and that information is combined with service usage information collected from DPI service monitor and or service history server and or service usage . In some embodiments certain service aspects are controlled using network based DPC policy implementation in some cases in conjunction with or supervised by network based policy management server and other service aspects are controlled using device based policy implementation agent in some cases in conjunction with or supervised by policy control agent . As will now be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the numerous embodiments described herein many hybrid approaches to service usage monitoring service control service notification or service billing can be accomplished with some aspects of the policy notification control monitoring or billing being implemented performed on the device apparatus described herein and others implemented performed on the network apparatus described herein. The presence of access control integrity server and many other service control verification embodiments described herein make it apparent that the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system embodiments also provide for affirmative verification of whatever functions are implemented on the device. It will also be apparent that all of the above combinations of device and network functions and many others can be accomplished in ways that are network neutral and or protect user privacy preferences by implementing the service control algorithms in a network neutral manner and or receiving user preference input on how to implement service control and by maintaining service usage and CRM information security and filtering on both the device and the network based integrated device service control device usage monitoring system .

In some embodiments the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system facilitates or plays a part in automated provisioning and activation of the devices as similarly described above with respect to various device based automated provisioning and activation embodiments. In some embodiments the activation server is integrated into or partially integrated into device service control device usage monitoring system .

In some embodiments the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system facilitates ambient services as similarly described above with respect to various device based ambient services embodiments.

In some embodiments the integrated device service control device usage monitoring system facilitates VSP and ODI solutions as similarly described above with respect to various device based VSP and ODI embodiments.

Various other network architectures for network based service control including deep packet inspection functions can similarly be used as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the various embodiments described herein.

In some embodiments the bill by account function is implemented in the context of the 4G 3G 2G DPI DPC gateway embodiment or other network based system embodiments described herein. For example the bill by account information can be completely derived from the network box e.g. 4G 3G 2G DPI DPC gateway without assistance from device based service monitoring or billing capabilities or none may exist on the device. In this example the DPI service monitor in some cases in conjunction with service history server can operate in conjunction with bill by account policy settings stored in the billing event server so that service activities are divided into the account classifications defined by the service profile settings. The bill by account feeds can then be sent to the billing system or to an intermediate billing event aggregation server that collects this type of deep packet inspection generated information from one or 4G 3G 2G DPI DPC gateway units to aggregate and format the information in a manner that can be used by the central billing system . In some embodiments the bill by account information collected in a network box such as the 4G 3G 2G DPI DPC gateway is augmented refined or otherwise added to by bill by account information collected on the device as described herein and any intermediate server that can be used to aggregate and format these bill by account feeds for the central billing system deals with both types of data from the network and from the devices.

As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art the above described embodiments can be extended to include some or all of the functions depicted in the 4G 3G 2G DPI DPC service gateways of in the base station or base station controller .

In some embodiments automated provisioning and activation includes automation of one or more of the following functions 1 programming device credentials or partial credentials and recording them in a database or providing same when they are programmed into the device 2 associating these credentials with the proper provisioning and or activation actions to be taken on the device and in the network 3 directing the device to the proper activation function e.g. activation server sequence when it attempts to connect to the network 4 completing provisioning of the device 5 programming the AAA billing system gateways mobile wireless center and other network equipment to the proper initial device service control settings and 6 establishing a service account for the device.

In some embodiments improved processes for activating service for a device or user with a network service provided by a central provider network an MVNO network or a VSP on the central provider network are provided. In some embodiments activation includes one or more of the following a process or result of associating a service account with device or user credentials with the service account potentially further being associated with a service profile defining the service activities that the device is authorized to access creating or updating a service usage or billing record and associating it with the service account to create a service plan and or initiating service to the device or user in which the network equipment allows access to the appropriate level of service activities. In some embodiments VSP embodiments include the provisioning and activation apparatus embodiments of any or all forms.

In conventional mobile device provisioning systems the provisioning and activation process required to create a user service account and enable the device to access the desired level of service activities can limit mass market low cost or user friendly applications of the device or service because the process can often be cumbersome time consuming and or expensive for the service provider service owner master agent service distributor MVNO VSP and or user. Accordingly the various embodiments for provisioning and activation described herein simplify the provisioning and activation process for mobile devices. In some embodiments provisioning and activation for the device and or the network accommodates a wide variety of device types and service profile types with the capability to perform the provisioning and activation at a number of points in the manufacturing distribution sales and usage progression for the device and the ability to either pre activate before first device use or very quickly activate during first device use or during some later use of the device .

In some embodiments as described herein the term provisioning generally refers to those actions processes associated with programming the device with credentials or other device settings or software installations used to later activate the device as well as in some embodiments creating database entries and other credential associations in the network so that the network and or device have the information used to recognize the device or credentials and implement the service policies in the service profile and or service plan once the service profile and or service plan are activated. In some embodiments as described herein the term activation generally refers to the process of creating or selecting the service plan and or service profile programming the settings that are used in each e.g. required network function and or each e.g. required device function so that the system can properly associate the device credentials with the appropriate service activity policies and then admitting the device onto the network. The term activation can also refer in some embodiments to the creation of a user or device service account in some cases with user or device owner information or billing information. In some embodiments the process of provisioning amounts to assigning credentials to the device and programming a portion or all of the credentials on the device entering a portion or all of the credentials in the various necessary network equipment databases so that the network components are capable of identifying the device and associating it with the network based portion of the admission traffic processing service monitoring billing service limits and other policies that are eventually defined by the service profile and service plan.

Further examples of the network based service profile policies include network access level traffic routing service monitoring service limits and actions taken upon reaching service limits. Once the service profile is created and activated during the activation process the device credentials and the associated service profile are communicated throughout the necessary network elements so that each element can implement its part of the network portion of the service profile policies. This process of propagating the service profile settings to all the required network equipment components is a portion of what is referred to herein as activation in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments the activation process includes associating the credentials with the proper service plan and or service profile and possibly completing the process of programming the device functions and or network functions so that the device can be admitted to the appropriate level of network services. In some embodiments activation also includes the service processor software settings configurations or installs for each function or agent in the service processor to implement its part of the service profile service plan service billing or transaction billing policies. In some embodiments activation also includes the creation of entries in the various service account databases and or billing databases to create a user account or device owner account for the purpose of managing the user choices for service plan and other account information storage and management aspects such as maintaining status information maintaining the central service profile configuration conducting reconciliation and billing exchanges service usage history and or account history.

In some embodiments the term credentials generally refers to the set of information parameters that the network and or device uses e.g. requires to admit the device onto the network and associate it with the appropriate service profile and or service plan. For example the credentials can include one or more of the following phone number device identification number MEID or similar mobile device identifier hardware security device ID security signature or other security credentials device serial number device identification and or credential information via security hardware such as a SIM one or more IP addresses one or more MAC addresses any other network address identifier embedded device descriptive information block static or programmable security key security signature algorithms passwords or other secure authorization information service processor or similar device client or agent software identifier or settings or version device type identifier browser e.g. http https WAP other browser client header information or similar identifier browser token information or similar identifier browser cookie information or similar identifier embedded browser instructions portal client e.g. interface or communication agent that connects to a network portal used at least in part for provisioning or activation for the device or by the user header information or similar identifier portal client token information or similar identifier portal client cookie information or similar identifier embedded portal client instructions service provider OEM master agent service distributor VSP device service owner identifier distributor or master agent and or any information the network can use to authorize network admission provision the device provision the network activate service authorize associate or enable the device with a provisioning sequence associate or enable the device with one or more service profiles associate or assist the device with an activation sequence associate or enable the device with an ambient profile or service experience associate or enable the device with one or more service plans or service capabilities associate the device with a service provider or service owner associate the device with an OEM or master agent associate the device with a distributor or master agent or associate the device with a device group user group or user. In some embodiments at least some of the credentials are unique to the device and in some embodiments groups of devices share one or more aspects of the credentials. In some embodiments the term permanent credentials generally refers to the set of credentials that include at least a subset that are intended to be assigned to a device or user on a permanent basis. In some embodiments the term temporary credentials generally refers to the set of credentials that include at least a subset that are intended to be assigned to a device or user on a temporary basis. In some embodiments temporary credentials are eventually replaced by permanent credentials. In some embodiments at least some elements in the temporary credentials e.g. phone number and or access or authorization security credential are used for more than one device. In some embodiments the temporary credentials are recycled from one or more devices and used for one or more other devices for example when they remain unused for a period of time or when they are replaced with permanent credentials on one or more devices. It should not be inferred from the term permanent credentials that permanent credentials are never recycled for example when the user discontinues service or use of the credentials. Also the term temporary credentials does not imply that temporary credentials are always temporary. In some embodiments partial credentials or pre activation credentials generally refer to a subset of credentials that are to gain access to limited network services for the purpose of provisioning of credentials and or activation of a service plan or service profile. For example prior to a phone number being assigned a device can gain access to a limited set of network server destinations in which embedded information contained in the device e.g. the partial credentials is provided to the server the server associates that information with the proper additional credentials including the phone number to assign to the device and or associates the information with the proper service profile to activate service. In this example partial credentials can include device type OEM service provider VSP device identification number SIM service processor configuration or some other information used by the server to determine what the credentials should be and the proper service profile.

In some embodiments a permanent service account generally refers to the service account that is permanently associated with the user and or device. For example this account includes an association with the device or user credentials user information or billing information service profile billing profile network authorization status and other aspects that define the device or user service policies and billing policies. In some embodiments the term temporary service account generally refers to a service account that is temporarily set up and associated with the device before some or all of the required permanent account information is available or entered for a device or user. For example this account can be set up with an association with an actual user or can be set up with a mock user or unassigned user association so that the network and billing system can recognize the credentials authenticate the device admit the device provide the proper level of service activity control according to the service profile associated with the temporary service account or collect the service activity usage information for various network and billing system accounting needs before actual user information or billing information has been entered into the network systems. For example a temporary service account can make it possible or easier to use existing billing systems or other network systems to provide simplified provisioning simplified activation or ambient services. A temporary service account can also become a permanent service account by replacing mock user or unassigned user information with actual user information or a temporary service account may need to be replaced by a permanent service account when actual user information needs to be entered into the network systems possibly including the billing or service profile databases.

In some embodiments temporary or permanent device credentials and other information used required for provisioning the device are generated with apparatus located at the manufacturer or in the distribution channel as discussed below. In some embodiments the apparatus includes a local onsite server that typically shares some aspects of the provisioning information e.g. phone number phone number range MEID or MEID range SIM number or SIM number range IP address or IP address range MAC address or MAC address range other secure device credential elements with a network provisioning database. In some embodiments the apparatus includes a server terminal and the aforementioned portion of the credentials is generated by the network and shared with the local provisioning apparatus. In some embodiments as will be discussed below the provisioning credentials are in part generated in the network and shared with the device while it is connected online to an activation server e.g. activation server that is connected to the access network. Similarly there can be activation servers connected to apparatus in the manufacturing or distribution channel that service device activation or over the air or over the network apparatus connected to an activation server which in turn connects to the device can be used to accomplish activation programming of the network and device as further discussed below.

In some embodiments when a device is provisioned and entered into the network provisioning database it is associated with the automatic provisioning and or activation sequence the device is intended to go through once it connects to the network or to the apparatus that will complete the process. In some embodiments one or more device parameters e.g. service owner device type OEM plan type IP address security credential and or software version are used to determine what the appropriate network provisioning steps and or settings are for completing the provisioning and or activation process and this association information is stored in the network provisioning database for propagation of the provisioning profiles or activation profiles to the various network equipment elements. In some embodiments the network provisioning database is provided e.g. in the network that associates the pre activation provisioning information e.g. generated as described herein at time of manufacture sometime during distribution by the user on a website by a sales associate or other activation assistant or by the network when a new device enters the automatic activation process . For example the pre activation provisioning information informs the network whether or not to let the device onto an activation sequence when the device attempts access and in some cases also instructs the network to direct the device to a specific activation sequence including for example an activation server or other activation sequencing apparatus sequence as described herein. In some embodiments a central database is queried by other network equipment or the central database is included in one or more of the network elements e.g. the AAA server and or billing system mobile wireless center or the database is copied in part or in whole in various network elements e.g. the central database AAA server mobile wireless center billing system and or gateways .

In some embodiments propagating the network equipment provisioning information for a given device or group of devices is accomplished with a network provisioning system that has access to the network provisioning database and is capable of programming the appropriate network equipment. In some embodiments this network equipment is referred to as network management equipment or network provisioning equipment. In some embodiments there are several functions that take part individually or in concert including for example the AAA server service controller either with device based assisted services through the service processor related embodiments or with network only embodiments as described herein the mobile wireless center e.g. including the home location register HLR or other similar function referred to by other industry terms the activation server s other network provisioning or management equipment attached to or associated with the billing database system and or some other equipment apparatus. In some embodiments the local database on the device database in the AAA server and or database elsewhere in network is provisioned to inform the gateway of the process for handling the pre provisioned device according to for example the credentials. For example if the device is not recognized or not authenticated onto the access network as an activated device with associated active service profile and or service plan the device connection or communication can be directed or routed to a generic activation server that provides an activation sequence that is not necessarily determined by one or more of the specific device credential elements partial credential elements device profile or partial device profile that define something specific about the activation sequence for the device. In another example in which the device is not recognized or authenticated as an activated device with associated service profile and or service plan the device can be directed or routed to an activation service or other activation sequencing apparatus that uses some part of the credentials or range of partial credentials or a portion of a partial or complete device profile to determine a desired pre determined device specific or device group specific activation sequence that is implemented by a specific activation service sequence or other activation sequence apparatus. In another example in which the device is not recognized or authenticated as an activated device with associated active service profile and or service plan a portion of the device credentials or partial credentials can be used as a look up index into a database that determines what the specific device activation sequence should be and the device can be directed or routed to a specific activation server sequence or other activation sequencing apparatus.

In some embodiments a database in the AAA server or database elsewhere in network is provisioned to inform the gateway what to do with a pre provisioned device according to the credentials. For example devices can be authenticated for activated devices routed to activation servers or other activation sequencing apparatus or denied access. In some embodiments the AAA server and or other network elements provide the above discussed look up function for the above gateway description in which a lookup database locally stored or stored in a central database is queried to provide secondary routing information to the specific or generic activation servers.

In some embodiments the pre provisioned database is located in the billing system. In some embodiments the billing system accesses the pre provisioned database e.g. stored on the billing system or another network element for the purpose of setting up temporary accounts or permanent accounts and associating those accounts with pre activation status activated free ambient or activated paying customer.

In some embodiments for zero activation all the required pre provisioning or programming of the above network elements or others is coordinated by the network provisioning system at some point after the partial or full device credentials have been associated with the device or reserved for a particular device type or service type. In some embodiments the network provisioning system also coordinates the information to or from the device provisioning apparatus that is described elsewhere.

In view of the various embodiments described herein it will be appreciated that many of the automated or background provisioning activation and ambient embodiments described herein can be accomplished with network based approaches device based approaches or network device combination hybrid based approaches. For example when the access control for the provisioning process is accomplished in the device e.g. a device based approach the activation server can be located anywhere on the Internet and the device will ensure that the activation process is conducted with the activation server while blocking other traffic from occurring. As another example some or all of the ambient provisioning programming steps become steps to program the access control traffic control application control bill by account rules and or other aspects in the service processor or service controller as described herein.

In some embodiments the provisioning apparatus described herein can be a computer located in the user s home or business and the user or an IT manager has access to a website that provides the provisioning information in which the computer serves as the provisioning or software programming apparatus. In some embodiments the network itself possibly through an activation server website or other interface to the device becomes the provisioning apparatus in some cases with the assistance of software on the device to affect the programming of provisioning information from the network or the communication of device credentials or other information to the network. For example this software can be a background process that runs without user interaction a portal widget program a web browser based program a WAP browser based program and or any other program that provides a counterpart function to the network functions effecting the provisioning e.g. activation server . In some embodiments the activation server either initiates a specific provisioning sequence if device software is present to assist or routes to a website for manual entry if there is no software present.

In some embodiments a device software loading and programming apparatus provides software loading or device settings functions that form a portion or all of the provisioning or pre provisioning device configuration or form a portion or all of the device activation profile configuration or form the device service owner master agent or VSP device assignment or signature and in some embodiments using an activation tracking service ATS system. As discussed herein the ATS monitors network connections and aspects of traffic that provide insight into which networks the device is gaining access to in some embodiments for the purpose of ensuring that an OEM master agent device service owner or VSP is being compensated for devices that activate on a service provider network. In some embodiments the ATS agent connects to a server counterpart that records and in some embodiments also analyzes the service or network connection information to make a determination of the type of access service the device is receiving and in some cases determine which networks the device is activated on. In some embodiments the ATS is installed on the device in a manner that makes it difficult to tamper with or remove so that the entity that is intended to get credit for device service activation does get credit e.g. the ATS agent can be loaded into secure memory it can be installed with software that makes it difficult to de install it can be installed on the modem possibly in secure memory it can be installed in the BIOS it can be installed deep in the OS kernel it can be installed with one or more additional device agents that monitor the ATS agent and alert a network function or re install it if tampered with . The SIM inventory is provided to illustrate that in some embodiments hardware elements e.g. a SIM security module as shown or hardware configurations are also installed or manipulated in device and these operations and the recording of the resulting associations form a portion of the provisioning or pre provisioning process.

In some embodiments at the time the credentials or partial credentials are loaded programmed set installed read from the device or otherwise recorded they are in some cases all associated together in a database that allows for later identification of the device and its appropriate provisioning and or activation process through such associations. For example this can involve reading device parameters such as MEID MAC address device type or other information that is associated with the information being loaded or configured on the device. As discussed herein this credential configuration and association information is stored in the network equipment responsible using it to configure the network to activate the device in one of the various embodiments disclosed herein.

Some embodiments include tying some or all of the activation provisioning steps and information settings together into a database that defines a higher level activation profile for a group of users devices and a server is used to perform device and equipment programming for the devices in the group including for example associating the following device information into the group definition credentials service owner or master agent provisioning information and or activation profile. Some embodiments further provide for this device group information being distributed to the various network equipment components required to activate the devices as discussed elsewhere. In some embodiments this programming and device group association is accomplished using the VSP workstation server . For example a device can be manufactured and distributed in a manner that provides flexible assignment of the device to a group that is assigned to an activation profile or a service owner.

In some embodiments multiple activation servers are provided as shown which illustrates that there can be multiple device activation servers each with a different device activation experience and potentially controlled by a different VSP service owner service provider OEM or master agent. As discussed herein there are several ways that a device can be routed to the proper activation server so that the device provisioning and activation process can be completed. In some embodiments all devices that are not activated are re directed or routed to an activation server that reads one or more parameters in the device credentials. The device credential information can be determined either through the device identification information associated with the access network connection itself e.g. MEID IP address phone number security credentials or other credentials identified for a device that gains access with the network or with the aid of the device in a pre arranged query response sequence. The device can then be re directed or routed to the appropriate activation server for that device device group device service owner or VSP. In some embodiments the same process described above can be accomplished with a single re direction from a service gateway or or another router enable network element. In some embodiments the gateway or network element itself decodes the device credential information as described herein and performs the correct re direct or route to the appropriate activation server for that device. In some embodiments the activation server can be incorporated directly into the gateway or the base station or other network component. In some embodiments the activation server can be incorporated into the service controller or the service controller device control system .

In some embodiments apparatus other than the activation server are used to facilitate provisioning of credentials or partial credentials or activation during manufacturing or device distribution and for example these apparatus can augment supplement compliment or replace the activation server function. Such apparatus include for example device programming equipment e.g. device credential provisioning apparatus device software loading and programming apparatus or SIM inventory equipment that is networked into a central provider MVNO or VSP database e.g. device credential software and settings server to gain access to provisioning information or activation information that is programmed into a device or group of devices or to place device credential or partial credential information in a network database for later recognition or to receive or communicate security information such as certificates for devices or SIM modules that will later be used to complete provisioning or complete activation or gain access to a network. For example these apparatus or any other apparatus including the activation server can be networked into a service provider network or device database an MVNO network or device database or a VSP network or device database. In some embodiments programming of the device credentials or other information associated with the service processor or device is provided so that for example the device can be recognized by an activation server or similar network function at a later point in time so that provisioning or activation can be completed in an automated manner potentially with reduced or no user involvement that provides a provisioning or activation configuration that is in some way unique for the service provider or service provider partner device type user group VSP MVNO master agent or other entity. In some embodiments this programming is provided in a manner that is difficult to change without the proper authorization so that the device is properly associated with the proper service owner or master agent e.g. for the purpose of activation incentive payments . For example as discussed herein various approaches can be applied to the device credential or other settings or software provisioning so that the settings or software are secure or protected or so that if the software is removed replaced or modified it is reported or replace or restored. In some embodiments VSP control of the provisioning partial provisioning or activation of devices is provided during manufacture or at different points in the distribution channel. As discussed herein some of these embodiments allow the central provider to offer to service partners e.g. VSPs MVNOs master agents and or OEMs similar types of control for device activation experience design or device service assignment control e.g. sometimes referred to as service provider device locking so that other service providers cannot provide primary access to the device during the manufacturing or distribution process that are possible with devices manufactured and distributed for the central service provider.

In some embodiments the device is provisioned before the user obtains the device with permanent credentials temporary credentials or partial credentials. In this case the necessary credential programming of the device occurs during manufacture at some point in the device distribution such as at a distribution depot or in a store or at the point of sale or point of shipment. In some embodiments provisioning of network information as discussed above is used and the network information is provisioned at the same time before or after the device information is provisioned. In some embodiments the device provisioning information is programmed with dedicated apparatus that connects to the device either with wires or wirelessly. For example the dedicated apparatus can be local to the location where the device is being provisioned or it can be partially or entirely networked into a database or provisioning solution located elsewhere and operated by the central provider a VSP OEM or other entity. For example the apparatus to program the network portions of the provisioning information can also be networked and the operators who set up the required network programming for a device or group of devices may be in the vicinity of the servers that host the provisioning and management tools or they may network into the servers. In some embodiments provisioning system operators have full or partial control of any device provisioning equipment associated with the entity they work for e.g. OEM VSP or master agent but only have remote access via secure terminal secure website or other techniques to network into a central provider or VSP server farm in which they control or partially control the network portion of provisioning capabilities for that subset of devices that are assigned to the entity they work for with e.g. OEM VSP or master agent .

In some embodiments provisioning is accomplished over the air on the mobile access network for mobile devices or over the wired access network or WLAN connection for wired access networks either before the user receives the device or after the user receives the device. In some cases the device can be connected to general purpose equipment such as a computer to perform the programming required to complete provisioning. In the cases in which the device is provisioned at point of sale or after point of sale the device provisioning can be triggered by a user initiated sequence or can be initiated by an automated background sequence at any time after the device is powered on. In such cases in some embodiments partial credentials that include information such as device type OEM or service provider are used to assist in determining how to complete the provisioning and the information can also include secure information certificate or signature programmed into the partial credentials that is required for the network to perform the provisioning of the remaining credential information in the device and possibly the network. In some embodiments any network information used required to provision the device or service is generated at the time the partial credentials are determined rather than beforehand.

In some embodiments the device is activated for service before the user obtains the device with permanent credentials temporary credentials or partial credentials or with a permanent service account or a temporary service account. For example in this case the necessary steps of provisioning and activating service for the device can occur during manufacture at some point in the device distribution such as at a distribution depot or in a store or at the point of sale or point of shipment. In some embodiments the steps for activating service include one or more of the following provision the device e.g. with permanent temporary or partial credentials provision the necessary network databases and equipment to prepare them to recognize the device and associate it with the service profile and or service plan create or select the service account e.g. permanent or temporary service account select or create the service profile and or service plan program any elements in the device required to activate service e.g. account ID device aspects of the service profile and or service plan and program the necessary network databases and equipment with the required associations of device credentials and service profile and or service plan policy settings. In some embodiments the device oriented programming portions of the service activation steps occur at the same time before or after the network oriented programming portions of the service activation steps.

In some embodiments the device activation information is programmed with dedicated apparatus that connects to the device via a wireless or wire line connection. For example the dedicated apparatus can be local to the location where the device is being provisioned or the dedicated apparatus can be partially or entirely networked into a database or service activation solution located elsewhere and operated by the central provider a VSP OEM or other entity. For example the apparatus to program the network portions of the activation information can also be networked and the operators who set up the required network programming for a device or group of devices can be in the vicinity of the servers that host the service activation and management tools or they can network into the servers. In some embodiments activation server tools operators have full or partial control of any device activation apparatus associated with the entity they work for e.g. OEM VSP or master agent but only have remote and partial access via secure terminal secure website or other techniques to network into the network portion of the activation tools that are controlled by the central provider or VSP. The server tools operators can be restricted in some embodiments to providing network activation information or settings only for those devices or device groups that are assigned to the entity they work for with e.g. OEM VSP or master agent . For example the device control group restriction can be accomplished with a secure database that has secure sub partitions for one or more entities so that they cannot impact the control of one another s network activation settings but can control their own devices. In this way a centralized set of activation tools resources controlled by a central provider VSP or other entity can be partitioned so that different entities can have partial or full control of the activation service definition for devices or groups of devices without impact or risk to others who share the network and activation tools resources.

In some embodiments activation is accomplished with an over the air interface to a mobile device or over the wired access network or WLAN connection for wired access networks either before the user receives the device or after the user receives the device. In some cases the device can be connected to general purpose equipment such as a computer to perform the programming required to complete activation. In the cases in which the device is activated at point of sale or after point of sale the final device activation process can be triggered by a user initiated sequence or can be initiated by an automated background sequence at any time after the device is powered on. In such cases some embodiments call for a temporary service account that is used to bring the device onto the network before the user has input the information necessary to create a permanent service account. In some embodiments a temporary or permanent service account can be applied to the device at the time the device reaches the network and the type of account service profile and or service plan can be influenced e.g. partially determined or informed or determined by information embedded in the device credentials or partial credentials such as device type device ID SIM OEM or service provider. For example the device credentials can also include secure information certificate or signature that can be required by the network to perform the activation steps for temporary or permanent service account status. In some embodiments in which the device is activated in this manner before the user information is available or before the user has selected a pay for service plan the service profile and service plan are set up for ambient services as described herein.

In some embodiments the device is activated during the manufacturing or distribution process and then the activated device status is suspended. Once the temporary or permanent service account is set up with appropriate service profile and or service plan and temporary or permanent credentials in some networks and billing systems the service can often be more easily resumed once suspended as compared to provisioning and activating the device from scratch. The device is then later resumed or re activated when some event triggers the resume process such as when it ships to the end user or when the end user attempts to use it. This process prevents the network from needing to manage credentials and accounts for devices that have been activated but are not yet on the network.

In some embodiments provisioning is accomplished at least in part with temporary credentials in a manner which is automated and convenient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments at least some subset of the temporary credential elements replaced at a later point in time by permanent credential elements in a manner that is also automated and convenient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments the temporary credential set is pre programmed into the device along with a temporary or permanent service account including service profile during the manufacturing or distribution process so that the device is activated with temporary credentials when it ships. In some embodiments the aforementioned pre programming is performed for the network via a secure set of server access equipment that networks into the network databases used to define the service profile and or the service plan. In some embodiments a subset of the temporary credentials is recycled once it is replaced if a temporary service account is not activated or used after some period of time if a permanent account is not activated or used after some period of time or if the credentials subset is revoked from the device for some other reason.

In some embodiments more than one device is assigned one or more elements of the temporary credentials such as the phone number which may be limited in supply. In some embodiments a network will accept more than one set of temporary credentials one or more redundant elements for two or more different devices. In some embodiments a device that has two or more temporary credential sets in which at least a subset of the credential elements are different for the sets so that if one set of credentials has elements that are already being used to access the network then one or more reserve sets can be drawn upon to gain access to the network.

In some embodiments the temporary credentials are used to log onto the network to conduct an over the air or over the network activation process in which an activation server reads at least a portion the device credentials to determine some aspect of how the device service profile. In some embodiments the aforementioned over the air activation process is accomplished in the background without user intervention. In some embodiments the over the air activation process is initiated when the user first attempts to use the device or when the user first attempts to access the network or upon user request or approval. In some embodiments the over the air activation process is initiated using a temporary service account for the device and or network to gain access to the network. In some embodiments the over the air activation process is initiated after the user has entered the information required to create a permanent user account into the device or into the network. In some embodiments the user is required to enter the aforementioned user information before using the device or using some aspect of the device. In some embodiments the temporary service account is replaced by a permanent service account some time after the user has entered the necessary information to create a permanent account into the device or network. In some embodiments the over the air activation process is initiated using a permanent service account assignment for the device and or network to gain access to the network.

In some embodiments the service profile is assigned to the device and or network during the aforementioned over the air activation to be a pay for service profile with a free trial period. In some embodiments the service profile assigned to the device and or network during the aforementioned over the air activation includes pre pay post pay session based pay or pay as you go options for service. As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art various embodiments disclosed herein are particularly well suited for control or pre pay services. In some embodiments the service profile that is assigned to the device and or network during the aforementioned over the air activation is an ambient service profile providing service access before all the user information is available to assign a permanent account. In some embodiments the service profile that is assigned to the device and or network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient service profile providing a service upgrade selection option interface to the user. In some embodiments the service profile that is assigned to the device and or network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient service profile providing transaction services to the user. In some embodiments the service profile that is assigned to the device and or network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient service profile providing bill by account functionality for the network. In some embodiments the service profile that is assigned to the device and or network during the aforementioned activation is an ambient service profile providing some amount of free networking or information service to entice the user to use the other ambient services. In some embodiments the aforementioned ambient service is at least partially implemented with device based service activity control or control assistance. In some embodiments the aforementioned ambient service is at least partially implemented by gateways routers or switches in the network that are programmed according to the ambient access profile for the device to implement the ambient policies for network access control routing control traffic control or service monitoring and reporting for bill by account.

In some embodiments activation is accomplished at least in part with a temporary service account in a manner that is automated and convenient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments at least some subset of the temporary service account is replaced at a later point in time by permanent service account subset in a manner that is also automated and convenient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments the temporary service account settings e.g. including the service profile settings and or the service plan settings are pre programmed into the device along with a temporary or permanent credentials set during the manufacturing or distribution process so that the device is activated with temporary credentials when it ships. In some embodiments the aforementioned pre programming for the network is performed via a secure set of server access equipment that networks into the network databases used to define the service profile and or the service plan. In some embodiments the device is suspended once it is activated but before the user is using it and then resumed before or commensurate with the point in time that the user begins to use it. In some embodiments some subset of the temporary service account is recycled once it is replaced if the temporary service account is not used after some period of time if the temporary service account is not upgraded to a permanent service account after some period of time or if the activation is revoked from the device for some other reason. In some embodiments more than one device is assigned to the same temporary service account. In some embodiments a network accepts more than one device on the same temporary service account. In some embodiments a device includes or is associated with two or more temporary service accounts in which at least a subset of the temporary service account elements are different so that if one account is already being used to access the network then one or more reserve accounts can be drawn upon to gain access to the network. In some embodiments the temporary service account is associated with a temporary credentials set. In some embodiments the temporary service account is associated with a permanent credentials set.

In some embodiments un activated devices are detected by the network routing equipment e.g. service gateways or routers in hierarchical networks or base stations with embedded gateways in flat networks and the device routing is programmed to re direct un activated devices to an activation server network destination. For example the activation server can first inspect the information associated with the device to determine if the device belongs to the list of devices device types or device groups that the network is programmed to provide access to. For example the information used to determine this can include device type service provider phone number device ID SIM ID or configuration secure information used to qualify the device IP address MAC address user user group VSP OEM device distributor service distributor master agent service processor presence or configuration presence or configuration of other software or hardware. There can also be some activation definition information embedded in the credentials or associated with some portion of the credentials or programmed additionally on the device that informs the activation server as to the service profile and or service plan and or service account that should be established for the device. If activation information the service profile service plan and or service account information is found through association with the device credentials e.g. device ID phone number IP address MAC address SIM or other security credentials rather than being read directly from information embedded in the device or device credentials then the pertinent aspects of the credentials can be used as a cross reference to look up the service plan and or service profile information stored in a database networked to or within the activation server. The activation information can include information to define a wide variety of service plans and service profiles that when properly implemented on the network functions and perhaps device if necessary can provide for a wide range of service activity policies service billing policies transaction billing policies and service account types that can be associated with the device over the air or over the network.

In some embodiments once the activation server has determined the activation information from the device or from a look up based on some aspect of the device credentials then the activation server initiates the necessary network settings and billing database entries to be programmed by sending the service profile instructions to the network provisioning and activation apparatus and the service plan instructions to the billing system. In some embodiments the activation server can then also send the any necessary service profile and or service plan settings required for the device to a provisioning and activation support software function on the device such as various embodiments of the service processor so that the device provisioning and activation can be completed. The provisioning can be with permanent credentials or temporary credentials and the service account that is set up may be permanent or temporary. In some embodiments the activation process described above is completed perhaps before the user has entered some or all of the user information necessary to set up a permanent service account and in these cases a temporary service account can be set up. In some cases the activation process can be completed in the background before the user has completed an attempt to access the network and the service profile can be set up to provide ambient services to a temporary service account. In some embodiments the user is required to enter the information required to establish a permanent service account prior to gaining full use of the device either on the device on a computer or in the store so that by the time the user begins using the device the above activation embodiments can provide for ambient services activation with permanent account status so that the user can purchase a service upgrade or any transaction without entering any more account information.

In some embodiments a device status is changed from a temporary service account to a permanent service account. If the device is activated with a temporary service account and the user information is available to set up a permanent account then if the billing system rules and interfaces allow for such the user information can be changed from the mock information to the actual user information while maintaining the same account identifiers in the billing system. If the billing system will not allow for such then the user information can be used to establish a new account the device credentials can be re associated with the new account in some cases after modifying one or more of the device credential parameters and the network functions can be re programmed as required and in some cases the device can be re programmed as required to accommodate the new permanent account.

In some embodiments code on the device pulls a temporary or permanent set of credentials. When the credentials are pulled the network associates the device with an ambient service profile according to one or more of the following embedded device information identifying device type service owner e.g. VSP user group or user or device ID is cross referenced to a database that is populated some time from manufacturing time to post sale where the database provides information identifying device type service owner e.g. VSP user group or user. The device is then re directed accordingly e.g. for device based this is a matter of setting the policies or loading the software for the service processor for the network based approach this is a matter of populating the routing tables and service profile . For example credentials can be re cycled after a period of time and or some portion of the credentials can be redundant with other devices. For example this is essentially a dynamic service for temporarily assigning device credentials and the duration of the temporary credential validity for that device ID can be time limited to give the user time to activate a real account or a free trial session limited or a longer duration of time that is perhaps refreshed each time the device logs on. For example the device could also already have permanent or temporary credentials but not have a service account. The above process can be used to assign a temporary or permanent service account as well. Once the service account is assigned and the appropriate service profile is propagated to the network elements the device can then be directed to or use the appropriate activation profile service activities or the appropriate ambient service activities.

In some embodiments the device is activated in the background in a manner that is virtually transparent to the user. For example at some point in the distribution channel the device is programmed to seek the activation server system described above as soon as it is turned on or as soon as some other event occurs like the user using the device or the user attempting to gain access. When the pre programmed event is triggered the device connects to the network and the gateways or routers re direct the device to an activation server as discussed above. As also described herein the activation server either derives information from the device that informs the server what service the device should be activated with or the server derives that information from a database look up with a portion of the device credentials as the cross reference parameter. Once the activation server has determined the activation information from the device or from a look up based on some aspect of the device credentials then the activation server causes all the necessary network settings and billing database entries to be configured programmed by sending the service profile instructions to the network provisioning and activation apparatus and the service plan instructions to the billing system. In some embodiments the activation server can then also send the any necessary service profile and or service plan settings required for the device to a provisioning and activation support software function on the device such as various embodiments of the service processor so that the device provisioning and activation can be completed. For example the provisioning can be with permanent credentials or temporary credentials and the service account that is set up can be permanent or temporary.

In some embodiments background activation is performed using the aforementioned activate suspend process. At some point in the distribution channel the device is programmed to seek to resume service as soon as it is turned on or as soon as some other event occurs like the user using the device or the user attempting to gain access. When the pre programmed event is triggered the device attempts to connect to the network and the gateways or routers re direct the device to an activation server as described herein. As also described herein the activation server either derives information from the device that informs the server that the device is ready to resume service or the server derives that information from a database look up with a portion of the device credentials as the cross reference parameter. Once the server is aware of this information it sends a message to resume service to the billing system or other network function that controls the suspend resume function and the service is resumed.

In some embodiments background activation is performed as described below. The service processor and the credentials are pre programmed during the manufacturing or distribution process to provide the desired service profile support and or billing profile support for the desired initial ambient service. As described herein this programming can be accomplished with dedicated apparatus at the manufacturer or distribution depot. Furthermore the party responsible for defining the service e.g. typically the central provider OEM VSP distributor or master agent can network into the service processor programming apparatus to control service processor and or credential programming for all or a subset or group of the devices or device types locally available. The service processor enabled device is programmed to seek the activation server system described above as soon as it is turned on or as soon as some other event occurs like the user using the device or the user attempting to gain access. In some embodiments the activation server is the access control server previously discussed or the access control server can act in concert with another server that performs the activation function. When the pre programmed event is triggered the device connects to the network and the gateways or routers re direct the device to the activation server. As also described herein the activation server can communicate with the service processor to verify the service processor security credentials agents and configuration.

In some embodiments if the activation server determines that the pre programmed settings stored in the service processor need to be modified to provide the latest version of the desired service or if the service processor agent software needs to be updated then this can be accomplished prior to completing the activation process. Once the service processor configuration and settings are confirmed the activation server causes the necessary network settings and billing database entries to be programmed by sending the service profile instructions to the network provisioning and activation apparatus and the service plan instructions to the billing system. Given that the service processor can perform some or much of the service activity control or control assistance the service control options are generally larger than without the service processor and there can be less configuration to perform for other networking equipment to complete the provisioning and activation process. The provisioning can be with permanent credentials or temporary credentials and the service account that is set up can be permanent or temporary.

In some embodiments pre programming and pre activation of devices with temporary credentials and a temporary service account are used to ship devices that are pre activated. Given that the credentials are temporary and can be recycled when the permanent credentials are assigned concerns about using up too many pre assigned credentials are reduced. In embodiments in which a portion of credentials elements can be used for multiple devices this concern is further reduced. If there is a concern about too many activated devices being assigned that are not actually active and generating service revenue then the suspend resume process discussed herein can be employed. In some embodiments the temporary credentials and or temporary account can be replaced with permanent credentials and or account assignments at any time as follows. When a pre programmed event in the device is triggered then the device initiates a program that seeks the aforementioned activation server or another server that has the capability of fulfilling the device request to exchange the temporary credentials for permanent credentials and or exchange the temporary account for a permanent account. The event that triggers the credential exchange can be the same or different than the event that triggers the service account exchange. The service account exchange can typically be triggered by the point in time that the user enters account information.

In some embodiments the aforementioned ambient service is partly implemented with a combination of the techniques for pre provisioning during manufacturing or distribution and at least partially implementing the service activity control e.g. access control routing policy traffic control usage limits and or policy for usage limit overage required for implementing ambient using the service policy provisioning capabilities in the data path gateways routers or switches in the network. The gateways router or switches are pre programmed as discussed herein according to the ambient access profile for the device to implement the ambient policies for network access control routing control traffic control or service monitoring and reporting for bill by account. In some embodiments the provisioning credential elements are not all pre programmed before the device ships but a subset of the credential elements are programmed using the activation server technique discussed herein. This over the air automated provisioning is combined with the activation server reading the device credentials to derive the service activity control settings for the gateways routers or switches that will result in the desired ambient services activity controls.

In some embodiments the aforementioned ambient service is implemented with a combination of the techniques for pre activation during manufacturing or distribution and at least partially implementing the service activity control e.g. access control routing policy traffic control usage limits and or policy for usage limit overage required for implementing ambient using the service policy control capabilities in the data path gateways routers or switches in the network. The gateways router or switches are programmed to recognize the pre activated device credentials as discussed herein according to the ambient access profile for the device to implement the ambient policies for network access control routing control traffic control or service monitoring and reporting for bill by account. In some embodiments the device activation profile and or service account are not pre programmed in the network and or the device before the device ships but the activation profile and or service account are programmed using the activation server technique discussed herein. This over the air automated provisioning is combined with the activation server reading the device credentials to derive the service profile activity control settings for the gateways routers or switches that results in the desired ambient services activity controls.

In some embodiment a VSP capability is enabled by providing a secure network connection to the service policy settings tools that define the device pre provisioning settings the device pre activation service profile settings the network equipment service activity control policy settings e.g. access control routing policy traffic control usage limits and or policy for usage limit overage and the network billing system database. By providing server tools that enable all these settings to be controlled or perhaps only observed in the case of the billing system by a secure workstation or secure website interface that networks into the equipment that programs the settings and providing for a secure partitioning of the devices that can be controlled by a given secure workstation or secure website interface a central provider can provide VSP services to multiple entities who all have different device and service plan combinations that they desire different flavors of ambient services for. These techniques can also be extended beyond ambient to any device service profile service plan combo the VSP desires to create. In some embodiments the networking equipment is implemented to secure device service group domains in which the service policies for a group of devices can be controlled. In some embodiments the pre provisioning and pre activation techniques are substituted with the over the air activation server techniques discussed herein and a secure device group partition capability is provided in the activation server as well so that the activation server device group partition control capabilities can be added to the secure device group partition control capabilities of the network gateways routers and or switches the device programming tools and the billing system to form a VSP partition solution for over the air activation of various device service plan combinations. In some embodiments the device groups are relatively small so that beta trials of arbitrarily large or small size can be designed and implemented by defining a service control group as described above and after fine tuning and perfecting the beta trial settings the device group can be expanded to publish the automated provisioning and activation service settings to a larger user or device group for production services.

In some embodiments device based service activity control assistance e.g. based on the various service processor embodiments described herein is combined with simplified provisioning techniques described herein so that service processor enabled devices can be shipped with pre provisioned credentials temporary or permanent or can obtain credentials in an automated manner that is convenient and efficient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments the service processor embodiments in combination with the manufacturing and supply chain credentials and provisioning apparatus described elsewhere provide various approaches for provisioning pre provisioned service processor enabled devices. In some embodiments the service processor embodiments in combination with the activation server variants discussed above provide various approaches for over the air or over the network simplified post sale provisioning for service processor enabled devices. For example these embodiments can also be used for ambient services given that as discussed herein the service processor has capability to implement service profile policies for deep control of ambient service activity control.

In some embodiments provisioning includes provisioning partial device credentials that include for example a secure certificate that is used to authorize full credential provisioning and or activation by performing a process for a later look up validation of the full device credentials. For example the look up validation of the full device credentials can be performed by a gateway router or similar network device that re directs to a provisioning server and or activation server or other network components that either 1 recognizes the partial credentials that serve as a reference to direct the device communication to a specific provisioning activation server determined from the partial credentials or 2 does not recognize the partial credentials and directs the device communication to a less specific provisioning activation server that is not necessarily associated with a reference to the partial credentials.

In some embodiments if the partial device credentials e.g. temporary or permanent credentials are being used for provisioning then the partial credentials are read e.g. and or other credentials can be looked up based on the partial credentials as described above . The device is authorized if the proper credentials and or secure certificate is present. The device credential provisioning is then completed e.g. using activation server commands or settings to a device based software and or hardware element and the credentials are in some cases also communicated to the various network equipment elements.

In some embodiments if the partial device credentials are being used for activation then partial or full device credential provisioning is performed such as described above. A service account e.g. temporary or permanent service account is created or looked up based on the partial device credentials e.g. a user account associated with the device through embedded partial or full credentials or a look up process or based on a dynamically created assigned temporary account associated with the device through embedded partial or full credentials . An initial service profile and in some cases an initial service plan e.g. service control policy settings including a billing profile are determined from embedded information and or using a look up process e.g. based on the device type and or partial or full device credentials . The device is then programmed to enable access with the service profile and plan and in some cases the various network components elements are programmed to enable the service profile and plan and in some cases proper entries in the billing system are made or confirmed and the device credentials are thus activated for service.

In some embodiments the above described provisioning and or activation processes are performed with the provisioning server s and or activation server s in the background with reduced minimal or no user input required for example after the device is sold to the user and the user turns on the device so that by the time the user attempts to access the service using the device the provisioning and or activation process is already completed.

In some embodiments device based service activity control assistance e.g. based on the service processor embodiments is combined with simplified activation techniques described herein so that service processor enabled devices can be shipped with pre activated accounts temporary or permanent or can obtain activated account status in an automated manner that is convenient and efficient for the user or device owner. In some embodiments the service processor embodiments in combination with the manufacturing and supply chain activation and provisioning apparatus described elsewhere provide various approaches for pre activated service processor enabled devices. In some embodiments the service processor embodiments in combination with the activation server variants discussed above provide various approaches for over the air or over the network simplified post sale account activation for service processor enabled devices. These embodiments can also be used for ambient services given that as discussed herein the service processor has capability to implement service profile policies for deep control of ambient service activity control.

As discussed herein in some embodiments for activation the network AAA or other network function either recognizes one or more aspects of a pre activated device credentials and routes the pre activated device communication to an activation server that is appropriate for that device routing information either derived through look up of the credential aspect or by obtaining the required information directly from the credential itself or the AAA or other network function does not recognize the credentials and routes the device communication to an activation server for unrecognized device credentials. In either case in some embodiments one or more of the credential aspects can then be used to perform a secondary determination of what provisioning and or activation sequence to perform in association with the device or which activation server sequence the device should be directed to. For example one or more device credential aspects can be read and used as a cross reference to determine a routing for the device communication or the information required for routing can be in the device credential information itself so that the device can be routed to the appropriate activation server sequence.

In some embodiments an activation server sequence can be determined at least in part by using a browser server or a portal e.g. http server https server WAP server or another standard or custom protocol server for a browser embedded or automated browser or a portal client in the device . In some embodiments the browser server is an http or https server. The pre activated device communication can be routed to the https server in a manner similar to that described above and the server can read the information embedded in the https communication to determine the device credential information required to initiate the correct provisioning completion and or activation sequences. For example the https header information tokens cookies or other secure information communicated over https from a secure embedded client on the device or user can either provide the activation server with the information required to perform the cross reference to an appropriate provisioning and or activation sequence or the https embedded information or the embedded client or user information can instruct the activation server on which services the device is to be provisioned and or activated on and any necessary device or user information e.g. device owner and or billing information can be exchanged or the device might be provisioned and or activated first on a free ambient service with temporary or permanent credentials or account.

In some embodiments the service processor can be combined with the pre provisioning and pre activation techniques described above to create an ambient service solution that will work on roaming networks in which the central provider or VSP has no control or minimal control over the network elements. For example the device includes a service processor pre programmed for ambient service activity control as discussed herein and the device credentials and other settings are pre provisioned and pre activated for the central provider network all of which is described in numerous embodiments disclosed herein. Provided that the service provider has a roaming agreement with other service providers or provided that the device may gain access to the roaming network when the device is roaming it will be capable of ambient connectivity with bill by account functionality and all the other features of ambient. Furthermore as also discussed herein the ambient service activity control policies can be different for different roaming networks to accommodate the varying network costs and performance. Also for example it would be permissible to sign up for initial services or additional upgrade services with the central provider while roaming on the roaming partner network. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this also allows for creating a VSP or MVNO for the purpose of creating a clearing house for central provider service activations according to geography or user choice. By using a global multi mode modem module and maintaining service agreements with a multitude of carriers the MVNO or VSP can provide consistent ambient services across multiple carriers and multiple geographies while still maintaining a good degree of cost control. Using bill by account capabilities it is also possible to have an activation agreement where a roaming service provider agrees to refund the cost of ambient roaming. From the ambient service platform the VSP or MVNO can then provide service purchase options to the user based on the carrier networks available to the device or the VSP or MVNO can broker the user off to any of the carriers by activating the device onto the carriers main central provider service.

Accordingly these embodiments provide flexible capabilities for activating a device or group of devices with a broad range of service profiles and service plans by simply programming the device with the proper credentials at some time during manufacturing or distribution or simply programming a database associated with the network so that a portion of the device credentials can be used to look up the desired service profile and service plan. For example various activation embodiments described herein are highly convenient for the end user and need not in many cases involve any human intervention.

The service processor service controller policy implementation and or profile implementation and various embodiments disclosed herein are applicable to conventional communication products as well as machine to machine applications. For example if the machine to machine device includes a service processor with an activated account then the service profile settings can be optimized for machine communications to provide only the limited access required to support the particular machine to machine application. This allows for cost optimized access services and prevents the machine to machine device or access modem from being misappropriated and used for some other service access than that intended. For example by programming the machine to machine communications device at time of manufacture or during distribution with credentials or partial credentials that provide for automated provisioning and activation as described herein the device can be automatically provisioned and activated on the service network with a service account when deployed thus eliminating the need for costly or time consuming human intervention. The various embodiments that make it simpler to design manufacture test and deploy devices may also be equally applied to machine to machine devices. These embodiments include the service processor developers kit and the automated provisioning and activation management tools among others. Also the service analysis and test tools and the virtual service provider embodiments can also be applied to machine to machine applications.

It should be appreciated that the various service monitoring notification control and billing embodiments disclosed herein can also be applied to intermediate networking device applications.

In some embodiments an intermediate networking device is a communications device in which the service processor is configured at least in part to allow the intermediate networking device to act as a service intermediary or intermediate connection between the network and one or more end point devices e.g. communications devices . In addition a service controller or other suitable network functions can be employed to assist with the verifiable service usage monitoring control and verification as disclosed in numerous embodiments described herein. In some embodiments an intermediate networking device does this by implementing the service policies required for assisting service usage control of the intermediate networking device and connecting the network to provide services to one or more end point devices that are connected to the intermediate networking device. In some embodiments the intermediate networking device also monitors the service use activities of the intermediate networking device and or the end point devices connected to the intermediate networking device. In some embodiments the intermediate networking device and or end point device service usage is verified to ensure that the service usage is within the expected ranges for the policies that are implemented. In some embodiments the intermediate networking device connects with the network using one modem technology and connects with the end point devices using one or more additional technologies. In some embodiments an intermediate networking device connects the end point devices to the network by passing bridging forwarding routing traffic shaping or otherwise allowing the end point devices to communicate with the network. Example intermediate networking device embodiments include a Wi Fi to WWAN e.g. 2G 3G 4G or other wireless wide area networking access technology bridge or router device a Wi Fi to DSL cable or fiber gateway device a WWAN to DSL or Cable femto cell device a WWAN and Wi Fi to DSL Cable or fiber back hauled femto cell device a WWAN to WWAN router device a WWAN to WLAN WPAN or LAN bridge router or gateway device or a WWAN back up connection device for an enterprise router.

An intermediate networking device can also be provided in some embodiments by including a bridging forwarding or routing function between two modems in a communications enabled device that connects to the network. For example an intermediate networking device configuration can be a cell phone smart phone mobile internet device or any other mobile device that includes a WWAN modem and a Wi Fi WLAN WPAN or LAN connection that can be used to connect to other end point devices. For example the mobile device WWAN modem can connect to the network a service processor can be included on the device processor to assist monitoring controlling and billing for services between the WWAN network and end point devices connected to a Wi Fi modem. In addition a service controller or other suitable network functions can be employed to assist with verifiable service usage monitoring control and verification as disclosed in numerous embodiments disclosed throughout herein. In some embodiments the Wi Fi modem can be configured in access point mode or in ad hoc mode to communicate with other end point devices in the area covered by the mobile device WLAN modem. In this manner a service processor and a service controller or other suitable network functions can be employed to enable the verifiable service usage monitoring control and verification as disclosed in numerous embodiments described herein.

Another example embodiment is a notebook or sub notebook computer with a WWAN modem and a Wi Fi Ethernet Firewire Bluetooth near field or Zigbee modem in which the notebook processor has a service processor running on the notebook processor and the service processor is used to assist monitoring control and billing for services communicated between the WWAN network and end point devices connected to the notebook or sub notebook WLAN LAN or WPAN. Another example embodiment is a Wi Fi hot spot with a service processor capability. Another example embodiment is a WWAN back up modem in an access network router where the back up modem connection to the WWAN network is used when the main wired network connection goes down and a router processor or a WWAN back up modem processor runs a service processor to assist monitoring controlling and billing for services between the WWAN network and the access router e.g. the service provider may only wish to enable a connection when the main wired network is down to ensure that the WWAN modem is not used for everyday access . In this manner a service processor and a service controller or other suitable network functions can be employed to enable the verifiable service usage monitoring control and verification as disclosed in numerous embodiments described herein.

Another example embodiment is a two way home gateway configured to perform various functions such as reading power consumption of the home and or components in the home providing WLAN WPAN or LAN connectivity for such components or to the power meters controllers attached to such components providing a WWAN or WAN connection to a network that reads records monitors and or controls the home and or component power consumption and possibly to provide other wide area network services for other devices in the home such as computers or entertainment electronics in a similar manner to the WWAN DSL cable and fiber gateway embodiments. The WLAN WPAN connections can be made with one or more of Wi Fi Zigbee Bluetooth NFC or any other suitable wireless modem technology and any desired wired LAN connections may be made with one or more of Ethernet USB Firewire data over cable data over power line or any other suitable wired modem technology. The WWAN connections can be made with one or more of 2G e.g. CDMA 1 RT GPRS 3G e.g. WCDMA UMTS HSPA non MIMO HSPA CDMA EVDOrA B 802.16d e WiMax 4G e.g. LTE MIMO HSPA MIMO 802.16m WiMax or any other suitable modem technologies and the wired WAN connections may be made with one or more of DSL Cable fiber or any other wired modem technology. A service processor and a service controller or other suitable network functions can be employed to enable the verifiable service usage monitoring control and verification as disclosed in numerous embodiments disclosed throughout herein.

In some embodiments an intermediate networking device can be used to connect one end point device to a network and assist in implementing service policies or an intermediate networking device can connect multiple end point devices to one or more networks and assist in implementing service policies. In some embodiments an intermediate networking device can be associated with one service profile one service plan or one service account or an intermediate networking device can be associated with multiple service profiles multiple service plans or multiple service accounts. In some embodiments end point devices connected to an intermediate networking device can have service usage policies implemented in aggregate for all end point devices or service policies can be implemented differentially for different end point devices.

In some embodiments an intermediate networking device can have a network connection associated with a single account and manage QOS between end point devices under one umbrella service profile or collection of profiles. In some embodiments an intermediate networking device can treat all connected end point devices equally from a service sharing or QOS perspective so that for example service usage is based on end point device demand and or contention. In some embodiments an intermediate networking device differentiates service QOS between different end point devices based on end point device service demand or service usage patterns EDP device type or device group end point device user or user group end point device service account status or service plan status or end point device application type and or traffic type or service type.

As discussed herein the service processor function assisting intermediate networking device implementation can be included on the intermediate networking device can be included in part on the intermediate networking device and one or more end point devices or can be implemented mainly or entirely on one or more end point devices.

In some embodiments an intermediate networking device can be constructed in which end point devices connect to the intermediate networking device and gain access services to a WWAN network through a WWAN Wi Fi enabled intermediate networking device that is supplied with services associated with a single account and service profile. The intermediate networking device service processor can assist in monitoring control and billing for WWAN service usage for all end point devices in the area covered by the intermediate networking device Wi Fi link. In some embodiments end point devices receive service on first come first serve basis with no differentiation. In some embodiments end point devices receive fair distribution of services so that if one end point device is using more significantly more service than the other end point devices or is demanding more service than the intermediate networking device service profile settings provide for a single end point device e.g. bandwidth hogging then the high demand end point device is throttled and the other end point devices are not. In some embodiments end point devices receive hierarchical distribution of services based on one or more of service type device type user type and or account status. In some embodiments an intermediate networking device can provide for a large or unlimited number of end point devices to connect to the network and simply control aggregate service usage parameters for the intermediate networking device WWAN connection. In some embodiments the intermediate networking device limits the number of end point devices that are allowed to connect to the WWAN network according the end point device count limits programmed in the service processor service profile settings in the intermediate networking device. In some embodiments end point device traffic can be identified by various end point device credential aspects including for example by Wi Fi ID MAC ID IP address user ID LAN tag end point device agent credentials and or browser token or cookie. In some embodiments the intermediate networking device service account can be billed for overall service usage and or by number of end point device connections allowed or experienced. In some embodiments as the intermediate networking device user or owner signs up for a higher end point device connection count one ore more aspects of the service usage policy implementation and or profile implementations in the service processor profile settings can be increased.

The various verification techniques described herein can also be applied to the intermediate networking device and extended to multiple end point devices. For example network based service usage measures for verification can be applied to the intermediate networking device just as if the intermediate networking device were an end point device. For example network based service usage measures e.g. IPDR information can be used to perform network verification checks to ensure that intermediate networking device service usage is within acceptable ranges based on intermediate networking device policy settings as similarly described with respect to various device embodiments. In some embodiments in the event intermediate networking device service usage is outside the policy limits set for the intermediate networking device service processor a notification can be sent to the intermediate networking device main account owner. The main intermediate networking device account owner can also be required to acknowledge the notification. The notification can also be sent to one or more other users of the intermediate networking device connection including possibly all users. Other actions that can be taken if the network based intermediate networking device service usage measure does not match the policy limits set on the service processor include notify the user notify the user and require acknowledgement bill the user for service overage suspend the end point device quarantine the end point device SPAN the end point device and or alert network manager or alert an automated network troubleshooting function. In some embodiments a device based usage measure can be verified against a network based service usage measure. It will now be apparent that the various service processor verification embodiments service controller verification embodiments network verification embodiments authentication embodiments and tamper prevention or detection embodiments such as those shown in and described with respect to can be applied to intermediate networking device applications and embodiments.

In some embodiments it is desirable to match up individual end point device or user intermediate networking device service usage with other service usage measures. For example the individual end point device service usage measures logged or reported from the end point devices and or the intermediate networking device can be aggregated to form a total intermediate networking device usage measure that is compared to an aggregate intermediate networking device usage measure logged or reported in the network. In some embodiments if these measures do not match then an error condition results and an action is taken. In some embodiments the aggregate intermediate networking device service usage measure is compared to the aggregate network based service usage measure and as long as these two measures are within an acceptable tolerance then the intermediate networking device service usage measures are trusted and can be used for deeper intermediate networking device and end point device usage measures for service control and or billing than may be possible in the network. In such embodiments the individual end point device service usage measures gained from the intermediate networking device or end point device can be used to verify end point device service usage versus service policy allowances. In some embodiments end point device service usage measures are compared with intermediate networking device measures for the same end point devices.

In some embodiments the IPDR records for one or more networks can include individual end point device service usage information. This is the case for example when the IPDRs include information broken down by end point device credential such as IP address or other end point device credential. In such cases intermediate networking device embodiments can be employed in which the individual end point device service usage information measured in the network can be compared with the service usage policy allowances or limits for the end point device. Also in some embodiments the individual end point device service usage measures from an end point device service usage monitor and or an intermediate networking device service usage monitor can be compared with the network based service usage information to verify an end point device and or an intermediate networking device service usage monitor is operating properly.

As similarly described with respect to end point device embodiments with no intermediate networking device between the end point device and the network in some intermediate networking device embodiments service usage and service usage monitor reports can be periodically verified by performing a SPAN function on the traffic for an intermediate networking device. The SPAN traffic can be analyzed in a real time manner or in a non real time manner in the network and the results can be compared with the intermediate networking device or end point device service policies or service usage measures.

The synchronized device notification and acknowledgement embodiments can also be employed in the case in which one service account is applied to the intermediate networking device. The service usage counters in the intermediate networking device can be synchronized or updated with the network based measures and the differences between the two may be minimized. The service usage notification can be sent to one or more of the end point devices connected to the intermediate networking device. For example the notification can be sent to the intermediate networking device manager or service owner all end point devices or the most active end point devices.

Similarly user preference feedback can be collected from one or more of the service users connected to the intermediate networking device. In some embodiments user preferences or user service selections or service settings are collected from one user or a subset of end point devices used by the service subscriber. In some embodiments more than one service user can provide preference information or service settings even if there is only one user account. In some embodiments there are multiple service subscribers each providing preferences. In some embodiments as similarly described with respect to various device embodiments user preferences can be used set service control policies that provide the user with their selected balance of cost and service capability in a manner that meets network neutrality requirements. Similarly in some embodiments the service monitoring and customer resource management information collected on the intermediate networking device or end point devices can be filtered according to user privacy preferences to maintain the level of user privacy selected by the user.

Adaptive intermediate networking device policy implementation can also be performed in the intermediate networking device service processor embodiments as similarly described with respect to various device embodiments. In some embodiments the service policy implementation for the intermediate networking device can be adapted by the service processor agents e.g. policy control agent working to control the settings in policy implementation agent and or another service processor agent or function to achieve a higher level service usage goal. In some embodiments the usage goals or adaptation can be based on aggregate end point device usage for the intermediate networking device network services and in some embodiments the higher level usage goals or adaptation can apply to one or more individual end point devices.

In some embodiments even though there is one intermediate networking device account there can be multiple options for multi end point device or multi user operation in which the number of end point devices number of users or service capabilities for some of the end point devices or users are selectable. These parameters are accommodated by an intermediate networking device service profile that includes the service capabilities that are to be delivered to a multitude of end point devices or users. In some cases some end point devices or users have a different profile within the intermediate networking device service processor with differentiated capabilities as compared to the intermediate networking device service processor profile for other end point devices or users. This is the case for some of the examples provided herein. These multi end point device or multi user service profiles in the intermediate networking device service processor can share services equally or can allow more capable access services to some end point devices or users than others. In some embodiments a service profile implemented by the intermediate networking device service processor for one end point device or user is different than that in the service profile implemented by the service processor for another end point device or user e.g. providing differentiated service profile implementations by end point devices and or users . End point devices can be uniquely identified for purposes involving implementation of different service profiles in the intermediate networking device service processor agents e.g. depending on the embodiment service monitor agent policy implementation agent policy control agent application interface agent and or other service processor agents or functions based on a number of parameters such as IP address local area network address e.g. Wi Fi address MAC address end point device ID user ID and or end point device application layer tag. This allows for independent service usage monitoring and control for different end point devices or users.

In some embodiments an intermediate networking device also bridges services to end point devices or users that have individually managed service profiles service plans or service accounts. As discussed herein individual end point device service policy implementation and or service profile implementation can be accomplished by classifying end point device service usage according to an end point device identifier so that service monitoring control assistance and reporting may be differentiated between one or more end point devices. These end point device identifiers can then be associated with a different service plan or account in the service processor and or billing system . The end point device or user specific service usage monitoring reporting notification and control assistance can be accomplished by running one or more profiles for each end point device or each user.

It will now be apparent that billing can also be implemented with a single account encompassing service usage for all users or end point devices connected to an intermediate networking device or for individual users end point devices user groups or end point device groups connected to an intermediate networking device. As similarly described with respect to the service profile this is accomplished by associating service usage events and associated billing events with an end point device identifier user identifier end point device group identifier and or user group identifier.

In some embodiments end point devices or users connect to more than one intermediate networking device with the same service account service plan or service profile. In some embodiments the intermediate networking device requires an authentication sequence for the end point device or user before allowing connection to the network through the intermediate networking device. This authentication sequence can involve the end point device communicating an active account or admission credential with the intermediate networking device. The intermediate networking device can compare the credential with a local database or may query a database in the network to admit the end point device to the intermediate networking device network connection. In either case provided the user credential or network authorization process is passed the service processor service profile settings for the end point device are applied and service is then established as discussed herein. In these cases the verification can be accomplished as described herein. In some embodiments even if the end point device does not have a service processor provided that the intermediate networking device service policy implementations and or service profile implementations are verified as described herein then the intermediate networking device will accurately assist in control and reporting of service usage for the different end point devices or users and the appropriate service policy controls and or billing can be maintained.

In some embodiments when the end point device attempts connection to the intermediate networking device if the user or end point device does not already have an active account or logon credential that the intermediate networking device recognizes then the intermediate networking device can offer the end point device or user a service sign up experience. This experience can be implemented in a number of ways including a website WAP site portal download of agent software and other methods. For example an automated recognition of new devices can redirect unauthorized end point devices to browse into a website WAP site or portal site located on the intermediate networking device or in the network. If the site is located on the intermediate networking device it can be cached and refreshed at a time of day when the network is not overly busy. Once on the site the user or end point device selects the plan choice they desire inputs account information and in some embodiments downloads device agent software to aid in network service policy implementation and or profile implementation with the intermediate networking device. Once the user signs up the information is logged into the network data base the service account is established and the intermediate networking device service profile for that user or end point device is activated and the user can begin using the service.

In some embodiments a website WAP site or portal site located in the intermediate networking device can be used to provide the end point device user with a service usage monitor interface and a service purchase interface for cases in which the end point device does not posses any special software to allow it to display a more specialized service usage monitor function for information received from the intermediate networking device or network service usage counters. The service usage monitor for the intermediate networking device can be synchronized as similarly described with respect to various device embodiments. In some embodiments the service usage notification system can also display cost data from a usage to cost look up function. In some embodiments the service usage notification system can display projected service usage or projected cost as similarly described with respect to various device embodiments. The service usage monitor to drive these service notification embodiments can be located on one or more of the end point device the intermediate networking device or the network.

In some embodiments if multiple accounts are serviced by one or more intermediate networking devices verification can be performed on the service controls for the end point device or user service usage. As will now be apparent just as with the intermediate networking device the end point device or user service usage comparison with usage policy settings can be verified in the ways described herein. If the usage is found to be out of policy then any of the out of policy actions described herein can be performed including for example notify the end user notify and require acknowledgement bill for overage suspend quarantine SPAN and or flag to network manager or network error handling function. For example the verification methods shown in and described with respect to can be applied for the embodiments where intermediate networking devices have multiple account multiple service plan multiple service profile multiple end point device and or multiple user capabilities.

It will be apparent that the various embodiments described herein for automated provisioning and activation also can similarly be applied to the intermediate networking device embodiments. It will also be apparent that the various virtual service provider embodiments can similarly be applied to the intermediate networking device embodiments.

Ambient services can be employed on the intermediate networking device and the ambient services can thus be provided to the end point devices. It will be apparent that the ambient service profile embodiments disclosed herein can similarly be applied to the intermediate networking device and then the intermediate networking device can supply those ambient services to end point devices connected to the intermediate networking device. It will also be apparent that the intermediate networking device can provide an ambient service profile as described herein to end point devices or users that have not yet signed up for service while providing other paid for service profiles to end point devices or users that have signed up for service.

Bill by account embodiments can similarly be applied to the intermediate networking device embodiments. For example bill by account can be used in embodiments in which all end point devices or users are connected to the intermediate networking device under one account or to embodiments in which some end point devices or users are accounted for separately with different service accounts service plans or service profiles. In either case it will be apparent that using one or more of the end point device or user identification credential aspects discussed herein can be used in a bill by account profile to account for any end point device or service activity. In such embodiments billing event reports for those activities that include the end point device or user identifiers can also be provided for billing mediation and reconciliation down to the individual end point device or user level. For example this allows for very deep service monitoring and billing capabilities with intermediate networking devices.

The intermediate networking device embodiments described above also have uses in machine to machine applications. It will be apparent that if the end point device includes the correct credentials to gain access to an existing account or to allow an automated provisioning and activation account to be established then the end point device can be connected to the network through the intermediate networking device without human intervention. Furthermore the service profile that is established with the end point device for machine to machine communications can be set up to provide the access required to support the machine to machine application allowing for low cost access services and preventing the end point device from being misused for some service other than that intended. For example the verification techniques and embodiments disclosed herein can similarly be applied to such machine to machine applications.

It will be apparent that the identifiers discussed above for bill by account mediation with accounting down to the individual end point device or user level can be combined with a billing mediation server in the network that accepts intermediate networking device billing events with end point device identification or user identification indexed billing performs the necessary bill by account mediation functions formats the billing events into the format used by the billing system and transmits the mediated billing information to the billing system .

In some embodiments the intermediate networking device service processor functionality can be split. The division ranges from some or all of the service processor on the device to some or all of the service processor on the intermediate networking device.

In some embodiments all of the service processor is on the intermediate networking device. The end point device does not participate in service processor functions and has no service processor interface software. In some embodiments the end point device has small subset of service processor capabilities including for example a service notification UI or a logon client with credentials. In some embodiments service monitoring is implemented on the end point device or on both the end point device and in the intermediate networking device. In some embodiments the end point device has additional service processor capabilities including for example application layer tagging that associates application layer activity with service processor service monitoring or service policy implementation and or service profile implementation information. This can be accomplished by a range of techniques for example transmitting the application tagging information disclosed elsewhere to the intermediate networking device service processor so that the policy implementation may be accomplished with knowledge of the application layer information. Another example involves assigning IP addresses in the intermediate networking device networking stack to the end point devices so that different types of end point device traffic can be routed into service processor traffic shaping queues each queue having a policy profile implementation engine and application layer tagging information or similar traffic identifying information is used to determine which policy implementation engine the traffic should be routed to in order to accomplish the desired traffic shaping for the traffic type application type service type and or content type. In some embodiments the traffic control policy is implemented on the end point device either with an application layer traffic controller or by implementing more of the service processor functionality as similarly described with respect to various device embodiments. In the end point device service functionality example most or all of the service processor functionality is implemented on the end point device and the intermediate networking device functionality can be reduced to a bridging forwarding or routing function between the end point devices and the network that performs little or no service control monitoring and or billing functions. For example the service usage monitoring agents can also be provided on the end point device to aid in verification.

In embodiments in which the end point device requires agent software the software can be loaded at time of manufacture or during distribution loaded later and or made available for download through the intermediate networking device. In the case in which the end point device agent SW is downloaded through the end point device there can be locally cached copies of the SW for one or more OS variants stored in a cache on the intermediate networking device with the cache being updated over the network at convenient or conducive times or the software can be downloaded live over the network when it is needed by the end point device. Logging the service usage to download this software is another example in which bill by account functionality can be used to track network traffic that may not be desirable to bill to an end point device owner or user and bill by account functionality can be used to log and mediate such usage out of the user or end point device owner s bill.

Any end point device agent software required to connect to the intermediate networking device can also be implemented as a service processor developer s kit as described herein and distributed to aid manufacturers service provider and virtual service providers in bringing new devices onto networks with intermediate networking device capability.

In the case of a femto cell intermediate networking device in some embodiments it is desirable to facilitate handover from the WWAN network to the femto cell. In some embodiments this provided in the intermediate networking device service processor in a variety of ways. In some embodiments the voice and data traffic is routed through a VPN tunnel controlled by the service processor and connected to a network element such as the transport gateway or another specified traffic concentration destination for the femto cell. In some embodiments the voice traffic the data traffic or both can be routed in secure or open Internet channels to different destinations or the data can be routed directly to the Internet destination specified by the packets. In some embodiments the femto cell intermediate networking device controls the femto cell frequencies or local frequency channel strength surveys over the intermediate networking device control channel. In some embodiments the service processor has a VPN connection to a network base station hand off controller to assist in handoff to and from the WWAN network and or has the capability to instruct the end point device and the base station handoff controller. In some embodiment whenever an end point device authenticated for femto cell access is within range of the femto cell the service provider desires to set up a service processor profile to get the end point device to connect to the femto cell even if it has a strong signal with one or more WWAN base stations so that the WWAN traffic may be offloaded. In some embodiments the service processor can form a secure control plane link with network AAA functions to manage authorization and admission of end point devices the femto cell has not yet admitted or the network policies can require re authorization every time a end point device attempts access. Once an end point device is connected to the femto cell intermediate networking device the verifiable traffic monitoring control and billing functions described herein can be applied to various application embodiments. For example the intermediate networking device service policy verification techniques disclosed herein as similarly described with respect to various device embodiments can similarly be applied to the femto cell intermediate networking device embodiments.

In some embodiments the service provider desires to keep the number of end point devices or users that access an intermediate networking device below a certain count specified in the service processor profile. In some embodiments this is accomplished by controlling the number of IP addresses allowed onto the intermediate networking device local area side connection. In some embodiments this is facilitated by observing the end point device identification parameters available in the end point device traffic. In some embodiments this is facilitated by observing the traffic patterns to determine the likely number of devices connecting to the network. For example traffic demand patterns can be examined to determine how many users are likely to be demanding access at one time. Although the foregoing embodiments have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding the invention is not limited to the details provided. There are many alternative ways of implementing the invention. The disclosed embodiments are illustrative and not restrictive.
