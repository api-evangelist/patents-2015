This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62 033 868 filed on Aug. 6 2014 under the title DEVICE PACKAGING METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR OPTOELECTRONIC CIRCUITS the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was developed under Contract DE AC04 94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.

This invention relates to packaging for electronic and photonic circuits and MEMS devices and more particularly to chip scale photonic device packages that include provisions for optical coupling to external circuits and devices.

The field of photonics is expanding rapidly. The abundance of emerging devices includes new multifunctional devices that to be practical will require photonic circuitry to be jointly packaged with electronic circuitry. For example there will be a need to integrate electronic processing within a single package with high bandwidth optical input output I O and radio frequency RF photonics.

Great advances have been made in the packaging of electronic circuitry. For the new generation of photonic and multifunctional devices to achieve market acceptance it will be necessary for the packaging of hybrid standalone and monolithic optoelectronic circuits to keep pace with similar advancements.

For example optical fiber coupling to device packages continues to pose a challenge. Conventional methods use vertically coupled or side coupled optical fibers. Vertical coupling is band limited and can introduce excess power loss. Although side coupling does not generally suffer these disadvantages there remains a need for a dependable way to maintain the side coupled fibers in position for the full product lifetime.

We have developed an improved device package adapted for the side coupling of optical fibers and solid state lasers to the photonic circuitry such as chip scale circuitry that is contained within the package.

We have also developed a new method of wafer level packaging that encloses optical circuits in hermetic silicon packages and concurrently provides features for the auto alignment of coupled optical fibers or diode lasers. The coupled lasers may be edge emitting lasers or vertical cavity surface emitting lasers VCSELs . One advantage of our new packaging approach is that in implementations an exact match of optical modes can be made between the rectangular waveguide of an edge emitting laser and the photonic chip waveguide so that coupling can be made directly without the intermediation of an optical fiber.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention in a first aspect is an optoelectronic device package comprising an active die having upper and lower faces and at least one lid die sealable to a face of the active die. A plurality of optical waveguides are integrally defined in the active die. The active die also includes at least one active device region by which is meant either an optoelectronic device or a defined space for the placement of an optoelectronic device. Accordingly the active device region may include an optoelectronic device integrally defined in the active die or a discrete optoelectronic device that has been placed and mounted therein by flip chip attachment or a similar technique. At least one of the optical waveguides terminates at such an active device region so that an optoelectronic device situated at the active device region can be optically coupled to the waveguide for the purpose e.g. of routing an optical signal within the device package.

Further at least one slot is defined in the sidewall of the active die by removal of material to some depth. By sidewall is meant a peripheral border area of the die that is empty of active devices. At least one of the optical waveguides terminates at such a slot so that an optical fiber or optoelectronic device inserted in the slot can optically couple to the waveguide for routing an optical signal into and or out of the device package.

In various embodiments at least one slot is conformed to accept an inserted optical fiber or optoelectronic device has a rectangular cross section or aligns with a corresponding channel defined in the lid die.

In embodiments at least one groove for aligning an inserted optical fiber is formed in a face of the active die. The fiber alignment groove is aligned with an slot and extends from the slot to an end of an optical waveguide or to an active device region. The fiber alignment groove may be a V groove or it may have another cross sectional shape such as a semicircle or rectangle.

In some embodiments a locally thinned sidewall portion of the active die is coupled to at least one of the optical waveguides so that optical signals can be transmitted through the sidewall between the waveguide and an external optical path. In some embodiments the locally thinned portion is similarly coupled to at least one active device region. In some embodiments the locally thinned portion is in the device lid so that optical coupling to a waveguide or to an active device region is enabled when the device package is assembled.

In some embodiments a capacitive or inductive power coupler is connected to the active die. The active die or the lid die has a thinned but imperforate sidewall portion. The power coupler has an input side adjacent to the exterior face of the thinned portion and an output side adjacent to the interior face of the thinned portion.

In embodiments at least one electrical or optical feedthrough penetrates the active die or the lid die. The feedthrough is respectively coupled to an electrical conductor pattern or to a waveguide or active device region defined on the active die.

In some embodiments the active die is a photonic chip having two or more layers of photonic interconnect. This can be provided e.g. in a structure in which a lower silicon optical layer is overlain by an upper silicon nitride optical layer. Photonic interconnects from the several layers are optically coupled to external optical elements inserted in respective ones of the slots. The inserted external elements may be for example optical fibers or laser diodes. In another example an external optical element is an optoelectronic device that has two or more input output I O ports. The optoelectronic device is fixed within an slot such that each of the ports is optically coupled to a photonic interconnect in a respective one of the interconnect layers.

In some embodiments at least one channel for microfluidic coolant transport is defined in the active die and or in one or two lid dies.

In embodiments the active die is layered between a top lid die and a bottom lid die. In embodiments multiple active dies are layered and bonded together using e.g. through silicon vias TSVs for the vertical interconnections.

An exemplary embodiment of the invention as shown in is a package for encasing a silicon photonic circuit a silicon photonic electronic circuit a multifunctional device having optical inputs and or outputs or the like. As seen in the figure the package includes a bottom lid die a top lid die and an active die enclosed between the bottom and top lid dies. In other embodiments there may be multiple active dies layered and bonded together and similarly enclosed between dies and . In such a layered assembly vertical interconnections may be provided by through silicon vias TSVs or the like. A layered assembly may also include an interposer in which microfluidic channels have been etched to provide internal cooling.

The active die will typically be a substrate for an integrated circuit so that one or more devices are formed directly on die . Discrete components may also be mounted on die by wire bonding flip chip bonding or any of various other mounting technologies that are well known in the art.

For distribution of power and electrical input and output a metallization pattern not shown in the figure including contact pads is provided on the upward facing in the figure view surface and or on the downward facing surface of die .

Lid dies and can be made of any of various materials that meet standard packaging specifications such as the specifications for CMOS or optical chip packaging and that can be shaped appropriately by etching techniques. Examples of suitable materials for various applications include silicon silicon dioxide and borosilicate glass. The lid dies and the active die need not be made of the same material although if different materials are used due consideration should be given to the possible effects of a mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients.

In particular the material of active die may be chosen to provide a refractive index matched at least approximately to the index of a coupled external optical medium so as to minimize loss due to the optical index step between the respective media.

At least one device included on the active die has optical inputs and or optical outputs which are to be coupled to optical fibers for connection to hardware elements external to the package. For that purpose slots are etched in the periphery of the active die for insertion and alignment of lensed or cleaved ends of optical fibers . The slots are formed in the sidewall of the die by which is meant a peripheral border area that is empty of active devices. As will be seen below the sidewall may be built up by deposition of a filler material such as CVD oxide or spin on glass that encapsulates the features formed on the active die. When the lid is assembled onto the active die each slot becomes a circumferentially enclosed channel that is able to guide the insertion of the fiber.

In some embodiments such as the embodiment of at least one lid die is also etched to form slots. The slots in the lid die align with slots in the active die so that when the lid is assembled onto the active die each aligned pair of slots becomes a circumferentially enclosed channel for guiding fiber insertion.

Although it may be especially advantageous to etch the slots with rectangular cross sections as shown in the figure other shapes that may be useful for various applications include semi cylinders v grooves and any of various shapes having polygonal cross sections.

In the view of the encapsulating fill material has been cut away everywhere except in the sidewalls so as to reveal buried features.

In other arrangements inserted fibers can butt directly against optoelectronic devices instead of or in addition to butting against optical waveguides.

Also seen in the figure is electrical feedthrough which passes through the sidewall of active die and as shown is electrically continuous with conductive trace . One example of an electrical feedthrough is a through silicon via TSV .

Optical feedthroughs may also be provided. An example of an optical feedthrough is a region in the sidewall of active die that has been made thinner to improve optical coupling between a waveguiding medium internal to the die and a waveguiding medium not shown external to the die. This technique can be effective if the material of the die has sufficient transparency at the coupled wavelength or wavelengths. Another example of an optical feedthrough is a window of e.g. deposited silica or of silica that is grown in situ. Optical feedthroughs can be formed in the active die or in the lid die. By cutting a slot only partway through a sidewall an optical feedthrough can be combined with the slot. In such an arrangement the inserted fiber abuts the feedthrough from the outside and a waveguide can abut the feedthrough from the inside.

Optical feedthroughs as described above which do not fully penetrate the sidewall of the active die or lid die are especially advantageous when a hermetic seal is desired.

Multilayer optical networks have recently been proposed as a way to increase device density in photonic interconnection networks while mitigating the detrimental effects of insertion loss and crosstalk. For example A. M. Jones et al. Layer separation optimization in CMOS compatible multilayer optical networks in 2013 IEEE 5 8 May 2013 pp. 62 63 describes a design study for a multilayer silicon nitride over silicon on insulator network. In such an arrangement a silicon optical layer is overlain by a second optical layer formed e.g. of silicon nitride.

A photonics chip designed according to these or similar principles can have two or even more layers of photonic interconnects. Hence laser light may be coupled into such a chip from several levels.

Turning again to it will be seen that the slots for insertion of laser diodes are disposed in two levels. If active die is a multilayer photonics chip the slots at each level may communicate with respective optical layers of the chip.

Multiple rows of slots may likewise be useful for optically connecting to respective levels of a composite die consisting of two or more active dies that are bonded together. As noted TSVs or the like may be used to provide vertical interconnections in such assemblies.

As noted above it will often be advantageous to integrate a laser diode such as a VCSEL directly into the package instead of first coupling the light into a fiber and then packaging the fiber. The reason is that the optical cavity of a typical diode laser is rectangular in cross section and thus is readily mode matched to a rectangular waveguide if appropriately dimensioned. By matching the electric field in the optical mode between media both in size and in shape it is possible to achieve low loss optical coupling.

A first method for fabricating a device package according to any of the various embodiments disclosed here is a Wafer Level Packaging WLP method. According to that method a plurality of active dies are defined jointly on a common substrate wafer and a plurality of lid dies are likewise defined jointly on a common substrate wafer. After the substrate wafers are fully processed and after any externally provided circuitry has been mounted on the optical substrate wafer the lid substrate wafer or pair of lid substrate wafers in the event there are to be both top and bottom lid dies is bonded to the active wafer. The bonded substrate wafers are then diced into a plurality of individual packages. The WLP method is advantageous because it can reduce cost and can reduce the likelihood and extent of contamination.

Voids in the optical substrate wafer are filled at step by e.g. PECVD deposition of silicon oxide followed by planarization by e.g. chemical mechanical polishing CMP . This step encapsulates the structures on the optical substrate wafer and builds up the sidewalls.

The slots are formed in the optical substrate wafer at step . As shown schematically in the slots for external fiber or laser diode insertion are formed between pairs of adjacent dies so that when the substrate wafer is diced half of each as etched slot will go with each die of the pair. The slots may be formed e.g. by deep reactive ion etch DRIE or by a potassium hydroxide KOH or other wet etch. The KOH etch would be useful in particular for forming the slot as a V groove.

If the sidewalls of the optical substrate wafer have been built up in planarization step then the slots will be formed at least in part by etching down through the fill material which as noted may in some examples be CVD oxide or spin on glass.

The width and depth of the slots relative to the dimensions of the internal optical waveguides will partially determine the alignment accuracy and precision between the external fibers and the internal waveguides e.g. rib waveguides or ridge waveguides that are formed as part of the active die. Hence the lithographic method to be used in defining the slots should be chosen according to the tolerances that are required for the particular application.

The lid substrate wafer is processed at step . As noted portions of the alignment slots may be etched in the lid wafer. In particular therefore the depth to which the slots are etched in the lid wafer may at least partially define the vertical alignment of the external fiber or laser diode to the internal waveguide. As also noted fluidic microchannels may be formed. If required voids in the lid substrate wafer are filled by deposition of silicon oxide followed by planarization.

At step the optical substrate wafer and the lid substrate wafer are cleaned and then they are bonded together e.g. by plasma bonding. The bonding step can be carried out such that the resulting individual packages are hermetically sealed.

At step the bonded pair of substrate wafers is diced to yield a plurality of separate packages. The dicing step opens the fiber alignment slots so that they can be accessed from the side of each package for fiber or laser diode insertion.

For final assembly optical fibers or laser diodes are inserted into their respective slots and secured by e.g. ultraviolet cured epoxy or etched MEMS latches. The use of active alignment with monitoring of transmitted optical power is advantageous for minimizing coupling losses.

An alternative fabrication method is a Chip Level Packaging CLP method. illustrates a sequence of steps of a CLP process that is useful in the present context.

At step the optical substrate wafer and the lid substrate wafer are processed as described above except for the insertion of externally provided circuit elements.

At step the optical substrate wafer and the lid substrate wafer are diced to form individual active dies and lid dies.

At step externally provided devices and other circuit elements are inserted and bonded on the individual active dies.

It will be appreciated that irrespective of the fabrication method the active die or the lid die can be opened on the top and or on the bottom for the installation of heat sinks for attachment to ball grid arrays for chip scale bonding for flip chip packaging or for attachment of any chip interconnect mechanical support fluidic channel or the like.

An alternate procedure for facilitating the coupling of an optical fiber to an SOI active die will now be described with reference to . Using backside die alignment techniques deep reactive ion etching DRIE is used to cut e.g. a 250 m hole from the back side of the die to the buried oxide layer where it underlies an optical waveguide integral with the active die. To reduce loss a known optical coupling element such as a Bragg grating can be etched into the waveguide where it approaches hole . The oxide layer functions as a transmissive window between waveguide and an inserted optical fiber or laser diode . Oxide layer can also serve as an etch stop layer for the silicon etch that forms the coupling element. After insertion of e.g. fiber epoxy is applied and cured to secure the fiber in place. If a laser diode is to be inserted hole can be made rectangular to conform to the shape of the laser diode. Likewise hole can be appropriately dimensioned to conform to the shape of a VCSEL.

As noted the sidewalls or the top or bottom walls of the package can be thinned to provide transmissive optical feedthroughs. Additionally the top and or bottom surfaces can be thinned to enable localized optical evanescent coupling or capacitive or inductive electrical coupling. The local thinning is produced e.g. by DRIE. Evanescent coupling may be advantageous for example where it is desired for an internal waveguide to couple with an external waveguide laid in a trench.

For capacitive coupling for the purpose e.g. of electrical input output a thinned region on the active die or on the lid die can be backfilled with metal to create the coupling capacitor. For inductive coupling for the purpose e.g. of power input a thinned area can be metallized and patterned to form a coil or other inductive element.

In both capacitive and inductive coupling the package material serves as a dielectric between an input side of the coupling element that is e.g. mounted outside the device package and an output side that is mounted inside the device package. Internal electrical connectivity may be provided by e.g. an electrical conductor pattern defined on the active die or on the lid die and having a branch that terminates on the output side of the coupling element.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the techniques described above allow for numerous variations without departing from the inventive scope. In one variation for example a bottom die is etched into a tub like shape in which a central depressed region is surrounded by sidewalls. An active die is received into the depressed region. A lid die may similarly be conformed with a central depressed region to receive an upward extending portion of the active die. The active die may be encapsulated in fill material that is likewise received within the depressed region or regions.

The bond between the bottom die and the lid die may be made between the native substrate materials of those dies or it may involve fill material. Depending on whether fill material is used and whether it extends to cover the sidewalls slots may be etched into native substrate material of the bottom and or lid dies or into fill material.

Packages as described here are readily made stackable. Suitable interconnects for such purpose include TSVs capacitive electrical interconnections and vertical optical interconnections. As those skilled in the art will understand gratings or similar diffractive elements can be used in combination with vertical optical interconnections for efficient coupling to horizontal waveguides. By stacking a plurality of individual dies a package in package assembly can be made.
