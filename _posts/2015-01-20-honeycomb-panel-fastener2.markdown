In another aspect the present invention is directed to a fastener assembly for use with honeycomb panels comprising a honeycomb panel insert which comprises a generally cylindrical body having an outer surface a first end an opposite second end and a longitudinally extending passage having a first opening in the first end and a second opening in the second end . The first opening has a first perimeter and the second opening has a second perimeter that is relatively smaller than the first perimeter. The longitudinally extending passage comprises a first section having a first diameter D a second section having a second diameter D that is relative smaller than the first diameter D and a third section having a third diameter D that is relatively smaller than the second diameter D. The difference between the first diameter D and the second diameter D provides a first ledge and the difference between the second diameter D and the third diameter D provides a second ledge . The first end further comprises a first flange section that has a periphery . The first flange section has a pair of notches located in diametrically opposed positions along the periphery . The second end further comprises a second flange section that has a periphery . The second section of the longitudinally extending passage has an inner wall and the third section of the longitudinally extending passage has an inner wall . The inner walls and have therein longitudinally extending and diametrically positioned channels and that extend to the second end such that the channels and form portions of the perimeter of the second opening . The fastener assembly further comprises a stud which comprises a head and a shaft that is attached to the head . The shaft extends to a distal end along a longitudinally extending axis . The stud further comprises a cross pin that extends through the shaft and is orthogonal with respect to the longitudinally extending axis . The cross pin has a first section and a second section . The shaft has a diameter that is sized to fit through the longitudinally extending passage . The first section and second section are sized to fit within and move along channels and respectively. The head has a predetermined diameter that is greater than the second diameter D of the second section and less than the first diameter D of the first section so the head abuts the first ledge when the stud is completely inserted or depressed into the longitudinally extending passage . The fastener assembly further comprises a spring that is mounted on the shaft and interposed between the head and the cross pin .

When an axial force is applied to the head of the stud so that the shaft moves longitudinally within the passage in a first direction and the spring is compressed the circumferential channel becomes exposed and in proximity to the second end of the insert . The fastener assembly further comprises a containment ring that is external to the insert and positioned within the circumferential channel of the shaft so as to maintain the spring in a compressed state. Compression of the spring urges the stud to move longitudinally within the passage in a second direction that is opposite the first direction thereby causing the containment ring to abut the second end of the insert thereby limiting the movement of the stud in the second direction .

Referring to there is shown a fastener assembly configured for use with a honeycomb panel in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Fastener assembly comprises a honeycomb panel insert that comprises a generally cylindrical body having an outer surface a first end and an opposite second end . The honeycomb panel insert includes a longitudinally extending passage which has a first opening in first end and a second opening in second end . The first opening has a first perimeter and the second opening has a second perimeter that is relatively smaller than the first perimeter of the first opening .

The longitudinally extending passage comprises a first section having a first diameter D a second section having a second diameter D that is relative smaller than the first diameter D and a third section having a third diameter D that is relatively smaller than the second diameter D. The difference between the first and second diameters D and D respectively provides a first circumferentially extending ledge and the difference between the second and third diameters D and D respectively provides a second circumferentially extending ledge .

The first end further comprises a first flange section that has a periphery . The second end further comprises a second flange section that has a periphery . The first flange section has a pair of notches and located in diametrically opposed positions along the periphery . As will be explained in the ensuing description notches and function as potting and vent openings.

The first section of the longitudinally extending passage has a circumferentially extending inner wall . The second section of the longitudinally extending passage has a circumferentially extending inner wall . The third section of the longitudinally extending passage has a circumferentially extending inner wall . The inner walls and have therein longitudinally extending and diametrically positioned channels and . The channels and extend to the second end such that the channels and form portions of the perimeter of the second opening see .

The generally cylindrical body has at least one longitudinally extending channel in the outer surface . In a preferred embodiment there is a plurality of longitudinally extending channels . In one embodiment the longitudinally extending channels are equidistantly spaced apart. Insert is configured to be cemented to a honeycomb or sandwich type panel. As is known in the art resinous material such as epoxy resin is used to cement and anchor the insert to the honeycomb or sandwich type panel. Once the insert is positioned at the desired location on the honeycomb panel the unsolidified cement is injected into the notch in the flange until an excess of the unsolidified cement exits the notch . The unsolidified cement may also be injected into notch until an excess of the unsolidified cement exits the notch . The unsolidified cement fills the channels in the outer peripheral surface . Upon hardening the hardened or solidified cement permanently cements the insert to the honeycomb panel. The hardened cement within the channels prevents the insert from any rotational movement.

In a preferred embodiment the insert is formed from a composite material. In one embodiment the insert is fabricated from Ultem .

Referring to fastener assembly further comprises a stud . The stud comprises a head and a shaft . Shaft is attached to the head and extends to a distal end along a longitudinally extending axis . In one embodiment the distal end is beveled. The stud further comprises a cross pin that extends through the shaft and is orthogonal with respect to the longitudinally extending axis . The cross pin has a first section and a second section that extend from the shaft in opposite directions. In one embodiment the shaft has a bore that has a pair of openings. The cross pin has a predetermined diameter that requires the cross pin to be force fitted through the bore . The bore extends in a direction that is substantially orthogonal to the longitudinally extending axis . In an alternate embodiment cross pin is integral with the shaft .

Referring to the shaft has a diameter that is sized to fit through the longitudinally extending passage . The first section and second section of cross pin are sized to fit within and move along channels and respectively. The head of stud has a predetermined diameter that is greater than the diameter D of the second section of passage and less than the diameter D of the first section of passage so that when an axial force is applied to stud as shown in the stud will move longitudinally through passage until the head abuts the first ledge .

Referring to the fastener assembly further comprises a spring that is mounted on the shaft and interposed between the head and the cross pin . The spring has a predetermined diameter that is less than the diameter D of the second section and greater than the diameter D of the third section so that the spring abuts the second ledge when the stud is inserted into the longitudinally extending passage .

As shown in the shaft has a circumferentially extending channel or groove therein at a predetermined location between the head and the cross pin . When an axial force is applied to the head of the stud to cause the shaft to move longitudinally within the longitudinally extending passage in a first direction the axial force compresses the spring and the circumferentially extending channel becomes exposed i.e. external to passage and accessible and is in proximity to the second end of the insert as shown in . The purpose of channel is described in the ensuing description.

Referring to the fastener assembly further comprises a containment ring that is external to the insert and positioned within the circumferential channel of the shaft in order to maintain the spring in a compressed state. When compressed the spring urges the stud to move longitudinally within the passage in a second direction that is opposite the first direction thereby causing the containment ring to abut the second end of the insert . The containment ring limits the movement of the stud in the second direction .

The containment ring is fabricated from a resilient material. In one embodiment the containment ring is fabricated from Delrin. Containment ring comprises an opening that has the shape of a slot. Opening has a central portion that is relatively smaller in size than the size of the distal end of the shaft . Such a configuration requires the shaft to be force fitted through the central portion in order to mount the containment ring on the shaft . Since the size of central portion is relatively smaller than the diameter of the shaft a predetermined amount of force is required to mount the containment ring on the shaft and then forcibly slide the containment ring along shaft until it slips into circumferentially extending channel . The slot shaped opening is sized and shaped to allow the sections and of cross pin to pass therethrough. Containment ring has a pair of curved openings and which have several functions. First the curved openings and enable containment ring to flex when it is slid across the shaft . Second the curved openings and are aligned with corresponding pin members see of containment ring installation tool which is discussed in detail in the ensuing description. Third the curved openings and are sized so that the containment ring fits snugly on the pin members thereby allowing the installer i.e. the user to line up the slot shaped opening with cross pin . As containment ring is being slid across the shaft the sections and of cross pin pass through the slot shaped opening thereby allowing the containment ring to be positioned within circumferentially extending channel or groove .

Containment ring installation tool shown in may be used to mount the containment ring on shaft and slide or push the containment ring along the shaft until the containment ring snaps into the circumferentially extending channel or groove . Tool comprises handle shaft and end . Shaft has a substantially circular seat that is sized to receive the containment ring . The aforementioned pin members extend upward from the seat and are sized to snugly or fit closely through with the curved openings and in containment ring . In one embodiment there is only one pin member . In another embodiment there is more than one pin member . Shaft has longitudinally extending bore that is sized to receive the shaft of the stud . In order to mount the containment ring on the shaft the installer or user first arranges or positions the containment ring on the seat so that pin members enter the curved openings and . Once the containment ring is positioned on the seat and the pin members enter the curved openings and the user or installer then maneuvers tool so that the distal end of the stud is aligned with the slot shaped opening of the containment ring . The user or installer then applies a force on the handle of tool that is sufficient to cause shaft of stud to enter the slot shaped opening and also the longitudinally extending bore of tool . The user or installer then continues to push the containment ring along the shaft and may rotate the tool as needed in order to align cross pin with slot shaped opening . The user or installer continues to apply an axial force on the tool in order to slide the containment ring along the shaft until the containment ring snaps into the circumferentially extending channel or groove . Once the containment ring is positioned in the circumferentially extending channel or groove the user or installer then withdraws the tool .

Although tool has been described in the foregoing description it is to be understood that other suitable techniques may be used to mount the containment ring on shaft as well.

Referring to there is shown the fastener assembly used to attach a honeycomb panel to a structure . A typical structure is an aircraft interior wall. However the structure may be on other types of structures found on space vehicles laboratories nuclear facilities etc. The honeycomb panel includes honeycomb panel skins and . Insert is cemented to honeycomb panel with epoxy adhesive . After the epoxy adhesive hardens the stud is inserted through spring and the cross pin is attached to the shaft so that the spring is interposed between head and cross pin . Next the stud with the spring mounted thereon is inserted into longitudinally extending passage of insert . Cross pin sections and move through channels and respectively as stud moves through passage . The installer or user depresses the stud further into passage in order to compress spring and cause the circumferentially extending channel to become exposed near end of insert . The user applies an axial force indicated by reference number to the stud via a screw driver or other tool while the containment ring is being mounted on the shaft . As described in the foregoing description containment ring installation tool may be used to mount containment ring to shaft . Gasket is positioned between honeycomb panel and structure . Receptacle is attached to structure with rivets . Receptacle has a slot shaped opening therein. The installer or user then uses a screwdriver to rotate the stud so cross pin can fit through the opening . Once cross pin passes through opening the installer or user then rotates the stud so that cross pin is lateral with respect to the slot shaped opening . When the installer removes the force from stud the spring urges stud in the direction indicated by arrow in so that cross pin is firmly pressed against the exterior surface of receptacle . The number of fastener assemblies required to attach a honeycomb panel to a structure depends upon the size of the honeycomb panel.

Thus the fastener assembly can be installed on a honeycomb panel in relatively less time in comparison to the prior art fastener assemblies. Only one cross pin is used with the stud . The cross pin is attached to the stud prior to being inserted into the interior of the insert . As the stud with the spring mounted thereon is moved through the longitudinally extending passage cross pin sections and slide through the channels and respectively and exit opening of insert . Thus the fastener assembly eliminates the problems associated with having to reinsert the cross pins to the stud as is done with prior art fastener assemblies.
