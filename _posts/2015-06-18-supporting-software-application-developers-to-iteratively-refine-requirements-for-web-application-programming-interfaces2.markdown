A ranked list of recommended Web APIs and a set of Web API recommendations regarding the context of the application is sent to a client device via a network. In response to determining that a selection of a set of Web APIs in the ranked list of recommended Web APIs was received, the set of Web APIs selected is added to the context of the application to generate a new context of the application. A display of a relationship among the set of Web APIs added to the new context of the application is sent to the client device via the network.
