This brief summary has been provided so that the nature of the disclosure may be understood quickly. A more complete understanding can be obtained by reference to the following detailed description and to the attached drawings.

In numerous embodiments the RWE is the operating system for a real world RW portion of a hybrid game that concerns itself with real random gambling events money credits on the hybrid game and other parameters associated with execution of a gambling game. The RWE manages the RW portion of the gaming system and controls and operates a gambling proposition. The RWE includes the random number generator RNG pay tables meters and other hardware and software constructs used by the game of chance to offer a fair and transparent gaming proposition and to contain the auditable systems and functions necessary for the game to obtain gaming regulatory body approval. The RNG may be a software and or hardware device which is used to generate random outcomes. In some embodiments a random number may be received via a network connection.

The RWE encompasses the components of a slot machine but may not necessarily include an entertainment front end. The RWE accepts triggers from the RW User Interface to run gambling propositions in response to actions taken by the player in the context of the ESE driven entertainment game controlled sequence and also provides information to the GWE to expose the player to certain aspects of the gaming proposition such as odds amount of credits in play amount of credits available etc.

In some embodiments an RWE manages the RW portion of the game and contains the mechanical electronic and or software devices to a provide control of the RW portion of the game b communicate metrics of wagering to the GWE c contain various audit logs and activity meters d couple to a centralized server for exchanging various data related to accounting of the gambling proposition the player and their wagering activities on the game along with other functions.

In numerous embodiments the GWE is a portion of a hybrid game gaming system which includes the electronic and software device to perform one or more of the following but not limited to a couple to the RWE to receive the results of real world wagering and other parameters related to the state of the gambling activity in general b directly display to the user through a GWE user interface the results of real world wagering and other parameters related to the state of the gambling activity in general c couple to the ESE to direct the ESE to provide appropriate output to the player in response to the results of RW wagering and the state of the gambling activity in general d operate in conjunction with the ESE to receive gambling game input parameters from the player in the context of the ESE driven audio visual display e couple to the RWE to communicate gambling game input parameters to the RWE and f communicate with a patron management system for management of player information.

In many embodiments the GWE and ESE manage a game world GW which is a video game or entertainment game portion of the gaming system that includes information typically associated with this virtual entertainment environment including its game characters or objects character action game scores.

It is noted that in the case of the RWE in this arrangement through explicit player choices operation of the GWE may affect selection of the RWE s bet or wager size pay tables bonus round selections and or other configuration variables. In the case of all such choices the profile of the RWE controlled gambling game is directed by the player either directly or indirectly through the GWE .

The communication link shown between the GWE and the RWE in has at least two purposes. The first being that it allows the GWE to obtain information from the RWE as to the amount of credits available on the RW portion of the game the result of each gambling proposition and necessary status operation of the RWE such as on line or tilt . The communications link also provides a means by which the GWE communicates to the RWE parameters that serve as inputs to the RWE controlled gambling game e.g. credits to be bet or wagered electing to participate in bonus rounds etc. .

The GW game operating system has at least three activities. The first is to take the results of each RWE controlled gambling game undertaken in the RWE and to direct the ESE to output a specific type of audio video event as a result. The GW Game OS accesses a GW database that in accord with processes in the GW Game OS translates each possible result of the RW gambling game into a command or commands to the ESE to generate a controlled sequence of a portion of an entertainment game of the ESE resulting in an entertainment game state or states that are output as an audio video event to the player. This particular function is defined by one or more Process Maps which may be entirely or partially resident within the GW Game OS .

In another aspect the GW game operating system sets flags or variables that the ESE uses to condition ESE s own process of generating a controlled sequence of a portion of the entertainment game as an audio video event. That is the specific audio video event need not be dictated by the GWE .

The GWE also may display directly to the user through display audio meters and or other means the details regarding the player s current state in regard to the RWE controlled gambling game. Specifically the number of credits in the RWE controlled gambling game the current status with regard to bonusing the current setting as relates to the number of credits to be bet or wagered etc. are examples of but not a limit to the information that can be presented to the player at all times through the GWE s access of the portion of the GW User Interface dedicated to display of the RW activity GW User Interface .

In another aspect the GWE displays this information in coordination with the ESE so that the presentation of such information appears to seamlessly integrate with the entertainment content generated by the ESE and displayed on the GW User Interface . An example of this might be displaying the gambling or wagering results of the player on the scoreboard in a football game. Another example is to show the explosion and subsequent implosion of a building under attack in a military game based on a favorable RW gambling or wagering result.

In another aspect the RWE may be the entity that displays the details regarding the player s current status with regard to the RWE controlled gambling game by signaling sent to the GW User Interface or may directly interface with the ESE to provide this information to the player . Selection of whether the GWE or the RWE assumes responsibility for display of gambling status would typically be driven by gaming regulatory requirements.

The GWE also conveys player choices to the RWE that affect the RWE controlled gambling game inputs as made by the player in the context of the ESE driven entertainment game audio visual display.

In the GWE also connects to the ESE . The ESE manages and controls the visual audio and player entertainment for the game. The ESE accepts input from the GWE as to the type of audio video event that is to be presented to the user acts upon this input while reflecting the current state of the audio visual game and updates the audio visual display accordingly with the aim of providing an engaging entertainment game controlled sequence to the player. This cycle of the GWE of collecting information from the RWE conditioning it passing information to the ESE and the ESE acting upon it after possibly having conditioned it further may transpire with each play of the RW game.

In many embodiments the ESE includes the electrical and software systems that provide a rich multi media output of high entertainment value to the player in response to the RW gambling or wagering result and state. A PC a handheld tablet Sony PlayStation Wii or Microsoft Xbox running a modified version of a specific game program e.g. Madden Football 10 are some embodiments of hosts for an ESE. In some embodiments the ESE exchanges data with and accepts control information from the GWE. One purpose of the ESE s interaction with the GWE is to 1 to ultimately translate RW game play into a controlled sequence of an entertainment game to provide a higher level of entertainment value to the player 2 to provide an audio visual display which serves as the context in which the player selects the inputs to the RWE controlled gambling game e.g. number of credits to be bet or wagered 3 to interact with the GWE to provide a means by which input parameters for RW game play can be collected from the player. At the direction of the GWE which in turn receives input from the RWE representing the state of RW game play the ESE drives an audio visual display that closely approximates the experience of playing a video game or an arcade game controlled sequence Process Map . An combination of a series of rules logic databases and processes which may be static or formulaic deterministic and or include an element of randomness that dictates in whole or in part i.e. the output from the Process Map may be further conditioned independently by GWE or ESE resident software the way in which a gambling or wagering result achieved in the RWE is represented to the player by the ESE software in the GW context. The Process Map may reside in the GWE the ESE or both.

The ESE enables a wide range of game themes including popular titles from arcade and home video games e.g. Gears of War Time Crisis Madden Football etc. . The ESE can also be dedicated to a single game theme to provide the seamless and sensible operation of the gaming system as a richer experience than conventional slot machines.

In other aspects the ESE may also signal the GWE as to player actions in the GW context and other GW parameters type of character car weapon etc. for the GWE s use in triggering gambling plays or wagers and configuring the overall profile of the RWE . According to these aspects a cycle of the gaming system includes the player making choices and taking actions within the GW context thereby signaling the ESE through the GW User Interface . The ESE in turn signals the GWE of these choices and actions and the GWE configures wagers and other factors of the RWE for RW wagers that create a wagering or gambling result as gambling plays transpiring with the player s interaction with the ESE via the GW User Interface .

In another aspect the RWE is coupled to a RW patron management system for the purposes of player management and game accounting for a gambling game such as real world credit RC accounting and tracking. Additionally the RW patron management system may also track game world credit entertainment game player profiles and configurations etc. for the purposes of an entertainment game played by a player. RC are entered into the hybrid game by the player casino operator or third party either in the form of currency tickets or other medium as issued by the operator of the game e.g. a casino . RC may be of a nature that they are convertible back into currency by a player casino operator or third party.

In another aspect the GWE may be coupled to a GW patron management system for the purposes of tracking game world credit managing entertainment game player profiles and configurations etc. for the purposes of an entertainment game played by a player.

In another aspect the RW patron management system and the GW patron management system may be linked together.

In another aspect the RW patron management system and GW patron management system may be part of a single patron management system.

In another aspect two or more RWEs may be coupled to two or more GWEs. This allows two or more players to use play an entertainment game of the gaming system either competitively or cooperatively while each of the two or more players has their own RWE to manage each player s wagers and results independently. By use of such a feature each player can have their own unique gambling or wagering result sequence.

The architecture of a gaming system as shown in may be physically accomplished as shown literally or may be more virtual in nature. For example a single or a plurality of controllers may divide up the logical tasks reflected the user interfaces shown could be combined to a single or plurality of display screens player feedback and controls that connections shown to the RW patron server for the purposes of game accounting RC and game world credit tracking and other functions could be a single connection to a single server a single connection to a plurality of servers multiple connections to multiple servers etc. such that the system could be accomplished in a highly virtualized space such that the RWE and GWE were large scale centralized servers in the cloud coupled to a plurality of widely distributed ESE controllers such as ESE or clients via the Internet.

In many embodiments a hybrid game is deployed in a gaming establishment such as a casino in either one or a plurality of locations where people go to play gambling games of chance. A casino for the purposes of this document may also refer to a virtual manifestation of a casino such as an on line casino or other gambling operation. Casinos are typically operated by a person or an entity that may operate one or more gambling operations including but not limited to a Wide Area Network gaming franchise a gaming route or other gambling business be it a physical manifestation in the case of a casino or virtual in the case of an internet gambling operation.

In some embodiments an entertainment game of a hybrid game is a game that is provided to a player that the player interactively plays. Examples of entertainment games are video games or the like. In various aspects an entertainment game can include elements of skill play partial skill play or pseudo skill play. In addition an entertainment game may include multiplayer aspects where two or more players can play either competitively or cooperatively.

In numerous embodiments the GWE and ESE operate to manage game world credit GWC . GWC is credit earned or depleted as a function of player skill i.e. as a function of player performance in the context of the game. According to various embodiments of GWC entertainment games of different types may have different scoring criterion may have different GWC types and different GWC magnitudes. GWC may be perpetual and may be carried forward from one level of game play to another and from one gaming session to another. GWC may ultimately be paid out in various manners such as directly in cash or indirectly such as earning entrance into a sweepstakes drawing or earning participation in or victory in a tournament with prizes. GWC may be stored on a player tracking card or in a network based player tracking system and the GWC is attributed to a specific player. In addition GWC may span more than one type of game and not only may GWC be carried forward from one level of game play to another but from one game to another.

The RWE may be connected to a RW patron management system . The RW patron management system sends parameters to the RWE such as Ln RC tables max speed of play game monetary denomination and casino promotion RC. The RWE sends parameters to the RW patron management system such as the RC in a current game RC wagered in the current play session RW player account information player activity player profiles etc.

The RWE is further connected to the GWE and receives player choices and actions that may be used as gambling or wagering triggers for a RWE controlled gambling game.

The RWE transmits parameters and objects to the GWE such as status of the RWE a gambling or wagering play results Ln RC table information RW patron management system data whether or not it is possible to enter a bonus round the game monetary denomination and other RWE parameters.

Ln RC tables are tables which dictate the real credit earned as a function of game play and is analogous to the pay tables used in a conventional slot machine. TABLE Ln RC payouts are independent of player skill and the output of the table is established by applying a random number generator against a table of potential outcomes. There may be one or a plurality of TABLE Ln RC pay tables contained in a game design the selection of which being determined by game progress a player has earned and bonus rounds which a player may be eligible for.

The GWE also transmits parameters and objects to the RWE such as the RC used to play per RWE game whether to enter or decline a bonus round casino promotional RC and audit information. The audit information includes a game title profile and status Ln GWC table information GWC points and audit information game software and firmware versions and signatures and player and profile information.

The GWE is also connected to the ESE and transmits parameters and objects such as ESE controlled entertainment game software difficulty settings game score enhancements cheats character profiles and setups equipment inventory random complexity modifications changes in the GW character s status in the game.

The GWE receives from the ESE parameters such as player choices and actions choice is to open a treasure chest action is to use magic wand to open the treasure chest chosen through a UI GW character profiles GW equipment and inventory game scores random complexity ratings language selection and tournament and multiplayer information.

The GWE may also be connected to a GW patron management system . The GW patron management system sends parameters to the GWE player entertainment game configurations a player s current GWC accumulation etc. The GWE sends parameters to the GW patron management system such as the GWC in a current entertainment game GWC that the player is using to acquire access to various elements within the entertainment game GW player account information and player activity and profiles.

The architecture of a gaming system as shown in may be physically accomplished as shown literally or may be more virtual in nature. For example a single or a plurality of controllers hosts or servers may divide up the logical tasks reflected the user interfaces shown could be combined to a single or plurality of display screens player feedback and controls that connections shown to the RW patron server and for the purposes of game accounting RC tracking and other functions could be a single connection to a single server a single connection to a plurality of servers multiple connections to multiple servers etc. such that the system could be accomplished in a highly virtualized space such that the RWE and GWE were large scale centralized servers in the cloud coupled to a plurality of widely distributed ESE controllers such as ESE or clients via the Internet.

In one aspect at the onset of a game session the ESE receives information and about player preferences through the GW User Interface via the GWE as a means of selecting the entertainment theme for an entertainment game controlled sequence or to make specific selections as relates the characters or teams or other variables active in the context of the entertainment theme. For example the gaming system of may be set up such that the ESE houses software related to video football e.g. Madden Football video hockey e.g. NHL2K10 and or a video soccer game e.g. 2010 FIFA World Cup . The player of might decide they want to gamble at the gaming system in the context of football and could input this information through a touch screen that is part of the GW User Interface . The resulting information is used to configure the ESE and or the GWE .

Once the player of has selected football they could in one implementation further select the team they want to be e.g. New Orleans Saints and the team they wish to oppose. Again this information could be for example entered through a user input device such as a touch screen. In another implementation the player of can make more detailed selections to characterize the operation of the ESE . For example the player of could select individual football players for their team.

User preferences and status in the RWE and all other information presented to the user in a conventional slot machine e.g. number of credits number of credits currently being bet or wagered per game play etc. in addition to gambling or wagering results may also be represented within an entertainment game controlled sequence managed by the ESE . In each case the information of interest is communicated from the RWE to the GWE either at the request of the GWE or on a push basis from the RWE . The GWE then translates this information into the command data or signaling or plurality thereof necessary to cause the ESE to generate a controlled sequence of a desired portion of an audio visual display as a part of the ESE s entertainment game controlled sequence.

In another aspect once configured the player of commences gambling by taking actions and making choices in the context of the ESE entertainment game controlled sequence. The choices may be used to shape the type of bet or wager such as by altering the number of credits to be bet or wagered or the odds for the bet or wager. For example the type of football play chosen in a video football implementation may dictate the number of credits to be bet or wagered and or the football play dictates the shape of the bet more generally such as a Hail Mary pass versus an up the middle run could invoke bets or wagers with different odds. The actions taken and choices made by the player forms part of the information and collected via the GWE User Interface in the context of an audio visual user interface provided by the ESE is relayed by the GWE to the RWE and is conveyed simultaneously to the player of through the GWE User Interface and or the ESE generated audio visual display. The RWE uses the information to determine one or more bets or wagers for the player and establishes for each bet or wager via the RNG of and pay tables of one or more resulting outcomes for the one or more bets or wagers as a gambling or wagering result that may have one or more results corresponding to the one or more bets or wagers. The gambling or wagering result is fed back to the GWE . The GWE may or may not directly display the gambling or wagering result through the GW User Interface and or indirectly using the GW User Interface in the game context.

In numerous embodiments EE Enabling Element. The consumable and replenishable elements in an entertainment game that enable a player to play the entertainment game while consuming the element. Examples include but are not limited to bullets fuel health points potions etc. to be used when playing an entertainment game.

The GWE further directs the ESE to generate a controlled sequence of a portion of the entertainment game reflective of the gambling or wagering result. The controlled sequence of a portion of the entertainment game changes the state of the entertainment game as well as defines how the entertainment game state will be displayed audibly and visually to the player. This may include transitioning through one or more entertainment game states and generation of one or more corresponding audio visual displays for the player. In addition the controlled sequence of a portion of the entertainment game may provide for additional player inputs that may form the basis for partially or wholly generating a portion of the controlled sequence or entertainment game states. For example if five credits were bet or wagered based on the user selecting a mid range passing play and the RWE controlled gambling game returned twelve credits as part of the gambling or wagering result the GWE may direct the ESE to generate a controlled sequence of a portion of the entertainment game as a display of a play generating forward movement of the ball of 25 yards in favor of the team that the player chose to represent them in the game. Additionally the GWE may dictate the specific play by which this forward movement of the ball was to be achieved and in another aspect the ESE would determine the type of play to be displayed using logic internal to ESE s software. In addition as the controlled sequence of a portion of the entertainment game may be influenced by additional player inputs the player may take an action such as attempting to catch a pass as a direct player in the example football based entertainment game the result of which may ultimately determine the remainder of a portion of the controlled sequence of a portion of the entertainment game or the state of the entertainment game.

The controlled sequence could be for any portion of the entertainment game. For example he controlled sequence could establish the beginning portion of the entertainment game where the theme of the entertainment game is laid out for the player. The controlled sequence portion of the entertainment game could also be for an intermediate portion of the entertainment game such as a major branching of the game play where the player is presented with either a more challenging portion of the entertainment game or a less challenging portion based on the gambling or wagering results. The controlled sequence portion of the entertainment game could also establish a final outcome portion of the entertainment game such as the player ultimately being victorious or defeated.

If the player of subsequently gambled another five credits and the gambling or wager result was such that these five credits were lost a loss of yards on the play might transpire. Alternatively other controlled sequences of a portion of the entertainment game might be made available such as the resulting ESE display might be signaled to show an incomplete pass a short gain insufficient to achieve a first down or even an interception. If this play was undertaken on fourth down a fumble might ensue and possession would go to the other team. Once the ball was held by the other team subsequent gambling propositions would cause display actions in the context of the player s team being on defense.

In another aspect the interaction between the GWE and the ESE by which the wager result drives ESE generated audio video output is accomplished by virtue of one or more Process Maps of whose purpose is to transform gambling or wagering results into a set of directions that enable the ESE to generate the appropriate portion of the audio visual output in the ESE driven entertainment game controlled sequence.

When the one or more Process Maps of are resident entirely within the ESE the GWE may still operate between the RWE and the ESE and translate the result of the RWE controlled gambling game output in the RWE into a form that the ESE can accept as input to the one or more Process Maps of .

Bonusing special events and other results of the RWE controlled gambling game would be similarly mapped to events within the ESE either explicitly via the GWE or more generally by the GWE along with the ESE using the ESE s own software i.e. the one or more Process Maps of to convert the input from the GWE into a specific controlled sequence of events within a portion of the entertainment game.

In another aspect the controlled sequence portion of the entertainment game is only partially based on a gambling or wagering result. For example the controlled sequence portion of the entertainment game could be also partially based on actions taken by the player such as sequence of player or user inputs. As another example the controlled sequence portion of the entertainment game may be partially based on an action of an operator of the gaming system such as the operator of a gambling establishment providing a special bonus or complimentary award to a player. As another example the controlled sequence portion of the entertainment game is further based on an action of a third party such as another player playing competitively or cooperatively with the player of the entertainment game.

In another aspect an entertainment conditioning function is used to transform a series of gambling or wagering results into a series of results that are more appropriate for generating a controlled sequence of a portion of an entertainment game in order to maintain a player s interest in what may be a losing series of gambling or wagering results. For example illustrates an exemplary series of gambling or wagering results corresponding to a series of results that can be used to generate a controlled sequence for a portion of an entertainment game. In the example the entertainment game is related to a football game but it should be understood that an entertainment conditioning function may be applied to any type of entertainment game. On graph dots such as dot and respective curve illustrate an RC credit meter on a gambling game for a series of gambling or wagering results. From graph it can be seen that the player has some losses as indicated by a fall in the RC credit meter and wins indicated by a rise in the RC credit meter . Also on graph other dots such as dot and respective curve represent a yardage meter for use in generating a display for an entertainment game. If the yardage advanced and lost in the football game were directly linked to RWE gambling or wagering results a potentially unsatisfying script might emerge whereby the player for a number of possessions continues to lose yardage on every play regardless of how well the play calling was done.

As can be seen from graph yardage is managed independently of the play by play result as indicated by the RWE gambling or wagering results. That is there is not a one to one correspondence between the yardage gained or lost and the RC credits won or lost. This is accomplished through the use of an entertainment conditioning function by use of its processes and by looking forward at a Win Loss Queue WLQ of the series of gambling or wagering results. By generating the yardage using an entertainment conditioning function the entertainment game states reflected to the player as playing field results are managed so that over a play session the final game entertainment game state will generally be in line with the gambling or wagering result . This is to say if the player finished their gambling play session a winner then the player s team would be reflected to have dominated the other team in the scrimmage. If however the player lost a marginal amount of money in the session the game could have played out to be close with the player perhaps winning by a small margin late in the game with the outcome of the entertainment game hanging in the balance to the last moment and an unfortunate turnover in the last 45 seconds leads to the opponents long yardage field goal to win the game by 1 point. If the player sustained larger losses the game could still be kept exciting throughout so the result was not obvious to the player but the opponent could overwhelm the player s team in the last 5 minutes of the game.

In operation one or more gambling or wagering results are determined for a gambling game. The one or more gambling or wagering results are then used along with a look up table to generate a desired result or entertainment game state that is then used to generate a controlled sequence for a portion of the entertainment game.

In another aspect the output of the entertainment conditioning function are pseudo gambling or wagering results that are gambling or wagering results that have been conditioned according to the entertainment conditioning function. The pseudo gambling or wagering results are then used to generate a controlled sequence of a portion of an entertainment game in the same manner as non conditioned gambling or wagering results.

The GWE compares the action taken by the player with the optimal action for the given entertainment game state and determines if the optimal action was taken. If not the process ends without rewarding the player. However if the optimal player action was taken the GWE determines if the player should be awarded GWC . The GWC may also determine if the player should be awarded by enhancing an EE within the entertainment game. If the GWE does determine to award the player EE the GWE does so by enhancing an EE within the entertainment game for the player s use. The GWE may also determine to reward the player by adjusting a pay table in an RWE to be more favorable to the player. As a result of this process the player is rewarded for playing the entertainment game well even if a series of gambling game results may not prove favorable to the player.

In another aspect the correlation between events in the entertainment layer driven by the ESE and the gambling events driven by the RWE can be either direct e.g. five credits won equals a five yard movement of the football or indirect e.g. the GWE or ESE can introduce randomness into the process by which the entertainment output is selected the random process being seeded by the result of the RWE controlled gambling game and the state of the ESE driven entertainment game controlled sequence. 

In the case of the indirect correlation if the GWE was the controller introducing some measure of randomness the GWE would modify the directions that it sends to the ESE which in turn generates the appropriate controlled sequence of a portion of the entertainment game output for the player of . In this mode a gambling or wagering result X which is achieved by the RWE would in turn be modified by the GWE by an amount Z e.g. X Z such that the display generated by the ESE is not deterministic as a function of the result of the RWE controlled gambling game. The nature of the modifier Z could be an element which was dictated by the casino operator not shown .

Turning now to in another aspect the player s of state as it relates to the RWE and the RWE controlled gambling game is displayed to the player of using an optional RW User Interface independently of the state of the ESE driven entertainment output. The number of credits in the gaming system of the number of credits the player of has selected to bet or wagered on the next gambling play and any and all other metrics and relevant to the player s status in the RWE controlled gambling game are continuously updated and displayed using the RW User Interface independently of the entertainment content of the game as generated by the ESE . This is achieved through a dedicated portion of of the GW User Interface that is reserved exclusively for this purpose and that is managed by the GWE based on input received from the RWE .

The player s RWE state portion of the GWE output while synchronized with the gambling activity within the RWE may not in all implementations be tightly synchronized with the ESE generated entertainment game controlled sequence output i.e. the ESE output may lag the information displayed directly by the GWE if part of the particular implementation as to the state of the RWE controlled gambling game . In addition the output of the ESE i.e. the ESE generated entertainment game controlled sequence and the GWE driven output directly reflecting the state of the RWE controlled gambling game may be directly synchronized such that the result of a RWE controlled gambling game is not known to the player of until the completion of the ESE driven display sequence initiated by that RWE controlled gambling game. This characteristic may or may not be accompanied by a feature that prevents additional bets or wagers from being made until the ESE driven display routine is complete and confirmation of this fact is passed from the GWE to the RWE .

In another aspect certain player functions are handled as input directly to the RWE rather than running through the GWE or ESE . According to such an aspect the player of triggers the betting process in the RWE through a dedicated user input portion of RW User Interface connected to the RWE . The player of can also cash out through another dedicated user input linked directly to the RWE through the RW User Interface . In another aspect these functions are handled through a touch screen whereby the RW User Interface subsumes a portion of the display. In another aspect all user input is captured through the GWE User Interface which directs the input to the RWE or directs the input to the ESE as appropriate.

In another aspect player of actions will result in a request to the RWE to drive a number of RWE plays as exemplified by Pending Bet Queue of to occur in order to generate a list of wins losses which would be loaded into a queue. This wins losses queue or WLQ is in turn communicated to the GWE . The GWE operates on these gambling or wagering results via the one or more Process Maps of such Process Maps of containing the procedures to analyze the net result of the gambling or wagering results in the WLQ and subsequently trigger a series of actions in simulating a portion of the ESE controlled entertainment game by the ESE such that player of experiences more of a comprehensive story to describe the result of their wagering as opposed to the linear relationship of a typical wager result wager result method in the case of a single ESE generated controlled sequence of a portion of an entertainment game per RWE play by direct correlation. The purpose of this conditioning function that the GWE processes using the WLQ is to provide a more realistic ESE controlled entertainment game context progression enhancing the entertainment derived by the player of .

An example of this functionality in the context of a football game would be the GWE determining from the WLQ which for this example has a depth of 8 plays that the player will net a win of 3 credits for a total of 8 bet but will only do so on the last play. The GWE receiving this gambling or wagering result from the pending WLQ instructs the ESE to generate a controlled sequence of a portion of the entertainment game showing the player s team making 2 running plays for short gains followed by the quarterback getting sacked for a loss of 10 yards followed by the quarterback throwing the ball downfield for a 25 yard completion and a first down.

The entertainment or storyboard conditioning function performed by the GWE for conditioning the ESE output described above may or may not directly correlate to the handling of the actual wagering proposition which RWE plays entail. This is to say if the conditioning function directly correlated to the wagering proposition then the results of the conditioning operation of the RWE results would be translated into a single summary bet or wager for the player so long an equivalent mathematical result for a fair gambling proposition could be ensured . If the conditioning function was not directly correlated then one of two methods could be employed a the wagering proposition would be a package of RWE wagers run in a sequence as a package of bets or wagers or b a separate RWE wager not related to the sequence of RWE wagers would be effected to produce the wager proposition. The correlation and exact implementation may depend on regulatory and casino operator policies. Additionally the WLQ pending bet or wager results may or may not be considered irrevocably committed to the RWE controlled gambling game. In the case where all bets or wagers in the WLQ will be placed the ESE will play out the script resulting from the pending queue of bets or wagers and the player of will win lose funds accordingly. In this mode and at a moment of synchronization the player of would then be presented the choice to continue with the game and hence expose themselves to the next series of bets or wagers to limit the amount of bets or wagers they d be exposed to or to cash out. Note that in this WLQ committed mode the WLQ could be no larger than credits available on the game subsuming that the gaming system contains the logic to automatically control the depth of the WLQ or how much of the WLQ is analyzed and thus committed by the GWE to the gambling proposition.

If the gaming system utilizes the WLQ herein described there are two methods for handling termination of play by the player of at the time of cash out. In the first method the player of may elect to revoke the pending bets or wagers of the WLQ and to take pay out on the credits remaining on the gaming system. In the second method the pending result of bets or wagers of the WLQ are displayed to the player of and the amount of remaining credits which the player receives at cash out is a netting of these results against the credits remaining. Which method is utilized may be a selection of the casino operator or will be based on what is allowed by gaming regulations in the particular jurisdiction.

The WLQ s operation does not necessarily mean that a plurality of credits must be played or committed. For instance the final net result of the WLQ over say 9 bets or wagers could be arithmetically operated upon in some manner to determine the betting result of a single set of credit s wagered. The value of the WLQ in this case is to provide a deeper set of inputs for the ESE GW context story board so that the player of is uncertain throughout a greater period of time how their bet or wager is going to come out. In another aspect the player could commit a fixed amount of credits to the whole football game the RWE could be run once to determine the outcome of the whole game and then the football game could be played by the player to completion the result of plays throughout score the game controlled by the GWE its Process Maps and possibly RNG results for the play by play action with the outcome of the whole game unknown until the final.

In another aspect the WLQ is eliminated and a series of control tables in the one or more Process Maps of of the GWE would take an RWE RNG of wagering result and use the value to drive selection of a particular control table which would provide a script of instructions to drive the ESE GW context story board over a multiple of plays actions results or events. The purpose here again is to drive a richer entertainment representation of the result of RWE RW gambling plays.

In another aspect generation of the controlled sequence portion of the entertainment game further includes using a conditioning function to relate the result of the general direction winning or losing of a plurality of wagers in the WLQ with the controlled sequence portion of the entertainment game such that the result of the controlled sequence portion of the game may be decoupled on a wager by wager basis while being coupled on a summation basis as summed over the plurality of wagers.

In another aspect as the player of continues to expend credits in the game either in a single session or across multiple sessions as tracked through a RW Patron Management System of the ESE output can be conditioned to provide audio visual output that is exclusively displayed to the player of if the player of meets certain criteria as set by the casino. For example unique characters weapons background scenery and or music monsters etc. could be displayed in variants of the ESE output. Likewise unique gambling propositions can be offered to the player of as a function of player status as reflected in the casino s RW Patron Management System of and or the player s of gambling behavior during the current session. The ESE output can also be conditioned and or unique display options provided to the player of as a function of the casino s assessment of the player of across any number of dimensions as supported by the RW Patron Management System of independently of the player s of specific actions vis vis the specific game in question. In this manner a player s entertainment experience on a particular game can vary from player to player and session to session. To enable such a feature the gaming system of accepts input from the casino operator or configuring entity on a plurality of conditioning variables such as rate of play time of day frequency of play on the particular game a player s club status etc. Based on the control variables specified a casino operator can tailor their machines entertainment offering to their particular market interests.

In another aspect player selections in the ESE controlled entertainment game such as selection of a team in a football game selection of specific players for a team selection of a specific play choice choice of weapon or game scenario etc. may control certain RWE parameters such as the amount of credits bet in the RWE controlled gambling game and or affect the bonusing available to the player. For example a football controlled sequence driven by the ESE might allow the player to select from one of a number of offensive plays to be run. Choices might include a run up the middle a short 5 yard pass attempt and a 50 yard Hail Mary pass attempt. Selection of each play might cause one three and ten credits to be bet or wagered in the RWE controlled gambling game respectively this information having been clearly communicated to the player prior to finalizing his selection. In another example choosing NY Yankee Alexander Rodriguez to pinch hit in an ESE baseball entertainment game might require that additional credits are expended for each at bat but could also give the player the opportunity to win bigger bonuses. Such a scenario subsumes the concept whereby the player plays the ESE controlled entertainment game and in so doing makes choices that affect the RWE controlled gambling game configuration such that player choices can affect the denomination of the credit and or the bonusing available as a function of playing the game. Once the RWE is configured to operate in response to certain player choices in the ESE GW context the actual gambling play is run completely randomly on the RWE .

In another aspect player selections in the ESE controlled entertainment game affect the odds or pay tables of the RWE controlled gambling game. For example a player in an ESE controlled football entertainment game may elect to call a long odds play such as a Hail Mary pass when only 2 yards are needed and they are on the 50 yard line versus calling a much safer run up the middle play. In this case the RWE would receive signaling as to the selection and enroll the player in a long odds bet or wager with a much higher payout than would be the case with the 2 yard up the middle run play.

In another aspect and a feature related to that disclosed in the previous paragraph the GWE contains analysis logic and processes to determine the riskiness of the player of choices in the ESE controlled entertainment game and signal the RWE so as to effect changes in its pay tables or odds to match the gambling profile of the RWE to the risk of the ESE elected play or action choice. E.g. calling the Hail Mary pass in the situation cited in the preceding paragraph or in a shooting game the player directing the player to run directly at a machine gun nest to engage in close combat with a pistol. 

In another aspect the player s skill in playing the entertainment game influences the gambling game. In operation the GWE communicates with the RWE to select and or configure a gambling proposition as a function of the player s demonstrated skill exclusively or in conjunction with other influencing elements in the entertainment game. The player s demonstrated skill may be a function of their play at in the current game session either over the entire session in the context of a single recent action or anything in between or a measure of a given player s demonstrated skill over time i.e. across multiple game sessions as related to a specific player profile . The impact of the player s demonstrated skill upon the nature of the gambling game can be slight or large the relative influence being determined by the casino operator or gaming system manufacturer.

The form of the impact can include but is not limited to a the odds of the gambling game or b the range of possible results.

In another aspect it should be noted that in addition to the impacts relating to RC use cited before various ESE GW context decisions can accrete to or cause a declination of a player s GWC based on GWE analysis of the wisdom of the choice in the given situation e.g. was it wise to call for a 50 yd deep pass when 4th and 1 on the opponents 35 yard line in the football game 

In another aspect a closed loop feedback between the entertainment game and the RWE operates to provide an additional play element. Referring now to in operation an ESE manages an EE that a player uses when playing an entertainment game hosted by the ESE . The player consumes the EE as the player plays the entertainment game. When the player takes an action that consumes the EE a corresponding bet or wager is made in a gambling game managed by an RWE . A gambling RC result of the gambling game is then used to determine an effect for the EE . For example an amount of the EE may be increased if the gambling or wagering result is a win for the player. Alternatively the EE may be reduced if the gambling or wagering result is a loss for the player.

Referring now to an additional entertainment game element or different type of EE may be supplied to the player by the ESE in response to the gambling or wagering result rather than affecting the original EE that was acted upon or used by the player to make the corresponding bet or wager in the RWE . Accordingly the RC gambling or wagering result of the gambling game is used to determine addition of the additional game element in the entertainment game.

For example an RC win could provide a player of a football game such as Madden Football with access to linebacker Lawrence Taylor as a player on his team which in turn could positively affect the player s performance in the entertainment game and or in the RW gambling game. This stands in contrast to a RC win leading to the opportunity to run more plays which is an example of an increase in EE.

As another example an RC win could provide a player in a baseball game with a higher payroll ceiling allowing the player to sign better talent to his team. This closed loop feedback could take place in lieu of or in addition to an increase in the amount of EE for example.

As another example an RC loss could cause a player in a racing game to experience fog making it harder to stay on the track or place road hazards on the track e.g. potholes in lieu of or in addition to impacting the amount of fuel the race car has i.e. the EE .

Another example related to a racing game a loss in the gambling game could cause the steering wheel control to vibrate or become less responsive to the player s inputs until a subsequent gambling game win or a certain event occurs within the entertainment game e.g. a prescribed period of time elapses the player pulls his car into the pits for repairs etc. . In this regard the closed loop feedback described herein need not be singular but can continue to loop back on itself over a multitude of gambling game results and or entertainment game events.

As another example related to a hybrid game implementation of Scrabble EE is consumed when tiles are moved from the player s rack to the board. RC is bet as a function of the points on the tiles placed i.e. Z O O drives a 12 credit bet . In an RC win in addition to affecting the player s amount of or access to EE can in certain circumstances governed by the design of the game affect the Scrabble board. When an RC win of a certain threshold is reached bonus squares are added to the Scrabble board. These squares can relate solely to the entertainment game and the accumulation of GWC e.g. an additional triple word score square can relate to subsequent gambling games e.g. a square that provides a free credit added to a gambling game initiated by the consumption of EE when a tile is placed on the square using a valid Scrabble move or both.

An RC win could also increase the total number of tiles available to the game or provide special tiles e.g. a letter A worth eight points instead of one point . RC losses could provide the opposite effects eliminating special squares or base squares that are standard on a Scrabble board eliminating tiles etc.

Variables within the ESE and also inputs from the casino operator can also play a role in establishing the relationship between EE RC and RC EE beyond explicit choices made by the player e.g. the case where the player selects a specific football play or a specific player for his football team in Madden Football 

The impact of these variables and inputs along with all other inputs that can affect this relationship are managed through a function within the GWE previously described.

Examples of inputs from the casino operator include in a non exhaustive list time of day location of machine player specific information e.g. player identity funds expended today or over a period of time on this game or on all games in the casino in total etc. .

As another example of an input by a casino operator roving gaming element can be injected into the entertainment game but only one for instance for a whole group of networked games of the same type. The first player of the networked games that successfully played the roving gaming element would receive a jackpot win that would then become unavailable to the other players of the networked games. In the context of a first person shooter entertainment game with a western them the roving gaming element would be in the form of a very bad hombre who would roam towns within the GW. Players would ride from town to town doing their gaming but if they were both lucky or unlucky enough to run across this guy he could be in a saloon restaurant on the street at the corral etc. they could decide to play bounty hunter and call him out for a duel. This would be a big payout jackpot with perhaps easy odds so that the harder proposition might be finding the bad hombre and maybe the player ends up with a 50 50 chance of killing the bad hombre depending on the setup at the corral in the open etc. . This would be a very thematic way for a casino operator to offer a progressive jackpot. Players would actually try to hunt the bad hombre down if the award was high enough. This might mean that the bad hombre is always there in any GW that any player can access but they may have to ride to a remote area of the territory to find him and in an obscure place to boot under the stairwell watching etc. . First to kill the bad hombre wins the money.

Such a feature allows the casino operator to program a roving jackpot and inject the roving jackpot into the game for a period of time. The casino operator could advertise this and make a big deal of it such as coming to a gambling area to play for a big Texas Hold em tournament prize.

In another aspect a result of a gambling game shapes a parameter of the entertainment game but not the result or a specific result. For example in an entertainment game where a player must achieve a particular objective by overcoming a series of obstacles the number and types of obstacles may be altered in correspondence with the result of a gambling game. Alternatively a new and unexpectedly harder obstacle may be placed into the game. For example in a game where the player has to chop trees if the player wins a gambling game the GWE process map shapes the ESE game by causing more trees to appear of various types such as easier to chop higher point value GWC trees if the player wins the gambling game fewer or no new trees if the player loses the gambling game or a horrible beast is introduced into the forest in the event of a gambling game loss and the player has to fend the beast off with the player s axe .

In the various aspects of the gaming system player choices and input are received through the GWE user interface which can subsume a wide array of input devices including but not limited to a touch screen buttons joystick controllers levers switches etc.

An advantage of the architecture is that it leverages very popular titles with garners and provides a sea change environment for casinos to attract players with games that are more akin to the type of entertainment which a younger generation desires.

Another benefit of this architecture is that it minimizes the underlying changes needed to the aforementioned entertainment software Gears of War etc. for it to operate within the gaming construct thus making a plethora of complex game titles and environments rapid and inexpensive to deploy in a gambling environment.

In another aspect a player either has an account on the gaming system or game network or they do not as in the case of a new player. If a player is new to the network or a player wishes to change their preferred profile a setup process similar to a wizard is run. The setup process can encompass a number of parameters which alter the look and feel of the ESE s output. For example a player profile might identify the football team they want to be represented by in an ESE controlled entertainment game system built around Madden Football 2K10.

In another aspect a choice of a particular team in a sports themed entertainment game can affect the paytables and costs of wagering. For example a particular team may include players that have a higher probability of carrying out a particular called play. A player playing such a team would naturally tend to have better results in the entertainment game. Therefore it would be natural for such a team to cost more to play that is minimum wagers placed while utilizing such a team in the entertainment game would be higher or occur with more frequency than if a lesser team were chosen. In addition as a reward for risking more paytables could be adjusted so that the player has either a higher probability of winning a particular wager or the payout as multiplier of the wagered amount per successful wager could be set higher.

Having described a general architecture and processing for the gaming system of several specific game aspects and processes used in the specific examples of a gaming system will now be described in reference to .

In this example implementation the ESE s entertainment game controlled sequence concerns an old west style gunfight where two gunfighters one representing the player the other the computer oppose each other on the main street of a frontier town circa 1850. The player can make choices as to how his gunfighter is represented in the game e.g. man or woman tall or short left handed or right handed mode of dress etc. . The player can also choose the type of pistols their gunfighter is going to use. These choices are made through the GWE User Interface in concert with audio visual output created by the ESE . Players could at the behest of the casino and or as a function of their player status gain access to specialized accessories for their gunfighter effectively conferring status.

In the game the number of credits bet reflects the number of rounds of ammunition available to his character in the gunfight itself. A single credit provides the character with one bullet in a single pistol. A bet or wager of 10 credits might provide the character with two pistols each with five bullets.

When the bet or wager is placed the result of the gambling proposition is translated by the GWE and or ESE into a controlled sequence of the gunfight itself. A losing bet or wager of a single credit would lead to the player s gunfighter firing a single errant shot and being shot by the opposing gunfighter. A draw would result in both the player s character and the opponent missing each other or injuring each other but not fatally. A winning bet or wager of seven credits for example might lead to a prolonged audio visual output in the form of a more involved gun battle where the two characters move around the street until they expend all of their ammunition in this case seven bullets for the player s character . At the completion of this logical display unit the opponent would die and the player s character would survive more or less unscathed.

In another aspect the game would always have the opposing character loading their gun with six bullets for a showdown as one would typically expect . The player by selecting to load less bullets for the gun fight would be interpreted by the GWE to be a riskier proposition for the player and as such the GWE would signal the RWE to select a longer odds bet or wager pay table with larger payout potential than if the player fully loaded their gun with six bullets. The gun battle would ensue and if the result of the RWE controlled gambling game was a win for the player the player would see his her character shooting deftly only say the two bullets they had loaded short versus their opponent who wildly fanned their six gun missing the player with their shots. If the RWE controlled gambling game was a loss the player would see the more expected outcome whereby they ran out of ammo in the fight or shot at too slow of a rate and were gunned down in the street.

The player s gunfighter would win and lose gun battles but would not be fatally injured until such time as he expended the last credit in the machine and such final bet or wager was a loss. At that time the GWE ESE driven audio visual displays would encourage the player to insert more credits or money to continue play and to prevent his gunfighter from dying a slow painful death from complications related to his gunshot wound.

In another aspect a player could save the configuration of their gunfighter character for future use. This configuration would be linked to their account on the casino s Patron Management System and could be accessed in subsequent game playing sessions.

In another aspect a player can accumulate GWC while playing the gunfighter game thus allowing a player s character to gain in skill as function of winning more gunfights and therefore gaining access for example to better odds for a bet or wager as a function of the player s GWC level in this case akin to how many gun battles the player has won . In addition GWC can be accumulated by the player for making certain decisions during playing of the entertainment game as opposed to making other decisions. For example a player may be accorded GWC for making a selection as to what to use for cover on the street selecting a less powerful but more accurate weapon etc.

As a player continued play in the game they would experience a range of interesting opponents. Bonuses that might be won as a function of the RWE controlled gambling game could be represented in the entertainment game controlled sequence as the gunfighter having come across stolen loot or winning a game of cards in a saloon or stripping a vanquished opponent of his personal effects.

Note that this example is not intended to be all inclusive but rather cites only one manner in which the various components of the gaming system may be combined to accomplish an entertainment and gambling game.

In this example implementation gambling is undertaken in the context of a baseball game. The game proceeds bet by bet or wager by wager through nine innings including both halves where the player s team is on offense and on defense. In another aspect the player can choose to play only offense the computer controlled opponents offensive half of each inning being represented simply as a final result.

Players would be able to choose the team that they were going to be represented by and could also in some gaming systems select specific players to represent them. Specific baseball players would require different amounts of credits to be bet or wagered for each pitch of their at bat or in the case of pitchers for each pitch thrown.

Within the workings of the game for each bet or wager placed when at bat in this example the player does not vary the size of his bet or wager for each at bat it is dictated as a function of the team and or individual players he selected at the onset of the game a pitch is thrown to their player and the player either gets a hit if the RWE controlled gambling game had produced a win receives a strike a loss or a ball a draw . In the case of hits the magnitude of the hit single double etc. is a function of the value of the gambling proposition driven win on the bet or wager made i.e. 1 the bet or wager 2 the bet or wager etc. .

Ultimately over the course of many bets or wagers the opposing side is retired and the player s team will then take the field to play defense. Here bets or wagers made drive pitches by the player s team and ultimately outs hits walks etc. by the ESE generated opponent result. Betting continues until the opposing side is retired.

This process can continue through a full nine innings of baseball or end prematurely when the player declines to expend more credits. Bonuses can be awarded at the end of the game if the player s team wins the ESE generated baseball game. Given the number of credits required to reach the end of the game these bonuses could be significant.

Note that in this implementation the cumulative effect of each bet or wager can lead to an outcome winning or losing the baseball game that is not explicitly linked to the result of each bet or wager and that the player cannot predict. This adds an entertainment element to the slot machine that is unique and can drive long term interest among casino customers.

In another aspect the outcome of the baseball game need not be deterministically set by a gambling result. For example the baseball game could still be played as is done on an interactive gaming system such as a Wii namely the player has to hit the ball etc. but the result of the gambling game affects the likelihood of hitting the ball out of the park or the speed that the pitch is thrown etc.

In another aspect accumulation of GWC during an individual gaming session affects odds in future gaming sessions if the person playing the game plays again. For example by continuing to play games through a simulated season accumulation of GWC over several gaming sessions would correlate to keeping a team together. Through accumulation of GWC a more favorable TABLE Ln RC is used to improve the probability that the player will have winning gambling or wagering results.

Note that this example is not intended to be all inclusive but rather cites only one manner in which the various components of the gaming system may be combined to accomplish an entertainment and gambling game.

In another aspect gambling is undertaken in the context of a football game. The game proceeds play by play through as many as four quarters plus OT potentially of football.

When playing offense the patron would select specific plays to be run. Each play would correspond to a specific bet or wager value. For example a run up the middle might take a single credit while a 50 yard Hail Mary pass attempt might require 10 credits.

Players would be able to choose the team that they were going to be represented by and could also in some gaming systems select specific football players to populate their team. Specific football players would modify the number of credits to be bet or wagered on a given football play. For example selecting a pass play with Minnesota Vikings receiver Randy Moss as the recipient would require an additional two credits be expended in the RWE controlled gambling game. Having Tom Brady of the New England Patriots involved in a passing play might require a one credit step up. It is also possible that selecting specific players would provide the player with access to specific bonusing provisions.

After selecting a play the RWE controlled gambling game would run in the context of the number of credits dictated by the choice of football play and the player or players engaged in the play. The result of the RWE controlled gambling game as dictated by the RWE is communicated to the GWE and after conditioning through one or more Process Maps drives a specific result through the ESE . The result of the gambling proposition and the outcome of the football play are both displayed to the player .

As the game progresses the ESE presents the player with appropriate football play choices based upon the state of the game e.g. punting the ball is not offered on anything other than fourth down .

Ultimately over the course of many bets or wagers an offensive series reaches its logical conclusion with points being scored a turnover or other change of possession. The player then selects defensive formations in the context of the entertainment game controlled sequence again driving bets or wagers of specific size in the RWE controlled gambling game.

This process can continue through four quarters of football or end prematurely when the player declines to expend more credits. Bonuses can be awarded at the end of the game if the player s team wins the ESE generated football game. Given the number of credits required to reach the end of the game these bonuses could be significant.

Note that this example is not intended to be all inclusive but rather cites only one manner in which the various components of the gaming system may be combined to accomplish an entertainment and gambling game.

In this example implementation gambling is undertaken in the context of a WWII tank battle. Via the GWE User interface and responding to prompts generated by the ESE audio visual output the player selects one or more tanks and assigns them various attributes in terms of speed maneuverability range armor and weapons. Each choice imputes a specific number of credits that will subsequently be bet in the RWE controlled gambling game. The player outfits one or more tanks representing a minimum of one credit a single meagerly outfitted tank or multiple credits in the form of a single well outfitted tank or multiple tanks each outfitted uniformly or differently to build out his tank brigade. These tanks are staged in a corral as represented through the ESE as part of the entertainment game controlled sequence. Once outfitted the player launches one or more of these tanks into battle which triggers the appropriate number of credits to be bet or wagered in the RWE controlled gambling game.

The result of the RWE controlled gambling game is then communicated from the RWE to the GWE which in turn coordinates a controlled sequence of the tank battle between the player s brigade and an ESE controlled opponent. The result of the battle itself reflects though not necessarily directly the result of the RWE controlled gambling game. As the battle progresses the player can continue to outfit new tanks and release them from the corral into battle. This again correlates with the placement of a bet or wager of a specific number of credits in the RWE controlled gambling game.

For example a player could create three tanks correlating to three six and ten credits respectively. These tanks are stored in the corral. When the player releases the three credit tank into battle via the GWE user interface a three credit bet or wager is made in the RWE controlled gambling game. The result of this bet or wager dictates not necessarily deterministically the fate of the tank in the ESE controlled entertainment game. In this example the RWE controlled gambling game results in a three credit loss for the player and the tank is hit by an anti tank missile and burns to the ground. The player then releases both the six and ten credit tanks into the field of battle. The RWE executes both RWE controlled gambling games and the results are again transmitted to the GWE and ultimately affects the ESE s representation of the result of these tanks performance on the field of battle. Ultimately if one of the player s tanks is the last remaining on the ESE controlled entertainment game s field of play the player wins the ESE generated tank game. This may cause the player to receive a bonus but does not affect the number of credits ultimately won by the player . That is dictated solely by the RWE controlled gambling game.

Note that this example is not intended to be all inclusive but rather cites only one manner in which the various components of the gaming system may be combined to accomplish an entertainment and gambling game.

Consistent with various discussions in this document the gaming system may be embodied in whole or in part in the cloud being based in the internet thus taking place outside of a casino. In this mode players would access games through an internet website and have an otherwise similar experience as relates to RC and GWC. Tournament play would also be supported in such a model. In summary as it would apply to the gaming system the only notable difference between a land based casino and an internet based one would be whether players are present in a gambling operation location in the case of a land based operation or at home or other distributed location in the case of the internet based operation. In either case the elements of the gaming system and their functions would operate effectively the same.

In another aspect the gaming system also includes the concept whereby players can independently gamble through the RWE but experience a head to head presentation of the ESE driven entertainment game controlled sequence content. According to this aspect players opt to participate in a head to head competition through a GWE managed sign up process. That process allows two or more as may be appropriate given the entertainment game in question i.e. the limit is two players for football but could be N players for the adaptation of a multi player game like Halo players to directly establish a head to head pairing between them or for a single player to request a head to head competition. In the latter case the GWE will interact with a centralized server to link the player with another player in a queue of players seeking head to head game play. This sign up process may but does not have to require minimum bet or wager commitments on the part of the players to ensure a game of adequate length between the participants.

Players gamble through independent RWEs and there is no co mingling of their gambling or wagering results. There is no head to head element with respect to the actual gambling proposition. Where the head to head aspect does come into play is as regards the ESE display routines and the GWE s direction of same.

In a head to head implementation a single GWE and ESE either locally or on a remote server act as a master controller. One or more Process Maps dictate the impact of each player s gambling upon the players characters within the ESE driven entertainment game controlled sequence. The same resulting audio video feed is displayed on all the slot machines of participating players. An example of such a map for a western gun fighting game is as follows. In the table Character 1 is the entertainment game avatar related to player 1 and Character 2 is the entertainment game avatar related to player 2.

As with non head to head games in this example a player s character dies when the player runs out of credits as a result of a losing bet or wager.

A range of bonus schemes are possible in this environment. According to one aspect a player gains bonuses either credits or other prizes as dictated by the casino as a function of the player s gambling or wagering results independent of the head to head play i.e. independent bonusing . In another aspect each player in addition to their gambling or wagering results is assigned a score or GWC in the context of the ESE displayed entertainment game controlled sequence that relates to their performance relative to the player they are competing with head to head i.e. relative scoring . Continuing with the western gunfighter example relative scoring might work like this.

The bonus scoring would be tracked within the GWE overseeing the head to head competition and would be either communicated directly to a patron management system or relayed to a patron management system through the RWE associated with each player participating in the competition.

Another example of a head to head competition revolves around an ESE deployment of a video football game e.g. Madden Football 2K11 . In this case head to head competition is limited to two players. Each selects the team they want to be and the head to head competition itself is managed as described previously. Specifically the Process Map for a head to head football game might look like this for example when the offense has the ball and it is first second or third down.

On fourth down in a kicking situation this context being established by the ESE the table might look like this.

The head to head implementation of the gaming system contains a richer series of one or more Process Maps that are managed by the GWE and ESE to provide a rich gaming experience.

Bonusing schemes in the football context are derived directly from the score of the ESE simulated video football game which in turn represents the aggregate performance of the two teams as a function of each player s gambling or wagering results as transformed through the Process Map into specific football plays.

In regards to head to head play generally the same concepts of queuing of bets or wagers or wagers in a Pending Bet Queue of the WLQ of or the absence of the WLQ of would apply. When the WLQ of is supported in head to head play players are required to commit credits and these credits are queued in the form of pending bets or wagers to provide for smooth play. In the absences of a WLQ of players would manually make betting decisions move by move.
