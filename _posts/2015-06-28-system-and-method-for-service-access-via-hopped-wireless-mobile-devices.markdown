title: System and method for service access via hopped wireless mobile device(s)
abstract: Provided is a distributed system and method for peer to peer service propagation. A Mobile data processing System (MS) can share its accessible services to any other MS, preferably in accordance with permissions. Route communications depend on where the MS needing the service is located relative a minimal number of hops through other Mobile data processing Systems (MSs) to get to the service. Services otherwise unavailable to a first MS (or MS user) become available through another MS. A plurality of MSs may facilitate the connection (e.g. hops) from the first MS to the last MS which publishes the service and has access to the service. A service route is minimized for best performance even with highly mobile MSs by minimizing a number of hops between MSs to reach a service.
