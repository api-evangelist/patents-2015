Unless otherwise defined all technical and or scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of embodiments of the invention exemplary methods and or materials are described below. In case of conflict the patent specification including definitions will control. In addition the materials methods and examples are illustrative only and are not intended to be necessarily limiting.

Some embodiments of the invention are herein described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings. With specific reference now to the drawings in detail it is stressed that the particulars shown are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of embodiments of the invention. In this regard the description taken with the drawings makes apparent to those skilled in the art how embodiments of the invention may be practiced.

The present invention in some embodiments thereof relates to communication session management and more specifically but not exclusively to systems and methods for communication session management based on user rules.

An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to program code executable by a processor in communication with a client device of a caller e.g. the client device itself and or a connecter server external to the client device the program code containing instructions that apply a set of rules to iteratively execute a sequence of attempts at establishment of a communication session between the client device of the caller and a client device of the callee optionally a phone call between phones or other mobile devices such as a phone call over a packet network e.g. voice over internet protocol VoIP . Each failed attempt to establish the communication session is followed by a following attempt defined by the set of rules as a following action to perform. The program code follows the set of rules to achieve a predefined desired communication session. In this manner the client device of the caller and or the server attempting to reach the callee may free up resources of the caller device to allow the user to execute other applications e.g. by the communication application executing in the background and or by the server executing the attempts instead of the communication application executing in the foreground and optionally requiring constant user attention and or user monitoring .

Optionally the set of rules is stored in association with one of the contact members of an electronic address book optionally in communication with the processor of the caller device. The set of rules may define the communication address for the sequence of attempts according to the communication address stored for the respective contact. Selection e.g. by the user pressing an icon representing the contact using a graphical user interface of the contact may automatically initiate the sequence of attempts at establishment of the communication session according to the set of rules related to the contact member.

Optionally selection of the contact triggers transmission of an electronic message including the set of rules over a network to the server for execution of the attempts to establish the communication session. Optionally the server connects the caller device to the respective callee device when the server establishes the communication session based on the set of rules. Alternatively selection of the to contact triggers activation of a local application installed on the caller device to attempt to establish the communication session.

Optionally the set of rules define attempts at establishing the communication session to different communication addresses of the same contact member optionally in a predefined sequence dynamic or static for example to different telephone numbers of the contact member. Alternatively or additionally the set of rules define attempts at establishing the communication session to different contact members i.e. different than the first selected contact member for example family members related to the contact member in a certain order.

Optionally the electronic address book stores the set of rules and communication addresses of the same and or different contact members within a single contact member entry representing the sequence. Selection of the sequence member initiates application of the set of rules at the external server or locally at the caller device. In this manner the sequence is automatically followed without requiring intermediate user intervention to initiate different calls.

Optionally the set of rules include instructions to execute simultaneous communication session attempts for example simultaneous attempts to establish the same session with multiple different contacts e.g. group electronic chat conference call and or simultaneous attempts to establish different sessions with different contacts e.g. multiple phone calls to different people using different phone numbers and or network phone connections .

Optionally the set of rules includes instructions to execute attempts at establishment of the communication session using two or more different mediums for example a duplex texting and or chat session a short message service SMS a voice phone call over a phone network and a call e.g. voice and or video over a packet network such as the internet e.g. voice over internet protocol VoIP . The different mediums may be executed simultaneously such as two simultaneous attempts to establish communication sessions. The different mediums may be executed sequentially according to the order such as an attempt at a voice call followed by an attempt at a chat session.

An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to program code executable by a processor of a server in communication with multiple client devices. The code of the server follows a set of rules transmitted as a network to message by a client device to iteratively execute a sequence of attempts at establishment of a communication session between the client device of the caller and a client device of the callee. Optionally resources of the client device are freed up for other uses by transferring the attempts at the establishment of the communication session to the server. The server routes the established communication session back to the client device of the caller. In this manner the user of the client device may use the resources of the calling device for execution of other applications until the communication session has been established.

As used herein the term communication session means a mechanism for allowing human language based communication between two human users i.e. the caller and the callee for example a voice call a videoconference call and text based electronic messages.

As used herein the term attempt sometimes means attempt to establish the communication session for example for simplicity and or clarify in the description.

Reference is now made to which is a flowchart of a computerized method for establishing a communication session between a client device of a caller and a client device of a callee in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. The method applies a set of rules to automatically execute a sequence of attempts at establishing a communication session between a client device of a caller and a client device of a callee when previous attempts at establishment of a communication session have failed.

The set of rules may be static and or dynamic. The set of rules do not necessarily follow the certain order and or the predefined sequence. The set of rules may define a set of predefined dynamic or static communication addresses and or predefined contacts from which the following contact and or communication address is automatically designated for the attempt for example the set may include all contacts in the addressbook the set may be defined dynamically e.g. contacts in the same city as the caller and or the set may be manually defined by the user. The set of rules may define the following callee for the following attempt at establishment of the communication session based on for example facts obtained by a software module and or sensor input for example time of day e.g. accessed by code from the caller device and or an external server geographic location of the caller e.g. accessed by code from a global positioning system module of the caller geographic location of the callee topic of discussion e.g. analyzed by code based on subjects of messages frequency of earlier communication sessions between the caller and the callee e.g. by code analyzing a call history log file and or previous communication to sessions initiated from the callee. Alternatively the set of rules may define a random selection of the following communication address from the set of predefined dynamic or static communication addresses. Each subsequent attempt may be different than a previous attempt to a different communication address of the same callee or to a different client device of a different contact callee.

Reference is also made to which is a block diagram of a system that includes code that automatically executes a set of rules to subsequently attempt establishing communication sessions between the client device of the caller and a client device of a callee in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. The system may free up resources on the client device while the attempts are being executed. The code of the system of executes on the client device s to execute the attempts. As discussed below the system of executes code on servers external to the clients to execute the attempts. For the systems of and the set of rules are defined on the clients with execution of the attempts performed at the client or by the server external to the client.

The code of the system described herein and or related method may improve performance of the client device of the caller by executing the communication session establishment attempts in a manner that frees up resources for execution by other processes and or applications. For example the code is executed by the external server or executes in the background of the caller device during the attempts while one or more other applications are executing in the foreground of the caller device. In this manner the user may use the other applications while waiting for establishment of the communication session. As following the set of rules may take time for example minutes or hours the client device may become available for execution of other applications in the meantime improving utilization of the existing resources e.g. processing and or memory of the client device.

The code of the system described herein and or related method provides new electronic communication session establishment features that do not have direct corresponding manual actions. For example the set of rules may be executed as a background process and or executed by an external server allowing the user to use the client device for execution of other programs while the attempt at establishment of the communication session is occurring simultaneously. Constant or intermittent intervention and or monitoring of the attempts by the user is not required allowing the user to attend to other applications. The set of rules define instructions to achieve a predefined desired communication result without requiring manual user intervention.

System includes a client device also referred to herein as a caller device for communicating with a callee client device also referred to herein as a callee device by establishing a communication session over a network via an interface of client device to a communication address of callee device .

Caller device and or callee device may be for example a mobile device a Smartphone a Tablet computer a wearable computer e.g. watch glasses a desktop computer a laptop or other device with communication capabilities. Network may be for example a landline telephone network a wireless telephone network a wireless data network the internet a private network and or combinations thereof.

Caller device includes or is in communication with a user interface for providing output and or accepting input for example a touchscreen a keyboard a mouse a camera and a display.

Caller device stores thereon or is in communication with one or more communication applications for establishment of the communication session for example a voice calling application a videoconferencing application a network calling application e.g. voice over IP a text messaging application an email application and an electronic chat application.

Communication sessions may be one or more of a voice phone call a network voice call a videoconference call an electronic message chat and exchanges of electronic messages e.g. email and text messages .

Optionally caller device stores thereon or is in communication with an electronic address book that stores contact members e.g. as electronic records optionally represented by icons with one or more related communication addresses for establishment of the communication session for example cellular phone number work phone number email address network calls electronic address and text message address. The contact members may be distributed and or shared with others for example with devices of other callees with electronic address books of other callee devices and or with a central server.

Caller device stores thereon or is in communication with a set of rules repository that defines a sequence of one or more subsequent attempts at establishing a communication session as described herein. Optionally a different set of rules is stored for different contact members of the electronic address book such as each member having an associated set of rules. Optionally the set of rules define additional communication addresses of the same contact for subsequent communication session establishment attempts. In this manner the code attempts to reach the same contact at a different address for example a different phone number. Alternatively or additionally the set of rules associated with the contact member define different communication addresses of other contact members different than the respective contact member for subsequent communication session establishment attempts. In this manner the code attempts to reach other contacts instead of the original contact for example family members friends and or coworkers of the contact.

Each set of rules may be stored as a field related to the address book contact entry and or mapped to the address book contact entry for example by accessing an interface of the address book application for example an application programming interface API . The set of rules may be defined as code written in text characters as compiled instructions or other representations.

Caller device stores thereon or is in communication with a program store storing code as described herein.

Caller device includes a processor coupled to interface electronic address book set of rules repository communication applications and program store .

At the set of rules is provided. Different sets of rules may be provided for different contacts such as contacts stored in the electronic address book . Alternatively the same set of rules may be provided for different contacts. Alternatively different sets of rules may be provided for the same contact.

The set of rules may be manually programmed by the user for example written in domain specific language and or generated using a compiler or parsing application that provides a graphical user interface. For example the set of rules may be a table of the attempts in the sequence allowing the user to fill in each entry using existing data and or manually entered data such as by links to electronic address book and available communication applications .

The set of rules may be downloaded from an external device for example from a client of another user or a server.

The set of rules may be automatically generated by code implementable by processor that analyzes social relations from a social network e.g. online social network from a family tree e.g. stored locally in a repository accessible on a online website and or derivable from an analysis of a social network webpage and or patterns in a history of actually dialed numbers e.g. stored locally in a dialing history log file . For example the code may analyze the dialing history of the caller to determine the 3 top contacts that the caller called. The generated set of rules may define the order of the 3 top callers based on frequency of attempted calls. In another example the code may analyze the social network webpage of the caller to identify 5 family members such as mother father spouse partner brother sister cousin and child. The generated set of rules may include the 5 identified family members in a predefined order.

The set of rules may be automatically generated by code implementable by processor that applies machine learning algorithms to identify a dialing pattern and or communication session establishment tries e.g. manual user actions performed when a previous attempt at establishment of a communication session fails. The code may analyze the manual user actions in real time as they are being performed e.g. via an API of the calling application and or analyze the manual user actions after they have been performed e.g. from a log file of historical call attempts . For example when no set of rules is related to a certain contact the user may manually try calling different numbers of the contact to reach the contact. The code learns the sequence of tries to automatically gather different callees and generate the set of rules according to the gathered callees. It is noted that multiple sets of rules may be learned for each contact. The code may automatically update an existing set of rules by analyzing a dialing pattern and or communication session establishment tries such as according to the manual user behavior. For example the code may perform a text analysis of messages which follow a call attempt for example to identify that the user sends an SMS message to the caller stating tried reaching you please call me back ASAP . In this example the code updates the set of rules to send the SMS message to the callee when a call attempt fails. Alternatively or additionally the code may automatically update a generated set of rules for example by appending a default attempt to execute at the end of the sequence i.e. the last entry in the sequence . Optionally the set of rules includes or is modified to include transmitting an electronic text message to one or more electronic message communication addresses of the contact member stored in the electronic address book for example I tried to reach you please call me back .

At a first attempt to establish the communication session is executed for example by the user manually selecting the contact member from electronic address book and optionally selecting the communication address. For example the user selects a contact member and phone number for attempting a phone call.

Alternatively the sequence of attempts is automatically triggered by code in response to a detected event for example based on manual user input based on sensor data and or based on data acquired by the code e.g. from an external server and or local data repository . For example the sequence is automatically triggered in response to the user manually pressing an emergency call button on the device and or external to the device and communicating with the device and a GPS module on the device detecting the location as being in unauthorized area for example inside a river.

Optionally the attempt proceeds as previous i.e. prior to installation of the set of rules and related code for example the relevant communication application accesses communication interface of caller device via network to try and reach callee device at a communication address. In such a case the code monitors the attempt for failure as described herein. Alternatively the attempt follows the set of rules such as when the contact member of electronic address book is mapped to the set of rules which define the first and subsequent communication session establishment attempts. In such a case the contact member details may not exist independently of the set of rules.

At the code detects failure of establishment of the communication session attempt. The failure may be defined by the set of rules for each contact member and or by a global set of rules default.

Optionally the code detects a failure to acquire a real time human response for example an immediate response e.g. by the callee answering the ringing phone call or a short delay response e.g. by the callee replying with a text message an email or by initiating a different communication session back to the caller such as within about 10 seconds within about 30 seconds within about 1 min and within about 5 minutes.

The failure may be identified for a voice based call based on for example one or more of a predefined number of unanswered telephone rings a busy signal a signal representing the callee is on another line a forward to a voicemail box and or an electronic indication that the callee is busy and or unavailable e.g. which may be accessed through an interface e.g. API related to the client device of the callee such as an online status .

The failure may be identified for an electronic text based session based on for example a predefined delay in receiving a response from the callee e.g. within the same chat session and or as a separate reply message such as an email and or an electronic indication that the callee is busy and or unavailable e.g. which may be accessed through an interface e.g. API related to the client device of the callee such as an online status showing for example away busy not online or unavailable .

At the code applies the set of rules e.g. from set of rules repository associated with the selected contact member to iteratively attempt by one or more attempts to establish a subsequent communication session.

Optionally the sequence is operated in response to a user selection made when the first contact in the sequence i.e. the selected contact of block is not responsive i.e. failure detection of block for example a popup with a button appearing when no answer tone is played and or the like. The user may manually select to execute the sequence. Alternatively the sequence is automatically executed. Alternatively the sequence is automatically executed when a condition is met for example a time of day a predefined user preference and the caller is in a predefined geographical location.

Optionally the code executes the relevant entry in the set of rules to attempt to establish the subsequent communication session to the one or more different communication addresses of the client device of the same selected contact member for example a different phone number. Alternatively the code executes the relevant entry in the set of rules associated with the selected contact member to attempt to establish the subsequent communication session to a communication address of a different contact member which may be defined in electronic address book to and or stored as part of the set of rules. It is noted that the stored address of the different contact member or a different address of the selectee contact member as part of the set of rules may not be directly accessible for selection as the first communication attempt.

Optionally the subsequent communication session is attempted using the same communication medium and or the same communication application as the previous attempt. The same medium may be used for example based on user preference and or communication ability of the medium. For example phone calls may be used to try to reach a living person. Alternatively the subsequent communication session is attempted using a different communication medium and or different communication application than the previous attempt. For example the initial attempt may be a phone call to a phone number and the subsequent attempt may be an electronic messaging session to an electronic message address. Different media may be used for example based on user preferences and or different availability of the callee. For example the callee may be in a meeting unable to answer a phone call but able to respond to a text message.

Optionally the code applies the set of rules to simultaneously attempt to establish multiple subsequent communication sessions optionally using different communication media and or different communication applications to multiple communication addresses of the same selected contact member. For example the mobile phone is called the home phone is called and a chat session are initiated simultaneously. The simultaneous attempts may occur for example instead of a sequence of single attempts. The simultaneous sessions may be executed for example to save time in trying to reach the selected contact.

Alternatively or additionally the code applies the set of rules to simultaneously attempt to establish a single subsequent communication session to multiple different contact members e.g. other than the selected contact via multiple communication addresses. The single communication session is attempted using the same communication medium and or the same communication application . For example the single communication session is a conference phone call made to phone numbers of multiple contacts and or a group electronic chat session using invitations sent to multiple electronic chat addresses of contact members. The set of rules may define cases in which less than all of the defined contacts have joined the communication session. For example the set of rules may define a minimum number of participants may define success of establishment of the session without further attempts to connect the other callees for example connect to at least 3 out of 5 contacts. In another example the set of rules may define replacements to attempt to connect to when first attempts at joining callees have failed for example if John cannot be connected to the conference call try connecting Jane.

Optionally the code applies the set of rules sequentially without introducing additional details between subsequent attempts. Alternatively the code delays execution of the subsequent attempt. The delay may be defined by the set of rules for each contact entry and or globally as a default. The delay may be the same or different between subsequent attempts for example wait 5 minutes wait 10 minutes wait 1 hour or wait 1 day.

Optionally the code applying the set of rules executes in a background of caller device for example as a minimized window. A different application and or process may simultaneously execute in a foreground of the client device for example as the major portion of the screen of the device. As following the set of rules may take time for example minutes or hours the client device may become available for execution of other applications in the meantime improving utilization of the existing resources e.g. processing and or memory of the client device.

Optionally at the code iteratively attempts to establish additional communication sessions defined by the relevant portion of the sequence of the set of rules when previous attempts at establishing communication sessions have failed.

Optionally the set of rules define the failure and or success of each communication session attempt. Alternatively or additionally the set of rules define the failure and or success for all attempts in the sequence. Alternatively or additionally the failure and or success is globally defined for example in a configuration file stored on the server and or locally on the client.

Optionally the code executing on the caller device and or server iteratively follows the sequence e.g. by repeating the sequence as described herein until a communication session is established with a callee. In such a manner the system helps ensure that the caller always reaches one of the contact callees even when a large number of attempts are required and or when the attempts take a long time. Optionally the code continues the iterative attempts until a human communication to session is established with any of the previous and or current callees for example by receiving an incoming session from one or more of the previous callees and or when one or more of the current and or previous callees answers the session attempt.

Optionally the code implementable by the processor of the client device repeats the sequence optionally from the beginning when the last entry in the set of rules defining the last communication attempt has failed. The repetition may be defined by each set of rules and or globally as a default. The iteration may be performed at the same rate as the initial set of rules and or including one or more details for example initiate after 10 minutes after an hour or after a day.

Alternatively to at the code terminates execution of execution of the set of rules. Termination may occur prematurely i.e. before the last step in the sequence defined by the set of rules or after the sequence has been completed.

The code may prematurely terminate the connection attempt during the attempt itself. Alternatively the code may prematurely terminate the sequence after the current attempt has failed and or before the next attempt has initiated.

Optionally the code prematurely terminates the execution when a response is simultaneously during the attempt being received from a contact member and or contact address that has previously been attempted and failed for example a contact member returning a phone call by initiating a new phone call while the code is attempting another phone call according to the set of rules. The code determines the origination address and or origination contact member of the new incoming communication session to determine whether to terminate the current execution of the attempt. Optionally the code establishes a new communication session by accepting the incoming simultaneous communication session. In this manner returning phone calls are automatically answered.

Optionally when the sequence has been completed without successfully establishing the communication session and when there are no instructions to repeat the sequence the user is notified for example the user is provided with a busy signal with a pop up message or with an audio message.

Optionally at the communication session has been successfully established with the callee in the current communication attempt. The communication session is established as defined by communication address contact member communication medium and or communication application as defined by the set of rules.

Optionally the code analyses the sequence of failed attempts in an effort to try and improve the efficiency of the sequence for example reducing the number of failed attempts and or reducing the time to connect to a callee. The code may analyze the sequence of failed attempts in real time e.g. via an API of the communication applications and or analyze a log file storing details of the history of the attempts. The code may analyze the sequence of failed attempts in isolation and or in view of other sequences from other attempts e.g. previous attempts of the caller . The code may adapt the set of rules based on the analysis. For example the code may change the set of rules to change the sequence to include the first communication session attempt to be made to the contact and or address which results in establishment of the session. For example the code may change the set of rules to reduce the number of dialing tries for each failed attempt for example from 8 rings to 3 rings.

Optionally the user is notified of the success of the establishment for example by returning the executing code to the foreground of the device e.g. major display on the screen by an electronic message e.g. flashing light displayed message and or audio sound e.g. beep or voice of callee is projected through a speaker .

Reference is now also made to which is a block diagram of another system for establishing a communication session between a caller device and a callee device according to a set of rules in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. System includes a server in communication with the caller device and the callee device the server executes the connection establishment attempts and routes the connection upon successful establishment back to the caller device. In this manner resources e.g. processor network bandwidth communication interface channel and or memory which perform the attempts are freed up at the caller device the functions being taken up by the server which improves performance of the caller device as the freed up resources are available for other users.

System includes a server in communication with one or more caller client devices one is illustrated for clarity and one or more callee client devices one is illustrated for clarity via a network . Server is external to devices and devices . It is noted that each device and or may act as both a caller and a callee.

Optionally server includes a first interface A for communicating with caller devices and a second interface B for communicating with callee devices . It is noted that interfaces A and B may be the same interface. Alternatively a single interface communicates with both caller and callee devices.

Server has stored thereon and or is in communication with a program store storing code as described herein.

Server includes a processor coupled to first interface A second interface B and program store for implementing the stored code.

Optionally server has stored thereon or is in communication with a set of rules repository that stores sets of rules transmitted by callee devices and or caller devices for storage within repository . Each set of rules may be associated with a communication address or other contact member representation of the callee device and or caller for execution when another set of rules is executed by server as described herein and exemplified below. In this manner one set of rules may trigger execution of another set of rules such as in a nested manner in a sequential manner and or in an iterative manner. For example a first set of rules transmitted by caller device is executed by server . The first set of rules defines calling callee device which is associated with a second set of rules stored within repository . As such server in trying to establish the communication session with callee device now executes the second set of rules stored in repository which may have been provided by callee device .

Components of caller device have been discussed with reference to caller device of . It is noted that the code stored in program store for executing the set of rules associated with a selected respective contact is not necessarily present. Instead program store may include code for communicating with server which executes the attempts to establish the communication session as described herein.

Optionally code stored in program store of caller device implementable by processor automatically performs one or more of the following functions 

Sever may provide a user experience to the user of the caller device that is similar to making a standard phone call. The user may dial a phone number in a manner that is similar to making the standard phone call for example selecting an icon of a contact member from the electronic address book using a graphical user interface of the caller device as described herein. Dialing i.e. selecting the contact member triggers transmission of the set of rules to the server for execution of the attempts at establishment of the communication session. The server follows the set of rules to attempt to obtain a dialing signal or an answered call with a phone of one of the callees and routes the session back to the caller. The user of the caller device after dialing the contact member now hears the dialing signal or is connected to the phone of the one of the callees defined by the set of rules that the server was able to reach. In this manner the user dials i.e. selects a single item e.g. icon single contact member group icon and is automatically connected to one of multiple callee devices as defined by the set of rules or optionally provided with a busy signal or other notification when none of the callees were reached instead of for example manually dialing each of the different numbers of the callees. The server provides for the seamless user experience based on existing phone calling procedures of the user dialing a single item and then directly being connected to one of the callee devices.

System may execute the method of . Details of the method as performed by system such as blocks executed by the server are now described.

At code implementable by the processor of the server receives from one or more of caller devices an electronic message including a set of rules associated with a callee. The set of rules define a sequence of one or more subsequent attempts at establishing a communication session with the callee or subsequently other contacts to respective communication addresses as described herein.

The electronic message may include the communication addresses of each callee defined by the set of rules. The electronic message may include sufficient instructions and or data for independent execution by server .

Server may simultaneously apply multiple sets of rules from different caller devices to different callee devices .

Resources of the caller device sending the electronic message are freed up i.e. as server applies the set of rules to execute the attempts using its local resources instead of device becoming available for other uses such as local execution of other processes and or applications.

At the code on the server applies the set of rules to attempt to establish the subsequent communication session with callee device via the interface using network when the previous session fails and optionally attempts additional sessions as defined by the sequence of the set of rules when earlier attempts have failed as described herein.

It is noted that server may retrieve and execute a second set of rules from repository such as when such second set of rules is associated with the communication address of callee device defined by first set of rules . Instead of attempting the communication address defined by set of rules server follows the second set of rules mapped to the communication address.

It is noted that alternatively the electronic message may be transmitted from the caller device s to server after the first failure detection to apply the set of rules for subsequent attempts.

At when the communication session has been successfully established the code implementable by the processor of sever routes the established communication session back to the respective caller device to allow communication between caller device and callee device .

Optionally the communication session is established when the code identifies a ring tone to the phone of the callee. The caller device may be connected in the ring tone state even before the callee answers. In this manner the user may select the number of rings to wait. Alternatively the communication session is established when the code identifies a voicemail box of the phone of the callee. The caller device may be connected in time to leave a voice message to the callee. Alternatively the communication session is established when the code identifies that the callee has answered the phone call.

Optionally the communication session fails when the code identifies one or more of a busy signal a signal representing the callee being on another line a signal representing the callee device is off a signal representing the callee device is unavailable e.g. electronic status and a signal representing a forward to voicemail. The definition of the failure to establish the session may be predefined and or configurable globally and or for each set of rules.

Reference is now made to which are some not necessarily limiting examples of sets of rules as described herein in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. For clarity and simplicity the sets of rules are represented as a table however as described herein such a representation is not necessarily limiting as the sets of rules may be represented in other format for example as a flowchart as text based code organized into a script and or other instruction formats. Data storage formats may include for example objects records a text file compiled code arrays or other suitable formats. It is noted that may represent electronic messages transmitted by the caller device to the server for execution by the server for example as discussed herein.

The table may be filled in by a user using a graphical user interface which may then be parsed to generate the set of rules for execution manually written by the user and or automatically generated by software code.

It is noted that some fields are optional for example contact name description details of application and or delay before attempting. When some fields are empty for example details of application default values may be used. Some fields may be inserted for the human user to make the table more readable for example description. Some fields may be inserted as a mapping to the electronic address book for example contact name may map to the contact entry in the electronic address book.

The set of rules may be mapped to the John Smith entry in the electronic address book which may be a pre existing entry independent of the set of rules.

The set of rules may be mapped to an entry created in the electronic address book representing the whole sequence for example family.

It is noted that the time of day may be retrieved by the code for example by accessing an external time server and or by querying the local operating system for the current time.

It is noted that the geographical location of the caller may be retrieved by the code from an output of a GPS module of the caller device. The geographical locations of the friends may be stored as address fields in the electronic address book.

It is noted that one set of rules may trigger execution of another set of rules as described herein. For example a server e.g. executing the set of rules of executes attempt 1 which includes instructions to call mother. Instead of dialing the mobile number 1212121 the server retrieves from the set of rules repository e.g. a second set of rules defined for mother and or mobile number 1212121 e.g. transmitted from the mobile device of the mother for storage in repository . In the example the second set of rules is defined by . Therefore server now executes second set of rules and attempts to call mother following attempt 1 of which when fails calls son at 2222222. As such the caller may be connected to son.

For example purposes an electronic address book which may correspond to electronic address book includes entries of contact members A E. Mappings between the entries of address book and sets of rules stored in repository are described which may correspond to set of rules repository .

Contact member B to set of rules B and set of rules B. In such a case the same contact entry is mapped to two or more different sets of rules. The particular set of rules to apply may be selected for example manually by a user e.g. via a graphical user interface and or automatically by software according to additional rules which may be associated with each set of rules such as time of day geographical location and other factors.

Contact member D to set of rules A. In such a case both contact members A and D map to the same set of rules for example different contact entries of co workers may be mapped to the same set of rules that define contacting the same supervisor of the co workers.

It is noted that the set of rules associated with each contact member may be transmitted to the server e.g. as shown in and discussed herein for execution upon selection of the contact member by the user e.g. the user pressing an icon representing the contact member using a graphical user interface for example as an electronic message over a network e.g. as described herein . Alternatively the set of rules may be locally executed by the client for example as described herein.

Attempt 3 maps to both contact members B and C of address book i.e. to attempt a simultaneous session .

As such contacts Q S are not defined by address book and attempts to establish connections are not directly available to the user i.e. as a first attempt . Attempts to establish sessions with contacts Q S are sequentially executed when the attempt to establish the session with contact member A fails.
