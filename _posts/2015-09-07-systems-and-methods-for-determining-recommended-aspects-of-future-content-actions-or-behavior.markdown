This application is a continuation in part CIP application of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 471 851 filed on Aug. 28 2014 now granted as U.S. Pat. No. 9 129 027 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Many people use the internet every day. Some use it to discover information such as news recipes phone numbers etc. Some use the internet to communicate with others through mediums such as chat rooms message boards and e mail. Traffic on the internet is large and many people use the internet for extended amounts of time.

Users of the internet may also use the internet to such a degree that advertisers can effectively market goods and services to customers or potential customers using the internet. For example a host or administrator of a website may place advertisements on popular pages of their website. Such advertisements may be related to other parts of the website or goods that can be purchased that are related to the website. In another example such advertisements can be unrelated to the website. For example the website host or administrator may sell space to advertise on and within the website to third parties much like a billboard might sell or lease ad space to third parties who would like passersby to see the advertisement.

Described herein are illustrative embodiments for methods and systems that provide for quantifying social audience activation through search and comparison of custom author groupings. In an illustrative embodiment a user of the system may enter a search criteria that specifies a custom author crowd. The search criteria may specify various demographic information related to authors posts created by authors preferences of authors temporal considerations when did an author do something or other various search criteria as disclosed herein. The user may also be able to enter multiple search criteria to specify define and or search for a custom author crowd.

As disclosed herein a user is generally referred to as a user of the disclosed system and methods while an author is generally referred to as any user of social media. Whether the author actually authors posts is irrelevant to their categorization as an author. For example an author as defined here may never actually author a post but may interact on social media in other ways. In short a distinction is made in the present application between a user of the disclosed system the user and a user of social media an author . The terminology used throughout the present application is not meant to limit the activity of an author or user or to prevent an author from also being a user or vice versa. Rather the terminology is merely used to provide clarity and distinguish between users and authors. A user generally refers to a person using the systems and methods disclosed herein while an author generally refers to a person using a website social network application software apps etc. including applications for mobile phones smart phones tablets personal data assistants PDA s laptops desktop computers etc. In other words the system and methods disclosed herein may be used across one or more platforms and mediums including social networks websites mobile phone apps and the like.

Once a crowd has been defined by a user that crowd can be stored analyzed and or tracked for various fluctuations within the crowd based on the authors in the crowd s behavior after the crowd has been defined. Many examples of fluctuations that may be determined by the system are disclosed herein and are not meant to limit the possible fluctuations that may be tracked analyzed and or determined. In one illustrative embodiment a custom crowd may be initially defined by searching for authors who have authored a social media post within the past three months about any type of carbonated soft drink. Such a search may include search for different types and brands of carbonated soft drinks in social media posts. Whoever authored those posts would then be included in the custom author crowd.

A user of the system and methods disclosed herein may be different persons or entities. For example a user may be an advertiser or agent staffer of the advertiser who wishes to search for and create custom author crowds to track effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. In another example the user may be a social network or agent staffer of the social network who wishes to search for and create custom author crowds. A social network may wish to use custom author crowds for a variety of purposes. For example the social network may wish to track their own advertising campaigns or advertising campaigns of those who use the social network to advertise. In the latter example tracking others advertising campaigns on the social network may allow the social network to better promote the effectiveness of advertising on their social network and thereby increase advertisement spending on their social network. In another example the social network or an agent staffer of the network may perform searching for and tracking of custom author crowds on behalf of a separate advertising entity. In this situation the advertiser may or may not dictate how the searching and tracking should be done by the social network. When the searching and tracking is not dictated by the advertiser the social network may be offering the searching and tracking services as part of advertisement services paid for by the advertiser. In another example the searching and tracking may be provided by the social network to advertisers. In this example the advertiser may be the user of the system. Furthermore a social network in this example may exert some control over how the searching and tracking is accomplished. For example the social network may limit the number or type of authors the advertiser can search for. In another example the social network may limit the number of custom author crowds the advertiser can search for or save for tracking. The social network could also limit the total number of authors searched for and or tracked by an advertiser. The social network could also limit the number of authors allowed in each custom author group tracked by the advertiser.

In other examples the system and methods disclosed herein may operate across multiple mediums and platforms such as websites social media networks and or mobile apps. For example an advertiser may want to define a custom author crowd by performing searches of Facebook authors. The advertiser may also wish to find the same authors they already found on Facebook on another medium. Examples of other mediums may include a Dictionary.com mobile app a user of ESPN Fantasy Football services or individuals with an account on an online shopping website such as Amazon . The advertiser may have a particular rationale for discovering or finding users on other mediums as well. For example the advertiser may operate the mobile app Uber which offers taxi like services. Uber may wish to identify authors that use a mobile app that allows tracking of city buses or other transportation related apps. In a further example Uber may wish to identify authors that use any sort of road navigation app such as Google Maps. One possible implementation may be to market to those who use such navigation or transportation apps whenever there are a surplus of Uber drivers in a certain town or area. The system may even be able to identify when a particular app is actively being used. In this scenario an author may be using a navigation app such as a city bus tracker app during a time when there is a surplus of Uber drivers. The system may identify the authors actively using the bus tracker app and market Uber to those authors. The identification could happen automatically and marketing may happen automatically as predefined by a user. In another embodiment the identification of surplus drivers and potential market for those drivers may occur automatically and the marketing may be executed manually. In a third embodiment all steps may be performed manually by a user. In these examples an app developer may be able to open up their author database to a broader cross platform activation system that may be tapped into by advertisers and other entities. The advertisers may target users on apps or platforms they do business on or perform other relevant cross platform marketing and targeting.

Next a baseline magnitude may be determined using a fluctuation criteria. For example within the custom author crowd the fluctuation criteria may be set as root beer. In this embodiment any author in the custom crowd that has authored a post about root beer in the past three months that is whoever has previously posted about root beer in the set amount of time before the custom crowd is created or specified is a part of the baseline magnitude used to calculate a fluctuation. A group of users that are a part of the baseline magnitude may be considered to be a part of a community that enjoys root beer within the custom author crowd. Fluctuation criteria may also have the same parameters as the initial search criteria.

Once the custom author crowd has been specified and a baseline magnitude is determined using a fluctuation criteria the system may monitor the custom author crowd in order to determine a fluctuation of the custom author crowd if authors in the custom author crowd author content or engage in a behavior that is related to the fluctuation criteria. For example an author that previously had not posted about root beer or previously been considered part of a community that enjoys root beer may author an online social media posting regarding their experience trying root beer for the first time and enjoying it. The system may determine a fluctuation in the custom author crowd based on the online social media posting. That is the community of those who enjoy root beer within the custom author crowd has fluctuated upward. In other embodiments the system may determine a downward fluctuation. For example an author may leave an affinity group for root beer hosted by a social media website which may indicate a downward fluctuation and that the author has left the community of those who enjoy root beer. In another example a system may determine that an author s failure to author content about root beer over a certain time period is a downward fluctuation and that the author has left the community of those that enjoy root beer. In an illustrative embodiment the system is monitoring a plurality of authors in a custom author crowd for overall fluctuations based on a fluctuation criteria. That is the system can determine how many authors in the custom author crowd have joined and or left a community defined by the fluctuation criteria.

In an illustrative embodiment multiple fluctuation criteria may be used with the same custom author crowd. In this example a custom author crowd may be watched for fluctuations in multiple types of things. For example a custom author crowd may be watched in regards to root beer as in the preceding example and the custom author crowd may also be watched in regards to orange juice. In this example the additional fluctuation criteria may also be used to establish a baseline community of those authors in the custom author crowd who have authored content indicating a positive emotion toward orange juice. Multiple fluctuation criteria used for the same custom author crowd may or may not be related to each other. In this example the two fluctuation criteria are related to each other as both of them are beverages. Similarly in other embodiments whenever there are multiple fluctuation criteria used the multiple fluctuation criteria may be part of a common fluctuation criteria type e.g. beverages as in the previous example .

In another illustrative embodiment a user may specify more than one custom author crowd. Multiple custom author crowds may have at least one different author from each other. In some examples different custom author crowds may have one or more authors in common. In other examples different custom author crowds may be mutually exclusive and not have any authors in common. Each of the custom author crowds can be monitored for fluctuations based on fluctuation criteria similar to the examples disclosed herein. Where different custom author crowds are monitored based on the same fluctuation criteria the system can determine a fluctuation for multiple custom author crowds based on that same fluctuation criteria. In an illustrative embodiment the baseline determined using the fluctuation criteria and the fluctuations determined for the custom author crowds can be compared to each other. In this way a difference in fluctuations called a fluctuation magnitude difference may be determined as between the multiple custom author crowds. Returning to the root beer example the multiple custom author crowds may all be the target of an advertisement for root beer or may receive a promotional coupon for root beer. The custom author crowds may then be monitored to determine how and when the fluctuations of the custom author crowds change based on the advertisement or coupon. In some embodiments one custom author crowd may have a different fluctuation than another custom author crowd. The resulting fluctuation magnitude difference in the crowds may indicate to a user the relative effectiveness of the advertisement or coupon on a particular custom author crowd.

In addition to comparing multiple custom author crowds to each other to track performance and return on investment for advertising and other author engagement a custom author crowd may also be compared to a pre defined or curated social community following or fan base. In other words a custom author crowd may be compared to another crowd that serves as a baseline or other reference point for the custom author crowd. A pre defined or curated social community may be all the authors on a social media web site or may be all the authors the system has access to. A pre defined or curated social community may also consist of a list of current paying customers or former customers followers or fan bases of the user s social media accounts at a given point in time followers or fan bases of specific competitors social media accounts or other stakeholders social media accounts pre existing whitelists of authors who have or are thought to have certain characteristics influencer lists custom audiences that may have been generated procured targeted or otherwise leveraged in other marketing or advertising campaigns or any other applicable user listing. Another pre defined or curated social community may be determined similar to a custom crowd by searching based on demographics posts etc. but may be saved in the system perpetually and thus is characterized as a baseline pre defined social community.

Advantageously the system provides the ability to effectively interrelate paid audiences the targets of advertising paid sponsored content and owned audiences those authors who already follow a company product brand account such as a Twitter account and are members of the company product brand s community . To this end the system can show after an advertising campaign that more of the authors in a targeted crowd have joined the following by following the company product brand Twitter account for example . This can be referred to as a crowd penetration metric. One by one the system can show authors in a custom author crowd being captured. Advantageously when an author follows a brand s Twitter account the author is more likely to see unsponsored content posted on the brand s account. This is helpful because the unsponsored content is essentially free to post. Thus by keeping track of how many authors the brand has captured it can also keep track of the relative effectiveness of their unsponsored content as well.

In other illustrative embodiments multiple custom author crowds may be monitored for various and different fluctuation criteria as desired by a user. For example a user may designate one fluctuation criteria as Brand A Root Beer and may designate a second fluctuation criteria as Brand B Root Beer. Both fluctuation criteria may be applied to the same custom author crowd. Accordingly the custom author crowd may be monitored to determine not only how the custom author crowd is fluctuating in its sentiments toward Brand A Root Beer but also how the custom author crowd s sentiment is fluctuating with regard to Brand B Root Beer. This may be useful if Brand A Root Beer and Brand B Root Beer are competitors for the same customers. Similarly the multiple fluctuation criteria Brand A and Brand B may be applied to multiple custom author crowds. Multiple custom author crowds may be selected on the basis of demographics behavioral tendencies lifestyle indicators or other specific market segmentation criteria thus allowing a user to monitor and compare how fluctuations regarding Brand A and Brand B root beers are changing in particular demographic groups or target market segments.

In an illustrative embodiment the search criteria that specifies a custom author crowd may include multiple criteria of varying types. For example the search criteria may include authors in the custom author crowd who have authored a social media post about cheese and who live in the state of Wisconsin. In another example the search criteria may include authors in the custom author crowd who have liked a particular celebrity or joined an affinity group for a particular celebrity such as Harry Houdini and authored a social media post about magic within the last 6 months. In another example the search criteria may include authors in the custom author crowd who have purchased tea online in the last year and live in or around Boston Mass. In another example the search criteria may include authors in the custom author crowd who have authored a post on social media about their cell phone provider and who have authored a post on social media about their subscription to pay television within the last year.

In an illustrative embodiment multiple custom author crowds may be specified and stored utilizing systems and methods disclosed herein. In this embodiment two different custom author crowds may include common authors. In one embodiment no action is taken by the system with regards to the common authors. That is the common authors are left in both custom author crowds. In an alternative embodiment the system automatically identifies that the two custom author crowds both include at least one common author. In one embodiment the system may present a user with a choice to remove the common author from one of the custom author crowds. In another embodiment the system may automatically remove the common author from one of the custom author crowds. For example the system may automatically remove the common author from the larger of the two custom author crowds. In another example the system may automatically remove the common author from the custom author crowd that was specified later in time as opposed to the first custom author crowd. In another example the system may automatically detect when an author in one custom crowd joins another custom author crowd specified by the user. This may include custom author crowds defined by the parameters described herein a specific social fan base etc. It should also be noted that the ability of the system to detect the presence or absence of an author or authors in one or more crowds may not be limited to one social networking site. In one example the system may automatically detect when an author joins or leaves a crowd on social networking site A and social networking site B. This may help aid the user in making a determination that it may be more effective to target this author or group of authors with different messages on different social platforms.

When determining a fluctuation within a custom author crowd various methods and systems may be used. In an illustrative embodiment content generated by the authors that causes the system to measure a fluctuation may include a status update. For example an author may post a status update on a social networking site. The status update may include text image audio file video symbols and or universal resource identifiers URIs that comprise a fluctuation criteria. That is the author s status update may include text or a URI the system is looking for to measure a fluctuation. In another embodiment the fluctuation criteria monitored for and measured may be an online purchase of a good or service. Another fluctuation criteria may be signing up for an account with a web site or web service. Another fluctuation criteria may be selecting a URI or selecting a URI sent to an author through a messaging service or e mail. Another fluctuation criteria may be viewing a particular webpage or viewing a particular webpage for a certain amount of time. Another fluctuation criteria may be authoring a social media post or posts including a particular text image video audio file symbol or URI more than once or any other predetermined number of times. Another fluctuation criteria may be authoring multiple social media posts that contain a particular text or URI that are related. For example the fluctuation criteria may cause the system to monitor for and measure a number of authors who post about peanut butter and jelly. Another fluctuation criteria may be joining a particular affinity group or liking a particular fan page for an item brand celebrity sports team interest etc. Other potential fluctuation criteria may include following another author retweeting and or sharing a post from another author liking an author commenting on the posts of other authors or interacting with another author who is also a member of the same custom author crowd. Fluctuation criteria could also be an interaction with a posted or promoted post authored by the user of the system. In other words if an advertiser posts sponsored content the fluctuation criteria may be designed to measure how a custom author crowd interacts with and based on that sponsored content. This can help inform or alert the user to authors subsequent activity to a user action or interaction. Another fluctuation criteria may involve images or characteristics of images including image sequences such as videos such as a certain image style of an image item or product in the image text or signs in an image or appended to an image person in the image number of people in the image age of people in the image geographic locations of where the image was captured lighting levels of the image whether the image was indoor or outdoor time an image was originally captured food in an image resolution of an image style of an image i.e. selfie landscape panoramic portrait square filter type video or still etc. duration of an image sequence or video duration of a particular individual or object s presence in an image sequence or video text or hyperlinks that appear in a video or are appended to a video or any other characteristic of an image image sequence or content of an image. In using such fluctuation criteria for an image the system may utilize photo analysis software such as facial recognition image recognition metadata reading or other analysis on images that are searched. These and other related fluctuation criteria may also be applied to video content and or other rich media. Other fluctuation criteria could also take into account the user s activity over a certain time period with respect to desired fluctuation criteria in the custom author crowd. In other words the system may enable the user to determine the total behaviors postings or promoted messages that were directed to each custom author crowd as a proportion of the user s total outreach efforts and the resulting viewership and interactions made by authors with that user s content as a proportion of the total interactions made by the custom author crowd during a specific time period. These fluctuation criteria may provide signals related to the efficiency of the user s messages and strategy to reach and engage each custom author crowd as well as signals related the mindshare or brand awareness the user possesses within a custom author crowd.

In an illustrative embodiment the system may be configured to send out alerts based on the tracked fluctuations of custom author groups. For example if a fluctuation meets a certain magnitude an alert may be sent to a user. In just one example 10 of a custom author group may meet the fluctuation criteria and an alert may be sent. The 10 that meet the fluctuation criteria may be a total of the custom author group or may be an additional 10 beyond those in the custom author group that had already met the fluctuation criteria in other words were already a part of the community when the custom author group was created. Additional alerts may be subsequently sent out when other predetermined thresholds are met. Thresholds may be other varying numbers than the example 10 . Additionally discrete numbers may be used instead of percentages. For example alerts may be sent out for every 1 000 authors who meet the fluctuation criteria. Aggregations of these alerts and other real time performance measures may be viewable to the user in the system.

In another illustrative embodiment alerts may also be sent out based on fluctuation magnitude differences between multiple custom author groups. For example the system may encourage a race between multiple custom author groups to meet fluctuation criteria. For example a user may define two custom author groups that have different authors. The two custom author groups may be assigned to different marketing teams to target. The same fluctuation criteria may be measured for each of the custom author groups. In this way the marketing teams could compete at getting their respective custom author groups to meet the fluctuation criteria. Alerts may be sent when custom author groups hit certain predetermined thresholds of meeting fluctuation criteria similar to the embodiments described above. In another embodiment alerts may be sent out when one custom author group surpasses another custom author group in number of authors that meet the fluctuation criteria. In this way the marketing teams or other users would know who is in the lead for marketing success and would know in real time when they had surpassed another group. Advantageously this may incentivize marketers or other users to do a better job when reaching out to engaging and marketing to the various authors in the custom author groups.

In another illustrative embodiment alerts may be sent out regarding negative fluctuations. For example if in a custom author crowd a predetermined number of authors disassociate themselves with an affinity group an alert may be sent to a user to indicate a negative fluctuation. Similarly in another example the system may sense negative language toward a product person etc. in a post authored by someone in the custom author crowd. These alerts may be triggered by activities of a custom author crowd that take place on multiple social networking sites websites or apps.

In another illustrative embodiment alerts may be sent out based on temporal factors. For example an alert on the progress of fluctuation criteria for a custom author crowd may be sent out every two weeks regardless of whether any predetermined threshold is met. In another embodiment an alert may be sent out if a predetermined threshold for fluctuation is met within a certain time period. For example if the fluctuation of a custom author crowd based on a particular fluctuation criteria reaches 3 in one month an alert may be sent out.

In another illustrative embodiment the system may be configured to alert the user when certain thresholds are met in relation to his or her own outreach efforts that may or may not be directed at specific custom author crowds. For example the user may want to know when he has attained 10 mindshare within a specific custom author crowd or when he has achieved 95 awareness in a custom author crowd. In other example the user may want to know when his organic marketing program is at peak efficiency whereby the timing and frequency of his postings elicits the best response rate or desired fluctuation criteria within a custom author crowd.

In another illustrative embodiment the system may be configured to alert the user when an author of particular importance engages in certain online activities or authors a post with certain words images videos audio files symbols and or URIs. For example a user may want to know if a famous celebrity authors a post about a user s product. In one specific example an under the weather President of the United States may tweet positively about the efficacy of a particular brand of facial tissue. The brand manager of that particular brand of facial tissue may wish to be alerted that such a high profile individual is evacuating his or her nasal cavities upon their particular brand of paper handkerchiefs. The system can alert the brand manager thusly. The brand manager may then choose to promote such a post using the system or take other action based on the alert stemming from the President s now famous nasal mucus.

Alerts and other monitoring of fluctuation criteria may also be done in real time or near real time. This would allow users to immediately know when thresholds for fluctuation criteria are met. In other terminology a user may immediately be notified when a certain number of authors from social media sites have been activated or join a community based on their authored posts or other online actions. Advantageously alerts and other real time notifications may trigger increased advertisement spending overall as advertisers are able to better capitalize on trends and current states of engagement from authors. It may even be the case that entire marketing or advertising programs are based off of notification to these fluctuation criteria.

In another illustrative embodiment the fluctuation criteria may be used to track performance or success of a rival. For example if someone sells a particular type of electric car they may wish to know how many of their targeted custom author grouping is interested in other brands of electric cars or even gasoline cars. Accordingly a user may set fluctuation criteria related to a competitor product as well as their own. In another embodiment the seller of electric cars may set a fluctuation criteria to monitor and track authors in the custom author group who author or engage with content relating to all cars. In this way the seller may be able to determine a proportion of those authoring content about cars generally that are interested in electric cars or are interested particularly in the seller s type of electric cars. In this way users may determine subsets of custom author crowds. Advantageously the subsets can be dynamic as they can be set to track the fluctuations of the custom author crowd in any of the ways disclosed herein. In another illustrative embodiment this subset can be treated as a separate custom author crowd. In other words the definition of a custom author crowd may be analogous to a fluctuation criteria. In this way a custom author crowd may only include for example any author that has posted something about a car within the last year. If an author originally is considered part of the custom author crowd but a year goes by without that author having again posted something about a car that author may be removed from the custom author crowd.

In another illustrative embodiment the fluctuation criteria and activation of users in a custom author crowd can be used to trigger the publication or use of content such as advertising. For example the system may automatically post an advertisement that is viewable to the custom author crowd when that custom author crowd reaches a particular fluctuation criteria. In just one specific example when at least 15 percent of authors in a custom author crowd have authored a post on social media about football the system may automatically publish an online advertisement to that custom author crowd for a paid television subscription service that offers football programming. In another embodiment the 15 threshold being met in the custom author crowd may also trigger advertisements for other custom author crowds about football programming or may trigger advertisements for all authors about football programming. In another illustrative embodiment the automatically published advertisement may only be published for the authors who have authored a post about football. The automatically published advertisements may come in many various forms. The advertisements may be through sponsored content on a news or pseudo news website may be native ads or editorial content on a social networking site or other web property may be a standard banner advertisement may be recommended and sponsored content on a shopping website may be an e mail may be a paper mail advertisement may be a sponsored video may be a video featuring a product product placement or subliminal advertising or any other type of advertising. In another embodiment the promoted content may be a post of one of the authors. For example if an author posts a favorable comment about the aforementioned paid television subscription service that offers football programming that post may be promoted. Promoting such a post may involve prioritizing the post for other social media users and authors so that it is seen more often than another post.

In another embodiment the system may not execute the paid advertisement or unsponsored posting on the user s behalf. Instead when the fluctuation criteria are met the system may signal an opportunity or recommend that the user engage in a certain behavior or publish content to capitalize on the favorable conditions within the custom author crowd. In such an example execution of these actions may be facilitated by sending the fluctuation criteria and other data from the disclosed system into another software application or set of software applications via a customizable application program interface API . Examples of integrated software applications may include but are not intended to be limited to a social media management system a social media publishing or engagement platform a programmatic advertising platform a real time bidding RTB platform a demand side platform DSP a supply side platform SSP an advertising exchange a content management system a community platform a marketing automation system or any other data management analysis and optimization web Internet or marketing technology platform. In other words the system disclosed herein may be an enabler of other functions. For example the execution of advertising and marketing campaigns may not be done directly via the present system. That is it may be the case that this system leverages an API that plugs into well established social media management systems like HootSuite that offer post scheduling and publishing functionality. The system may also send data into programmatic ad platforms. In another example the user could be presented with an example post or a pre written post to publish based on the opportunity. In yet another example the user could author their own post or advertisement based on the opportunity. In another embodiment the user may be able to start a process to publish a post or advertisement but the post or advertisement may have to be approved by another party before it is posted. For example if the user is a marketing agency the agency s client may approve the post or advertisement. In another example the post or advertisement may be approved by the social networking website where the post or advertisement will be published.

In another embodiment the system may be utilized by users to support forecasting activities. That is the activation history of one or more crowds with the system may be leveraged in conjunction with planning exercises of the user and or to help predict when certain crowds or crowd members will engage in certain behaviors or post certain types of content on a particular medium. Such trend data and other variability measures may be helpful when planning campaigns that may span multiple online platforms or even promote offline sales. In an illustrative embodiment the user may want to know how many authors have been activated about root beer in Milwaukee and the rate at which this fluctuation criteria was met over the last year. The user may then leverage this data and other measurements to predict how many authors may be activated at a later time to plan his or her advertisement or engagement campaigns accordingly. In another example if the fluctuation criteria deals with new product availability in store the user may leverage this data to inform demand planning and the stocking of merchandise at retail stores within the most activated geographic regions. In that way crowd activity may help optimize inventory levels and allow the user to better react to shifts in product or service demand.

Advantageously the systems and methods disclosed herein allow social networks websites owners and operators of application software apps and other content publishers to monetize their user bases and monetize their user bases more effectively. In other words the system and method disclosed herein allows a social network to easily track how advertisement and other targeted content or actions are affecting their user base. Armed with the quantifiable and objective information of how well targeted content and advertising is received and reacted to by a social network user base a social network can charge higher prices to advertisers that utilize the social network for advertising or promoting content. A social network may also be able to charge higher prices to advertising customers based on the set of crowd attributes specified by the user or by the number of concurrent custom author crowds that are searched targeted and tracked by the user. The customization of the systems and methods disclosed herein also offers a significant advantage. The system creates the opportunity for the social network to create a new economy around their inventory i.e. their authors where the network may define new ways in which to bid up the most sought after or niche prospective crowds. It can be an exchange where the economy is based on expression and action and it may cost advertisers more to reach the best authors or crowd segments in the highest demand.

Advantageously the system functionality described herein may help social networks and other content publishers surface important new paid and organic marketing opportunities for their advertisers as well as valuable remarketing opportunities for advertisers to target the same crowd again with a new message at a certain time. Furthermore another advantage of this system may be the improvement of the social networks own user experience through better native advertising and more relevant ads. The provision of these and other benefits may help attract new advertisers or retain existing advertisers. The system may also increase the size and frequency of ad buys and incentivize the perpetuation of spend among current advertising customers. Performance metrics that may be generated by the system related to the activities of a custom author crowd and the user may provide deeper context around campaign engagement. Such insights that may be both qualitative and quantitative in nature may enrich the return on investment that a social network is capable of demonstrating to a prospective advertiser and thusly differentiate that social network s ad products from those of other social networks. That is a social network using the system and methods described herein may be at an advantage in securing greater advertising spend or share of wallet due to the richness and effectiveness of the advertising experience provided.

Advantageously the system may also interrelate success within the curated social communities and target custom author crowds of the user. In other words the system may be able to drive and illustrate valuable social media community growth for the advertisers showing that he or she is capturing the attention and hearts of more of the users he cares about through various programs and initiatives. This advantage also applies to other user lists described elsewhere in the present application that may include current customers competitors fan bases influencers etc.

Another advantage of the system and method disclosed herein can be exploited by brands and brand managers as well as by their advertising agencies. Similar to how social networks may exploit the systems and methods disclosed herein brand managers and other marketers may be able to cause maintained or increased spending in advertisements with the objective and quantifiable information that can be provided by the system and methods disclosed herein. This advantage is important because other forms of tracking the effectiveness of advertising such as counting the number of clicks a banner advertisement on a web page gets may not as accurately reflect the effectiveness of advertising. For example robots may represent some of the clicks on a banner advertisement or other promoted content and may not accurately reflect the number of human users that select an advertisement. Furthermore a human user may accidentally click a banner advertisement and may never be truly interested in the advertisement. The present system and method adds more contextual information and gives quantifiable gains and returns for social media advertising.

Another advantage of the systems and methods disclosed herein is that the systems and methods may be applied across multiple social networks and platforms. That is authors may be linked across multiple social networking web sites and platforms so that any post they author or association they make can be attached or linked to that particular author. The system may compile data and authors from multiple websites or other data sources. The system may automatically associate accounts or authors from different social media sites with each other by matching characteristics of the authors or accounts such as an e mail or phone number. Other information may also be acquired that can be used by the system to link multiple accounts from different social networking sites together as one author in the presently disclosed system. In another embodiment some accounts on some social networking web sites may not be easily linked to accounts on another social networking site and those accounts may be treated as different authors. It may even be the case that a particular custom author crowd consists of entirely different authors or is simply treated as a separate population of unique authors on two or more social networks. That is an inquiry into multi platform crowd membership may or may not be executed by the user. Such a system may also help advertisers and brand managers make informed decisions about social networks that are more effective and cost effective as compared to other social networks. For example an advertiser may focus an advertising campaign on social network A and social network B. The results of the system and methods disclosed herein may identify that social network B showed a greater return by measuring the fluctuation criteria for the custom author crowds in social network A and social network B. Further advertisers may be able to learn that advertising on one social network may be measured and effected through a second social network. For example an advertiser may sponsor an article on a social news website and authors may tweet about the article separately. The present system allows an advertiser to capture both how many people read the article on the social news website and how many authors tweeted about the article on a separate social news web site.

Advantageously the system and methods disclosed herein allow a user to ensure that the audiences they are reaching are the audiences actually targeted by the advertising. This is important because some metrics for achieving engagement and advertising success may not accurately reflect whether a target market is being reached. For example a web page may get 1 000 new likes in a month but if 200 of those likes are from authors who do not reside in a country where the user does business those 200 likes are not particularly useful or helpful to the user.

The present system and methods may also allow a user to more effectively benchmark and determine the total number of their target authors for a given promotion that exist on an advertising medium relative to a defined control group or the total population of authors. That is an advertiser may more easily gauge their position relative to a denominator or average score and whether they are indeed capturing greater shares of the total available pie. The advertiser may also determine a relevant range and scale on which to assess their performance. Advertisers have increased visibility into how effective their efforts are in each segment of authors they are targeting over time on social media. Advertising effectiveness is achievable in a context sensitive quantifiable way that provides market share like performance indicators on social media.

The system and methods disclosed herein also advantageously exploit people s natural desires for competition achievement and closure. By allowing users to see real time or near real time results and return on ad spending and quantifying those results users may feel a better sense of accomplishment and the feedback of return on investment may encourage even more aggressive marketing and ad spending.

In an illustrative embodiment the system and methods disclosed herein may include a software platform that provides flexible and continuous search refinement and tracking of target user segments for the purpose of improving advertising effectiveness and providing a gamified advertising experience on a given digital or social medium. The system and methods may provide utility regardless of the advertiser s firm size or familiarity with social media digital and social media advertising best practices in ad targeting and other web or social media related technologies.

In an illustrative embodiment a user can custom define target segments or crowds of Internet authors on any given digital or social medium. That is the user may perform digital or social market segmentation by identifying customized groupings of authors that represent a desired target market segment. Search result groupings and sizes are returned according to the user s custom search and targeting criteria made via a search interface.

In another illustrative embodiment a user can store and refine conceptualizations of these custom defined and generated author groupings on a dashboard. These crowds can be managed edited and constantly updated according to data from the ongoing or past activities of the authors contained within these specifically defined segments profile information follower characteristics text expressions other web and social behaviors etc as well as from other manual actions executed by the software user.

In another illustrative embodiment a user can engage in a gamified setting when monitoring and benchmarking all activities concerning a targeted crowd of social media authors. Advertisers will gain more contextually relevant information about author engagements with their ads and other content and be alerted of any other desired actions made by authors within their custom defined crowds. As such the advertiser will be able to gauge how he or she is performing in a crowd relative to others given his or her current level of investment and activity and have continuous visibility into the degree of success in capturing greater shares of the entire available pie within the frame of specific advertising goals or key performance indicators.

In an illustrative embodiment the system and methods provide a search tool and interface for returning groupings of similar authors on electronic media based on user defined criteria in a custom search query. These custom defined and retrieved groupings of authors constitute a unique target market segment or crowd which is specified by the user of the system. A user may make a custom search query through either free form text in a search bar or by selecting from available check boxes and look for unique objects and characteristics contained within author records on any participating advertising medium e.g. a social networking platform. Upon entering a custom search query the system can return results of groupings of similar authors. In other words the system may not return a list of every single author that meets the custom search query criteria. Instead the system may return groups of authors that are similar. For example a user may search for authors that have authored posts about baseball in the last two months. The system may return groupings of similar authors. In another example the system may display and return groupings of authors based on a particular baseball team mentioned by the authors. The system may display that 300 authors mentioned Team A 400 authors mentioned Team B 200 authors mentioned Team C etc. In other words the user may specify a certain market or industry and have the search results be grouped according to different brands within that industry. How the authors are grouped may be specified by the user. That is the groupings may be custom defined. In another example the groupings may be based on what social network the author is a part of. Using the previous example the system would therefore return results showing for example that 700 authors on Facebook have posted about baseball in the last two months 900 authors on Twitter posted about baseball in the last two months 300 authors posted on Instagram about baseball in the last two months etc. Other ways the authors may be grouped is how recently they posted about the selected custom search query. For example in the baseball example authors may be grouped together as those who have posted about baseball within the last day the last week the last month and the last two months. In another example the authors may be grouped by the frequency with which they meet the selected custom search query. For example authors may be grouped together who have posted about baseball in the last two months once 2 3 times 4 5 times and 6 or more times.

The system can then match all of the authors in the database of that particular medium or collection of media who possess the specified criteria and return these results to the user. The retrieved list of authors from search will be tagged as members of a population of interest which collectively represents a crowd the user wants to target. Targeting criteria may include keywords selection image and video shares demographic and psychographic attributes such as age gender geography and interests or other behaviors and actions historical activity mobile device and other metadata indexed during a specific time period that will allow for the grouping of similar authors. The system can also work within the constraints of pre defined targeting criteria offered and controlled by an advertising medium whereby the process of searching and grouping authors to be served an advertisement is executed solely by the advertising medium. That is the system may be used in more of a customizable self service fashion by the advertiser or be implemented by the owner of the advertising medium. As an example the system may be provided to an advertiser who can perform searching and analysis of custom author groups or the system can be used by a social network to demonstrate the effectiveness of the advertisements on their network. In other words the system can be used by advertisers on behalf of advertisers or as marketing to advertisers.

For example a digital marketer for a department store may want to find all authors on Twitter who have mentioned Beyonce Knowles and that department store in the past year like music and used shopping related keywords after December 1st. The advertiser may call this segment Beyonce Holiday Shoppers. The logic in performing this search is that this population might be interested in an offer for Beyonce s new gift set that month. The user enters this search query just like in any other engine for fast results on segment size and the collection of anonymized or non anonymized authors who match the search criteria. For the purpose of this user s query the retrieved author grouping represents the total possible market for the campaign. It provides a quantifiable denominator for determining baselines and benchmarks and for calculating percentage changes and other measurements over time. This is especially useful if the advertiser wishes to send another promoted or unsponsored offer at a later time to this exact same population of authors or to see if they organically take some specified action of interest absent any stimulus from the user. In this way the system allows the advertiser to group authors in similar contexts and view them in custom categories or crowds that are meaningful to any given marketing or advertising program. This new crowd can then represent the target audience to which the advertiser may direct a promoted ad or even unsponsored content via e.g. a social networking site. Although this crowd was produced by specific search criteria at a fixed point in time the social activities of authors contained within this crowd will change and new data on their activities will accumulate as time goes on.

The system also provides for visualizing search results in discrete groupings based on similarities of contained records. In addition these author groupings will be visualized and labeled with characteristics as opposed to returning a list of individual line item results like a traditional search engine would produce. In this way a user will not be overwhelmed by the results of numerous individual author records. Furthermore a third party action may not affect the ranking or relevance of search results presented to the user. Existence in a grouping is determined solely by the presence or absence of searched attributes in author records which is determined by author activity and characteristics and available metadata in the author database.

The aforementioned search and segmentation process can take place on a purely anonymous or personally identifiable basis or any combination thereof in accordance with accepted privacy regulations and standards privacy measures taken by individual users and the policies of websites social networking platforms and other advertising media who possess the user data.

Query results from a search for authors can be saved for reference and subsequent analysis. Author lists produced from a custom search query can be transferred onto what will be referred to as a whitelist for the purpose of ongoing measurement and later action. In essence storing and monitoring of custom search results which happen to be social media authors can be directly paired with the search functionality.

In searching and archiving the author search results the system effectively can return a digitized representation of a total crowd. It allows the user to perform accurate segment sizing and to define and better understand a crowd that he or she is uniquely interested in at a given time. Author records contained within the author database that match the user s search parameters can each have unique identifiers which enable the demarcation and aggregation processes to work easily when subsequently using the whitelist and or custom author grouping. Furthermore this may allow an author to be part of a custom author grouping by merely associating or storing the unique identifier in a custom author grouping. This allows a custom author grouping to contain unique identifiers instead of all information relating to an author. When searching for authors the system may have no results or database or populated list of authors at all stored before the search. Once search parameters are entered the system searches the internet or various databases such as a social media database for the authors and populates the search results.

Since an advertiser s targeted crowds are dynamic in nature the user of the system disclosed herein may want to have searches and groupings for crowds these author search results archived and available to reference at a later time. The system allows the user to create his or her own personal query specific index of author groupings that can be extracted from the results of the search. That is the system provides the user with the option to populate one or more custom crowds with the results of a search query. The capability allows a user to store archive refine and manually adjust results returned by his or her custom search query. This conceptualization of a crowd of target authors can be viewed and edited in its original form at any time.

For example a corporate communications professional at a large retail store may want to search for and identify the crowd on Twitter who is currently talking about the retailer s recent credit card breach. These authors may be a high priority for the retailer to reach with an apologetic message immediately following the incident. However six months later the user may want to follow up and send these exact same authors a different message perhaps an exclusive early bird offer to a brand new clothing line for the purpose of re engaging these potentially unhappy consumers. That is the system may be utilized for remarketing campaigns to specific user groupings.

In this way the ability to tag and store crowds will allow the advertiser to gain greater context into the behavior of the crowd he or she wishes to curate and nurture over time whether it is tracking responsiveness to a promotion or any other author behavior. These crowds in turn can be constantly refreshed and updated as new authors join Twitter or any other social networking site talk about a topic of interest are served advertisements etc. What s more the advertiser can make comparisons and gauge performance measures exclusive to his or her specifically selected crowds rather than on the marketing channel spend holistically. With this system the advertiser can view performance measures on specific crowds specific campaigns and the channels they are on.

A user of the systems and methods disclosed herein can also append an aforementioned crowd with proprietary data or third party audience data related to the target author base that is not produced by the system. For example a user could upload customer relationship management CRM data on individual authors which may consist of e.g. Twitter IDs or other unique author identifiers accumulated from other marketing programs. This capability provides the user with flexibility to add change or supplement author records that share similar characteristics with the crowd produced by system and methods disclosed herein.

A crowd may not be subject to any change to a search engine indexing algorithm availability of metadata or by third party activity which would consequently affect the organic ranking and presence or absence of individual search result listings. Systems and methods disclosed herein may also not be limited by the type of item or items returned on a search engine results page these may include pages documents descriptions links usernames and any other unique records matching the user s search query which may be useful to archive and reference in original form at a later time.

Such a system and method as disclosed herein may be used for activating or activated crowd members. Returning to the Beyonce Holiday Shoppers example from above some of the crowd members may view an article about a bizarre scandal with the pop star and take to Twitter with their commentary. The author postings are not responding to content from the user but are nonetheless activated to the topic of Beyonce Knowles. So in this way any data on reach impressions behavioral engagement likes retweets shares follows and unfollows photo uploads etc. text expressions image or video content shares and even sentiment data on those mentions positive negative or neutrality of posts can all fuel for social activation metrics. In various embodiments authors may be activated by either online or offline stimuli. These metrics can indicate a good time to market certain products services content etc.

Metrics actually measured by the system with regards to its crowds can be varied and may be calculated in different ways. Although not a comprehensive list of possible metrics some example measurements include 1 crowd to community ratio size of the crowd vs. size of current follower base 2 crowd penetration percentage of crowd members contained in a specific social community or following this can also be similarly tracked as a crowd to community conversion rate or a crowd acquisition rate 3 crowd conversion rate of crowd members that opt into a marketing offer total number of crowd members who saw the offer 4 crowd activation rate of crowd members that take action of interest total crowd size this can also be tracked as the activated community for something within a crowd 5 crowd engagement of crowd members engaging with paid or organic content total overall engagement this can also be tracked in raw numbers 6 crowd impressions of crowd members to whom paid or organic content was displayed total overall impressions this can also be tracked in raw numbers 7 percentage change in crowd size of crowd members at time of crowd members at time of crowd members at time 8 multi crowd membership method for finding duplicate records by matching unique author identifiers contained within multiple custom author crowds 9 crowd awareness percentage of crowd members who are likely to be aware of a brand product or service based on the activities and postings of these authors during a certain time period. Measurements and metrics specific to one crowd may be compared to total measures that may include actions taken by authors who are not represented in the crowd 10 crowd fatigue calculated by determining the number and frequency of advertisements delivered to a singular crowd during a specific time period relative to other crowds this measurement may also be expressed in percentage or proportional terms 11 crowd attraction percentage of total online activity and interactions of the authors within a custom author crowd that concerns or is directed to other members of the custom author crowd or related to the defined characteristics of the crowd this may be considered a measurement of the degree of attraction within a custom author crowd on a social platform relative to other crowds this may also be expressed as an evaluation of inter crowd communicativeness 12 crowd focus percentage of behaviors postings or promoted messages by the user that were directed to each custom author crowd based on the user s total online activity this may also be expressed in relation to the user s other custom author crowds .

A user may also use the crowd as a basis for gaining other statistics specific to his target audience including other embodiments of awareness measurement advertising fatigue or other embodiments of reach and frequency capping within a crowd content relevance affinity strength and comparisons word of mouth marketing gauges advocacy and loyalty indicators or any range of behaviors and expressions even sharing activity of different media files by these authors. The system may also facilitate event based alerting and quantifiable aggregations of activities in a custom crowd. For example when an author uses a specific keyword or hashtag in a tweet the user of the system may be alerted. He may also be alerted to and may be capable of viewing the total number of such instances that occurred with respect to his crowd over a certain time period. The user of the system could specify these specific events of interest when setting up a custom search monitor.

Advantageously the system allows for ongoing measurement of a specified crowd as expressed in terms of the share of total authors that exist in that crowd. The user experience with the system may create the feeling of a challenge for the user it is theoretically feasible to capture one s entire target segment and to verify those successes through various data points quantitatively. That is there are a total quantifiable number of target authors which can be compared against benchmarks and current activity levels. Each step closer to the total may be treated as a minor victory in itself. To accomplish this the system may include a user interface or dashboard like visualization to display the various crowds calculations comparisons current user performance benchmarks comparison to benchmarks past user performance competitor performance user activity levels user investment or advertisement spending and or comparison to other investment levels by competitors or industry averages.

An illustrative embodiment may also include notification of action or actions taken by an author contained within a custom curated crowd that signals fluctuations of interest in the overall performance of that crowd. The addition of gamification techniques to this software platform allows for the creation of thresholds through performance metrics that can provide an advertiser with a sense of achievement and closure even addiction with respect to his or her current level of author activity relative to known baselines benchmarks and short and long term goals.

After creating one or more crowds a user may choose to proactively target authors by engaging in any variety of direct marketing activities or by leveraging specific ad products offered by the advertising medium. The user may also choose to passively view the organic activity of authors in those segments. In either approach the system allows the user to monitor subsequent author activity within his or her crowd after the crowd was created.

The system also provides a customizable keyword and behavior based alerting and aggregate measuring mechanism to the user when any of the authors included in a custom defined crowd executes an action or behavior of interest on any range of digital or social media. That is only the activity of the authors specifically contained within a user s crowd will trigger an alert and impact overall performance measurement. The system provides a huge range of possibilities regarding the behaviors that an advertiser may be interested to track and aggregate within a crowd and or to receive a direct notification. For example an author could mention a specific news event or brand name engage with a piece of unsponsored content such as a Facebook message visit a website click on a paid advertisement follow a corporate Twitter handle or engage in any other behavior on a digital or social medium specified as an action of interest by the user. Recall a previous example a user may want to know when his or her custom defined crowd of Beyonce Holiday Shoppers takes an action. In an example apart from engagement with paid advertisements the user may want to know when a crowd member elects to follow a certain Twitter account. That is the user is interested in each instance an author contained within this particular crowd takes this singular action. In this case the system will determine the baseline number of users within the custom defined crowd who follow the Twitter handle identified by the user. Every subsequent follower the user receives to that account will be similarly searched against the index to see if the author is a tagged user contained within the user s custom crowd. Say for example jehanhamedi just followed the user s desired Twitter handle. If this name exists in the custom crowd the user will be alerted that he has captured a new member of his target market.

The system may also display performance metrics on a custom curated crowd. The number of alerts accrued for a particular event or action taken by authors in a custom segment may also be tracked and quantified into perpetuity. In doing so the aggregation of these events or alerts will serve as a quantifiable representation of performance in that custom curated segment of Internet authors. These alerts can continue into perpetuity until the crowd containing all tagged authors of interest is deleted from the software platform.

Consider again that the act of following a Twitter handle is the user s behavior of interest. Let s say that the user s custom curated crowd consists of 100 target authors and at the present time 10 of them follow him on Twitter . Therefore the user s current crowd penetration which may also be described as a variant of a follower rate with this crowd is 10 . Fast forward one week The user posts several new messages through his Twitter account including a sponsored one and sees that he has gained new followers. In this example the user received 10 new followers in the week. The system searches for these authors within the user s crowd and identifies that 5 of the new followers are indeed contained within the crowd. As a result crowd penetration has now grown to 15 15 100 in that segment. The user can view this percentage change in performance in that crowd and even compare it to other crowds he may have defined with the system. This figure may also be compared to the total number of that account s followers to determine for example the proportion of crowd members to general followers at a given time.

In this way the system allows for the creation of benchmarks and other comparative measures to gauge on a continuous basis the user s performance in a target crowd at the present time relative to the total performance that is achievable in that crowd i.e. the denominator at that time. By calculating percentage changes and other raw measurements over time with respect to each of these actions the user is able to create and monitor his or her own custom market share like performance indicators for each author crowd he or she wishes to target.

The system may also include capabilities for benchmarking and ongoing monitoring. The system can provide a display that acts as a dashboard monitoring the activity of the advertiser s crowds on each advertising medium. This display may show any type of market share like key performance indicators KPIs such as percentages of awareness purchase intent content relevance crowd membership growth and crowd penetration advertising fatigue priming indicators degree of topic or brand affinity loyalty rates crowd acquisition rates etc. With each of these metrics there may also be a display of an average score and an anonymous industry leader to help instill a sense of competition and encourage continued activity. The conceptualization of a leaderboard may also use identifiable information of top achievers. Relative rankings in achievement may be determined with respect to performance in the same custom author crowd a specific category of interest within some competitor set or along any other dimension that is capable of being tracked via fluctuation criteria. One or more of the user s crowds may also be included in these achievement calculations. As described the system can also quantify overall success rates in each custom crowd. In this way the user can view success measures at a current activity level in relation to the total possible pie at a given time. By having visibility into total possible achievement or relative achievement to other crowds or other advertisers the advertiser may be incentivized to increase spend levels until reaching 100 or whatever his or her goal may be.

The present system and methods may advantageously help an advertiser think Okay if I am only at 40 where do my competitors stand I don t want to be out performed I want to own the greatest consumer mindshare of the people I care about and keep moving the needle towards 100 before they do. In that way the system creates and fosters an arcade like experience that gamifies advertising expenditures and the user experience for the software user. This model can create value for all parties involved. An advertiser may use the present system instead of something like sponsoring a TV show or a golf event where the advertiser has less information on who actually sees and engages with his or her campaign.

In an illustrative embodiment multiple custom author groupings are compiled and available for selection or display. In this embodiment statistical summaries of each of a user s custom author groupings can be displayed on one web page or a set of web pages or within the interface of a software product. Such a collection of one user s custom author groupings may be referred to as a whitelist. The user may use that whitelist as the sole and primary content source for analysis allowing the user to track and perform measurements on the behaviors expressions and other fluctuations of that specific group of authors i.e. the search results in isolation. By performing measurements on the activities of a specifically defined crowd the user is able to determine for example the size of a certain crowd of users or discussion group as well as determine applicable audience activation and user acquisition metrics for that crowd. These measurements will help the user learn if his or her recent initiatives on any one or set of social media channels are positively impacting these metrics. These metrics can be referenced on an ongoing basis into the future.

The user may also decide to set up new programs around a crowd that may include executing targeted marketing and advertising programs via a social network s advertising platform or any other marketing optimization analysis engagement or technology platform described elsewhere in the present application that may specifically be directed to reach this author set. The user may set up activity based alerts to notify him of certain actions taken by these crowd members or changes within the size and makeup of the crowd overall. For example did people in the custom crowd Pepsi Lovers just follow CocaCola on Twitter after they saw a promoted ad for Diet Coke The user can also compare and contrast other custom author groupings he or she created along any of the same measures.

The system allows for comparison and tracking of two or more customized crowds against each other for the purpose of determining relative achievement and performance. This comparative measure may be a quantification of a desired action taken by certain authors in a crowd against the total crowd or comparisons along any of the metrics aforementioned. For example the user may decide to compare two custom defined crowds versus viewing one in isolation to determine relative activation or author acquisition levels with respect to the total number of social media authors in a crowd or against any other control group. The user may also wish to determine whether he or she was more effective in activating crowd A or crowd B after executing campaigns during a certain time period. In another embodiment the user may not even define these comparison crowds himself with the system there may be potential to compare a user defined crowd to a crowd defined by other users of the system or to a sample crowd or any collection of sample crowds already provided by the system.

In an illustrative embodiment an advertising or marketing campaign executed directly through or in conjunction with the system by a user may be used to capture more customer data. For example a promotion on a social network may allow authors to participate in the promotion upon giving the user an e mail address or mobile phone number to receive the offer. This may be an effective way to acquire new information about authors in the crowd which can be stored in customer relationship management CRM databases maintained either in the present system or separately by the user.

Advantageously the present system and methods allows a user to target and analyze the activities of authors across multiple social networks such as Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn Pinterest etc. As a result the system also has the capability of facilitating both the targeting and retargeting of social media users across multiple social networking sites. That is finding and serving promotional content to the same person when he or she is on each platform. The system can thus function as a neutral third party platform between social networks where neither party needs to worry about divulging valuable information to the other yet both parties benefit from increased advertising interest. The user of the system can create custom storable audience segments on a third party platform.

In some embodiments the devices shown in may be existing devices that are owned or possessed by a user author in a crowd other author system administrator etc. using the embodiments disclosed herein. In such an embodiment the author or user may only need to download software e.g. an application or app to the existing device to execute the various embodiments disclosed herein. In other embodiments specialized hardware may be used by the author or user that is specifically designed to perform or execute the various embodiments disclosed herein. As such hardware may be specifically designed to provide such capabilities.

In an illustrative embodiment the computing device is used by a user of the system and methods disclosed herein. The computing device may be used to search for authors create specify custom author groups and review the results of the monitoring of those custom author groups. A user may further utilize the computing device to implement advertising or marketing campaigns or interact with and otherwise create content for the internet that may not explicitly be advertising or perform any other functions as disclosed herein. The computing device is used by an author. The author can join social networks follow Twitter handles like pages send messages and chats receive e mail author online content navigate the internet make purchases trigger events etc. or perform any other functions as disclosed herein. The server facilitates and hosts the system and methods that are disclosed herein. It may store for the custom author groupings calculate and monitor those groupings and provides the computing device access to the features that are disclosed throughout the present application.

In an operation the search criteria is used to determine a custom author crowd. In this embodiment the search criteria can be used to perform a search after receiving an input from the user. If the search results are to the user s liking another input can be received from the user to indicate that the user would like a custom author crowd created. The custom author crowd is created. The user may be presented with an opportunity to name the custom author crowd making it easier to identify who is in the crowd why the crowd was searched or created or some other identification that the user specifies. The custom author crowd specified at is saved and monitored based on fluctuation criteria.

In an operation the system determines a fluctuation of the custom author crowd based on author posts and or other actions. The other actions may be a variety of author actions such as retweeting liking commenting purchasing or any other author action or interaction as disclosed and discussed throughout the present application. These posts and actions signal when an author or number of authors has been activated within the crowd. Thus fluctuation criteria specified by the user may also be referred to as activation criteria.

In an operation the system determines how many authors in the custom author crowd can be characterized as being a part of a community where the parameters of the community is specified by the user of the system. In other words the system is determining a magnitude or number of authors in the custom author crowd that have met a fluctuation criteria. For example the fluctuation criteria may be whether an author has liked a sponsored page for pizza. In the operation the system determines how many authors in the custom author crowd already have liked the sponsored page for pizza. In this embodiment the search criteria and the fluctuation criteria are different. In an alternative embodiment the search criteria and the fluctuation criteria may be the same.

In an operation the system saves the custom author crowd and the number and identity of authors that were determined to be part of the community in the operation . In this embodiment all authors in the custom author crowd and their associated profiles are saved as the custom author crowd. In an alternative embodiment identifiers of each account are stored in a list that serves as the custom author crowd. Any other information relating to the authors may be stored separately but can be referred to using the author identifiers. Similarly an identification or identifier may be stored with the author account or identifier that indicates whether a particular author is part of the community or another social following. In this embodiment the system determines if the authors in the custom author crowd are part of one community. In an alternative embodiment the system may determine if the authors in the custom author crowd are a part of multiple communities. For example the system may determine whether the authors in a custom author crowd have been activated that is if the authors have posted something indicating their interest or activation in a subject. For example authors may like follow author etc. a post about fashion. The system may then determine how many authors in the custom author group have been activated to be interested in fashion part of the fashion community . The system may in addition to the more general fashion community determine how many of the authors in the custom author group are part of a particular fan base. For example the system may determine how many of the authors in the custom author group have liked followed etc. the clothier J. Crew . In this way a user may be able to determine how many authors in the custom author group are activated and how many authors are in an owned community such as a particular brand. The system may utilize this functionality to compare the owned community to the broader community. In other words the system could determine what proportion of the activated community is part of a particular owned community. In this way the user may be able to more accurately track their own brand or owned community or that of a competitor.

In an operation the custom author crowd is monitored over time to determine whether authors in the custom author crowd meet the fluctuation criteria and are subsequently characterized as being part of the community. In an operation an alert is sent to the user when the number of authors in the community has reached a predetermined threshold. In an alternative embodiment the user is alerted whenever an author in the custom author crowd is characterized as joining the community. In another alternative embodiment the user is alerted based on a schedule. For example the alert may be sent once a week and update the user on how many authors have left joined or stayed in the community. Other various information or statistics may be included with the alert.

In an operation the first search criteria is used to determine a first custom author crowd. The determining of the first custom author crowd may be performed similar to the determining a custom author crowd discussed above with respect to operation of .

In an operation a second search criteria is received from a user. The first search criteria may be received similar to the search criteria discussed above with respect to operation of . In an operation the second search criteria is used to determine a second custom crowd. The determining of the second custom author crowd may be performed similar to the determining a custom author crowd discussed above with respect to operation of .

In an operation the system monitors the first and second custom author crowds over time for fluctuations of authors in the first and second custom author crowds who over time leave or join a community i.e. become activated. The monitoring may be similar to operation of and or operation of . In this embodiment the fluctuation criteria monitored for is the same for both the monitoring of the first custom author crowd and the second custom author crowd. In an alternative embodiment a different fluctuation criteria may be used or specified for the first custom author crowd and the second custom author crowd. The monitoring determines how many authors in each crowd have joined or left the community and at what time these events occur.

In an operation the system calculates differences in fluctuations of authors in the first and second custom author crowds joining or leaving the community. In other words the fluctuations within the first and second custom author crowds are compared. The differences in fluctuations of the first and second custom author crowds may indicate that certain strategies or content proved more effective at getting one crowd over the other to join the community i.e. to become activated within some specific context to opt into a marketing offer to join the fan base of specific social account etc. In an alternative embodiment many other statistics comparisons and ratios may be calculated as disclosed herein. In another embodiment the system may compare and monitor more than two custom author crowds.

In an operation an engagement and or advertisement campaign is executed by or in conjunction with the system disclosed herein. This may be running an advertisement posting sponsored content online sending out print media running a commercial tweeting something from an official account prioritizing particular content on a social networking website retweeting a post or any other sort of engagement or advertisement campaign that can be executed online or offline. In this embodiment the user executes the engagement and or advertisement campaign using the present system. That is the user may be able to post and or schedule to be posted advertisements sponsored content unsponsored content etc. utilizing the system. In an alternative embodiment the engagement and or advertising campaign may be executed outside the framework of the presently disclosed system and methods. That is the user or party related to the user may execute an engagement and or advertisement campaign utilizing a different electronic system or the campaign may not be online at all. For example the user may execute an engagement and or advertisement campaign on a different website may send out paper mailers e mails run a promotion in stores for or related to a product or products etc.

In an operation the custom author crowd is monitored for one or more fluctuation criteria. The fluctuation criteria may be interacting with sponsored content such as commenting on reading or retweeting the content. The fluctuation criteria may also be joining an online affinity group or following a particular individual or brand page or account. Another monitored fluctuation criteria may be whether the author actually authors a post regarding sponsored content the advertising campaign or the subject of the advertising campaign. Other fluctuation criteria that may be monitored are disclosed throughout the present application.

In an operation the system determines metrics of how the community and or the custom author group changed based on the monitored fluctuation criteria. This can inform the user how effective the engagement marketing and or advertising program was. The metrics may be many various calculations as described herein. For example the metrics may include number of authors who joined the community during the advertisement campaign or a set amount of time after the campaign percentage change of authors in the custom author crowd who joined the community number of authors who joined a corporate fan base or a celebrity brand endorser s following etc.

In an operation the authors that match the search parameters are located and grouped together in a custom author crowd. In an operation the group of authors or crowd are added to an editable whitelist. The whitelist as described elsewhere in the present application is a list including an interface where different custom author crowds can be viewed sorted configured deleted etc.

In an operation the whitelist and subsequently the custom author crowds stored therein is monitored to collect data and fluctuations in the crowds based on fluctuation criteria determined by the user and or preset in the system. In an operation custom event based alerts are defined by the user. For example the user may wish to receive an alert whenever an author leaves his or her community. In another example the user may wish to receive an alert whenever a particular fluctuation criteria changes such that when a predetermined threshold which can be set by the user is reached the alert is sent. In another example the user may wish to get an alert if the fluctuation criteria for one custom author crowd is a higher value than the fluctuation criteria for a second custom author crowd. Other alerts may be set and defined such as other alerts as defined elsewhere in the present disclosure.

In an operation an alert is sent to the user indicating that an event has occurred. Stated another way the system has determined that a particular fluctuation criteria is met as defined by the user so an alert is automatically generated and sent to the user by the system. The alert may be sent in varying ways. For example the alert may be sent by instant message short message service SMS text e mail tweet fax message system viewable in the presently disclosed system interface etc.

In an operation custom author crowds are compared to other custom author crowds in the whitelist. These comparisons may be done using varying methods as disclosed throughout the present disclosure. Additionally the comparison may include calculations of particular metrics or indicators based on the comparisons.

In an operation the user can specify and execute a new marketing program based on alerts received and or additional information displayed by the system. In other words the user can start an advertising campaign based on an alert received. The user may also wish to access the features of the full system and may view additional information that informs their decision of whether to initiate an advertisement campaign and what type of campaign that might be. Additionally the user may have pre programmed one or more advertising campaigns into the system or another adjoining system or systems that could be accessed by the system disclosed herein. In this embodiment the user can then just select that advertising campaign to commence as soon as the user receives an alert. In an alternative embodiment an advertisement campaign may be initiated by the system automatically when a certain alert condition exists. In this embodiment the alert sent to the user may include the alert information as well as a notification that the advertisement campaign was initiated automatically. In another embodiment the execution of an advertisement campaign may be facilitated via an application programming interface API that may allow the user to integrate intelligence generated and provided by this system into other cross channel advertising strategies and initiatives that may leverage other software applications. Thusly the presently disclosed system may also aid the user in optimizing other programs that are not entirely managed via this system. In other words the user may be able to access other programs through interactions between the presently disclosed system and another program. In this example the user may wish to execute a marketing program. A link to marketing program software may be inserted into an interface for a software application or web page. Although the marketing plan in this example is not executed by the present system capabilities to execute marketing plans can be incorporated into the present system.

The methodology and components described herein may be used for broader applications that combine search functionality whitelist creation and custom measurements and alerts to form a custom search monitor beyond social media. Custom search monitors can be applied to help users research any topic and compare custom results to another dataset similar to comparing a target crowd to an existing social community where item records are capable of being queried in a database. Further a custom search monitor may operate with direct database access or it may leverage a web crawler to extract data and populate an index which is then searchable by the user. In another embodiment a separate database is created where new data is added by executing frequent API calls of another database or by manual input.

In an alternative embodiment a custom search monitor may be applied to a store inventory database to alert a user when a new product he wants is in stock at his local retailer or when the product goes on sale adds a new feature color etc. The product types and fluctuation criteria may be specified by the user after a search of all records and then tracked to capture fluctuations in specific attributes of interest. Users may even use this method to compare one retailer or distributor against another along the same dimensions. That is the user may have an open search monitor running for the products he is interested in spanning multiple stores databases. A custom search monitor may also be applied in the context of product user reviews as well. In that way a user may be alerted when the products or services he is interested in cross a certain threshold in terms of the volume or sentiment of ratings or overall rating score.

In an alternative embodiment a custom search monitor may be applied to a database of job listings where the user can search and tag target companies he or she is interested in applying to for a job at the present time or at some time in the future. The system may then alert the user to changes to that company s job listings when new roles are posted when specific skills and competencies are mentioned in the job requirements or according to any other fluctuation criteria. The system may also provide new metrics to the user for example the system may calculate the frequency and percentage of hires in certain functional areas versus others and may even provide benchmarking criteria on similar candidates as the user. Another embodiment may compare these job listings to the data contained in a digital version of the user s resume and alert the user when keywords or other criteria match new listings. That is a job opportunity may not solely be surfaced based on matching company or job title it could be surfaced through the presence of certain keywords or any other criteria located in the job description or company profile. In another embodiment fluctuation criteria may include online mentions of the prospective company or specific online activity of its employees and stakeholders that match the parameters provided by the user.

In an alternative embodiment a custom search monitor may be applied in the context of financial securities and investment decision making. The system may allow the user to search a database containing various data on available debt equity or derivative securities that meet certain parameters. The system may then allow the user to create a whitelist of the securities that he is interested in tracking in either the short term or long term. Fluctuation criteria may vary widely depending on the user s investment and trading strategy. Examples of fluctuation criteria include but are not intended to be limited to monitoring securities for changes in interest rates dividend yield risk metrics stock price strike price share price volatility moving averages weighted averages 52 week averages price to earnings P E ratio debt equity ratio revenue figures reported net income profitability indicators such as ROA recent news announcements and public postings containing specific information etc. Such metrics and measurements may be leveraged in conjunction with other technical analysis. Advantageously the system may alert the user when certain fluctuation criteria may signal a favorable investment condition. The user could then use this intelligence provided by the system to optimize his or her trading and investment strategies and inform the timing and execution of new trades or other subsequent actions.

In an alternative embodiment a custom search monitor may be applied to a setting in which a user wants to improve the frequency timing and relevance of communications to important contacts. By accessing a database of information from different media accounts such as social media friends followers connections discussion forums target author crowds a mobile phonebook email and text messaging accounts etc. the user could search for and tag contact records he wants to prioritize for networking relationship building purposes or other outreach purposes. Search parameters may include things such as company affiliation university alumni professional groups geographic region age keyword or topic mention interest image or video share etc. These and other custom fluctuation criteria when met may trigger an alert to the user. The system may also deliver an alert after a pre defined amount of time has elapsed or when a certain number of contacts in a specific grouping have messaged him. In another embodiment the system may display an activity summary for a certain time period which would give the user a digest about past conversations with this target contact list and relevant outreach and success metrics. Furthermore this group of contacts can be tracked independently of all outbound communications made by the user via the accounts he has connected to the system. Thusly the system may inform the user when he is not regularly communicating with the people who he deemed are important in proportion to his total outbound communications over a certain time period. In another embodiment the system may create the feeling of a challenge for the user to accomplish pre defined short and long term goals and provide incentives for doing so. In yet another embodiment the system may help inspire the type substance and timing of the next message sent by the user to one or more contacts based on historical context and the unique activation criteria for that contact grouping. For example say the user had sent a text message to a specific crowd of target contacts on Day 0 about fantasy football prospects. This text message campaign had a 100 response rate effectively initiating a dialogue with all of his targets. Further these target contacts were in turn 50 more likely to start a new conversation with the user absent any prompt within the next 14 days. This was a significant improvement from his past work related conversation attempts. As a result the user may decide to specify fantasy football as new fluctuation criteria. That is the next time this particular crowd becomes activated on the topic of fantasy football the user may then be alerted to initiate a subsequent dialogue. Context specific relationship building may be nurtured in a systematic fashion thusly.

In an alternative embodiment a custom search monitor may be applied to service offerings as well. In a travel use case a user may search a database of hotels rooms or flights to locate and track preferred seating arrangements room accommodations and travel dates to a specific destination as part of his travel plan. The system may then alert the user when there are fluctuations in variables that may explicitly influence his plans e.g. the ticket price drops or new seats with extra leg room become available or perhaps there is a new amenity offered to him as a traveler. In the event that the user has already made the booking the system may compare the data on his booked trip to other options occurring at the same time and notify him of any potentially preferable alternatives that may influence a booking change.

In an alternative embodiment a custom search monitor may also apply to users making doctor appointments. The system may allow a user to search a database of doctors by specifying parameters such as area of specialty geographic region of practice of years in practice required co pay accepted insurance plans having a degree from a particular school etc. and then save groups of their preferred doctors for treatment. The system may then alert users when this grouping meets desired fluctuation criteria such as appointment openings with doctors when preferred doctors are added to the user s insurance provider s coverage or even when these doctors open up another practice in the user s area. A custom search monitor may also be applied in the context of patient reviews of doctors facilities treatments procedures and prescription drug usage. In that way a user may be alerted when the specific services he may be considering cross a certain threshold in terms of the volume or sentiment of ratings or overall rating score. This information may be useful to different users for benchmarking evaluation and research purposes.

In an alternative embodiment a custom search monitor may be used to track the publishing behavior of target groups of webpages and then alert users when these entities cross a certain threshold in content production or search ranking viewership rate preference or relevance metrics etc. That is the user may assess competing websites based on content goals content topics quantity and frequency of content types blog whitepaper ebook video podcast etc. keyword use or along any other attribute or action of interest. The system may also be applied to alert users when webpages located by a search query adjust in content or ranking. The system may use a crawler to create a searchable index of data retrieved from specific website URIs. The system may then categorize content type based on factors such as URI architecture which it may then use to identify and track when new content in those defined categories are published and then compare it to the entire set of web properties. The system may also leverage direct database access for applications with social media accounts By creating two crowds each containing one social account and then comparing the two e.g. Microsoft vs. Samsung the system may use the data to extract the Internet media types and content asset types that were posted and shared by the account most often and track these into perpetuity this may be a number of jpg files uploaded a number of gifs blog mentions in URIs promoted content or any other media type or content asset type.

In an alternative embodiment the system and methods disclosed herein may also be applied to monitoring media libraries that stream entertainment content. Some of the media libraries are available online or through a set top box and television. In this embodiment the media library may be monitored for specific content such as movies or television shows. If a certain television show becomes available for example the user may be alerted to its availability. In another embodiment the user may be alerted when the status of a certain media changes. For example the user may be alerted when a television show is transitioned from being available for a fee to being available for free. Further the systems and methods disclosed herein may also be used to track available content from various media libraries generally. For example the system may be able to inform a user which media library has the most new material the most recently added show or movie or which media library is the largest. If a user is looking for a particular item of media the user may be able to use the system to search for that media to determine its availability and the conditions of that availability. The user may also determine parameters for a type length or genre of media they are looking for. Searching for types lengths genres etc. of media may yield a resulting group of media items. The user may also be able to configure and set custom alerts for that media or group of media. In other illustrative embodiments the system and methods disclosed herein may also be applied to websites that list real estate sales rentals leases etc. Another illustrative embodiment may be configured to monitor and set up alerts for available parking spots in an area.

Disclosed herein are systems and methods for determining agility ratings and recommending aspects for future content to be posted by an author actions to be taken or behaviors to engage in. As disclosed herein an author generally refers to a person using a social network website application software or mobile application software app etc. Whether the author actually authors posts is irrelevant to their categorization as an author. A user is described herein as one who uses the systems and methods disclosed herein. A user may be an author and vice versa but a user is not necessarily an author. For example a user of the systems and methods disclosed herein may merely track the behavior of authors utilizing the systems and methods without actually being an author themselves. Similarly authors may exist that do not utilize the systems and methods disclosed herein but such authors may post content generate data or take other actions that may be tracked and analyzed by the systems and methods disclosed herein. The system can recommend aspects for future content actions and or behaviors. For example actions and behaviors as well as aspects of those aspects and behaviors may be recommended. For example actions and or behaviors that may be recommended may include examples such as liking a page creating a page editing a webpage adjusting a page URL or page title adding alternate text to images starting an advertisement campaign conducting NB testing of a webpage or other marketing message starting a remarketing campaign sending an email purchase decisions or whether a particular ad service will address a problem or goal of a user.

A user may wish to determine certain aspects of future content that would make the content more beneficial to post or more attractive to a particular audience. For example a user may wish to post content on behalf of an author that is more likely to be engaged with by the user and or author s target audience. The audience may be a custom author crowd as discussed above in the present disclosure. Accordingly a user may designate a unique author and a target custom author crowd for future content action and or behavior recommendations. The system can then provide potential requests that each include an indication or type of a recommended aspect for a future content actions and or behaviors. For example a system may provide to a user potential requests with a specific recommended aspect type such as How many times should I post content today How long should my next content post be What should the subject matter of my next content post be Should I include a graphic in my next post Who and what should I retweet or share In other examples the recommended aspect types provided with the potential requests may be more general. For example the potential requests may be grouped by type e.g color related length related type of content related etc. goals difficulty level industry or company type job title or role within a company persona use case etc. Upon providing such potential requests to the user the user can select one or more of the potential requests. In one example a potential request is selected with a single user interface interaction such as a single mouse click or a single touch on a touch screen. In response to the single interaction the system then automatically determines a recommended aspect of the future content action and or behavior for the selection of the potential request. For example if the selected potential request was How many times should I post content today the system may provide a numerical recommended aspect response instruction to the user to post content as the unique author for example four 4 times today. The system s determination of the recommended aspect can be based on activity data that indicates aspects of other content authored by or interacted with by other authors. For example the system may use activity data to determine that four is an optimal number of times to post content in a day in order to receive the most interactions with the content without alienating authors or causing fatigue with posts by the unique author. Activity data does not necessarily refer to old data. Rather activity data used for determining recommended aspects is referred to herein as any data that exists prior to the exact moment in time when a recommended aspect is actually determined. Accordingly activity data may include data about topics currently trending on social networks including news from news sources television radio websites etc. Accordingly activity data may be updated regularly to provide up to date and real time data for determining recommended aspects. For example the system may determine that a particular hashtag is currently trending on Twitter and can make a recommendation accordingly. In another example author content may be used to infer potential future events even though activity data is used. For example the system may identify certain authors as having spending power based on live tweets or other social media posts such as I want to buy X or Headed out shopping. 

After providing a user with a recommended aspect for posts for a unique author the system can also determine whether a post with the recommended aspect is actually posted. The system can then use this information to determine an agility rating that indicates a responsiveness of the unique author to the recommended aspect. In other words the system generates an agility rating that indicates how good a unique author account is at posting content according to the system s determined recommendation aspects for that account. An agility rating is the measure of a user s responsiveness to new marketing opportunities. When customer moods shift or your rival s campaign misses a beat a user can find out from an agility rating. For example if the system recommends posting four times in one day the system can measure at the end of the day or in certain time increments during the day how many times content was actually posted by the unique author the recommended aspect was generated for. If the unique author has posted four times a favorable or positive agility rating is determined. If the unique author already has an agility rating stored by the system the four postings in one day as recommended can increase the existing agility rating. In contrast if the unique author has posted more or less times than four the system may determine an unfavorable or negative agility rating or decrease an existing stored agility rating for the unique author . In another embodiment a single agility rating may be related to multiple unique author accounts. Such a functionality is valuable for example if a user is in charge of multiple unique author accounts. In such an example all of those unique author accounts can be used to generate a single agility rating for the user. In another example a user may wish to track an agility rating of several competitors or other authors. Accordingly the user may designate a group of authors for which the system can determine a single agility rating. In this way groupings of authors e.g. by industry region etc. can be used to determine an average agility rating of those groupings of authors.

Such systems and methods as disclosed herein are advantageous because social media can be a very variable landscape. Because of its changing complexion marketers need to learn how to strike when it is most favorable. Dynamic and adaptive social media campaigns are now achievable through the systems and methods disclosed herein that can provide instant answers and recommendations for posting content and quantify a user s ability to leverage these instant answers.

That is the system provides business responses to marketplace change. These responses can be determined and delivered to the user in a personalized or generalized fashion. Advantageously these responses are not necessarily limited to the marketing function of a business. In turn users of the system will be able to achieve an incredibly fast time to value or time to insight. In other words a user can achieve high results without dedicating inordinate amounts of time to online marketing activities saving time and money. The system can also provide individuals who are new to marketing or who are uneducated in a particular marketing domain such as social media marketing on Twitter tools to learn and implement best practices quickly.

In an operation selections of potential requests from a user for recommended aspect types for future content action and or behavior are received. For example the user can designate which types of aspects he or she may want to request. For example requests such as what color should be used in a post or how many images to include in a post may be designated by the user. In an alternative embodiment the potential requests may be predetermined or default such that the operation may be omitted and the user does not select the potential requests.

In an operation a plurality of authors who are the target of the future content action and or behavior are received. The system may receive a custom author crowd as disclosed herein or plurality of authors who are the target of the future content action and or behavior. In other words a user may specify particular authors or groups of authors to assemble activity data on. This activity data as discussed below can be used to determine recommended aspects that will optimize author response and or interaction. For example a custom author crowd may be determined by a search criteria such as a demographic trait or user profile trait of the plurality of authors a subject matter of a social media post authored by the plurality of authors a related subject matter of a predetermined number of social media posts authored by the plurality of authors a group association of the plurality of authors such as the following of the unique author or the following of another author an interaction by the plurality of authors with the unique author an engagement with a content by the plurality of authors an amount of time spent viewing a webpage or screen by the plurality of authors accessing a webpage or screen by the plurality of authors the selection of a universal resource identifier URI by the plurality of authors an affirmative or negative activity executed through the at least one social network website application software or mobile application software app or any other type of search criteria. The custom author crowd may also be the author s immediate following on a social networking site such as Twitter . In another embodiment the custom author crowd may be a user s customers. For example the user can import or upload a list of Twitter handles from a customer database maintained by the user. In another example the user may import an e mail or mailing list or any other information that identifies a user s customers. Such identifying information can be used to define a customer author crowd. In such an embodiment the system may utilize non social networking site specific data e.g. name address e mail address to search social networking sites and identify authors on the social networking sites that likely correspond to the user s customers. This operation may be performed through various hashing methods of data wherein matches are discovered between the social networking site s user base and the user s customer list without either party having to directly expose sensitive customer information to the other party. Accordingly those customers located on the social networking sites can be included in the customer author crowd.

In an operation potential requests for a recommended aspect type for the future content action and or behavior are provided. The recommended aspect type may indicate what kind of recommendation the user is seeking. For example if a potential request is What time should I post today that potential request indicates a recommended aspect type timing. Numerous recommended aspect types are contemplated and each of the potential requests or groups of potential requests disclosed herein are for at least one recommended aspect type. The potential requests may be displayed on a single display such that the user can see all of the potential requests available for selection before selecting one. The available potential requests here are ones that were selected by the user in the operation . However in some embodiments the displayed available potential requests may be predetermined or default such that they are not selected by the user. In another embodiment the displayed potential requests may include some user selected potential requests and some predetermined or default requests. For example if the user only selects one potential request they would like to see displayed the system may display additional potential requests in order to still display at least a predetermined number of potential requests on the display. The system can be structured in a personalized question and answer format allowing a user to select their top marketing questions from a list of available options e.g. check all that apply and then click one button a single user interaction or input to receive fresh and instant answers each time a user needs them. These requests can also be grouped into categories according to the purpose use case or practical area they serve such as Timing for informing when certain types of content should be published or Images for informing how a user can better utilize image media in his content postings. Other categories may also be used such as Hashtags Strategy Community Management Customer Service Website Conversions SEO etc. Such recommendations can be organized in a guide or wizard view that walks a user through step by step how to create optimize publish and or distribute certain content or engage in certain behaviors actions or marketing activities. In this way the system can feature additional views and interfaces or display supplemental information to provide better instructions and more intuitive experiences to users. Such resources can provide a template and or tutorial experience for using and executing the recommended activities described herein. For example the system may organize potential requests and their associated recommended aspect types in a question and answer format on a display. Other views are contemplated and may include but are not intended to be limited to a list view a search view and a guide view. With the search view a user can explicitly search for a given potential request or recommended aspect type offered by the system. Search may be done by keyword for example. The system may also suggest new recommendations for the user based upon their goals performance and recent system usage. The guide view may show a more tutorial based display to provide sequential steps to a user. Such a display can help a user learn how to do modern marketing with templates and the various systems and methods disclosed herein. Answers or recommended aspects may be unlocked at different stages in learning process. As the user grows in familiarity and skill skill may be indicated for example by agility rating with the system new sets of potential requests and or recommended aspect types may appear. Such a process can refine a user s content marketing development and publication or distribution strategies. For example the system can include modules for learning how to use images in Twitter content marketing how to do video marketing how to create original content based upon audience trends etc.

The system can also ask users supplemental questions based on the selected potential requests. The answers can be used as a factor for determining recommended aspects of future content actions and or behaviors. For example if the user wants to know Which Twitter Ads Product Is Best For Me the system can return a simple answer such as Promoted Tweets. However in an alternative embodiment the system may also ask a follow up question such as Do you do email marketing The user s response to such a supplemental question can inform the system that there is some value to this user in capturing new email addresses for some other programs the user is running. In such a case the system can make different or additional recommendations e.g. a Lead Generation Card as a primary or secondary ads consideration for that user. The answers provided by users to supplemental questions may also be used to configure and display for the user additional recommended aspects of future content actions or behavior. In the case of the example above the system may introduce the user to a new set of potential requests or recommended aspects that are related to email marketing if the user responded in the affirmative to a supplemental question such as Do you do email marketing 

In an operation a selection of one of the potential requests for the recommended aspect type for the future content action and or behavior is received. In one embodiment the selection of the potential request of the recommended aspect type is a single input into a user interface of a computing device. For example several electronic buttons may appear on the screen of a computing device. Each of the electronic buttons can be associated with one of the potential request for recommended aspect types for a future content action and or behavior. By selecting one of the electronic buttons with the single input through the user interface the system can respond by automatically determining the recommended aspect for the future content action and or behavior. The single input may be various types of input such as a mouse click a touch to the location where a button or link appears on a touch screen a voice command indicating the potential selection a keyboard or other button selection or any other type of single input that may be incorporated into the user interface of a computing device. In an alternative embodiment inputs may include voice inputs such that a user may simply ask his or her device e.g. smartphone a question that corresponds to a potential request and the system can determine the recommended aspect based on the verbal question asked by the user. In other embodiments more than a single input may be received before the recommended aspect is determined. For example multiple inputs may be entered by a user to designate additional criteria for the potential request. For example a crowd of authors the user would like to focus the request on may be designated a custom potential request may be designated a unique author that the recommended aspect is to be determined for may be designated etc. In one illustrative embodiment the user may also specify certain goals such as wanting to increase a following drive traffic to a website get a certain number of retweets shares drive new product sales app downloads etc. Such goals can then be utilized by the system when determining recommended aspects for future content actions and or behaviors as discussed below. In an alternative embodiment the system may automatically select a potential request to determine a recommended aspect for a future content action and or behavior. In other words a system may monitor or otherwise check for marketing opportunities chances to post about a trending topic etc. Such monitoring can determine answers to potential requests i.e. a recommended aspect without an explicit input or selection from a user. For example a user may make an adjustment or optimization to his or her marketing mix modeling software business intelligence software enterprise resource planning or other business and operations software that may re appropriate funds refine goals or adjust emphasis on certain business activities and business channels during some period of time. In such cases the system may use these events or other inputs made by one or more users or affiliates of the user to external business software applications as signals for determining recommended aspects and or the degree to which a type volume location or context for certain activity data may now be more or less relevant or significant to the user.

In an operation the recommended aspect for the future content action and or behavior is determined based on activity data of the plurality of authors who are a target of the future content action and or behavior. The recommended aspect is determined at least in part based on activity data that indicates aspects of other content authored by or interacted with by a plurality of authors in a social network website application software mobile application software app etc. prior to receipt of the selection of a potential request. In other words the system uses activity data based on posts by authors and or activity data about how authors interact with posts in a time before the request for a recommended aspect is received. In some embodiments the activity data may be related to a predetermined amount of time preceding the selection of the potential request. For example the activity data may represent only the last day week month year two years etc. of author interaction and or posts. In another embodiment the activity data may include data since the unique author account was formed. In another example the time baseline for the activity data may be related to the time since an author account other than the unique author has posted content or behaved in a certain way. For example if the unique account is new and does not have much activity data associated with it the user may select a different author on which to collect activity data and use to determine recommended aspects for posts. For example the user may select a competitor author account or an author account the user or system views as effective that could be used to determine the recommended aspects. In another example the unique account may have little or no activity data associated with it and no other account specified to base activity data off of. In this example the system may automatically determine authors to use the activity data from. The automatic determination can for example attempt to identify an author or authors the system deems similar to the unique author. Those similar author or authors as well as their followers can be analyzed to determine the activity data used. That is in cases when there is no available data for a user the system would provide a generalized recommendation for what has worked well for other users of the system or users which may share common or similar characteristics with the user. In another example the system may use random authors for the activity data which would generate general recommended aspects as opposed to audience or crowd specific recommended aspects. In another embodiment the system may generate a general recommended aspect and an audience or crowd specific recommended aspect so that a user may compare how recommended aspects differ based on the activity data used and the authors associated with that activity data. The activity data may be other content authored by the unique author content authored by the user with different author accounts content authored by related other authors such as competitors for a similar good or service content authored by authors who are targeting the same audience and customers as the user an internal competitor s authored content internal competitors may be for example marketing professionals or users that work for the same entity and using separate accounts can foster performance tracking and internal competition any unrelated authors the author accounts owned or operated by the user s clients partners or affiliates or some combination of any of the preceding options. The recommended aspects are determined to optimize a response of the plurality of authors to the future content action and or behavior. In other words an aspect is recommended based on activity data such that a response or other interaction with a subsequently posted content is maximized for the goals of the user. The response to the posted content can be optimized for different factors. Such factors may be determined by the user prior to submitting the potential request after submitting the potential request or the factors may be predetermined by the system or default. For example some factors may be optimizing for responses or interactions by new authors authors that have never interacted with the unique author before optimizing for greatest total number of responses or interactions with the posted future content optimizing for a particular type of response or interaction with the posted future content e.g. likes comments shares new unique author page likes or follows shares with a comment appended or other types of response or interaction. The activity data can be analyzed in different ways to optimize response to posts according to a recommended aspect. For example the activity data may indicate a fluctuation as disclosed herein that is related to the other content that meets a predetermined threshold. That is activity data may be analyzed to determine shifts in how authors are behaving. Such shifts may be monitored to see if they reach a particular magnitude or predetermined threshold to determine whether to recommend a particular aspect based on that shift. For example if a plurality of authors has a subset of authors larger than the predetermined threshold that starts posting content related to a particular live television program the system may use that information to recommend an aspect relating to the live television program. Furthermore a fluctuation criteria may also be used to analyze this activity data. That is the system as default programmed or selected by a user may designate a particular type of fluctuation based on the fluctuation criteria to monitor. For example a bottler of soda in a particular region may wish to monitor posts of those in his or her geographical region for social media posts regarding soda sports drinks sparking water etc. and the shifts or fluctuations that are taking place in such an author crowd. Accordingly the user may designate both a custom author crowd for monitoring for activity data as well as fluctuation criteria for monitoring for activity data. In another embodiment a system may recognize automatically an author crowd and or a fluctuation that may be meaningful to an author. For example a fluctuation may be meaningful to the user if it is based on a historical context system usage and user performance other current activities happening on the system or are being currently performed by the user or feedback of other users of the system. The fluctuation could also be considered meaningful based on past searches tracked fluctuations criteria for custom author crowds and or user goals. In this way a system may determine fluctuations that are relevant to a user without the user explicitly setting a tolerance threshold for receiving helpful or meaningful information about fluctuations in authors or author content. For example relevance of fluctuations may be determined based on a determined type or size of fluctuations. That is the system may for example inform or alert a user their crowd or target audience is using more positive sentiment even if the user did not input positive sentiment as a desired fluctuation criteria or specify the threshold for what constitutes a meaningful spike in positive sentiment. A similar analysis may be used on other fluctuations such as behavioral changes topics discussions and comments by users or other actions or behaviors. Such information may also be used as disclosed herein to generate recommended aspects for future content actions and or behaviors as well as generating posting and or taking action on such future content actions and or behaviors.

In alternative embodiments activity data used to determine a recommended aspect for a future content action and or behavior may be activity data related to only one of the unique author s followers. The activity data may also be a unique author s friends likes individuals one or more levels removed from the unique author s followers friends likes etc. or other groups of authors related to a particular author account even an author that is not the unique author . Activity data for determining the recommended aspects and for determining whether posted content meets the recommended aspects may be culled from internet platforms in various ways. For example data from web pages may be retrieved with a web crawler or API or any other data scraping or data transfer techniques. The systems and methods disclosed herein may be accessible via software as a service or as an application such as a mobile app. Information that may be collected to be used as activity data may include but are not limited to various types of data such as author timelines home timelines recent posts followers friendships follower ids friends ids friends lists followers lists suggested users list members list subscribers list owners retweets statuses comments shares updates photos videos animated GIFs pages places and locations tags URLs hashtags contact information events locations other geographic information device information and other metadata trends and trending topics collections projects streams uploaded media direct messages user objects user account settings relevant tweets or users matching a specific query user profile and banner information friend graphs follower graphs transaction history and recent purchase activity other website marketing and advertising information mobile information pins related pins most clicked pins most repinned pins relevant pins from a domain that match a specific query recent snaps and other important objects and content that may be relevant to a user of the system. The data the system obtains through an API can be stored in a database such as a Mongo database. Various types of other databases may also be used such as a distributed database like Hadoop . The system can run algorithms on selected slices of the data either automatically or when requested by the user to calculate certain recommended aspects. That is the system is capable of pre computing recommended aspects to questions even before a user explicitly requests those recommended aspects. These recommended aspects can then pass through the back end web application and are rendered on the front end interface for viewing by users and can also be accessible via a browser extension as discussed in greater length below. In another embodiment recommended aspects and other functionalities are made available through a mobile app. In some embodiments multiple algorithms may be combined to deliver a single recommendation. Sometimes recommended aspects based on the algorithms can fluctuate. Accordingly the system can synthesize results from multiple analyses performed at different times with the same or similar algorithms into one recommendation that can be more reliable and can help users maximize their marketing effectiveness or impact.

Various types of recommended aspects are contemplated herein for the future content actions or behaviors. For example a recommended aspect could be a social network website application software or mobile application software app in which the future content is recommended to be authored a time of day in which the future content is recommended to be authored a length that the future content is recommended to be a subject matter that the future content is recommended to be related to a type of content that the future content is recommended to be a tag that the future content is recommended to include an indication that the future content is recommended to be lifestyle content or product content an indication whether to use paid advertising services on a social network website application software or mobile application software app in which the future content is recommended to be authored a public figure author to engage with the future content or a universal resource indicator URI that the future content is recommended to include. Other recommended aspects of future content may include any other additional aspects or recommendations for example media to attach to or include with the future content style tone or word choice of the future content an explanation or justification of why a certain action should be taken a volume of future content an amount of time that should be spent creating future content an amount of time that should be spent distributing and promoting future content other purchase decisions or investments that should be made by the user etc. Other recommended aspects and or potential requests that may be selected may include but are not limited to How many times should I post today How many of my posts should contain images How can I be more relevant to my audience today What are some trending topics I should know about How can I insert my brand or voice into an existing conversation that is relevant to my target audience and or my brand What is the promotional climate for a paid vs. organic campaign right now How favorable are the marketing conditions What s the best mix of paid and organic content to publish today may be expressed for example as a percentage or proportion 1 out of 8 posts should be paid etc. What type of content would resonate most with my audience today that is what type of content should I post Different types of content may include types such as base line tweets hashtag content behind the scenes exclusives quotes inspirational messages blog shares list based content listicals how to guides podcasts ebooks retweets with comments media mentions research case studies animated GIFs webinars original media infographics memes selfies PowerPoint slideware photo collage illustrations cartoons animations branded product content YouTube and Vimeo videos or shorter looping videos such as Vines or Instagram Video.

In various embodiments recommended aspects may be constrained or determined based on factors other than activity data. For example other factors may include a user or unique author s advertising budget a predetermined number of target future contents available time to spend on marketing activities a size or location of a target market the availability of other tools and resources etc. For example if a user has a limited budget the system may restrain from recommending numerous paid content posts. If an author has a stated goal to post content four times a day the system will not recommend posting more or significantly more than four times. This may be useful if for example a user has limited man power or time to post content. Recommendations may also be based on a size of a target market or any other factors of a target market. For example a user may produce large wind turbines. In this business the user may sell a significant amount of its product to a very small number of consumers. Accordingly page likes from non wind turbine consumers would not be very valuable to the user. Instead the user may wish to focus posted content efforts on a particular subset of authors that is more likely to actually purchase wind turbines. Accordingly the recommendations may be constrained by the size of the target market and the types of engagements or interactions sought through the posted content.

In an operation a content and or a content template is generated according to the recommended aspect. In other words when a recommended aspect is determined the system may use that aspect to generate a content for posting or a content template for posting that is generated according to the recommended aspect. For example if the system recommends posting about a baseball pitcher that is eight innings into a perfect game that is being broadcast on television the system may generate a post for the user to post such as WOW Sandy Koufax is on tonight lightsout perfectgamebid. In other words the system can provide automatic content generation. The system may do so based on various factors or inputs such as the posts of other authors about the same content. For example the hashtag lightsout may have been used by authors the last time a pitcher was having a great game. In another example the hashtag perfectgamebid may be in use in posts during the current game for which the automatically generated content is about. Other ways to automatically generate content may also be used.

For example a user may use the system to monitor discussion of professional athletes such as NBA stars and their teams. The system may monitor fluctuations such as when discussion peaks during game e.g. when a player hits a game winner which can trigger automatic advertisement generation and or posting for apparel and other branded promotional products that are relevant to that player and franchise. This may happen on a social network where the discussion is taking place or through other marketing channels such as websites email text etc. In another example sports apparel brands sponsor many professional athletes in order to build relationships with the fan bases of those athletes. When a star athlete has a strong performance during a game discussion of that player may spike on social media. When this happens consumers may have been activated on the topic of the sport and the game the teams and that star athlete among other things . Fans may even decide to follow a certain account or engage with certain social media posts during or after the game. Activity fluctuations such as these represent prime opportunities to promote branded apparel products and services to those audiences. Accordingly the systems and methods disclosed herein can be utilized to both automatically generate content when such an opportunity arises and automatically post the content recommend or execute a campaign etc.

In an operation the content with the recommended aspect is posted. Here the user may actually post the recommended content in the unique author s account. Where an action or behavior is subject of a recommended aspect the system can facilitate performing the action or behavior or scheduling the action or behavior. In some embodiments the unique author may not be an account controlled by the user. For example the user may be tracking a competitor s author account. In this case the content would not be posted to the competitor author account.

In an operation the impact of the posted content is determined. The impact is determined by how the plurality of authors responded to or interacted with the content posted according to the recommended aspect. In this way a user or unique author can determine whether a recommended aspect and subsequent content post was effective. For example the system may determine how many likes comments shares retweets mentions etc. a content post has received. The system may display this impact to the user or author and may also send an alert to the user or author to let them know how effective their action was or group of their recent actions were. In another example the system may measure the impact of the content more indirectly. For example instead of determining authors direct interactions with the content posted the system may evaluate other subsequent behaviors activities or communications made by the plurality of authors on one or more social network to determine the effectiveness of the posted content. In an embodiment where a recommended aspect is related to an action or behavior the impact of the action or behavior is also determined. The system or user may also evaluate the impact of the content behaviors or actions through certain business software and performance measurement dashboards that capture aggregate and display data from other areas of a user s business such as sales numbers and website performance.

In an operation an agility rating is determined or calculated based on the unique author s posted content as it compares to the recommended aspect. The agility rating may be determined based on the discussion below with respect to .

In an alternative embodiment the system may use activity data to predict the impact of a recommended aspect of a future content to be posted action to be taken or behavior to engage in. In other words the system can based on all the retrieved activity data determine the expected outcome of the future content if it is posted action if it is taken or behavior if it is engaged in according to the recommended aspect. For example the system may determine a recommendation that a user should post about a presidential debate thirty 30 minutes after the debate begins. Based on activity data of author actions during live television events the system may determine thirty minutes into the program is the best time to post. For example the activity data may indicate that an estimated 20 more total authors will view or interact with a content posted about 15 45 minutes after the beginning of a nationally televised live event as a opposed to the rest of the debate. Accordingly the system has output the recommended aspect of posting 30 minutes into the debate. Accordingly the user may also be informed that following this recommended aspect when posting results in 20 more interactions with the post. This can help a user engage with the system and motivates the user to use the system and actually post content based on the recommended aspect because they get an indication of what the post will do before it even happens. The system may further estimate an absolute impact of the posted content if it is posted according to the recommended aspect. For example as above the system may have determined that 20 more users interact with a content that is posted about 30 minutes into a live television event. To determine a baseline different factors may be used. For example the type of television event the unique author s current follower base time of day and other factors may impact what a baseline of estimated interaction would be. As an example the system may determine that a baseline estimate number of authors who will likely interact with a post from the unique author during the presidential debate would be about 15 000. Accordingly this baseline number can be displayed to the user alongside an indication that if the recommended aspect is followed the system estimates an increase of 20 or 3 000 increased interactions up to 18 000 if the user posts content at the right time during the debate. Again this estimate and display may encourage further use of and engagement with the system.

In an operation a recommended aspect for future content action and or behavior based on activity data of a plurality of authors is determined. The recommended aspect may be determined similar to the recommended aspects discussed above at length with respect to . In an operation the recommended aspect is provided to the unique author. In another example the recommended aspect may be provided to the user. In yet another example the unique author and the user may be the same person or entity so the recommended aspect may be provided to the unique author and the user. Similarly if a unique author has multiple users associated with the unique author the recommendations may be sent to the multiple users associated with unique author.

In an operation the system determines whether the unique author posted the future content or with the recommended aspect action and or behavior. In other words the system determines whether the user or unique author has actually taken the recommended aspect and posted content or engaged in an action or behavior accordingly. For example if the system recommended a time of day to post content did the user or author post content on or around that time of day 

In an operation the system determines an agility rating that indicates responsiveness of the unique author to the recommended aspect. The agility rating measures a user or unique author s aptitude at responding to and posting content that is in accordance with recommended aspects. In order to determine the agility rating the system may first determine if content with the recommended aspect has actually been posted by the user or the unique author that is being agility rated. The agility rating is ultimately designed to measure how well a user or author reacts to recommendations provided to it by the system or in other ways i.e. the agility rating may still be utilized to measure effectiveness even if another platform is used to generate recommended aspects for content behaviors etc. . In an alternative embodiment a user may publish content run an ad execute an e mail campaign or take any other action or behavior that may not be detectable by the system. For example this may occur when the content action or behavior is out of the platform of the user s author accounts. Accordingly the inputs used to calculate an agility rating may be received in different ways. For example the system may allow a user to manually input data that indicates a response success feedback etc. of the user s out of platform content action or behavior. For example if the user runs an e mail campaign that is sent to the user s 2 000 Twitter followers the system may prompt the user to manually enter how many of those 2 000 followers followed a link in the e mail to the user s webpage. Such a metric can be used to determine agility ratings even if the response itself cannot be detected by the system. In another embodiment a manual input of a response may be input by a user with voice recognition the user may tell the system what the response was like. Such ratings can be derived for a user s product or accounts or can be derived for a competitor author account that is not controlled by the user. In this way an agility rating can also indicate how well a competitor is reacting to opportunities in the market. The agility rating may further be determined based on whether the user or author has posted a plurality of future contents taken a plurality of actions and or engaged in a plurality of behaviors that have or are associated with a plurality of recommended aspects. In other words the agility rating may reflect a user or author s aptitude over time at responding to various recommended aspects and actually posting content with those recommended aspects. When determining the agility rating it may be based on a plurality of recommendations and posted contents over a predetermined amount of time. For example the predetermined amount of time may be related to a period of time that occurred most recently relative to the determining of the agility rating. For example the agility rating may capture recommendations and subsequent posts within the last three 3 months. In another embodiment the agility rating may calculated for different discrete periods of time. For example a user may calculate two of the author s agility ratings for the first six months of last year to compare how the author is doing in the first six months of this year. In another embodiment the agility rating may relate to an entire amount of time than a user or author account has been active which would yield a sort of all time score for the user or author.

Other various factors may also be used to determine an agility rating. For example the agility rating may be a relative score. For example the system may also track how internal other professionals within the same company or organization or external outside competitors are responding or reacting to recommended aspects for content posts whether or not those competitors are actually receiving or being notified of the recommended aspects . The system can use this information to determine who is reacting to the recommended aspects better or worse as compared to each other. Thus a relative agility rating can be determined rather than just a concrete agility rating that goes up or down based merely on whether a recommendation is being followed. In this way an indication of how well a user or author is doing as compared to his competitors peers or other users attempting to reach the same or similar target audiences can be determined. Another way an agility rating may be modified or customized is by selecting a custom author crowd for the activity data. In this way the recommended aspects are determined based only on activity data relating to a particular group of authors. In this embodiment different users may have specified different crowds or groups of authors which can lead to different recommendations. For example User A may be advised to post eight times a day while User B may be advised to post twice a day. If User A misses one post for seven out of eight they may receive a relatively higher score than if User B misses one post for one out of two because User B missed a much higher percentage of their opportunities than User A. That is an agility rating determination may be adjusted based on the recommendations that a user or users have received. In other embodiments the agility rating may be determined based on a number of recommendations the user accesses per time period the number of webpages or screens the user visits the number of goals the user has set the number of goals the user has actually attained in a certain time period or all time using the system whether or not he is outperforming industry or pre established benchmarks etc. The system could also take into account whether the user followed recommendations for what are deemed to be more advanced tactical recommendations by the system that may require additional time effort experience or know how and budget to execute on. In another embodiment the system may take into account effectiveness of future content posts actions taken and or behaviors engaged in to determine agility ratings. For example if a post is effective at generating positive interaction that may positively impact the agility rating. In other words if a fluctuation of content generated by a plurality of authors is significant or meets a particular threshold it can be used to determine the agility rating. The fluctuation may be a change in authored content author action or author behavior by the plurality of authors occurring over a period of time and with respect to the future content action and or behavior. An agility rating may be a percentile as described herein a letter grade a 1 100 rating or any other type of scale or rating. The system can also display agility ratings in tiers as compared to other users. This display can be anonymous with un named participants or could actually show the names of other users. The system could also show high performing and or low performing users.

Some users for example those who pay more may also have the ability find out more about and have access to more features relating to the computation of the agility rating. The system can provide these users with precise actions and recommendations on how to improve his her agility rating. Such a functionality may even interrelate a list of marketing recommendations that were delivered to the user and then display how each one had impacted the user s agility rating. For example such a report may show to the user that he she was very good at following X category of recommendations but not Y category of recommendations. As a result of this performance the system would then demonstrate the impact the user s tactics had on his her agility rating. If a user had neglected to follow all recommendations about the timing of new marketing content or had followed only 3 out of 10 then it may be a very simple concept to convey to the user that if he she posts each type of content at the suggested times then he or she will see an increase in their agility rating. Similarly it may be important for the user to learn precisely which set of recommended tactics he she had overlooked or perhaps misinterpreted or what specifically contributed to the decline or growth in the user s agility rating.

In an operation the system monitors agility ratings of a plurality of users. In an operation the system determines that an agility rating of a first user has dropped below the agility rating of the second user. In an operation the system sends an alert to the first user indicating that the second user has passed the first user in agility rating. Multiple other types of alerts and or differences in agility rating between a first and second user may be determined in other embodiments. In alternative embodiments the system may also monitor for different thresholds or comparisons between the agility ratings of different users or authors. For example the system may also determine that the first user s rating has risen above the agility rating of the second user. In another example a user s agility rating may be monitored in comparison to an average of other user s agility rating such as a group of competitor author accounts. In other embodiments the system may monitor for predetermined metrics as opposed to or in addition to comparisons with other authors. For example if a user or author reaches an all time high agility rating the user may be alerted of that. In another example if a user or author s agility rating goes significantly down or up by a particular threshold or percentage the user or author may be warned. In another embodiment the system may monitor for any movement up or down increase or decrease in the agility rating. In another embodiment the system may send the alerts to someone other than the author or user that the alerts are about. For example if a user is tracking competitors the user may receive alerts on author accounts that they do not control. In another embodiment a company may have a large staff of marketing professionals. Each marketing professional may have his or her own user account to use the system disclosed herein on behalf of one or more of the company s author accounts. Supervisors of the company s marketing department can therefore receive alerts agility ratings and additional information based on the individual marketing user accounts to monitor performance of their employees. Further the marketing professionals may be organized into teams based on multiple author accounts owned by the company. In this way by receiving alerts agility ratings etc. about the multiple author accounts teams of marketing professionals can also be monitored on their performance. Furthermore a plurality of authors or users may also be ranked by agility rating in this way. For example a leaderboard showing a top in an industry or at a company or team of a company may be maintained. In another ranking methodology the system may calculate a percentile rank to indicate how the user or author is doing. For example if a user s agility rating is higher than 90 of his peers at a marketing firm he is ranked at the 90th percentile. In order to select a group of authors for ranking comparing tracking alerting etc. a user or author may use a search criteria to define a custom author crowd as disclosed herein for such functions. Using a search criteria to specify a custom author crowd can be effected in different ways. For example a user may interact with a user interface and display to specify a custom author crowd. A user may specify authors they would like to include in a crowd or may specify authors whose followers should be included in the user s custom author crowd. For example a user may type in a brand name or brand names a user may specify Twitter handles upload a list of usernames actual names brands etc. the user may choose predetermined crowds from a drop down list or checklist etc. In another embodiment a potential request may be selected to yield a determined recommendation for authors to add to a custom author crowd. Output reports of agility ratings history etc. can be downloaded emailed etc. to their team of users a boss etc. showing how each of the tactics of each user has individually contributed to their goal and increased the overall engagement agility rating etc. of the brand. The systems and methods disclosed in this application to determine and provide recommended aspects and personalized recommendations may also be applied to a variety of educational and higher education contexts and settings to facilitate the teaching learning understanding and application of certain materials. Student performance teaching methods and standards vary thus more customized approaches may be beneficial. Variations of the systems and methods of the presently disclosed system may also be used to help instruct measure enhance and benchmark student knowledge in a set of business related or non business related subjects. Further the generation of an agility rating may also be applied to incentivize or otherwise encourage certain behaviors actions goals and outcomes of participants which may include both instructors and students and other parties directly involved in or influencing the education process.

Alerts may be utilized in other embodiments. For example a user can specify a recommendation and specific threshold or customized criteria which must first be met before the system sends alerts to the user with new marketing opportunities or calculates fresh marketing recommendations these may be in product alerts via email text push notification mobile alerts etc. . The alerts could be based on fluctuations agility rating size of custom author crowds etc. Alerts can also be generally sent whenever new information is available for viewing. Such alerts may also be used to signal as to when the user has reached a certain recommendation limit or quota with their account or when a user is underutilizing his or her allotted quota or some other indicator of system usage and the user s current position relative to some threshold or benchmark. This may help the user preserve their budget or offer opportunities for the system to offer the user paid content and or access to certain features. Some content available to paid users can be the ability to refresh results recommendations etc. frequently in an on demand fashion. Other users for example may only get to update their results recommendations etc. infrequently such as on a schedule e.g. once a day hourly set number of refreshes in a time period . Another way features may be divided between paid and free or discounted users is for example a free or discounted user may only have one author account in which they can determine recommended aspects for future content posts actions and or behaviors while a paid account may have 2 5 10 unlimited etc. author accounts based on their paid status or may have different number of author accounts depending on how much is paid. This may be valuable for those managing multiple brands or wanting to track competitors or targeting discrete or multiple audiences.

In some embodiments a target audience or market is not contained or is only partially contained within an author s current following. In such an embodiment customer author crowds are useful. For example a user may want to know when it is best to post new Vine videos to reach Audience A vs. Audience B similarly the user may want to know whether promoting an infographic or podcast will be more effective at engaging their target audience at 3 pm on a Friday or for meeting some specific marketing business goal they have with respect to that target audience. In another example a user wonders when they should tweet if they want to engage video gamers vs. fans of Manchester United . If they work in marketing at EA Sports and are trying to promote the next FIFA game they may want to know about both crowds.

When first accessing the system users may be able to view pre selected pre computed recommendation aspects based upon their prior usage of the system. That is users may not want to go through the exercise of re checking or re selecting each desired recommendation aspect every time they use the system. Instead the system can pre populate these results for the users to view quickly without extra effort. In this way the user will have the option to either select a new set of recommendations in his current session or have a shortcut to acquire fresh insights from the same set of recommendations as his prior session. In a similar fashion a user may receive a suggested set of recommendations that the system determines may be of interest to the user. This will serve the dual use case of experimentation and consistency. In other words the system can save past potential request selections as well as the recommended aspects determined in response to the potential request selections in order to allow for easier use. A history for a user may include information such as the recommended aspects delivered when they were delivered to the user how long the recommended aspects are fresh or the time date at which they expire and may no longer be valid when the recommendation was acted on by the user whether or not the user actually followed the advice of the system other information that was input by the user and used by the system to provide a certain recommendation and or the impact each of these marketing tactics had on a particular goal or goals of the user. In another example a user may receive a suggested set of recommendations that the system determines may be of interest to the user which the user may or may not have previously accessed. Benchmarks or industry averages may also be shown for comparison. A user can also submit through the interface new potential requests that they want added to the system.

In an illustrative embodiment the system may receive requests of recommended aspects to monitor over time. For example a user may input a potential request such as When should I post product related content today In the previously described embodiments selecting this request may generate a time such as 3 PM post meridian . After receiving this selection the system may send an alert to the user at 3 PM or at a predetermined time before 3 PM to remind the user to post content according to the recommended aspect. In another embodiment the system may receive a selection of a custom author crowd and the system may alert user if that custom author crowd grows or shrinks based on the criteria that specifies the custom author crowd. For example a user may indicate a criteria that designates a custom author crowd of everyone on Facebook who likes a page relating to Fig Newtons . In one example the system may determine that this custom author crowd grows to reach one million authors. In accordance with this determination that the crowd has reached a predetermined threshold the system may generate an alert that includes a recommended aspect for a content post. For example the alert may recommend that the author post a celebratory message relating to gaining a one millionth user of fanatical Fig Newtons followers. In this embodiment the alert may be determined automatically or may be determined based on preset characteristics determined by the user. In other words the user may have preset that they would like to be alerted when one million users is reached or the system may automatically determine or have default criteria for generating alerts in this way. The system may also automatically determine that such events represent new marketing opportunities for a user.

In another illustrative embodiment the system may determine an agility rating or a change in agility rating in advance of a user or author actually posting a future content taking an action or engaging in a behavior with the recommended aspect. In this way a user or author may be able to know how their agility rating will change if they post content according to a recommended aspect. In another example the system may determine a different metric in advance of an actual post of future content action taken or behavior engaged in. For example the system may predict how a draft post should be best optimized to achieve a different user goal such as sales from a website or new registrations to a mailing list subscription service clicks and engagement impressions reach etc. This can help foster further engagement of authors and users with the system because they can see the benefits of following the recommendations. In another embodiment the user and or author may also get to see the change in their agility rating immediately after posting a content that follows a recommendation. In other words a user and or author s agility rating may be updated in real time to further improve engagement with the system. For example the system may scan the contents of a post currently being drafted as well as any uploaded media metadata the current time etc. to see if the user is following the recommended aspects. In another embodiment the system may send an alert or message regarding a change in agility rating or potential change in agility rating if the user has not posted the content yet to a competitor in order to spur on the competitor to use the system as well. In another embodiment a real time indication of how an agility rating may change can be calculated and displayed while an author is in the process of authoring a post. For example if a recommendation is to make a post between 80 120 characters an author may be writing a post and see his or her agility rating go up when the post goes higher than 80 characters and goes back down if the post goes over 120 characters. In another example the recommended aspect may be to author a post with three hashtags. While three hashtags will result in the best increase in agility rating the system can also show incremental increases in agility rating as one and two hashtags are put into the post. Once a content is actually posted published the agility rating can go up permanently based on the content. In another example the user s draft tweet could be 50 characters in length and have an infographic attached to it with the funfacts hashtag. The system may then tell the user that in fact 60 characters are ideal so their text length may be shown in red coloring and reaffirm that indeed an infographic is the best content choice to engage their audience shown in e.g. green text . It may also approve of the funfacts hashtag because it meets a suggested character length and hashtag per post quantity. However the timing may not be right so the system may display in red wait to post until 12 pm. This same technique could be applied across any recommendation on any platform. Such a tool is a powerful on demand marketing helper to help deal with many questions a marketing professional may have in real time. This tool may also be connected directly to the medium on which the user posts the content. For example the system may facilitate a user working in the compose tweet window of Twitter . In another embodiment the system may calculate in real time a prediction of how a particular action behavior or content will impact other business goals. For example if a business goal either predetermined by the system or input by the user is to increase a followers for a Twitter account the system can also predict calculate how a post will increase followers to the account. In another embodiment the system may calculate an impact and or agility score change while actions and or behaviors are being scheduled. For example in a social media management system such as HootSuite a user can schedule posts or other actions behaviors e.g. selecting day time content should be posted . A user may also specify a location to tag a post e.g. Boston Mass. or select different targeting options for a post action or behavior e.g. country mobile device specific crowd . A user may also engage in behaviors like creating certain meta tags on their website to describe certain content page title tags or use alternate keywords as part of a strategy. For example the strategy may be to drive a higher ranking in organic search results. In another example a user who is using Photoshop to edit or create images design graphic for a post the system can determine in real time that if the user for example cropped an image in a particular way or made certain filter adjustments to it the image may be more likely to drive favorable results for a business goal and or agility rating. Other actions or behaviors can also be monitored in real time to determine how business goals and or an agility rating will be impacted. For example templating decisions for a website or website optimizations may be monitored. In another example page speed page load changes or other performance optimizations for web visitors fixing broken links or dead pages in a website navigation may be actions that are monitored by the system in real time to determine how would that action impact business goals and or an agility rating. Another business goal that impact may be determined for is search result optimization. For example if the user is updating a website the system may automatically determine how likely a web search for a particular term will result in finding the user s website.

The systems and methods disclosed herein may also include a registration process. First a user may login to the system or create an account. In some embodiments login names such as a Twitter handle may be used to login to the present system as well. This may be useful if for example the system operates utilizing Twitter . In this way the system can use the login information to access data from Twitter to retrieve activity data and post content. Authorization protocols such as OAuth may be used to obtain tokens from users that allow the system to request data from networks such as Twitter s API. In other embodiments the system may directly access a social network s user database or achieve access through a third party API or data provider such as Datasift for Facebook Accordingly the system can collect data like an author s timeline profile information follower graph friend information lifetime tweets last tweet etc. A user may optionally add in additional login information or account specifications so that the system can retrieve data on multiple accounts.

A user may enter various information to set up an account. Some of the information provided may be used to determine recommended aspects for posting content taking actions or engaging in behavior. Such information may be changed by the user to adjust how the recommended aspects are determined in the future. For example inputs to register for an account may include contact information your name and email address . A further input may be time zone allowing the system to appropriately deliver recommendations related to content publication timing. A user may also specify the author accounts e.g. Twitter handle s they want recommendations for i.e. the recommendee . A user does not need to be the owner of an author account to receive recommendations for it. Activity data can be collected from public or private information sources on the internet. A user may also specify all or just significant competitors. Such a specification may be by specifying a brand name product name Twitter handle Facebook name etc. In one example the potential request How much should I post today may be informed by combining the results of multiple algorithms. One input can be related to competitors activities. For example the system finds that a competitor named by the user is posting much more often than the user and that competitor is receiving a high post engagement rate and so the system may recommend that the user should increase the volume of content he she posts on a given day by some factor or multiple. Users may also specify one or more goals for their business or marketing initiatives. These goals may either be long term or short term goals which may impact how the system determines certain recommended aspects for the user on a given day.

A user may also input products brands services campaign indicators such as hashtags etc. that they will be promoting through their user account or through one or more author accounts. This can be used as an input to determine recommend aspects for users regarding for example the frequency and proportion of lifestyle vs. product oriented content they should post on a given day. Accordingly the systems and methods disclosed herein recommend that a user balance publishing lifestyle and product or explicitly branded content. A loyal following may be better gained by not talking about yourself and how beneficial your product is all day long. Rather it can be beneficial to talk about the topics that are of particular interest to your audience.

A user may also specify the size of their target market. Such data may be used as an algorithm input for certain recommended aspects or types of aspects. A user may also specify to what extent they feel their current following contains their ideal targets. This input may be used to determine an approximate target market. That is if a user thinks they have only captured 40 e.g. 400 000 people of their target market their total target market is the 40 e.g. 400 000 people of captured authors plus an additional 60 e.g. 600 000 people equaling the total target market 100 e.g. 1 000 000 people . A user may also specify their primary goals which can be used to determine for example how much and which kinds of advertising the system should recommend that the user do or use. A user could also specify their advertising budget specify the amount of time they spend online marketing or any other information related to use of or goals in social media. Information such as this can help adjust certain recommendations according to the user s preferences daily routine specific business and team needs operational financial feasibility etc. on certain tasks and recommendations.

After logging in and or creating an account the user is shown the available potential requests for recommended aspect types and can select the ones they want. In some embodiments certain potential requests may be available for paying customers. After selecting the potential requests desired the user can make a single click or interaction to generate all of the recommended aspects. The recommended aspects could be displayed on the same page with the potential requests or could be displayed on a separate page or on some other medium leveraged by the user. In an alternative embodiment separate account creation may not be needed by the system. For example if the system disclosed herein is integrated into a social network such as Twitter a user may log in and access the various functions of the system using their Twitter handle and password. Advantageously the presently disclosed system may also be integrated into different types of marketing and social media management dashboards such as HootSuite or other business software. Recommended aspects may be used in conjunction with or to inform tactical decisions or other tasks that may be executed through or performed while using other marketing business or consumer software applications. The pairing of the presently disclosed system with other systems may give rise to one or more new or complementary recommendations. Embodiments in which the system functionality is interrelated or enhanced by other systems or vice versa are contemplated.

The systems and methods may be executed on computing devices in various ways such as those discussed above with respect to . Another way in which the disclosed embodiments may be executed is through a browser extension that will allow users to access their recommended aspects outside of a web application. A browser extension can allow users to access their personalized insights on the fly. These can be valuable for users who are busy using other web based software platforms to create content and engage with customers e.g. HootSuite or Sprinklr sending emails or when they are on Twitter.com. That way system does not force users to be on an additional webpage or inside an application when they want to harvest new insights using the systems and methods disclosed herein. Instead the system can deliver these answers to the specific context in which they are desired by the user. Through a browser extension users are given the opportunity to view updated analysis results from the set of recommended aspects just as would be available to them in the web application. The users may be able to choose from a fresh set of questions via the browser extension. In yet another embodiment users may be limited to the set of potential requests and recommended aspect types which they had accessed during their last session not using the browser extension or mobile app.

In one embodiment the system may without specific selections of potential requests from a user still determine recommended aspects for future content actions and or behaviors. For example the system can measure fluctuations in data user author crowd entire network etc. . Such fluctuations can be measured manually directed by a user but may also be scheduled by a user or automatically scheduled on the back end a default schedule . For example data processing may occur for all users in one hour increments so the system may provide hourly answers. The system can then identify new marketing opportunities based upon fluctuations in data and or the user s current climate position and goals i.e. identify favorable marketing conditions for the user . The system can also convert these opportunities into practical insights and one or more suggested marketing tactics. The system can also learn from the user s performance or fulfillment of certain recommended aspects. Based upon the user s subsequent activities and successes and failures and those of other users of the system the system may provide additional recommendations or suggested tactics for the user. The system may also adjust a user s recommendations to make the performance of certain tactics more manageable. Such adjustments may be made based on time availability financial resources access to certain types of content and media for example if the user has no way of producing an infographic the system should learn from that either by user input or via the user s activity and instead recommend the next best type of content the user should post instead or general performance fulfillment of recommendations. In one example if the system recommends the user should post 10 times each day but he she only posts 4 times it may be a function of the available time that user has in the day to devote to social media marketing. Therefore the system should learn from this user s activity and adjust the future recommendations like this that are delivered to the user until he she attains more steady fulfillment of each recommendation. That is the optimal recommendation may be unrealistic for the user to fulfill right away but he she may learn to do it over time.

Other features can also be included in various embodiments. For example users can export recommendation aspect results into a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel to save for later viewing and or analysis. A user may also be able to download other document types such as PDF or PowerPoint files. The system may provide a Refer A Friend link where the user will have the opportunity to choose between sending a pre populated tweet or an email message to a specified recipient and invite them to use the system. Users may also have the ability to access additional content through the system that provide enhanced tutorials guides and extra helpful information that will help them execute and improve upon their marketing. There may also be a leaderboard that is viewable to users containing performance measures of other users of the system or a forum in which users of the system can interact with each other to share advice and best practices or ask for help. The system may also provide a workspace where the user can experiment with design store or test different variations of his or her content. The system may also provide a series of pre loaded samples of recommended aspects for popular authors to illustrate how users of the system who may work for companies of different sizes and industries or foreign countries may be able gain meaningful insights from the system.

The systems and methods disclosed herein can be integrated with any social network. Other social networks the system could integrate with may include but are not limited to Pinterest Yelp Flickr Meetup Tagged YouTube Vine Facebook Instagram QQ WhatsApp QZone LinkedIn Skype GOOgle Viber Tumblr Snapchat LINE Sina Weibo VK Reddit StumbleUpon Foursquare etc.

The concept of generating recommended aspects based on potential requests can be used in other sectors of the marketing industry. For example recommended aspects can be determined as disclosed herein for areas including but not limited to display ad spending mobile ad spending radio ad spending SMS and text message marketing SMS and text message ad spending search engine marketing search ad spending TV ad spending email marketing email ad spending b2b marketing lead generation content marketing public relations market segmentation mobile content market research digital marketing and website marketing display marketing programmatic advertising real time marketing marketing automation loyalty programs couponing social commerce and social selling mobile and tablet commerce e commerce omni channel retailing cost per click local search mobile search paid search search engine optimization SEO mobile social media native advertising ratings and reviews social media marketing social media ad spending digital video digital video ad spending mobile video mobile video ad spending video marketing print media advertising direct mail in store displays outdoor marketing event marketing non traditional and guerilla marketing telemarketing cross media marketing daily deals graphic design and illustration other art forms etc. Accordingly the systems and methods disclosed herein are not meant to be limited to a certain medium or type of marketing.

The systems and methods disclosed herein can also be used to manage and systematize marketing experiments. For example users as disclosed herein can consume their tactical and best practice recommendations from the system whenever they want wherever they want. The system may also include a campaign tactic or a group of campaign tactics that the user could select to move forward with. Tactics can be directed towards one marketing channel or involve conducting activities on multiple marketing channels. Such a system could provide an integrated or multi channel programmatic ad spending mechanism or some other structure where the system may recommend a suite of marketing channels platforms or devices for the user to try out that day and then allow the user to execute certain promotional tactics and new marketing activities. Such an embodiment could convert answers trends and other data driven insights into an array of pre populated tactics methods and campaigns that the user may choose to trigger test modify or ignore. Such tactics could include a group of recommendations across multiple social networks for example. Social networks or sellers of advertising services may offer users of the system promotional access to advertising services to increase their business. Similarly social networks or sellers advertising services may also offer the systems disclosed herein as a promotional tool to their existing customers in order to help increase per customer ad spend. The systems and methods disclosed herein may also convince users who have floating or ongoing marketing campaigns and flexible budgets to allow companies to react to these new on the fly marketing opportunities determined by the system. This could also increase overall ad spend.

For example the system may partner with multiple advertising platforms such as Google Adwords Twitter Ads and Facebook Advertising. The various advertising products offered by these platforms can be displayed in the user s campaign menu. The system can automatically create a customized marketing tactical response or suggested activity set for the user based upon that user s freshly available recommended aspects for content posts and what is going on in his or her audience or the advertising medium generally that day.

The system may have already learned from user submitted information that a user s primary marketing goal is to drive installs of a new mobile application. The system can determine based on previous results with an advertising product or a stated purpose of an advertising product what might work best to accomplish those goals. For example an App Card product by Twitter Ads may be recommended for this goal. The user may have also specified a secondary goal of growing his follower base. The Twitter Ads product that may be recommended for quickly gaining relevant followers can be a Promoted Account. The goals of a user may be captured by the system with explicit reference to a single advertising medium e.g. what is your top goal on Twitter or they could be the user s overall goals for social media marketing or his business. There may even be some required interpretation by the system of which advertising product is a preferred solution for meeting a certain goal of the user if this information is not readily available or open to interpretation.

However at certain times online marketing climate conditions can be used to direct a shift in advertising strategy as determined by the system disclosed herein. Accordingly a user may experiment with an additional or alternative advertising products mediums suppliers services etc. based on a current climate at a particular time or on a particular day. Recommendations to experiment in this way can be determined through analysis of variables in activity data as disclosed herein. For example when a user has identified a set of competitors the competitor accounts may experience a spike in follower growth rates and have an order of magnitude larger number of followers than the user. In such a case it may be justified for the user to shift priorities for the day to use for example a Promoted Account product instead of an App Card because the current climate indicates that there are many authors out there following new pages or accounts that are similar to the user s. Therefore switching to a strategy designed to get more followers would be well timed in this scenario. Additionally users discussing or engaging regarding similar content may be tightly connected and actively engaged in retweeting messages that day so there may be opportunity for the user to receive more exposure for the user s Twitter handle as well an additional incentive to try to reach those targets right now. In this case the system can present Promoted Account on a screen as a proposed tactic that the user may choose to execute a along with a promoted App Card b ahead of or in place of an App Card or c in combination with some other set of suggested marketing tactics or campaigns. That is advertising tactics considered to be advantageous may be calculated for and suggested to a user irrespective of that user s explicit goals or established marketing plan. This new suggested ad can include a performance estimate indicating the expected impact that the ad may have and pre populated creative elements such as text images designs tags and other inputs. Additionally the template of this new ad could be based off an existing message or a previous ad campaign developed by the user.

Suggested targets or goals could also be generated by the system and can be customized and edited by the user at various points in time. Targets can include but are not limited to factors such as location gender language devices platforms operating systems and carriers keywords followers interests tailored audiences TV targeting shows networks genres etc. other behaviors and characteristics the placement of where this ad will appear on Twitter e.g. in users timelines etc. In one simple example the system could detect that a certain percentage of the user s target audience is active in New York right now a potential request regarding geographic locations of active users may have been selected or the system may have determined this on its own . The system may then automatically input and recommend New York as a specific criterion for geographic targeting for a suggested advertisement on Twitter at that time. The user could also add targets or exclusions to any of the recommended targets certain exclusions may also be suggested by the system. For example the user may target the entire United States except California for a product advertisement. The user may also specify a total budget daily budget a custom bid or max duration or time frame for a selected campaign.

In another embodiment the system may suggest and provide the capability for a user to execute a new Facebook ad. A suggested Facebook ad could be shown in the display of a user s computing device as part of a marketing menu alongside the tactical advertising suggestions for Twitter . The display of all of these suggested items may also reflect a ranking or sorting of the recommended tactics by order of importance or in terms of suggested priority to the user shelf life how long until the opportunity expires or will need to be recalculated or by the relevance and predicted impact of each tactic the goals of the user or by the time and effort it will take for the user to execute the recommended tactic.

In another embodiment the user s goals may be different for different mediums. For example a user s top goal on Facebook may be to use advertising to increase online traffic and conversions on the user s website while the user s goal on Twitter is to increase the number of followers the user has. The system may sometime after the goals were set detect that the user s target audience for Facebook website conversions activated in the geographic area of the user s headquarters that day may be perceptive to liking the company s Facebook page. For example a high proportion of these authors online posts contain words and phrases which are deemed to reflect positive sentiment. Given this environment the system may recommend that the user leverage a supplementary advertising tactic on Facebook that day to capitalize on this new change. Because of the opportunity to drive local awareness of his company the user can be alerted to and given the opportunity to execute a Facebook ad to promote his business specifically to people who are nearby that area. This newly surfaced promotional opportunity may not have been something the user planned for. Instead the opportunity or potential request was triggered by current conditions that may have a small time window of opportunity. Similarly this secondary recommended aspect may be shown next to or proceeding a primary recommended aspect for the Facebook advertisement that the user may leverage to attain his goals with respect to new website conversions.

As disclosed herein the system may be integrated with other marketing platforms outside of social networks. For example the system may be integrated with Google Adwords . In such a case the system may be integrated with one or more of Google s APIs or the user s personal Google Adwords account in order to gain access to important information like the user s keyword planner display planner current search marketing campaigns the user s organic search rankings the user s goals and preferences transactions performance history current trends on Google search volumes and other industry data the user s available budget and other settings and information. The system may use this data to determine goals for the user and as factors for determining recommended aspects of content. For example the system may detect a fluctuation in search volume bidding or some other indicator around a particular keyword that may indicate a new opportunity. Such opportunities like those described on Twitter may warrant a new marketing campaign or tactical combination of campaigns to be conducted by the user.

The system may also suggest recommendations of an explicit pairing of a paid search advertisement with other advertising tactics in a user s menu of possible future content posts such as a Twitter Promoted Accounts campaign. These tactics may use targeting criteria that allow the user to reach authors with similar characteristics on different platforms. However in some cases it may be preferable to use different tactics on different platforms to appeal to different audiences. For example the demographics of authors on the social network Pinterest may be very different from the demographics of authors on the social network Spotify . Accordingly the user may direct different tactics or campaigns to those respective networks. Each suggested tactical combination may contain recommendations for using certain words phrases or design elements to help ensure a consistent brand identity or to more effectively appeal to each audience in each setting. Similarly the content such as postings or advertisements in this suggested tactical combination may leverage the same features or system outputs that were actually derived from activity data or fluctuations in the user s target audience or social network. For example the system may recommend to the user that they should use a new trending hashtag fantasyfootball and participate in that hashtag conversation to become more relevant to the user s target custom author crowd. In one embodiment the system may automatically insert or suggest inserting fantasyfootball into the message text for each advertisement that is posted. The system may even recommend variations of these ads or prompt to the user to include other insights from system that the user could test by operating multiple campaigns or tactics at one time. These fields could be automatically pre populated by the system or otherwise input by the user.

Furthermore the system can automatically tag each tactic or collection of tactics in a way that facilitates tracking and measurement of a multi channel or platform opportunity campaign. For example if a user s product is a mobile app that includes a music streaming service the system may recommend to the user that there is opportunity to do a paid search ad on Google using the keyword live internet radio based upon other activity around that keyword and the recent search habits of consumers. Similarly the system may recommend using a related keyword to the user s current keyword set. The system may also recommend that the user take this insight and apply it to another marketing channel for example to publish a promoted tweet on Twitter that contains the exact keyword live internet radio in the text of the tweet or some variation of that keyword or concept. Alternatively the system may recommend a new keyword or set of keywords to promote on Google based upon the expressions activity and or behavioral fluctuations of that user s target audience on Twitter or some other preferred advertising medium platform.

The system can identify new opportunities generate recommendations to tailor one or more suggested tactics to the user and can present such recommendations or tactical sets on a display in a menu format where the user could decide whether they want to initiate postpone ignore deactivate or abort a particular tactic or campaign recommendation. Put another way the user is given the flexibility to choose from a set of system generated recommendations or instead do something that is not explicitly listed. That is the user may propose an alteration to a baseline tactical suggestion make an explicit modification to a tactical suggestion or choose a new marketing tactic autonomously. The system can structure experiments to only be run within certain timeframes which can provide the user with greater transparency into when where why and how the advertising or marketing tactic is applicable and appropriate for the user s current situation. The user can therefore a gain deeper understanding of how a campaign fits within the bigger picture of his or her collection of online and offline marketing programs.

The system can also adapt to current marketing conditions the user is facing at the present moment as well as take into account constant fluctuations in data and changes in competitor and other participant activities. The system can also automatically adjust campaign experiments and the delivery of new tactical marketing opportunities to users according to the explicit goals information and other criteria submitted and set by the user.

The system allows the user to ramp up his or her activity and media investment on the integrated advertising mediums in order to expand the scope of their marketing activities seamlessly. For example if a user has available budget a smaller experiment can be expanded or scaled up into large scale campaigns very quickly with the systems and methods disclosed herein. The system can achieve this by recommending additional tactics duplicate tactics alternative timing of marketing content follow up recommendations or proposing investment in a new marketing tool or advertising medium that is currently not being used by the user. As previously discussed some of these experiments may be free trials offered by an advertising platform as an incentive to capture new users and expand the engagement and ad expenditure of existing customers. As such the system provides an incentive or process for the user to subscribe to a more premium level of access and additional functionality with the ad provider. The system may thus become a lead generation tool for a social network or ad provider.

The combination of intelligently determining recommended aspects for posted paid and unpaid content and a dynamic opportunity classifier allows the system to appeal to the needs of a wide range of companies and provide mechanisms with which the system can onboard educate and ramp up the online marketing activities of the user. Accordingly the systems and methods herein are worthwhile for a small business that has little to no knowledge about social media best practices or a large business that wants more advanced monitoring recommendations tactical advertising campaigns and timely and practical advice. The system also allows the user to manage and customize many of their own settings which are useful for more precise progress measurement and efficient goal attainment of the user. All of these systems and methods incorporate and or work in conjunction with the determination and usage of recommended aspects for future content to be posted actions to be taken and or behaviors to engage in that are based on activity data that indicates aspects of other content authored by or interacted with a plurality of other authors. These recommended aspects can be embedded in and or help inform alter revise compel or otherwise adjust a particular tactic or marketing strategy campaign.

Various algorithms may be used for text behavior and other analysis to analyze data content authors etc. and generate recommended aspects. For example algorithms utilizing machine learning network analysis predictive analytics descriptive statistics natural language processing graph algorithms sequencing algorithms numerical algorithms optimization algorithms database algorithms signal processing deep learning artificial intelligence etc. may all be used in various embodiments disclosed herein. The system can also include computer vision specific algorithms that allow the system to do sophisticated image processing. Such techniques are used to examine image e.g. stills videos GIFs based content to analyze activity data and determine recommended aspects for potential requests directly or tangentially regarding image based content. For example an image based potential request may include a request such as What color choices will help to increase my engagement rate today The recommended aspect or answer to the question depends on activity data indicating current color preferences of the authors on which the potential request is centered as well as images they are engaging with most frequently or most recently. In one illustrative embodiment the system can determine based on the activity data a recommended aspect that indicates the optimal color pallet each user should use for their posted image content that day and for example the RGB CMYK or hexadecimal values of these colors. These RGB values and other information extracted from the image may be used by the user to inform new marketing design choices in PowerPoint Illustrator Photoshop Microsoft Word other text word processing graphic image or video editing tools campaign manager and ads management editing tools etc. for example. There may also be a conversion mechanism to Pantone color values to facilitate certain marketing use cases. Advantageously the system provides a connection between recommended aspects to target an audience and the tools platforms and other software products or services that may be leveraged by the user to create edit store or distribute certain marketing content. In some embodiments certain data analysis e.g. video content may utilize additional integrated APIs e.g. a YouTube API . For example YouTube videos posted or linked on Twitter may not be able to be pulled and analyzed using a Twitter API as with text or images. Instead the system can layer in another data source to understand what is actually in a video and analyze it with various computer vision techniques. Integrating additional APIs may be used any time data from one provider or social network is distributed on another provider or social network. It may also be beneficial in certain cases to correlate interrelate or perform other analysis exercises on multiple data sets in conjunction to enhance understanding and value for the user.

Results from Google s custom search API or Yahoo BOSS Search or for example the Bing search API can be used to get more information about images shared by users on a given social network or other marketing channel. That is the system can in addition to or instead of relying on computer vision techniques to understand the characteristics and attributes of a set of images Google s API can be used to get additional information about images. For example the system may be able to capture certain metadata about the images from a reverse image search via Google s search API. Such a process may make determining recommended aspects faster and easier because metadata indicating the color palate of an image or sequence of images e.g. GIF video is generally smaller in size than an actual image and no image analysis has to be performed. In other words the system can use metadata of historical image data to generate the color preferences of authors instead of analyzing and using the images themselves to determine the activity data. This can save on processing speeds and potentially increase accuracy of the recommendations and activity data processing depending on the quality of image metadata.

In such an implementation the system can integrate with a search engine API such as Google s API to gain more information about the image such as the websites where that searched image or set of images is currently hosted. For example if the potential request is to provide a recommended aspect to a user about the usefulness and timing of product photos e.g. what percentage of your posts today should contain product images the system can determine what exactly constitutes a product photo. Such a determination may be accomplished by looking at the host site of that image. Product photos for example would likely come from retailer websites or corporate sites. In this case the system could use available metadata to identify which images in the set were product photos without having to do complex object detection. However where context based recognition is not used or cannot be used complex object detection may still be used. In another embodiment the system may use both context based and complex object detection. In another embodiment the user may upload or otherwise provide a means with which the system can access a repository of product or non product images to inform certain recommendations. In another example the system can identify which photos shared by Twitter authors are stock photos. Stock photography may be leveraged in many different areas of marketing that are not limited to posting content via social networking sites. A corresponding potential request may be Should I use stock photo imagery If so where should I use it and how often The system can then compile or have pre loaded on it its own catalogue website list taxonomy or grouping of websites which are likely to contain or offer access to stock photography and then look for matches within those sources. If an image is hosted on a stock photo website it is likely to be a stock photo and can therefore be treated as such by the system. Such a technique can be applied across a range of other content types such as videos or any other searchable items where a user may be interested in understanding the origin site hosted websites geographic locations and other relevant metadata associated with that particular object.

Web analytics platforms can also be integrated to inform the systems and methods disclosed herein. For example the system can use data obtained from web analytics platforms such as Google Analytics through product integration. Such an integration can allow an interrelation between the system and the activity and performance of the user s website traffic conversions sales etc. to allow the system to use this data to inform the system s recommended aspects tactics and best practices for social media marketing or other marketing and business purposes. For example a user may wish to receive a recommended aspect telling them which products on his website he should promote today on social media sites. In one illustrative embodiment using Google Analytics API the API allows a user to request certain information or even real time data for an authenticated user. The API allows users to query for dimensions and metrics that display active viewers of a page the most popular content and pages on a users website etc. Such data can be used to inform recommended aspects of future content actions and or behaviors.

In one embodiment the system may determine through an API that visitors to the user s website are currently interested in peacoats. Webpages featuring product images of various peacoat styles may be receiving a proportionally higher share of page views clicks sales or a longer average session length. As a result the system may use this data to generate a recommended aspect telling the user that they should publish marketing content about peacoats on platform e.g. Twitter Facebook Pinterest or even recommend explicitly that the user share those exact same images of peacoats on various social media at that time. The viewing behavior of this user s website visitors may be indicative of a preference held by others in the user s target market or digital audiences who may not know about the particular product offering on the user s website s yet. Accordingly such a recommended aspect if acted upon could be very helpful in driving additional traffic to the user s website and potentially more sales of the peacoats. It is advantageous for the user to capitalize on such current trends by publishing more relevant content about peacoats via one or more preferred marketing channels. The same technique may be applied to old products or product pages and marketing offers as well as new ones the user may be alerted by the system to a positive fluctuation in page views for a product listed on his website e.g. six months ago. This may in turn generate a separate recommendation that the user could consider posting about this page content e.g. product service via social media as well.

A specific promotional climate on a particular social network can also be used to inform the substance timing and design elements of recommended aspects and subsequent posted content or activities or behaviors of the user. For example the hair color of the models used in a suggested image or the optimal number of products to feature in one image that can help the user to maximize the engagement rate with their post on a particular medium or help achieve some other goal specified by the user. Therefore activity on the user s website or set of websites may inspire both new website optimization tactics as well as tactics that are unrelated to the user s website. For example website statistics as market signals and inputs can be used to inform recommended aspects of subsequent marketing activities on social media that can be executed by the user and vice versa.

In another embodiment a user can upload multiple potential images designs videos or other media for a future post and the system can recommend one based on activity data in a way that indicates a likelihood that the user s audience will like the image or contribute to meeting a goal of the user. Similarly a user may also upload multiple future content posts or other text and keyword selections. The system can determine the contents character length word choice universal resource indicators URIs and other website links grammar etc and the system can recommend one based on activity data or other market data and determine the likelihood the user s audience will like it or contribute to meeting a goal of the user or increasing his or her agility rating.

Numerous hundreds or thousands private and public APIs and user databases exist that the systems and methods disclosed herein may using according the various embodiments to provide recommend aspects for future content actions and or behaviors to businesses and individuals. Some of these APIs may include but are not limited to Amazon Product Advertising Shopzilla Ebay weather APIs event aggregator APIs news service APIs etc. New APIs may even be created or offered by certain companies specifically for integration with the disclosed system. Such integrations may use the API as an input e.g. historical or real time streaming data to the system or may serve as output destinations where the recommendations generated by the system may be consumed by or within other software technologies.

Data used for any of the embodiments disclosed herein including custom search criteria fluctuation criteria comparison of groups of authors recommended aspect determination activity data agility rating calculation marketing campaign recommendations etc. can be gathered from any type of various electronic devices software and sensors. For example devices where data can be collected may include although this list is not meant to be limiting smart thermostats automobiles biometric devices such as a FitBit smart product labeling in store shopper tracking and geotagging wearable electronic devices bicycle computers etc. where data is transmitted via connections to the Internet in various ways such as WiFi Bluetooth etc. Data captured through such devices can be used as historical or real time data for determining certain tactical marketing campaigns and or recommended aspects of content for the user.

For example in store tracking may be accomplished through Bluetooth video capture and analysis of in store shoppers WiFi fingerprinting where a system tracks the signal strength of a WiFi signal in a store data from a MEMS chip in smartphones to track a heatmap of customer activity LED lighting in a store where frequency emissions are used to determine customer location as well as via loyalty programs that may leverage NFC enabled cards to track purchase activities at checkout. Such in store activities may be used to determine marketing opportunities to authors and ways to further engage with them in store and on social media. Tracking authors using electronic devices may be done in other settings than a store. For example authors at a sports stadium may be tracked to determine opportunities to market to them. For example a fan in close proximity to a merchandise booth may be texted a special coupon for use at the merchandise booth. Such a campaign may come to the user in the form of a recommended aspect of a content post as disclosed herein.

The systems and methods disclosed herein may be utilized for a variety of different purposes by a variety of different users. For example a consumer instead of a marketer may want to use systems and methods herein to learn how to improve his or her popularity or credibility on a given social network. In another example a user may want to use answers generated by the system to help inform a purchase decision. What product or service should they choose Which store should they purchase it from Which location Should they ask for discounts Where can they find out if there is a coupon for the product The systems and methods herein could also inform lifestyle choices What clothes or shoes should they wear today What s the current style or trend What TV shows should they watch What places should they visit Who should they talk to Where should they go to get advice When should they do different tasks during the day Numerous applications are contemplated where a user of the system may apply audience driven insights in making decisions in his or her own life. Other data rich scenarios that could utilize the systems and methods herein for decisionmaking include but are not limited to sales advertising enterprise resource planning accounting and finance project management and collaboration healthcare manufacturing public relations human resources and recruitment research and development operations and supply chain management distribution and logistics customer service and customer relationship management IT and service management purchasing and procurement inventory merchandising quality assurance market research insurance management consultancy and strategy consumers etc.

Various embodiments utilizing the agility rating as disclosed herein are also contemplated. For example agility rating weights may be adjusted based upon criteria such as more consistent performance fulfillment of what are deemed more advanced recommendations provided by the system timely fulfillment of recommendations based on how pressing the opportunity is etc. An agility rating may also give preference to someone who consistently capitalized on marketing opportunities generated by the system that have a shorter time to execute the opportunity or who actually posted in a shorter amount of time. Adjustments to the agility rating may also be directly linked to real time or near real time changes in the results output of the system. That is if there is a change in the output of the system e.g. a fluctuation detected then that change can represent an opportunity for a user to adjust his or her strategy. Whether the user adjusts his or her strategy can be a factor in the computation of the agility rating. For example the system may take into account how many new opportunities a user received in a given time window and then the percentage of those opportunities that were fulfilled by the user.

The following details how the systems and methods disclosed herein may be used by an example user. For example the user is a custom t shirt manufacturer. The user wants to know what to do on Twitter today to promote their business. Initially the user can set goals and plan generally how the day will look with regards to marketing. The user may use the system to determine recommended aspects for 1 how many times the user should post today e.g. 10 2 what time of day should be a focus i.e. should the user concentrate more posts during a specific type of day or post their longer posts at a specific time of day e.g. 11 AM 3 how many of the user s tweets should contain image content Additionally a user may also discover through the system what advertising products and opportunities may be used to achieve particular goals. This may be accomplished through supplemental questions answered by the user.

The system can also be used to help the user identify new opportunities that arise spontaneously. For example the system can help the user determine what type of content the user s audience is really interested in right now or may pique their interest. For example the user may discover that hashtag content is receiving the most engagement. A user may also use the system to determine what is trending in the user s custom crowd target audience. For example the user may discover that FreeBrady is a trending topic which presents an opportunity to relate the user s brand and offerings to a trending conversation that is popular within the user s target audience. In order to react to this opportunity the user may utilize previous content posted and or new original content. For example if the user tweeted last week that people should share the funniest t shirt designs they have seen the user and the system can learn about clever designs and even get content from the t shirts designs that people shared that can be incorporated in a post. This type of data can be very relevant to the user s audience because the content originated with the user s audience in the first place and help elicit more user generated content or any other favorable outcome. The user can also determine what kind of original content they want to create. In this case the user may decide to create a t shirt design and integrate FreeBrady directly into the concept art. To promote this content on Twitter the user can compose a series of tweets using this hashtag and then attach an image of the shirt design to at least one tweet. In another tweet a link to where an author may purchase the t shirt may also be included.

Other factors for content generation can also be determined using the systems and methods disclosed herein. For example colors of the post generated graphics text and t shirt itself may be determined using the system. For example the system can determine that the color scheme of the New England Patriots football team is inherently associated with the FreeBrady concept and therefore could should be included in the content generation. The system can also help determine what other colors the user s target audience prefers and or is interested in. This recommendation could help the user to decide what colors to use in other promotional materials for the product such as the background for product images shared on Twitter or the best color scheme for a promotional infographic. The system may help determine other factors for a content post such as how many models to use in an image how many of the models should be wearing the shirt time of day to post the image content what the optimal tweet character length is for the content etc. The user may therefore compose a promotional tweet based on the recommended aspects and publish the content.

In another recommended aspect the system may recommend now publishing lifestyle content after the product t shirt posting. Since the latest shirt was football related and a football season may be approaching the system may recommend posting about things like sports news the Patriots football team fantasy football etc. In addition since the context surrounding the FreeBrady hashtag has to do with football as Tom Brady is the quarterback for the New England Patriots football team it may also be preferable for the user to engage in sports or football related discussion topics. In this way the user may build awareness and likability with their target audiences over time. For other subsequent content the user may use the system to determine a type of video that resonates with his or her audiences. For example the user may discover through the recommendations of the system that Vines are very popular right now driving high engagement rates. Accordingly the user can extend the concept of FreeBrady into another content format and do testing to see what drives the most engagement. Accordingly the user can decide to make a 6 second vine about the production of his FreeBrady shirt coming off the press. The system may recommend for example to share the video at 3 PM that day. These various postings can be developed and scheduled within a service for social media postings such as HootSuite or managed through other marketing software platforms.

The user may then try to leverage the system to discover opportunities for more direct engagement with his or her target audience. For example the system may analyze authored content to determine who is likely to have disposable income right now have users recently tweeted about going shopping or new things they bought . The system can identify such authors and facilitate sending those users a special offer for goods or services. In some instances the user may reach out to these authors on Twitter or a different marketing channel. For example although the author tweeted about shopping on Twitter the system may recommend sending the promotional offer to the author via e mail if an e mail address is available. The system may also help identify which members of a target audience are more impressionable e.g. which authors are more likely to share content from a company . The system may recommend tweeting at this authors using their handle and including a special offer to alert them to a deal. These authors may subsequently share the tweet and further propagate the marketing of the user s products and brand.

The user may also use the system to determine who is most likely to sway an interest group e.g. football fans fashion crowds Boston crowds sports crowds or news media crowds etc. that is part of a user s target audience. For example the system may recommend interacting with an author who is influential with a particular interest group. For example the user could offer an influential author something that may incentivize them to share the user s branded content with those valuable audiences he she has influence in. The system may also help the user determine who has gained more influence. For example the user may recognize someone that tweets about the product to their followers and give them a free t shirt or other recognition. Such authors may be worth befriending and fostering a relationship with. The system can help the user determine how to do this through personal tweets whether to send tweets publicly or privately through other communication channels e.g. phone e mail paper mail or social networking platforms etc.

In this way the t shirt designer user receives timely answers from the system about how to promote his company on Twitter today. The user even received an idea for a new product variation which evolved into its own multi faceted marketing campaign. Accordingly a user may use the system and methods disclosed herein to learn for example promotional guides and frameworks to focus on for the day how to construct original content that day how to make choices about things like product styles and other merchandising considerations how to build stronger ties with the lifestyle needs of the user s audience how to conduct effective community engagement on and offline how to conduct other important marketing tasks and behaviors and or how to launch a grassroots paid campaign on top of his her other activity.
