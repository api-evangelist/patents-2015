title: Tracking projectile trajectory with multiple sensors
abstract: Disclosed is an example for determining a projectile trajectory with at least two sensors. In one example, the projectile trajectory is estimated using a first sensor having a first angular range. Further, the projectile trajector is estimated using a second sensor having a second angular range. The first sensor and the second sensor are disposed on a platform at different spatial locations. Furthermore, a discrepancy in the projectile trajectory is determined when the projectile moves from the first angular range to the second angular range. The discrepancy is created due to the different spatial locations of the first sensor and the second sensor. An actual projectile trajectory is determined by compensating for the discrepancy in the projectile trajectory using the estimated discrepancy.

tracking projectile trajectory with multiple sensors by compensating for discrepancy e.g. parallax created due to different spatial locations of the sensors.

A projectile may be tracked with a number of sensors installed on a platform such as a stationary structure or a vehicle. Example projectile may be a bullet artillery shell missile bombs or other object that exhibit the characteristics consistent with a bullet in flight. The projectile may be propelled from any firearm such as rifle pistol handgun shotgun muzzle loader air gun and the like. The sensors for tracking the projectile trajector may be spaced apart from each other. The displacement of the sensors may create a parallax which can be discrepancies of observations difference in the apparent position of the projectile measured by the sensors in different spatial locations i.e. viewed along different lines of sight . The parallax may be magnified with the increase in distance between the sensors. Nearby projectiles may have a larger parallax than more distant projectiles when observed from different positions. Tracked projectiles that are close or near miss projectiles may create discontinuous plotted paths based on the parallax.

Systems and methods for determining a projectile trajectory with at least two sensors are disclosed. In one aspect the projectile trajectory is estimated using a first sensor having a first angular range. Further the projectile trajectory is estimated using a second sensor having a second angular range. The first sensor and the second sensor are disposed on a platform at different spatial locations. Furthermore a discrepancy in the projectile trajectory is determined when the projectile moves from the first angular range to the second angular range. The discrepancy is created due to the different spatial locations of the first sensor and the second sensor. An actual projectile trajectory is determined by compensating for the discrepancy in the projectile trajectory using the determined discrepancy. In addition a miss distance of the projectile from the platform and the projectile speed are determined using the determined actual projectile trajectory upon compensating for the discrepancy.

According to another aspect of the present subject matter a system includes a first sensor and a second sensor the first sensor and the second sensor are disposed on a platform at different spatial locations. The system further includes an error detection and correction unit communicatively connected to the first sensor and the second sensor the error detection and correction unit is configured to perform the method described above.

According to another aspect of the present subject matter a non transitory computer readable storage medium including instructions that are executed by a computational unit to perform the method described above.

The system and method disclosed herein may be implemented in any means for achieving various aspects. Other features will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follow.

The examples described herein in detail for illustrative purposes are subject to many variations in structure and design. Projectile may be tracked with a multiple number of sensors disposed on a platform. The platform may be a stationary structure or a vehicle. Example projectile may be a bullet an artillery shell a missile and other object that exhibit the characteristics consistent with the bullet in flight. The projectile may be propelled from any firearm such as a rifle a pistol a handgun a shotgun a muzzle loader an air gun and the like.

The sensors for tracking the projectile trajectory may be spaced apart from each other. The sensors at different spatial locations may have a limited angular range in a predetermined direction known as the sensor s boresight. For any pair of sensors there may exist a region that falls outside of both sensor s angular range. This region is referred to as a blind spot lost region. Further there may exist a region at which the both sensors simultaneously detect the projectile trajectory. This region is referred to as an overlapping region.

When the projectile is in the overlapping region or m the blind spot region there may be a discrepancy that manifests as discontinuity in a determined path of the projectile. For example in the overlapping region a parallax may be created which can be discrepancies of observations difference in the apparent position of the projectile measured by the sensors. Further tracked projectiles that are close or near miss projectiles may create discontinuity in determined projectile trajectory based on the parallax.

Examples described herein provide an enhanced system technique and as method for determining projectile trajectory with multiple sensors. In one example the projectile trajectory may be obtained from the multiple sensors having different angular ranges. When the projectile moves from one angular range to other angular range of the sensors a discrepancy in the projectile trajectory may be determined. For example the discrepancy includes a parallax created due to the different spatial locations of the sensors. An actual projectile trajectory may be determined by compensating for the discrepancy in the projectile trajectory. In case of parallax the actual projectile trajectory may be determined by compensating for the parallax using a parallax correction.

Furthermore a miss distance of the projectile from the platform and the projectile speed may be determined using the determined actual projectile trajectory upon compensating for the discrepancy.

Further the error detection and correction unit may be communicatively connected to the first sensor and the second sensor In operation the error detection and correction unit estimates determines the projectile trajectory using the first sensor and the second sensor . In the example shown in the error detection and correction unit may determine angular positions of the projectile with respect to the platform by tracking the projectile using the first sensor and the second sensor . Further the error detection and correction unit may determine estimate the projectile trajectory by computing a range estimate of the projectile using the determined angular position. The term angular position may refer to a measurement of projectile position with respect to a. specified reference position e.g. vehicle position . For example the angular position indicates the orientation of the projectile with respect to the vehicle position as expressed by the amount of angular rotation of the projectile necessary to change from one orientation to the other in 3 dimensional 3D space.

Further in operation the error detection and correction unit determines a discrepancy in the projectile trajectory when the projectile moves from the first angular range to the second angular range . Furthermore the error detection and correction unit determines an actual projectile trajectory by compensating for the discrepancy in the projectile trajectory . For example the discrepancy includes a parallax created due to the different spatial locations of the first sensor and the second sensor and the actual projectile trajectory may be determined by compensating for the parallax using a parallax correction.

In one example the error detection and correction unit determines an overlapping region of the projectile trajectory when the projectile is simultaneously tracked by the first and second sensors and resulting in a parallax error A. in this case the error detection and correction unit determines the actual projectile trajectory by normalizing the projectile trajectories determined using the first sensor and second sensor in the overlapping region.

In the example graph A as shown in an overlapping region A indicates projectile trajectories A and A that are detected simultaneously e.g. at the time t tier the apparent position i.e. true bullet location of the projectile. The projectile trajectory A may include a last tracked location as shown in associated with angular position of the projectile which is detected for the last time by the first sensor. The projectile trajectory A may include a new tracked location as shown in associated with angular position of the projectile which is detected for the first time by the second sensor. In this case the projectile trajectories A and A may be normalized based on the last tracked location and the new tracked location of the projectile. Further an actual projectile trajectory A may be determined by normalizing the projectile trajectories A and A in the overlapping region.

In another example the error detection and correction unit determines a lost region of the projectile trajectory when the projectile falls outside the first angular range and second angular range . In this case the error detection and correction unit forms overlapping trajectories in the lost region by interpolating the projectile trajectories determined using the first sensor and second sensor . Further the error detection and correction unit determines the actual projectile trajectory by normalizing the overlapping trajectories. In the example graph B as shown in a lost region B of the projectile trajectory may be determined when the projectile falls outside the first and second angular ranges that resulting in blind spot error B In this case overlapping trajectories B and B are formed in the lost region B by extending the respective projectile trajectories B and B determined using the first and second sensors and in the lost region B. For example the respective projectile trajectories B and B are interpolated to form the overlapping trajectories B and B in the lost region B. Furthermore the actual projectile trajectory B may be determined by normalizing the overlapping trajectories B and B The normalizing may be done in similar manner as explained in detail above with reference to . In addition the actual projectile trajectory B may also be corrected based on the vector positions of the first sensor and the second sensor. in indicates the angular position of the projectile varying with time.

Furthermore the error detection and correction unit determines a miss distance of the projectile relative to the platform and the projectile speed using the determined actual projectile trajectory upon compensating for the discrepancy. In one example the miss distance may be determined by triangulation of the angular position of the projectile estimated from measurements by two sensors i.e. the first sensor and the second sensor . Further the miss distance of the projectile may be used to estimate a shooter location that indicates a position from which the projectile is fired.

At block a discrepancy in the projectile trajectory may be determined when a projectile moves from the first angular range to the second angular range. In one example the discrepancy includes a parallax created due to the different spatial locations of the first sensor and the second. sensor. At block an actual projectile trajectory may be determined by compensating for the discrepancy in the projectile trajectory. In one example the actual projectile trajectory may be determined by compensating for the parallax using a parallax correction.

In one example an overlapping region of the projectile trajectory may be determined when the projectile is simultaneously tracked by the first and second sensor. In this case the actual projectile trajectory may be determined by normalizing the projectile trajectories determined using the first and second sensors in the overlapping region. In another example a lost region of the projectile trajectory may be determined when the projectile falls outside the first and second angular ranges. In this case overlapping trajectories in the lost region may be formed by interpolating the projectile trajectories determined using the first and second sensors. Furthermore the actual projectile trajectory may be determined by normalizing the overlapping trajectories.

Furthermore a miss distance of the projectile from the platform and projectile speed may be determined using the determined actual projectile trajectory upon compensating for the discrepancy.
