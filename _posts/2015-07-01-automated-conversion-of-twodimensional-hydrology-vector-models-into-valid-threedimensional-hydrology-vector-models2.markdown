This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 62 019 878 titled ENHANCEMENTS FOR AUTOMATED HYDROLOGY MODEL DEVELOPMENT and filed on Jul. 1 2014 the entire specification of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The disclosure relates to the field of image processing and linear feature extraction and more particularly to the field of extracting three dimensional hydrology vector models from remotely sensed imagery.

In the art of linear feature extraction ROADTRACKER and similar tools enable automated bulk extraction and semi automated point to point extraction of two dimensional linear feature vectors from remotely sensed imagery. Extractions by these tools are image based meaning image content automatically influences the trajectories of the extracted vectors. In semi automated extraction the image raster is displayed in a viewer and extraction is partially guided by user mouse clicks placed along a desired linear feature. Tools like ROADTRACKER can be used to perform two dimensional extraction of among other things single line drainages the centerline vectors of narrow streams double line drainages the two side vectors of rivers and the boundaries of water bodies and includes automatic smoothing of the extracted vectors and automatic topology cleaning of the vectors elimination of gaps under shoots and dangles over shoots where vectors are intended to be perfectly incident to one another. In this manner a two dimensional hydrology vector model for a raster image may be constructed.

What is needed is an automated way to convert a two dimensional hydrology vector model into a corresponding three dimensional hydrology vector model where the latter is geometrically consistent with the physics of real world hydrology i.e. lake boundaries are level corresponding points on opposite sides of a river are at the same altitude and water flow is monotone decreasing in altitude.

Accordingly the inventor has conceived and reduced to practice in a preferred embodiment of the invention a system and method for automatically converting a two dimensional hydrology vector model into a three dimensional hydrology vector model where the latter is geometrically consistent with the physics of real world hydrology i.e. lake boundaries are level corresponding points on opposite sides of a river are at the same altitude and water flow is monotone decreasing in altitude. The three dimensional vectors are expressed in the X Y Z coordinates of object space.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention a system for automatically converting a two dimensional hydrology vector model into a three dimensional hydrology vector model that is geometrically consistent with the physics of real world hydrology comprising a vector server stored and operating on a network connected computing device a raster server stored and operating on a network connected computing device a digital surface model DSM server stored and operating on a network connected computing device a vector extraction engine stored and operating on a network connected computing device and a rendering engine stored and operating on a network connected computing device is disclosed.

The inventor has conceived in a preferred embodiment of the invention a system and method for automatic conversion of two dimensional hydrology vector models into three dimensional hydrology vector models where the latter are geometrically consistent with the physical behavior of real world hydrology. The three dimensional vectors are expressed in the X Y Z coordinates of object space.

The three dimensional extracted vectors may be further provided to vector extraction engine for example to store the vectors for future reference.

It should be appreciated that according to the embodiment various means of connection or communication between the components of a system may be utilized according to the invention interchangeably or simultaneously such as for example a direct physical data connection such as via a data cable or similar physical means a software based connection such as via an application programming interface API or other software communication means such as may be suitable for example in arrangements where multiple system components may operate on a single hardware device such as a computing server or workstation or any of a variety of network connections such as via the Internet or other data communications network. It should therefore be appreciated that the connections shown are exemplary in nature and represent only a selection of possible arrangements and that alternate or additional connections may be utilized according to the invention.

The vector extraction engine takes as input a two dimensional hydrology vector model expressed in the X Y coordinates of object space and a DSM expressed in the X Y Z coordinates of object space and computes a three dimensional hydrology vector model expressed in the X Y Z coordinates of object space that is geometrically consistent with the physics of real world hydrology namely lake boundaries are level corresponding points on opposite sides of a river are at the same altitude and water flow is monotone decreasing in altitude.

In a preferred embodiment the vector extraction engine first automatically projects all two dimensional hydrology vectors vertically in the Z direction to the DSM. Care is taken to ensure that the inter connection topology among the vectors that existed in two dimensions is maintained in the three dimensional projection.

For each two dimensional lake boundary vector in a preferred embodiment the vector extraction engine takes median Z value of the initially projected lake boundary vector as the common Z value for all the points of the final three dimensional lake boundary vector. Any three dimensional vectors that were initially incident to the projected lake boundary vector are automatically adjusted near their terminals to maintain the incidence with the final three dimensional lake boundary vector.

For any pair of two dimensional side vectors U and V of a river in a preferred embodiment the vector extraction engine automatically computes the two dimensional centerline vector W between U and V and then automatically projects W vertically in the Z direction to the DSM resulting in the three dimensional vector W . Let Sdenote the unique infinite vertical surface containing W. Similarly define Sand S. The vector extraction engine automatically takes the projected vector W and projects it normally from surface Sonto surfaces Sand S. These new vectors on Sand Sare taken as the final three dimensional vectors corresponding to U and V respectively. Any three dimensional vectors that were incident to the initial projections of U and V are automatically adjusted near their terminals to maintain the incidence with the final three dimensional versions of U and V.

Let W denote a projected three dimensional single line drainage vector. Let p and q denote the endpoints of W where the Z value of p is greater than that of q. To enforce monotonicity of Z profile on W in a preferred embodiment the vector extraction engine employs one of several existing known algorithms to create a new vector W from p to q that is monotone decreasing in Z and as close as possible to W according to some measure of closeness. These algorithms will be known to someone familiar in the art. The vector extraction engine automatically indicates perhaps by depicting an arrow on the resulting vector in the viewer that the drainage direction goes from endpoint p with higher Z value to endpoint q with lower Z value .

In a preferred embodiment the vector extraction engine automatically affects the transformation from W to W as described previously for the two dimensional centerline vector W of a river whose two dimensional side vectors are denoted U and V before constructing the final three dimensional versions of U and V as described previously . In other words the three dimensional versions of U and V are constructed from W instead of W .

Finally in a preferred embodiment the vector extraction engine smoothes all three dimensional single line and double line drainage vectors in the Z coordinate.

The skilled person will be aware of a range of possible modifications of the various embodiments described above. Accordingly the present invention is defined by the claims and their equivalents.
