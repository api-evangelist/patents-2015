The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

A system consistent with this disclosure enables enforcement of a condition that an electronic resource can be electronically signed only if the signer is in the presence of a companion. Generally a signer includes a user of the system who is authorized to electronically sign an electronic resource. Generally a companion includes a user of the system who is in the presence of another user of the system. For example a companion may include a specific user of the system and or a user possessing a particular credential type e.g. a notary republic credential . In an example enforcement of the condition is performed client side e.g. by a client device e.g. a mobile device of the signer. In this example the client device maintains the electronic resource to be signed. To prove that the signer is in the presence of the companion the companion provides a representation of a credential e.g. a mobile device based representation of a credential that identifies the companion to the signer s client device. Generally a representation of a credential includes an electronic presentation of a credential. Upon receipt of the representation of the credential the signer s client device attempts to validate the companion s credential. Responsive to a successful validation of the companion s credential the signer is enabled to electronically sign the electronic resource.

In one example an electronic resource includes a signature field. Generally a signature field includes a portion of an electronic resource that is designated for entry of an electronic signature. In this example the electronic resource or at least the signature field of the electronic resource is locked prior to validation of the companion s credential. When the electronic resource or the signature field of the electronic resource is locked the signer is prevented from electronically signing the electronic resource. Generally the locking of an electronic resource includes the protecting of the electronic resource from modification and or deletion. Upon successful validation of the companion s credential the client device unlocks the electronic resource or the signature field of the electronic resource e.g. to enable the signer to electronically sign the signature field of the electronic resource. Generally the unlocking of an electronic resource includes making the electronic resource available for modification and or deletion.

In still another example the system includes a server that maintains the electronic resource prior to validation of the companion s credential. In this example the electronic resource is locked or otherwise unavailable for signing by the signer. Upon successful validation of the companion s credential the server unlocks the electronic resource and or transmits the electronic resource to the signer s client device for entry of an electronic signature. In an alternative example upon successful validation of the companion s credential the server enables the signer to instruct the server to sign the electronic resource on the signer s behalf. In this example the server stores a private key of the signer e.g. in escrow and uses the private key to sign the electronic resource on the signer s behalf.

Referring to client device displays graphical user interface . In this example client device is used by user . In the example of client device implements an application not shown for displaying electronic resources that are available to user within the application. In this example graphical user interface is one of the graphical user interfaces rendered by the application.

In the example of some of the electronic resources may be owned by user while some other electronic resources may be owned by other entities but shared with user . Based on a selection of one of control or control graphical user interface can switch between views that show the list of electronic resources owned by user and the list of electronic resources shared with user respectively. In the example of control is selected such that graphical user interface displays indicators of electronic resources that are shared with user .

In this example an electronic resource e.g. electronic resource in is associated with indicator . This electronic resource is associated with a condition that the electronic resource can be electronically signed by user when user is in the presence of a companion not shown . In this example the electronic resource associated with indicator is locked e.g. as user is not in the presence of a companion. Indicator displays notification message notifying user that the electronic resource associated with indicator is locked and that a presence of a companion is required to unlock the electronic resource.

In this example of user is prevented from electronically signing the electronic resource associated with indicator until after the presence of a companion has been validated. The presence of a companion may be validated by one or more of client device an application running on client device and a server not shown that is external to client device . In the example of user may select the portion of graphical user interface associated with indicator e.g. to cause client device to display the electronic resource represented by indicator .

Referring to graphical user interface is displayed on client device e.g. following selection of the portion of graphical user interface associated with indicator . Graphical user interface displays a visual representation of electronic resource . In this example electronic resource is the electronic resource represented by indicator . Electronic resource includes signature field . In this example user desires to electronically sign electronic resource . Hereinafter user may be referred to as signer for purposes of convenience and without limitation.

In the example of electronic resource is associated with a condition that electronic resource can be electronically signed if signer is in the presence of a companion not shown . In this example signature field is locked e.g. as signer is not in the presence of a companion. In this example signature field includes control for enabling signer to receive a credential from a companion e.g. in order to unlock electronic resource . Following selection of control client device may start listening for an ultrasonic audio signal representation of a credential. In another example following selection of control client device may instruct signer to user a scanner to scan into client device an optical machine readable representation of a credential of a companion. In yet another example following selection of control client device may instruct signer to enter an alphanumeric code representation of a credential of a companion. In still another example selection of control causes client device to send to a server not shown a message requesting that the server notify one or more companions of signer s need to validate companionship e.g. in order to unlock electronic resource .

Referring to signer is in the presence of companion e.g. based on companion moving into a location in which signer is present. In the example of companion uses client device . In this example signer verbally communicates to companion that signer needs a representation of a credential for companion e.g. in order to electronically sign electronic resource . In response companion uses client device to request e.g. from client device and or a server a representation of a credential for companion . In this example client device and or the server may prompt companion to select a type of representation for the credential.

In an example client device and or the server manages multiple different credentials for companion . For example client device and or the server may manage a notary republic credential for the companion an employee credential for the companion demonstrating employment by a particular company and so forth. In this example companion selects a particular type of credential to use to unlock electronic resource .

For example electronic resource may be associated with a condition that electronic resource can only be electronically signed if signer is in the presence of a companion that has a particular type of credential. In this example signer may verbally specify to companion that signer needs a representation of a particular type of credential for companion e.g. in order to electronically sign electronic resource . In response companion selects a credential of the specified type to use to unlock electronic resource .

In the example of client device displays graphical user interface for companion to select a type of representation for the credential. In the example of graphical user interface also displays notification messages . Notification message notifies companion that signer is requesting validation of the presence of companion e.g. to enable signer to access electronic resource that can be unlocked when signer is in the presence of companion . Notification message notifies companion that another signer is also requesting validation of the presence of companion e.g. to enable the other signer to access an electronic resource e.g. a sale agreement document that can be unlocked when the other signer is in the presence of companion .

In an example notification messages are generated by a server that is in communication with client device . For example client device that is used by signer may send to the server a request to generate notification message . In this example upon selection of control client device may generate the request. In response to receipt of the request the server may determine that companion is qualified to unlock electronic resource for signing generate notification message and transmit notification message to client device associated with companion .

In another example companion may be the only companion who may unlock electronic resource for signing. In this example client device displays notification message e.g. when signer opens electronic resource . For example when signer opens electronic resource client device or the server may send to client device information specifying that signer has opened electronic resource . In response client device may generate and display notification message .

As previously described the presence of companion may be validated based on the presentation of a representation of a credential of companion to client device . There are various types of representations for credentials. For example a credential may be represented as a numeric or alphanumeric representation an ultrasonic audio signal representation an animated graphical representation a parametrically generated graphical representation an audio representation of a phrase and an optical machine readable representation e.g. a quick response QR code each of which are described in further detail below.

In the example of graphical user interface displays controls . Through selection of controls companion can select a type a representation for the credential of companion . For example through selection of control companion specifies that the credential is represented as an ultrasonic audio signal. Through selection of control companion specifies that the credential is represented as a QR code. Through selection of control companion specifies that the credential is represented as a numeric value. In this example companion selects control . In response client device receives e.g. from a server QR code as shown in graphical user interface in .

In another example client device may receive information about the credential from the server. For example the information about the credential may include a credential identifier e.g. a number or character string that uniquely identifies a credential information specifying a type of the credential and so forth. Using the received information client device may generate the representation of the credential including e.g. an ultrasonic audio signal representation an optical machine readable representation and a numeric or alphanumeric value representation. Referring to companion causes QR code to be presented and or transmitted to client device of signer . For example companion may allow signer to scan e.g. photograph QR code into client device e.g. via an optical scanner e.g. a camera . In this example client device may transmit QR code to a server e.g. to validate the credential of companion . Upon successful validation of the credential of companion the server may unlock electronic resource .

Responsive to a successful validation of the credential of companion signer may be enabled to electronically sign electronic resource . In an example signer is enabled to electronically sign electronic resource e.g. by the server transmitting electronic resource to client device . In another example where electronic resource is stored locally on client device signer is enabled to electronically sign electronic resource e.g. by client device unlocking electronic resource and or by unlocking signature field of electronic resource .

Responsive to a successful validation of the credential of companion signature field is unlocked. As shown in signature field in graphical user interface is updated to display a message indicating that the signature field has been successfully unlocked e.g. by validating that signer is in the presence of companion . The message displayed in signature field also includes an indication of a name e.g. Ann Doe of companion who enabled electronic resource to be unlocked.

In this example of signature field remains unlocked for a temporary period of time e.g. to decrease a likelihood of a malicious user electronically signing electronic resource relative to the likelihood of a malicious user electronically signing electronic resource should signature field remain unlocked indefinitely. In the example of signature field is updated to include portion e.g. for display of a clock indicative of an amount of time that remains until signature field is locked.

Following unlocking of signature field signer is enabled to electronically sign electronic resource . In the example of signer inputs an electronic signature into signature field . As shown in signature field in graphical user interface is updated to display the contents of the electronic signature. In some implementations the electronic signature may be based on a public key infrastructure PKI for example and or on the Electronic Signature Algorithm DSA .

Additionally or alternatively the electronic signature may be based on an electronic credential of signer accessible via client device . For example signer may be a university student for whom an electronic university student credential is available via client device and who uses the electronic university student credential to electronically sign electronic resource . In such implementations information represented by the electronic university student credential may be included in the electronic signature applied to electronic resource . For instance the name of signer and the name of signer s university may be included in the electronic signature applied to electronic resource by virtue of signer using signer s university student credential to electronically sign electronic resource . In still another example signer may apply an electronic signature to electronic resource by entering a series of keystrokes on client device e.g. John Doe and or by selecting an image file representing an electronic signature of signer to be embedded within or otherwise associated with electronic resource .

In the example of signer is named John Doe and is a university student in this example. In this example after signer has entered an electronic signature into signature field the contents of signature field display the name of signer and information specifying that signer is a university student.

In an example client device is associated with user . In this example user desires to electronically sign electronic resource . Hereinafter user may be referred to as signer and client device may be referred to as signer device for purposes of convenience and without limitation. Client device is associated with user . In this example user is a companion of signer . Hereinafter user may be referred to as companion and client device may be referred to as companion device for purposes of convenience and without limitation.

In the example of server hosts one or more applications including e.g. application . Generally an application includes a computer program with a graphical user interface. In this example application is an identity management application that enables enforcement of a condition that an electronic resource can be electronically signed if the signer is in the presence of a companion. In an example client devices may download a client application not shown for interacting with application and or for interacting with server . In another example client devices may use a web browser to access application from server e.g. rather than downloading a client application for interacting with application onto client devices . In an example application and or a client application for interacting with application may be configured to render one or more of graphical user interfaces as shown in .

In an example server manages representations for credentials associated with users and groups of users and permits one or more users to validate the credentials for users by inspecting the representations.

In an example a credential may be evidence of authority status rights or entitlement to privileges that can be for example a badge or identifier for membership in a group e.g. an employee of a company a graduate of a school a professional certification forms of personal identification e.g. drivers licenses identity cards passports etc. and so forth.

As previously described credentials can be represented by parametrically generated graphical representations animated graphical representations phrases numeric representations ultrasonic audio signal representations and or optical machine readable representations. Combinations of one or more of these representations can also be used. In certain aspects credentials also may be hierarchical. For example a first credential may generally identify an individual as an employee of Company X while a second credential identifies the individual more specifically as an executive of Company X and a third credential identifies the individual as the Chief Executive Officer of Company X.

In operation server manages and stores one or more credentials associates users with appropriate credentials and provides representations of the credentials to users client devices and or to processing systems e.g. operated by credential authorities for validation. In this example of credentials may be stored in data repository .

In an example server generates a credential based on input provided by a credential grantor not shown . Generally a credential grantor includes an entity that grants a credential to a user. For example a credential grantor may be a company a school a professional certification organization a government agency and so forth. The credentials may include a variety of information including e.g. a description of an entity granting the credential e.g. a school a professional certification organization a government agency and so forth a credential identifier and so forth. In addition to creation of credentials by credential grantors credentials could be created at the request of users through a web based or other interface or through any other suitable mechanism such as sending email or short message service SMS to credential grantors.

Server generates credentials e.g. identified by credential identifiers e.g. based on information received from credential grantors. In data repository server generates associations between credential identifiers and user identifiers for various users. Generally a user identifier includes information that uniquely identifies a user. Based on the associations server may use a user identifier in identifying a credential identifier for a particular user.

In an example companion may request a new user account from server e.g. using an application executing on companion device . In response to the request server generates in data repository a database entry representing a user account for companion . A credential grantor may generate in data repository a database entry in another table for a group of individuals that are granted credentials as employees of Company X. In this example the credential grantor could grant companion credentials of being an employee of Company X e.g. by linking the database entry for the user account for companion to the database entry in the other table for the group of individuals that are granted credentials as employees of Company X.

Furthermore server also may notify the users that they have been associated with credentials for example by pushing notifications to the respective users client devices. Such notifications may include the credential identifier for the credential and or a representation of the credential itself.

In an example server generates credential representation for companion . Generally credential representation includes a representation of a credential for companion . Server implements various techniques in using credential representation to validate a credential of companion . In an example when server generates a representation of a credential e.g. credential representation server stores in data repository a copy of the representation of the credential. In this example when server receives from signer device credential representation server queries data repository for valid representations of credentials that match credential representation . Generally a valid representation includes a representation for a credential of a companion. When server identifies a match between one of the valid representations and credential representation server validates the credential of companion and thereby confirms that companion in the presence of signer .

In another example upon receipt of credential representation for validation server is configured to generate in real time a representation of a credential for companion . In this example server may use a credential identifier for companion a type of credential represented by credential representation a type of representation for credential representation and other seed information in generating a representation of a credential for companion . In this example server validates a credential for companion e.g. when server identifies a match between the generated representation and credential representation .

Server may generate numerous types of representations of a credential including e.g. a numeric representation an ultrasonic audio signal representation an animated graphical representation a parametrically generated graphical representation a phrase and an optical machine readable representation each of which is described in further detail below.

In an example server generates a numeric representation of a credential. Generally a numeric representation includes a sequence of numbers e.g. 4 to 24 digit integers that is associated with a credential and a user. In some instances a given numeric representation will only be valid for a certain time period. In the example of server associates a numeric representation with a credential for companion and distributes the numeric representation to companion device . In this example companion presents a numeric value e.g. a stored numeric representation from the server to signer for example by making an utterance including the numeric value or displaying the numeric value rendered on companion device . In response signer may enter the numeric value into signer device and signer device may transmit the numeric value to server . In response server validates that the received numeric value matches a valid numeric representation for a credential e.g. a numeric representation for the credential that currently is associated with a user to whom the credential has been granted at the point in time signer device communicates the numeric value to server .

In an example server may implement various techniques in generating a numeric representation of a credential. In one example server may use a random number generator or pseudo random number generator provided by a function or library routines that are accessible to server . A pseudo random number generator may use a clock at server as a seed which may provide suitable randomness for some applications.

In some examples the numeric representations that server generates for credentials may be temporary and expire at a predetermined time e.g. after a predetermined time period . Server may choose a time period for the numeric representations such as for example one minute five minutes or ten minutes. The expiration time for the corresponding numeric representation can then be associated with the numeric representation. For example the expiration time may be an entry in data repository that is included with the entry for the numeric representation. In some examples the time period may vary depending on a length of the numeric representation. For example a 4 digit numeric representation may expire after a short time such as five minutes or ten minutes whereas a longer eight digit numeric representation may expire after a longer time such as one hour or one day. In some examples a longer numeric representation may be valid for an indefinite e.g. unlimited time period. This may be advantageous for example in cases where a user s client device does not have access to server via network .

In still another example server generates an alphanumeric representation of a credential. Generally an alphanumeric representation includes a sequence of one or more of numbers letters and or non numeric symbols. In an example an alphanumeric representation includes one or more of a string of letters a string of numbers and a string of letters and non numeric symbols or any combination thereof.

A numeric and or an alphanumeric representation can be transmitted from companion device to signer device in several ways. For example companion device could output an audio signal from a speaker corresponding to the contents e.g. symbols letters and or numeric values of the numeric and or the alphanumeric representation that would be received by signer device . This audio signal could be a human perceptible audible signal e.g. a signal with frequency ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz or it could be an ultrasonic signal e.g. a signal with frequency that exceeds 20 kHz that is detectable by a microphone on signer device . As another example companion device may transmit the numeric and or the alphanumeric representation to signer device using electronic radio frequency communications e.g. near field communications NFC or Bluetooth. In still another example companion could speak or show the contents of the numeric and or the alphanumeric representation to signer and signer can enter the numeric and or alphanumeric representation into signer device .

In another example server may generate optical machine readable representations for credentials. An optical machine readable representation may be an arrangement of graphical elements that encode alphanumeric data where the elements are arranged so that the data can be read by an optical scanner. For example an optical machine readable representation may be a bar code or a QR code.

In the example of companion device may receive optical machine readable representations for credentials from server and or may generate optical machine readable representations for credentials given credential identifiers user identifiers and or other values. In this example companion device outputs optical machine readable representations for credentials to the display of companion device . In response signer device can scan the optical machine readable representation from the display of companion device . In this example signer device transmits information indicative of the scanned optical machine readable representation to server . In this example the transmitted information includes information decoded from the optical machine readable representation of the credential e.g. a credential identifier and or a user identifier . In response server validates companion e.g. by confirming that the decoded information is associated with a credential for companion .

In this example server implements numerous techniques in generating optical machine readable representations. In an example server generates a set of alphanumeric characters from a user identifier and a credential identifier. Server also maps the user identifier and credential identifier to the set of characters e.g. using various techniques. For example the credential identifier and user identifier could be concatenated manipulated using mathematical functions encrypted using a cryptographic algorithm such as AES hashed using a hash function such as MD5 SHA 1 or SHA 2 subsampled to select a predetermined subset or subsets or any combination of these techniques to generate a suitable set of characters.

Once the set of alphanumeric characters has been generated server encodes the set of alphanumeric characters to generate an optical machine readable representation for the credential e.g. using various techniques. For example server may call a function or library routine that encodes QR codes in accordance with the QR code International Organization for Standardization ISO standard ISO IEC 18004 2006 RSS Information technology Automatic identification and data capture techniques QR Code 2005 bar code symbology specification. In another example companion device may generate the optical machine readable representation. In this example server transmits the set of alphanumeric characters to companion device for use in generating the optical machine readable representation e.g. as described above. Companion device can store the optical machine readable representation in a suitable memory.

In another example rather than server and or companion device encoding the generated set of alphanumeric characters into an optical machine readable representation companion device may transmit to signer device the generated set of alphanumeric characters in several ways. For example companion device could output an audio signal from a speaker corresponding to the contents e.g. the symbols letters and or numeric values of the generated set of alphanumeric characters that would be received by signer device . This audio signal could be a human perceptible audible signal e.g. a signal with frequency ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz or it could be an ultrasonic signal e.g. a signal with frequency that exceeds 20 kHz that is detectable by a microphone on signer device . As another example companion device may transmit the generated set of alphanumeric characters to signer device using electronic radio frequency communications e.g. NFC or Bluetooth.

In still another example server generates parametrically generated graphical representations for credentials. Generally a parametrically generated graphical representation includes a visual display that is generated using one or more parameters as inputs to one or more mathematical equations such as a three dimensional rendering of an object or an image of a fractal. In this example the parameters can be generated from seed values such as a credential identifier and a time.

Server may generate in real time a parametrically generated graphical representation of a credential of companion e.g. to compare the generated representation to credential representation in validating a credential of companion . In this example credential representation may include information specifying a time at which credential representation was generated and or a credential identifier for companion e.g. to enable server to use the specified time as a seed value and or to use the credential identifier as a seed value.

In some examples the parametrically generated graphical representation for the credential can be a three dimensional rendering of an object. The object can be for example a simple polyhedron such as a cube tetrahedron or icosahedron or a more complicated object such as a helix trefoil knot Lissajous knot torus torus knot or hyperbolic knot. Various aspects of the three dimensional rendering can be specified using a variety of parameters.

Parameters may specify the shape of the object. Parameters also may specify for example the color of the object the texture applied to the object the reflection image of an image applied to the object the background over which the object is displayed and or a light source position for the object. For example seed values e.g. time and or credential identifiers could be input into an equation that generates an output that may be used as an index into a collection of different colors textures reflection images and or backgrounds from which the color texture reflection image and or background may be selected. Furthermore seed values e.g. time and or credential identifiers could be input into an equation that generates an output that may be used as an index into a collection of objects e.g. a simple polyhedron such as a cube tetrahedron or icosahedron or a more complicated object such as a helix trefoil knot Lissajous knot torus torus knot or hyperbolic knot from which the object to be rendered is selected. In addition the three dimensional rendering of the object also may be animated which can advantageously make replication of the image more difficult. For example parameters may specify a camera location a camera path an object rotation direction an object translation and or an object rotation speed. Any suitable combination of one or more of these parameters may be fixed or variable. The three dimensional object can be rendered based on these parameters using a suitable application programming interface such as OpenGL or Direct3D.

In this example server generates a parametrically generated graphical representation of a credential for companion . Server transmits to companion device the parametrically generated graphical representation of a credential. In response companion device displays the parametrically generated graphical representation for signer . Using signer device signer may scan into signer device the parametrically generated graphical representation.

In this example signer device transmits to server information indicative of the parametrically generated graphical representation. In response server compares the parametrically generated graphical representation with valid representations for credentials for companion . In the example one of the valid representations matches the parametrically generated graphical representation and therefore the parametrically generated graphical representation is validated.

In still another example server generates animated graphical representations for credentials. In this example data repository stores multiple animated graphical representations. The animated graphical representations may be for example hypertext markup language HTML animations animated graphical interchange formation GIF files Motion Pictures Expert Group MPEG files Adobe Flash animations or any combination thereof n animation may be for example a sequence of images defined by one of these files.

In this example server may access the stored graphical representations by way of index values where an index value may correspond to a single representation. For example in examples where the representations are stored in a file system an index value may correspond to a file name for example a uniform resource identifier URI to the file. In examples where the representations are stored in a database the index value may correspond to a particular database entry. In some examples multiple index values could identify one particular representation. For example one index value could identify a file directory and another could identify a particular file within that directory. In some examples one index value could identify multiple representations for example where the index value identifies a file directory including multiple representations. It should be appreciated that index values may identify graphical representations stored at any location. In this example the graphical representations may be stored on client devices at server in data repository or at any other location accessible via network .

In operation server can use seed values e.g. a credential identifier and a time to generate an index value identifying a current graphical representation for a credential. The time can be a current timestamp e.g. seconds or milliseconds from epoch obtained from a timing device such as a hardware or software clock located at the client device. In some examples the timing device can be synchronized with server and or with one or more additional servers that provide a master clock reference as described below. Additional seed values may be used such as a user identifier and or randomly generated numbers. When a user identifier is used as a seed value the graphical representation for the credential may be specific to a particular user. When a randomly generated number is used it may be stored by server and associated with the credential identifier and a user or group identifier for additional security.

Server may map the seed values to index values using any suitable technique. The technique may allow applications executing on different client devices to generate the same index values given the same input values e.g. the same credential identifier and time . For example the credential identifier could be used to seed a pseudo random number generator function and then the resulting value could be added to a value representing the time. In such cases the pseudo random number generator function may be configured so that different computers can generate the same value when they are called at substantially the same time and receive the same credential identifier as a seed value. The seed values can be concatenated manipulated using mathematical functions hashed using a hash function such as MD5 SHA 1 or SHA 2 subsampled to select a predetermined subset or subsets or any combination of these techniques to generate a suitable number of parameters.

In server validates an animated graphical representation by comparing it with a valid representation for a credential for companion . If the animated graphical representation matches the valid representation server validates that signer is in the presence of companion .

In still another example server generates representations of phrases corresponding to credentials. Generally a phrase includes a sequence of two or more words selected from one or more dictionaries of words. A phrase need not form a grammatical construct. A dictionary as used herein is a data structure in which index values identify words. A given dictionary may include many thousands or more different words.

Server accesses contents of an electronic dictionary that is stored in data repository e.g. by way of index values where an index value can identify a single word or a group of words. For example in examples where the words are stored in a property list an index value may correspond to a key that stores a word as its value. In examples where the words are stored in a database the index value may correspond to a particular database entry. In some examples multiple index values could identify one particular word or group of words. For example one index value could identify a specific dictionary e.g. one hashmap in a collection of hashmaps and another index value could identify a particular word within that dictionary e.g. a key from the identified hashmap . In some examples one index value could identify multiple words for example where the index value identifies a group of words.

In operation server can use seed values e.g. a credential identifier and a time to generate one or more index values identifying a phrase for a credential. The time can be a current timestamp e.g. seconds or milliseconds from epoch obtained from a timing device such as a hardware or software clock located at the client device. In some examples the timing device can be synchronized with server and or with one or more additional servers that provide a master clock reference as described below. Additional seed values may be used such as a user identifier a group identifier and or randomly generated numbers. When a user identifier is used as a seed value a phrase representative of a credential may be specific to a particular user. When a group identifier is used a phrase representative of a credential may be specific to a particular group. When a randomly generated number is used it may be stored by server and associated with the credential identifier for additional security.

Server may map the seed values to index values using any suitable technique. The technique may allow applications executing on different client devices to generate the same index values given the same input values e.g. the same credential identifier and time .

For example the credential identifier could be used to seed a pseudo random number generator function and then the resulting value could be added to a value representing the time. In such cases the pseudo random number generator function may be configured so that different computers can generate the same value when they are called at substantially the same time and receive the same credential identifier as a seed value. The seed values can be concatenated manipulated using mathematical functions hashed using a hash function such as MD5 SHA 1 or SHA 2 subsampled to select a predetermined subset or subsets or any combination of these techniques to generate a suitable number of index values.

A phrase can be transmitted from companion device to signer device in several ways. For example companion device could output an audio signal from a speaker corresponding to the phrase that would be received by signer device . This audio signal could be a human perceptible audible signal e.g. a signal with frequency ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz or it could be an ultrasonic signal e.g. a signal with frequency that exceeds 20 kHz that is detectable by a microphone on signer device . As another example companion device may transmit the phrase to signer device using electronic radio frequency communications e.g. NFC or Bluetooth. In still another example companion could speak the phrase to signer .

Server can validate a phrase in various manners. In an example signer device transmits information indicative of the phrase to server . In response server compares the information indicative of the phrase to information indicative of a valid phrase for companion . If server identifies a match between the information indicative of the phrase and the information indicative of the valid phrase for companion server validates that companion is in the presence of signer .

In the example of data repository stores electronic resource . In this example electronic resource is associated with condition . A user s ability to electronically sign e.g. signer s ability to electronically sign electronic resource is restricted e.g. until server and or signer device detect that condition is satisfied. Condition may include various types of conditions including e.g. time based conditions geographic location based conditions conditions specifying that electronic resource can be electronically signed if the signer is in the presence of a companion and so forth.

In an example condition includes a time based condition in which electronic resource can only be electronically signed by signer at predefined times e.g. eleven pm and or within predefined time ranges e.g. eleven pm to five am . In an example condition includes a geographic location based condition in which electronic resource can only be electronically signed by signer when signer and or signer device is located at a predefined geographic location e.g. Boston Mass. .

In still another example condition specifies that electronic resource can be electronically signed by signer if signer is in the presence of a companion including e.g. companion . In this example condition specifies that the companion is required to be a specific person to enable electronic resource to be unlocked. For example condition may include a list of names of specific people and or other identifying information for specific people e.g. user and or credential identifiers for specific people . In another example condition specifies that the companion is required to hold a specific credential type to enable the document to be unlocked. In this example condition may specify that a companion is credentialed as an employee at a particular company as a student at a particular educational institution as having an account at a particular financial institution as being a notary public and so forth.

Condition may also specify that companion be queried for confirmation that companion intends to enable electronic resource to be unlocked for electronic signing by signer e.g. before signer is allowed to electronically sign electronic resource . In this example server may send to companion device a message prompting companion to confirm that companion intends to enable electronic resource to be unlocked for electronic signing by signer . In this example upon receipt of confirmation from companion and upon satisfaction of other elements of condition server enables electronic signing of electronic resource as described in further detail below.

In this example signer requests to access electronic resource from data repository . In the example of signer device sends to server a request for electronic resource . In this example electronic resource is associated with condition which specifies that electronic resource can be electronically signed by signer if signer is in the presence of companion . In response to the request server sends to signer device electronic resource with electronic resource being in a locked state.

In this example signer device receives electronic resource in a locked state. In this example signer may verbally communicate to companion that signer needs companion to unlock electronic resource e.g. by enabling signer to prove that signer is in the presence of companion . In this example companion may use companion device to request from server a credential of companion .

In response to companion requesting the credential server transmits to companion device credential representation . In this example credential representation includes a representation of a credential for companion . Credential representation may include one or more of a numeric representation an ultrasonic audio signal representation an animated graphical representation a parametrically generated graphical representation an audio representation of a phrase and an optical machine readable representation.

Server identifies companion device using various techniques. In an example server identifies companion device based on the request for a credential that companion device sends to server . In another example prior to the request for access to electronic resource signer sends to server companion information e.g. information identifying one or more companions of signer . The companion information may include email addresses mobile telephone numbers and so forth. In response to the request from signer for access to electronic resource server accesses companion information for signer . Server may send to various companion devices preliminary messages requesting that the companions specify whether they are in proximity to signer . Based on the responses to the preliminary messages server sends credential representation to those companion devices that are used by companions who specified that they are in proximity to signer .

In still another example companion device may request from server a credential identifier for a credential associated with companion . In this example the request may include a user identifier that is associated with companion . Using the user identifier server determines a credential identifier that is associated with the user identifier in data repository .

In this example server transmits to companion device the credential identifier. Using the credential identifier companion device generates credential representation e.g. using one of the above described techniques for the various types of representations.

In the example of companion device transfers credential representation to signer device and or presents credential representation to signer . In an example credential representation includes a numeric representation. In this example companion transfers credential representation to signer e.g. by showing signer the numeric representation that is displayed on companion device . In response signer enters e.g. types the numeric representation into signer device e.g. for subsequent transfer to server .

In another example credential representation includes a QR code. In this example signer uses signer device to scan e.g. photograph into signer device the QR code for companion . In still another example companion device may transfer credential representation to signer device using NFC ultrasonic audio signals or others of the above described techniques.

In the example of signer device receives credential representation . In response signer device transmits credential representation and or information indicative of credential representation to server . Using credential representation and or information indicative of credential representation server validates that companion is in the presence of signer .

For example credential representation may include an identifier e.g. a credential identifier a user identifier and so forth for companion . In another example when signer device transmits credential representation to server signer device also transmits the identifier for companion . Using the identifier server identifies in data repository representations of credentials for companion . In this example data repository stores representations of credentials in association with identifier. In this example server compares credential representation to the stored representations of credentials. If server determines a match between credential representation and one of the stored representations server confirms that companion is in the presence of signer .

In another example server identifies a credential type for credential representation . In this example server uses the credential identifier for companion to generate e.g. in real time a representation of a credential of the identified type e.g. using the techniques described above for generation of various types of representations of credentials. In this example server compares credential representation to the generated representation of the credential. If server determines a match between credential representation and the generated representation of the credential server confirms that companion is in the presence of signer .

Based on confirmation of companion being in the presence of signer server determines that condition for electronic resource is satisfied. Based on satisfaction of condition server transitions electronic resource to an unlocked state for electronic signing by signer . In this example server transmits electronic resource to signer device for electronic signing by signer . In another example server stores in data repository a private key not shown of the signer . In this example the private key is held in escrow e.g. in which use of the private key is restricted until condition is satisfied. Responsive to validating the credential of companion server may enable signer to request that server sign electronic resource on behalf of signer e.g. using the private key of signer that is held in escrow by server .

In an example server may record information identifying companion who facilitates the unlocking of electronic resource . As previously described server may use a credential identifier of companion in validating credential representation . In this example data repository stores the credential identifier e.g. in association with a user identifier for companion . Based on the association between the credential identifier and the user identifier server uses the credential identifier to identify the user identifier for companion . In this example server generates an entry in data repository with the entry specifying that electronic resource was unlocked. Server generates an association between the entry and the user identifier for companion e.g. to record information specifying that companion facilitated the unlocking of electronic resource .

In a variation of electronic resource may be stored locally on signer device . In this example electronic resource may have a signature field that may transition between a locked state and an unlocked state. In this example after validating the credential of companion server may transmit message to signer device . Message includes information that causes the signature field in electronic resource to be unlocked thereby enabling signer to electronically sign electronic resource .

In still another variation of signer device is configured to validate credential representation e.g. without interaction with server . In this example signer device has access to valid representations that are stored in data repository and or in other data repositories or signer device otherwise may be able to generate such valid representations to confirm the validity of credential representation .

Server can be a variety of computing devices capable of receiving data and running one or more services including e.g. application which can be accessed by client devices . In an example server can include a distributed computing system a desktop computer a laptop a cell phone a rack mounted server and the like. Server can be a single server or a group of servers that are at a same position or at different positions. Server and each of client devices can execute programs having a client server relationship to each other. Although distinct modules are shown in in some examples client and server programs can execute on the same device.

Server can receive data from client devices through input output I O interface . I O interface can be a type of interface capable of receiving data over a network including e.g. an Ethernet interface a wireless networking interface a fiber optic networking interface a modem and so forth. Server also includes a processing device and memory . A bus system including for example a data bus and a motherboard can be used to establish and to control data communication between the components of server .

Application can be implemented in software running on a computer device e.g. server hardware or a combination of software and hardware.

In the example of client device can be a variety of computing devices capable of receiving data and running one or more services including e.g. an application not shown . In an example client device can include a server a distributed computing system a desktop computer a laptop a tablet a smart phone a cell phone a rack mounted server and the like.

Client device can receive data from client device and from server through I O interface . I O interface can be a type of interface capable of receiving data over a network including e.g. an Ethernet interface a wireless networking interface a fiber optic networking interface a modem and so forth. Client device also includes a processing device and memory . A bus system including for example a data bus and a motherboard can be used to establish and to control data communication between the components of client device .

As shown in memory stores computer programs that are executable by processing device . These computer programs may include an application not shown for implementing the operations and or the techniques described herein. The application can be implemented in software running on a client device hardware or a combination of software and hardware.

In operation signer device requests from server access to electronic resource . In response server makes electronic resource available to signer in a locked state.

In the example of server also generates credential representation . In a variation of server may generate credential representation substantially in parallel with server making electronic resource available to signer . Server transmits credential representation to companion device and companion device receives credential representation . Companion device also causes signer device to receive credential representation . For example when credential representation includes a QR code a display screen of companion device may display the QR code. In this example signer device receives credential representation by signer using a scanner to scan the QR code into signer device .

In this example signer device receives credential representation and or information indicative of credential representation . In response signer device transmits credential representation and or information indicative of credential representation to server e.g. for validation of the credential of companion which in turn validates that companion is in the presence of signer . Server validates that the credential represented by credential representation is for companion . As previously described server may validate the credential of companion by comparing credential representation to one or more valid representations of credentials for companion . If server determines a match between credential representation and one of the valid representations of credentials for companion server validates credential representation as representing a valid credential of companion . Based on the validation of credential representation server confirms that companion is in the presence of signer or that signer has received companion s authorization to electronically sign electronic resource e.g. because in order for companion device to transmit credential representation to signer device using one of the above described techniques companion device and or companion may need to be in proximity e.g. geographic closeness to and or communication with signer device .

Following validation of credential representation server unlocks electronic resource for electronic signing by signer and transmits to signer device information specifying that electronic resource is unlocked for electronic signing. Signer device receives the information specifying that electronic resource is unlocked. In response signer may sign electronic resource e.g. may electronically sign a signature field in electronic resource . In another example signer may request that server electronically sign electronic resource on behalf of signer e.g. using a private key of signer as described above.

In a variation of companion device may generate the credential representation e.g. rather than receiving the credential representation from server . In this example companion device may generate the credential representation using information received from server . The received information may include a credential identifier of a credential associated with a companion using companion device .
