In some embodiments oxygen permeability of the cellulose hydrogel can be tested using a polarographic method. This method directly measures the number of oxygen molecules diffusing though the material by measuring an electric current generated by the reduction of oxygen at the cathode. In a single polarographic determination four samples of the same material with different thicknesses can be used. This results in a linear relation between the inverse of oxygen transmissibility and the sample thickness. The sample can be placed onto the surface of the electrode cell fixed gently by pressing toward the electrode and retained with an o ring. Then a saline solution e.g. 0.9 NaCl pH 7.4 is poured into the reservoir on the material and the system is ready for the measurement of the electric current. The system is held in a humidity chamber at 35 C. with high humidity the polarographic cell and the saline solution were in the humidity chamber prior the measurement to achieve equilibrium conditions . The saline solution and the sample are saturated with atmospheric oxygen. To remove it nitrogen gas is bubbled through a glass frit while monitoring current until the current decreases to nearly zero. Once most of the oxygen is removed air is bubbled into the solution and the increase in electric current is observed as the oxygen molecules react with the cathode.

Application of the teachings of the present invention to a specific problem is within the capabilities of one having ordinary skill in the art in light of the teaching contained herein. Examples of the compositions and methods of the invention appear in the following non limiting Examples.

Seven different types of cellulose were evaluated to determine suitable material for synthesis of a cellulose hydrogel.

The cellulose hydrogel was synthesized by activating 2 5 grams of cellulose powder in 100 ml N N dimethylacetamide DMAc and stirring for example at 350 rpm for 24 hours. In a separate beaker 8 grams of LiCl was dissolved in 100 ml DMAc and stirred at 350 rpm. The DMAc was decanted from the activated cellulose powder and the LiCl DMAc solution was poured onto the cellulose and stirred for 10 minutes. The resulting transparent solutions were poured into desired molds and allowed to gel overnight. The gels were de molded and washed in running water for several hours.

The hydrogels were subjected to various analyses including Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy FTIR X ray diffraction XRD and thermogravimetric analysis TGA to determine 1 whether there were any chemical differences between different varieties of cellulose 2 how different phases of cellulose compare raw powder wet hydrogel dry gel re wet gel and 3 whether the gels were washed successfully. As shown in there were no significant chemical differences between the varieties of cellulose and the washing procedure was successful.

X ray diffraction analysis was performed to determine whether there were any differences in crystallinity between the varieties of cellulose and how crystallinity compared between the raw powder and hydrogel phases. The degree of crystallinity I 1 I I was calculated according to Buschle Diller and Zeronian 45 967 1992 . The hydrogels are less crystalline than the raw powders .

The ratio of cellulose I to cellulose II was also investigated according to the method of Gindl and Keckes 46 10221 10225 2005 . The ratio of cellulose I II is significantly lower in the hydrogel phase and bacterial cellulose has a much greater cellulose I II ratio in the raw phase than the other varieties. The results are shown in Table 2 below.

Cellulose hydrogels prepared under different concentrations 2 3 4 and 5 g were analyzed by TA instrument Q5000 Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer TGA . All samples were heated from RT to 500 C at 20 C min under N2 purge. During the test sample weight change versus temperature was recorded. Derivatives of wt with regard to temperature dWt dT was used to probe the peak temperature for each thermal transition. The mass lost during the temperature increase reflected the water content. As shown in the range of water content obtained for the various wet hydrogels was about 91 95 . TGA analysis comparing dried re wet and never dried hydrogels is shown in .

The transparency of 100 micron thick cellulose hydrogels was also determined. Percent transmittance values were generated at a wavelength of 550 nm. The transparency of all cellulose hydrogels exceeded 95 in the visible range. The results are shown in .

The refractive index of the cellulose hydrogels was measured. The results are shown in Table 3 along with a comparison with various commercially available contact lenses.

The tear strength of cellulose hydrogels in three different states hydrated dehydrated and rehydrated was characterized. All samples were made to conform to the geometry stated in ASTM standard D 624 00 sample type C. Samples in the hydrated state were made by pouring the cellulose LiCl DMAc solution into a mold with the appropriate sample geometry. Cheesecloth was placed in the ends of the mold before pouring to assist in gripping the hydrated gels during testing. Hydrated samples were allowed to gel overnight washed in running tap water for 2 4 hours soaked in tap water with frequent water exchange for 24 48 hours and stored in tap water. Sheets of cellulose hydrogel were made by pouring the cellulose LiCl DMAc solution onto a glass plate and allowing to gel overnight. Sheets were dehydrated between glass plates lined with Teflon film in an oven above 100 C. for approximately 5 hours. The sheets were then rehydrated in tap water for several hours. Samples were cut from rehydrated sheets by hand and either returned to water rehydrated or allowed to air dry dehydrated . The thickness of all samples was measured prior to testing in three locations near the site of tearing at the apex above and below the apex and the three values were averaged to obtain the sample thickness. All samples were tested using a 500N capacity tabletop mechanical testing system 5942R4910 Instron with a 5N maximum static load cell 102608 Instron . Pneumatic side action grips were used to secure the samples 2712 019 Instron . Samples were tested with a constant extension rate of 2 mm min until failure. The tear strength was calculated as the force at failure divided by the average thickness N mm . Two different cellulose materials Avicel 101 and Aldrich 4 and two different concentrations 2 g and 5 g were characterized and compared in each state hydrated dehydrated and rehydrated . See . Tear strength of typical contact lenses is 0.37 0.49 N mm.

The suture retention strength of cellulose hydrogels was characterized as a measure of their surgical feasibility. Cellulose hydrogels in three states hydrated dehydrated and rehydrated were characterized. Samples were cut from cellulose sheets as described above. Samples were cut in rectangles 2 cm 4 cm. The testing procedure described by Trowbridge et al. was modified for use in this study Trowbridge E. A. Lawford P. V. and Crofts C. E. Pericardial heterografts a comparative study of suture pull out and tissue strength. 11 1989 311 14 . All samples were tested using a 500N capacity tabletop mechanical testing system 5942R4910 Instron with a 5N maximum static load cell 102608 Instron . Pneumatic side action grips were used to secure the samples 2712 019 Instron . Before testing the thickness of each sample was measured at three points along one of the short edges designated the top edge . The sample was then secured in the stationary bottom pneumatic grip with half of the sample inside of the grip and a suture was threaded through the sample once in the center of the sample with a bite size of 2 mm from the top edge. Ethicon Ethilon 10 0 ophthalmic sutures were used 7756G and 7711G Ethicon Inc. . Both ends of the suture were secured in the movable top pneumatic grip. shows a diagram of the sample setup and shows results of the testing. Samples were tested with a constant extension rate of 10 mm min until failure. The suture retention strength was taken to be the force at failure divided by the average sample thickness N mm .

Puncture strength was measured according to the method described by Radebaugh et al. Radebaugh et al. 45 1988 p 39 46 . A schematic of their setup is shown in and the fixture used for testing is shown in . Rather than fixing the hydrogel between two plates using screws which can pinch or tear the gel the hydrogels were secured to the fixture with cyanoacrylate. A hemispherical probe with a 2 mm diameter was lowered onto the gel at a rate of 2 or 10 mm min.

The tensile strength of the prepared wet cellulose hydrogels was measured using a 500N capacity tabletop mechanical testing system 5942R4910 Instron with a 5N maximum static load cell 102608 Instron . Pneumatic side action grips were used to secure the samples 2712 019 Instron . A constant extension rate of 2 mm min until failure was used and the tensile strength was calculated from the stress vs. strain data plots. Samples were prepared by pouring the cellulose LiCl DMAc solution into a dogbone mold as shown in . Cheesecloth was placed in both ends of the mold before pouring to assist in gripping the gels during testing. Samples were allowed to gel overnight washed in running tap water for 2 4 hours soaked in tap water with frequent water exchange for 24 48 hours and stored in tap water until use. Prior to testing the width and thickness of the hydrogel at the center of the dogbone as well as the gauge length were measured for all samples. Initially six different cellulose materials Avicel 101 Avicel 102 Avicel 105 Avicel 200 Aldrich 310697 and Aldrich 435236 at a concentration of 2 w v dry cellulose to LiCl DMAc solution were characterized. Avicel 101 and Aldrich 435236 were further characterized at varying concentrations 2 5 and varying stir times in the LiCl DMAc solution 5 30 minutes .

The transmittance of the cellulose hydrogels was measured in the range of wavelengths from 250 to 800 nm using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 9500 series UV visible spectrophotometer. As transmittance is dependent upon thickness the thickness of each sample was measured with calipers prior to loading the sample in the spectrophotometer. Transmittance values were then normalized to a thickness of 100 pun according to

Oxygen permeability of the cellulose and collagen materials can be determined using a polarographic method. This method directly measures the number of oxygen molecules diffusing though the material by measuring an electric current generated by the reduction of oxygen at the cathode. In a single polarographic determination for example four samples of the same material with different thicknesses can be used. This results in a linear relation between the inverse of oxygen transmissibility and the sample thickness. The sample is placed onto the surface of the electrode cell fixed gently by pressing toward the electrode and retained with an o ring. Then a saline solution 0.9 NaCl pH 7.4 is poured into the reservoir on the material and the system is ready for measuring the electric current. The system is held in a humidity chamber at 35 C. with high humidity the polarographic cell and the saline solution are in the humidity chamber prior the measurement to achieve equilibrium conditions . The saline solution and the sample are saturated with atmospheric oxygen. To remove the oxygen nitrogen gas is bubbled through a glass flit while monitoring current until the current decreases to nearly zero. Once most of the oxygen is removed air is bubbled into the solution and the increase in electric current is observed as the oxygen molecules react with the cathode. The current is recorded until it reaches a stationary state.

Two drops of PBS buffer are added to the cavity in the bottom half of a contact lens mold an embodiment of which is illustrated in . The cavity is covered with a 2 cm 2 cm sheet of cellulose which can be substituted with a cellulose hydrogel of the invention . 1 2 more drops of PBS buffer are placed on top of the cellulose. The top half of the contact lens mold is then put over the bottom half. A spring clamp is then applied to keep the halves together. The mold is then placed in a humidity chamber at 40 relative humidity and 40 C. After 48 hours the clamp is removed and the mold is opened. The excess cellulose and gel is then trimmed and removed as necessary. The lens is then stored in PBS buffer.

A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility and related physical properties of cellulose based hydrogel contact lenses according to certain embodiments of the present invention for potential use as a corneal bandage.

Cellulose hydrogels were prepared by activating the cellulose powder or dried bacterial cellulose BC pellicle in 100 mL N N dimethylacetamide DMAc with stirring for 24 hours after which 8 g of LiCl was added with continued stirring and gentle heating until the solution became clear. The resulting solution was poured into molds of appropriate dimensions and allowed to gel. The gelled samples were gently washed in water to remove excess LiCl DMAc and stored in water prior to characterization.

Hydrogel oxygen permeability was measured using the polarographic method. The samples were fixed in place on a flat polarography cell having a gold cathode surrounded by a silver anode. The system was held in a humidity chamber at 35 C. with humidity 90 . A 0.9 saline solution pH 7.4 was used in the reservoir. The system was saturated with nitrogen to remove the oxygen as noted by the current being nearly zero. Next air was bubbled through a glass frit into the solution and the change in current recorded. Three reference materials were used to develop a calibration curve from which the permeability of the samples was calculated and corrected for boundary layer and edge effects. illustrates a diagram of the polarographic cell used for the measurement of the oxygen permeability of the hydrogels. shows the calibration curve from which the permeability of the samples was calculated.

The measured oxygen permeability of the hydrogels is in the range reported for commercial contact lenses and thus would allow sufficient oxygen transport for ocular surface applications. As shown in the average oxygen permeability for the hydrogels ranged from 60 to 94 Dk which is within the range of commercial contact lenses.

Hydrogels from the three different materials Avicel 101 MCC4 and BC and a conventional polymethylmethacrylate PMMA contact lens were evaluated for acute immune response and cytotoxicity. The gels were implanted in 6 week old female rats. Under inhalation anesthesia Isoflurane a 1.5 cm incision was made on the back of rats to insert each implant. After implantation each incision was closed by 4 0 nylon suture. The rats were sacrificed 3 or 7 days after surgery and each specimen was cultured under aseptic techniques. Sections 5 m of dehydrated paraffin embedded specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin H E according to standard method. As shown in scale bar 100 microns H E staining images show that after 7 days the immune responses to the cellulose implants were less severe than the commercial contact lens in which the region identified as M indicates the location of the material. In particular 3 days after implantation and E 7 days after implantation show the H E staining images of hydrogel implants and surrounding tissue with Avicel 101. 3 days after implantation and F 7 days after implantation show the H E staining images of hydrogel implants and surrounding tissue with bacterial cellulose BC . 3 days after implantation and G 7 days after implantation show the H E staining images of hydrogel implants and surrounding tissue with MCC4. 3 days after implantation and H 7 days after implantation show the H E staining images of conventional PMMA material and surrounding tissue.

The starting materials and their resulting hydrogels were subjected to endotoxin analysis both with and without a Glucan blocker Lonza Walkersville Md. . Initial results suggested endotoxins were introduced via handling the hydrogels during synthesis. Thus three important changes were made to the synthesis procedure 1 all glassware was depyrogenated using dry heat 2 all water used was sterile filtered 0.2 um filter and 3 all synthesis steps were carried out in a laminar flow hood. These simple changes resulted in a 95 reduction in endotoxin level. More careful handling of the final gels reduced the endotoxin levels an additional 97 which reached the acceptable levels for medical devices 

Avicel 101 was chosen as the cellulose material for contact lens development based on the combined results of the previous results. As such a contact lens shaped mold was designed and fabricated. Using the methods described above contact lenses were prepared for in vivo testing.

One week prior to the study start the nictitating membranes of four male New Zealand White rabbits were fixed. A commercial lens Hydrokone Hioxifilcon A Benz G5X p GMA HEMA was used as a control and was placed in the rabbits right eye and the experimental cellulose lens was placed in the rabbits left eye. Lenses were evaluated for fit abrasion and toxicity ISO 9394 . The rabbits were monitored clinically each day using the Drazie scale and weekly via slit lamp examination and fluorescein staining. The rabbits were sacrificed after 22 days for pathological examination. Each specimen was cultured under aseptic techniques. Sections 5 m of dehydrated paraffin embedded specimens were stained with H E Masson s trichrome and PAS according to standard methods.

The cellulose contact lenses were more stable but slightly more irritating than the COTS lenses on the corneal surface. There was no abrasion of the corneal surface from either lens after circular rubbing 50 times. After 21 days of wear for a minimum of 7 hours per day the experimental eyes showed no corneal opacity iris lesions conjunctival chemosis or aqueous flare. The histology suggests a flattening of the corneal surface. This and the increased redness is likely not due to the material but to its geometry and could be improved via manufacturing optimization. shows the lens fit far left and abrasion far right after circular rubbing 50 times. shows the histology after 21 days of wear with a minimum of 7 hours per day of wear.

The foregoing results demonstrate for example cellulose hydrogels were synthesized using aseptic methods to result in lenses with desirable material properties including high oxygen permeability and low endotoxin levels. In vivo biocompatibility was demonstrated using a rat subcutaneous implant model. Cellulose hydrogel contact lens were successfully tested in vivo and showed no evidence of corneal toxicity for 21 days though the fit needs to be improved. This material shows promise for use as a temporary corneal bandage for example in the combat setting until hospital treatment can be received.
