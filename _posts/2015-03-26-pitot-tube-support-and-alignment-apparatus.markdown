title: Pitot tube support and alignment apparatus
abstract: A support and alignment apparatus for a traversing pitot tube is provided. The apparatus includes a support strut, an insertion fitting and a termination fitting. The support strut spans within the duct, with each end of the strut being attached to one of the fittings. The pitot tube is routed through the insertion fitting and into the support strut. The strut supports the pitot tube as it traverses the duct. A slot cut along the length of the strut allows the pitot tube to extend away from the strut, into and parallel to the flow. The slot aligns the end of the pitot tube with the flow and prevents unwanted rotation, vibration, and flexing of the pitot tube to increase measurement accuracy.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties.

The present invention relates to pitot tubes for use in flow measurement systems. More particularly the present invention relates to support and alignment of a traversing pitot tube.

Pitot tubes are pressure sensing instruments used to determine the velocity of fluid flows. Depending on the arrangement they can sample total pressure static pressure or both pressures simultaneously. Pitot tubes are widely used as airspeed indicators in the aviation industry and as gas flow meters in industrial applications.

A pitot tube consists of a tube oriented to direct fluid flow directly into or across an orifice. Generally pitot tubes are configured with a right angle bend such that one leg is perpendicular to the flow and the other leg is extends into and parallel to the flow. One or more orifices are positioned within the leg that is parallel to the flow. The orifices are then connected to pressure sensing transducers or manometers.

If the orifice is directly aligned with the flow the pitot tube samples stagnation or total pressure. If the orifice is aligned perpendicular to the flow the static pressure of the fluid is sampled. A single orifice of a pitot tube allows it to measure the fluid state at a single point vice averaging over a large area.

An alternate version of the pitot tube known as a pitot static tube samples both total pressure and static pressure simultaneously. The static signal can be subtracted from the stagnation signal to determine the dynamic pressure of the flow at that location. Then for an incompressible flow with a known density this dynamic pressure can be used to calculate velocity in a manner well known in the art.

A common technique used for determining the velocity profile within a square or round duct is known as a pitot traverse. The pitot traverse requires that a number of pitot static measurements are taken at specific points perpendicular to the flow within the duct. Then the magnitudes can be plotted to determine the velocity profile.

A velocity profile is typically used to calculate the overall average velocity and mass flow rate. It can be used to identify zones of recirculation or instability resulting from upstream obstructions or to check for fully developed flow.

However performing a pitot traverse measurement across a large distance within a large diameter duct or under high velocity flow is problematic. As the pitot tube samples only at a single small location the pitot tube must be cantilevered and extended into the flow further and further to reach sample points on the opposite side of the duct. These conditions can cause the orifice on the pitot tube to wander and vibrate during the measurement whereas precise placement of the orifice within the duct is critical to conducting a proper pitot traverse.

Current designs rely on a single end support fitting mounted to the duct wall that attempts to hold the pitot tube in place. While they do help for the near wall measurements they are of little benefit for far wall measurements where the bending moment resulting from flow drag forces on the pitot tube is the greatest.

The use of an overly stiff pitot tube to resist bending and flutter has been tried. However for some large duct sizes and high fluid flow velocities the size and stiffness required is impractical and typically unavailable. Velocity averaging pitot tubes have also been tried. These pitot tubes can be made significantly stiffer and extend all the way across the duct so as to be supported on both ends. However velocity averaging pitot tubes sample at numerous locations and average readings into one pressure signal. They do not provide the flexibility or the fidelity of the single point sample of a standard pitot. Nor can they provide detailed velocity profile data.

Vibration or singing of the pitot tube is another problem that must be overcome. Vibration of a pitot tube results from fluid dynamic forces generated by the oscillating vortex sheet behind the cantilevered tube. When the frequency of these oscillations matches the natural frequency of the pitot tube system and its support resonance occurs. The effects of vibration for a cantilevered pitot tube have been found to result in significant over indication of pressure with increases in vibration amplitude.

Again previous solutions have relied on making the end support and tube prohibitively stiff. Common fluid dynamic fixes such as trailing fins or strakes are also not feasible for a traversing pitot tube as they would prohibit or severely limit translation.

Thus a need has been recognized in the state of the art to provide a means to increase the accuracy of a pitot tube measurement probe when measuring the mass flow rate of a fluid within a duct using a traverse sampling technique. There is also a need to provide a means to minimize bending of the pitot tube when extended across the width of a duct. A further need exists to minimize vibration of the pitot tube during such extension of the tube.

It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a support and alignment apparatus for a traversing pitot tube. The apparatus includes first and second end fittings and a support strut. The first end fitting attaches to one wall of the duct and the second end fitting attaches to the far side of the duct opposite the first end fitting.

The support strut spans within the duct with each end of the support strut being attached to one of the end fittings. The support strut can be fabricated from a hollow tube. A slot is cut along the length of the support strut. A pitot tube is routed through the first end support fitting and into the support strut. The support strut supports the pitot tube as it traverses the duct while the support strut slot allows the pitot tube to extend away from the support strut into and parallel to the flow.

A compression gasket or other form of packing seals the hole where the pitot tube passes through the first end fitting. However the seal is such as to permit free rotation and linear adjustment of the pitot tube within the support strut. At the second end fitting the second end fitting can attach the support strut directly to the inner surface of the duct or the support strut can pass through the duct wall to attach to the second end fitting.

The support strut provides a guiding channel for the pitot tube that supports the length of the pitot tube within the duct. The slot in the support strut allows the pitot tube to translate along the support strut without interference. Any vortex shedding resulting from high velocity flow emanates from the support strut itself and not from the pitot tube. Thus vibration of the pitot tube is minimized.

The support strut slot aligns the end of the pitot tube to the direction of the fluid flow and prevents unwanted rotation of the pitot tube so that measurement uncertainty is minimized. Further the support strut can prevent the pitot tube from bending backwards due to dynamic pressure and induced drag so as to provide greater measurement accuracy.

In one embodiment a pitot tube support and alignment system includes a support strut spanning perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of a duct a termination fitting supporting a first end of the strut adjacent to a first side of the duct and an insertion fitting supporting a second end of the strut adjacent to a second side of the duct. The insertion fitting accommodates the pitot tube through the second side of the duct through the insertion fitting and onto the strut.

The strut supports a supported portion of the pitot tube within the duct. A measuring portion of the pitot tube extends perpendicularly from the supported portion and the strut maintains an alignment of the measuring portion of the pitot tube parallel to the longitudinal axis within the duct.

The strut can have a channel cross section with the supported portion of the pitot tube being supported within the channel. The measuring portion extends away from the channel between the edges of the channel. The edges constrain the measuring portion to maintain its alignment within the duct.

The channel can have a semi circular shape with an inside radius conforming to the outside radius of the supported portion of the pitot tube. The cross section can also be a u shape with the edges extending a distance adjacent the measuring portion.

The cross section can also be fabricated from a slotted tube with a distance between the aforesaid edges forming the slot. In this configuration the distance between the edges conforms to the outside radius of the measuring portion.

The termination fitting can include a threaded portion affixed to the end of the strut and a mating portion. The mating portion can engage with the threaded portion such that threading the mating portion onto the threaded portion moves the mating portion into contact with the outside of the duct. Further rotation of the mating portion serves to apply a tension force on the strut.

The threaded portion can include a plate extending parallel to the outside face of the duct. The plate can include a first bore with the strut extending through the bore and being fixed therein. The plate can include a threaded bore distant from the first bore for accommodating the mating portion.

The insertion fitting can include a threaded portion extending through the side of the duct and into the duct with the strut being affixed to the threaded portion. The pitot tube can be inserted through the threaded portion and onto the strut. The insertion fitting also can include a flange affixed to the threaded portion with the flange abutting an outside surface of the side of the duct. A nut mates with the threaded portion and abuts the inside surface of the duct upon tightening the nut on the threaded portion.

A seal is provided between the flange and the pitot tube and between the threaded portion and the pitot tube. In one embodiment the seal can include a gasket abutting the flange and the threaded portion with the pitot tube being inserted through the gasket. In another embodiment the seal can be packing material with the packing material being placed about the pitot tube after the pitot tube is inserted through the threaded portion.

In one embodiment a system in combination with a pitot tube can include a support channel spanning perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of a duct and fixed to the duct at respective ends of the channel. The pitot tube can be supported within the channel with a measuring portion of the pitot tube extending away from the channel between edges of the channel. The edges constrain the measuring portion so as to maintain an alignment of the measuring portion parallel to the longitudinal axis of the duct.

The system can include an insertion fitting supporting a first end of the channel adjacent to a first side of the duct. The insertion fitting accommodates the pitot tube through the side of the duct through the insertion fitting and onto the channel. The system can also include a termination fitting to support the other end of the channel adjacent to the other side of the duct.

The insertion fitting can include a threaded portion extending through the side of the duct and into the duct. The channel is affixed to the threaded portion with the pitot tube being inserted through the threaded portion and onto the channel. A flange is affixed to the threaded portion. The flange abuts the outside surface of the duct. A nut mates with the threaded portion and abuts the inside surface of the duct upon tightening the nut on the threaded portion. A seal is provided between the flange and the pitot tube and between the threaded portion and the pitot tube.

The termination fitting can include a threaded portion affixed to the other end of the channel and a mating portion engaging the threaded portion. Threading the mating portion onto the threaded portion moves the mating portion into contact with the outside face of the duct. Further rotation of the mating portion can apply a tension force on the channel.

To obtain flow measurements at different points across the width of duct pitot tube is moved along the length of support strut in either direction indicated by double arrow B shown in .

In addition to supporting pitot tube strut can help align pitot tube parallel to axis X X. As illustrated in strut can be fabricated as a channel formed of a half tubular shape having an inside diameter d1 conforming to outside diameter d2 of pitot tube . In this configuration edges of support strut constrain measuring portion of pitot tube from rotating about central axis Y of supported portion

In edges of alternate embodiment strut are extended in the direction of measuring portion parallel to axis X X of . In this configuration edges can provide additional alignment support for measuring portion . In inside diameter d1 of alternate embodiment strut is greater than outside diameter d2 of measuring portion . In this configuration tubular support strut is slotted with edges being spaced width w apart just sufficient for measuring portion to pass therebetween. In a manner similar to that described with relation to edges of edges can provide additional alignment support for measuring portion

Tensioning screw of termination fitting can be threaded into bore until tensioning screw contacts duct . As tensioning screw is further threaded into bore plate is moved further away from duct resulting in tension being placed on support tube . This tension increases support tube resistance to vibration and singing. Contact of tensioning screw against duct also acts to lock the angular position and alignment of support strut within duct .

Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teachings. For example respectively illustrate support struts and generally as channels fabricated from variations of cylindrical tubular forms. Alternate shapes of support strut can be used to provide additional structural rigidity or improve aerodynamics. For example struts and can be channels fabricated from other tubular shapes such as square or rectangular tubes. Further an airfoil shape for support strut can help minimize flow losses reduce vibration and provide increased resistance to bending.

As an example a gasket can be used in lieu of packing material to seal about pitot tube . As a further example termination end of support strut can be sealed and threaded. Thus to tension support strut in this configuration a corresponding nut need only be tightened against duct .

In a further alternate configuration multiple support struts can be positioned across duct within a plane perpendicular to axis X X in such that readings can be taken at various angles about axis X X to develop a complete three dimensional profile within duct . Where support struts intersect notches can be provided in support struts to allow traversal of pitot tube along a full length of each support strut .
