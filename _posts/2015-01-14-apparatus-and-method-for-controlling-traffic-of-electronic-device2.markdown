Hereinafter various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described on the assumption that a first electronic device is a mobile communication electronic device such as a smartphone a tablet PC and or a mobile phone and a second electronic device is a wearable device. However the following description may equally be applied to the above described electronic devices.

Referring to a first electronic device is connected with a second electronic device via a wireless link and exchanges data with the second electronic device . For example the first electronic device and the second electronic device may be connected with each other in a short range wireless communication technology such as Bluetooth BT and may exchange data with each other according to a user s request detection of occurrence of an event and or a pre set regulation.

For example when an event that needs to be notified to the second electronic device occurs by one or more applications installed in the first electronic device the first electronic device may transmit a signal for notifying the occurrence of the event to the second electronic device . For example when a message reception event is detected by a short message service SMS application a social network service SNS application and or an e mail service application the first electronic device may transmit a signal for notifying the message reception to the second electronic device .

In addition the second electronic device may transmit data stored in the second electronic device to the first electronic device according to a user s request. For example the second electronic device may transmit a voice memo a photo an S voice a view signal in a notification device and the like to the first electronic device according to a user s request.

In addition when data of a specific application installed in the first electronic device is updated and then the specific application is executed in the second electronic device the first electronic device and the second electronic device may exchange information on the updated data and perform synchronization. For example when execution of a recent call record application a contact information application a media control application or the like is detected in the second electronic device the first electronic device and the second electronic device may exchange information related to updated recent call records updated contact information and or updated media data with each other.

In addition although not shown the first electronic device and the second electronic device may perform synchronization with respect to a specific application in a pre set period without control of the user.

As described above the first electronic device and the second electronic device may exchange various data with each other.

Referring to when the first electronic device transmits data to the second electronic device in operation the second electronic device receives the data from the first electronic device changes a standby state into an activation state and then turns on a screen in operation . That is when receiving data from the first electronic device the second electronic device may turn on an AP and then turn on the screen and may display information on the received data on the screen. Thereafter when a pre set time elapses without a user input the second electronic device turns off the screen in operation turns off the AP and changes back to the standby state. In this case the second electronic device consumes current as shown in .

Referring to when traffic is received at the second electronic device by data transmission from the first electronic device at traffic reception current consumption reaches the peak since the AP is turned on and analyzes and processes corresponding traffic data. Thereafter when a pre set screen on holding time elapses the current consumption of the second electronic device reaches the peak again since the AP is turned off. Thereafter the current consumption abruptly decreases. For example the second electronic device consumes little current of about 0.98 mA in the standby state and consumes average current of about 76.66 milliamps mA in the activation state in which the AP is turned on by traffic generation. In particular referring to a right view of briefly showing a current consumption waveform of the second electronic device it can be seen that the second electronic device consumes much current of about 145 mA and 130 mA on average when the AP is turned on off.

Accordingly various embodiments of the present disclosure propose a method for reducing total current consumption of the second electronic device by minimizing a driving time of the second electronic device taken by data transmission from the first electronic device and reducing the number of times current consumption reaches the peak. Herein the driving time of the second electronic device may refer to a time between a time at which the AP is turned on and a time at which the AP is turned off or may refer to a time during which the second electronic device is operated in the activation state.

In various embodiments described below the number of times the current consumption reaches the peak may be reduced by reducing the number of times data is transmitted from the first electronic device to the second electronic device or by minimizing the driving time of the second electronic device taken by data transmission from the first electronic device using a method for controlling a data transmission time.

Referring to the first electronic device detects occurrence of an event that needs to be notified to the second electronic device in operation . The event that needs to be notified to the second electronic device refers to an event that needs to be recognized by a user from among the events occurring by applications installed in the first electronic device and may include an SMS message reception event an SNS message reception event an e mail reception event a schedule notification time satisfaction event or the like for example. The event that needs to be notified to the second electronic device may be pre set by a designer and or a user of the first electronic device . For example the designer and or the user may set whether to notify the second electronic device of occurrence of an event for every application of the first electronic device through the screen of the first electronic device or the second electronic device or may set whether to notify the second electronic device of occurrence of an event for all possible events in each application. In addition when designing the first electronic device the designer may set to notify the second electronic device of occurrence of all events by a specific application or may set to notify the second electronic device of occurrence of a specific event by a specific application.

The first electronic device determines a time to notify the occurrence of the event which may also be referred to as a notification time based on a driving time of the second electronic device in operation . For example the first electronic device may determine the event occurrence notification time based on a basic driving time during which the second electronic device is operated in the activation state upon receiving data one time. Information on the basic driving time of the second electronic device may be received from the second electronic device or may be pre stored in the first electronic device . In addition the basic driving time of the second electronic device may be changed according to a screen holding time when the screen holding time is changed by the user. For example the first electronic device may determine the event occurrence notification time based on whether the basic driving time of the second electronic device elapses from the time previous data was transmitted to the second electronic device . When the basic driving time of the second electronic device does not elapse from the time the previous data was transmitted to the second electronic device the first electronic device may determine to promptly notify the occurrence of the event detected in operation and when the basic driving time of the second electronic device elapses from the time the previous data was transmitted to the second electronic device the first electronic device may determine a screen off time of the first electronic device as the time to notify the occurrence of the event detected in operation . In another example the first electronic device may determine a data collection time or an event collection time based on the basic driving time of the second electronic device and may determine a time at which the data collection time elapses or expires as the event occurrence notification time.

Thereafter the first electronic device notifies the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event at the determined time in operation . When notifying the occurrence of the event the first electronic device may transmit data related to the corresponding event along with information for notifying the occurrence of the corresponding event. For example when an SMS message is received at the first electronic device the first electronic device may transmit a caller number a receiving time and a message text of the SMS message to the second electronic device along with information for notifying that the SMS message is received.

Thereafter the first electronic device finishes the procedure according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.

Referring to the first electronic device includes an event detecting unit for detecting occurrence of an event that needs to be notified to the second electronic device . The first electronic device may include at least one application and or AP that includes the event detecting unit to detect occurrence of an event that needs to be notified to the second electronic device .

The first electronic device includes a notification determining unit for determining a time to notify the occurrence of the event based on a driving time of the second electronic device . For example the first electronic device may include an AP or a separate notification control program may include the notification determining unit to determine the event occurrence notification time based on a basic driving time during which the second electronic device is operated in the activation state upon receiving data one time.

In addition the first electronic device includes a notification transmission unit for notifying the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event at the determined time. For example the first electronic device may include a communication module that includes a notification transmission unit to transmit an event occurrence notification signal to the second electronic device .

Hereinafter a method for determining an event occurrence notification time based on a driving time of the second electronic device in the first electronic device according to various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described. In the following description the event refers an event that needs to be recognized by the user or needs to be notified to the second electronic device .

Referring to a method for determining an event occurrence notification time based on a basic driving time of the second electronic device and a previous event occurrence notification time when an event is detected by the first electronic device will be explained. In the embodiments of a transient event is detected by the first electronic device in a situation where a lock screen is not used. The transient event refers to an event that is not expected to be followed by the same event like an SMS reception event an e mail reception or schedule notification occurrence event. In addition the lock screen is a screen that requests the user to input at least one of dragging a signature a pattern a personal identification number PIN and a password to determine whether to allow user access to the electronic device.

Referring to it is common that when an event is detected at operations and the first electronic device may turn on the screen thereof and display event occurrence information on the screen and when the screen is turned off in operation without a user s checking the event the first electronic device may notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event in operations and .

Meanwhile according to an embodiment of the present disclosure the first electronic device determines whether the second electronic device is being driven or not based on a basic driving time of the second electronic device and a previous event occurrence notification time for the second electronic device . When it is determined that the second electronic device is being driven the first electronic device determines an event occurrence notification time to promptly transmit an event occurrence notification and when it is determined that the second electronic device is not being driven the first electronic device determines a screen off time of the first electronic device as the event occurrence notification time.

For example when a first event is detected in operation the first electronic device identifies a basic driving time of the second electronic device and a previous event occurrence notification time for the second electronic device and determines whether the second electronic device is currently being driven or not. In this case since the first electronic device does not have the record of having notified the second electronic device of occurrence of an event the first electronic device determines that the second electronic device is not currently being driven and determines a screen off time of the first electronic device as the event occurrence notification time. Accordingly the first electronic device turns on the screen of the first electronic device at the time of detecting the event in operation and displays information on the occurrence of the event on the screen and when the screen is turned off in operation without a user s checking the event the first electronic device may notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event in operation . When a user input to the corresponding event display is generated in the first electronic device before the screen is turned off and it is recognized that the user checks the corresponding event the first electronic device may not notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event even when the screen of the first electronic device is turned off.

In addition when an event is detected in operation the first electronic device identifies the basic driving time of the second electronic device and the previous event occurrence notification time in operation for the second electronic device and determines whether the second electronic device is currently being driven or not. In this case when the basic driving time of the second electronic device does not elapse from the previous event occurrence notification time in operation the first electronic device may determine that the second electronic device is currently being driven and may determine the event occurrence notification time to promptly transmit an event occurrence notification. Accordingly the first electronic device may turn on the screen of the first electronic device at the time of detecting the event in operation and display information on the occurrence of the event and may promptly notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event without waiting for a screen off state in operation .

As described above when the first electronic device notifies the second electronic device of occurrence of an event in a related art method the first electronic device waits until the screen is turned off and notifies the occurrence of the event. Therefore the second electronic device receives information on the occurrence of the event in the standby state changes into the activation state and then changes back to the standby state and after a predetermined time receives information on occurrence of an event changes into the activation state and changes back to the standby state. The second electronic device repeats these operations. In this case the second electronic device consumes current in the form of the related art method shown in box of .

On the other hand according to an embodiment of the present disclosure the first electronic device determines whether the second electronic device is being driven or not based on a previous event notification time and the basic driving time of the second electronic device and when it is determined that the second electronic device is being driven the first electronic device promptly notifies the occurrence of the event. Accordingly the second electronic device receives information on occurrence of an event in the standby state and changes into the activation state and receives information on occurrence of an event again prior to changing back to the standby state. In this case the second electronic device consumes current in the form shown in box of . Accordingly when the first electronic device determines the event occurrence notification time based on the basic driving time of the second electronic device according to the embodiment the first electronic device may achieve the effect of reducing current consumption in comparison with the related art method.

Referring to the first electronic device detects occurrence of an event that needs to or should be notified to the second electronic device in a screen off state in operation . For example the first electronic device may detect occurrence of an SMS reception event an e mail reception event or a schedule notification event in the screen off state without a lock screen being set.

The first electronic device turns on the screen of the first electronic device and then displays information for notifying the occurrence of the event on the screen in operation .

Thereafter in operation the first electronic device determines a current driving state of the second electronic device based on a time occurrence at which the first electronic device previously notified the second electronic device of occurrence of a previous event and a driving time of the second electronic device . For example it is assumed that when the second electronic device receives an event notification one time 10 seconds are required for the AP to be turned on process the event notification and be turned off again. In this case when occurrence of an event is notified to the second electronic device 5 seconds before with reference to a current time the first electronic device may determine that the second electronic device is in a driving state in which the AP is currently turned on. On the other hand when occurrence of an event is notified to the second electronic device 1 minute before with reference to a current time the first electronic device may determine that the electronic device is in a non driving state in which the AP is currently turned off.

As a result of the determining in operation the first electronic device determines whether the second electronic device is in the driving state or non driving state in operation and when it is determined that the second electronic device is in the driving state the first electronic device promptly notifies the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event in operation . That is the first electronic device promptly notifies the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event without waiting until the screen of the first electronic device is turned off. Thereafter the first electronic device finishes the procedure according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.

On the other hand when it is determined that the second electronic device is in the non driving state the first electronic device determines whether the screen is turned off without a user s checking of the event in operation . When the screen is turned off without the user s checking of the event the first electronic device notifies the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event in operation . For example after the screen of the first electronic device is turned on and displays information on occurrence of an event when the screen is automatically turned off without a user s input during a predetermined time the first electronic device may determine that the user does not check the event and may notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event.

After the screen of the first electronic device is turned on and the information on the occurrence of the event is displayed in the first electronic device when a user input to the display of the corresponding event is generated before the screen is turned off in operation the first electronic device determines that the user checks the corresponding event and does not notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event even when the screen is turned off and finishes the procedure according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.

Next a method for determining an event occurrence notification time based on a basic driving time of the second electronic device when an event is detected by the first electronic device and transmitting events detected until the event occurrence notification time collectively will be explained with reference to . In other words the first electronic device may determine an event collection time based on the basic driving time of the second electronic device and may transmit the events collected until the event collection time collectively at the time the event collection time expires. In addition a case in which a multiple event is detected in the first electronic device will be explained by way of an example. The multiple event is an event which is expected to be followed by the same event that is an event that is expected to be followed by the same event within a predetermined time like an SNS message reception event. According to an embodiment the first electronic device may determine whether an event is a transient event or a multiple event based on the number of events occurring by a corresponding application during a threshold time after the application is installed in the first electronic device . In addition a designer and or a user of the first electronic device may distinguish or set whether each event is a transient event or a multiple event.

Referring to it is common that when the first electronic device detects at least one of events and the first electronic device turns on the screen of the first electronic device and displays information on the occurrence of the event on the screen and simultaneously notifies the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event at event notification times and .

However according to an embodiment of the present disclosure the first electronic device determines an event collection time based on a basic driving time of the second electronic device and determines whether events continuously occur or not during the event collection time and transmits the events and detected during the event collection time collectively when the event collection time expires at expiration time . In this case the first electronic device may promptly notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the first multiple event according to a design method at notification time .

In particular according to an embodiment of the present disclosure the first electronic device may determine the event collection time as shown in Equation 1 1 Driving Time of Second Electronic Device Time of Communication between First Electronic Device and Second Electronic Device margin Equation 1

Herein T is an event collection time a driving time of the second electronic device is a basic driving time during which the second electronic device is driven when receiving an event notification or data one time and a time of communication between the first electronic device and the second electronic device is a time that is taken for a signal transmitted from the first electronic device to be received at the second electronic device . In addition margin is a value for allowing an event notification of the first electronic device to stably arrive at the second electronic device before the driving of the second electronic device is stopped regardless of a channel state between the first electronic device and the second electronic device. The margin may be pre set or changed by learning

Additionally the first electronic device may collect events detected in the first electronic device from the time the event is detected to the time the event collection time elapses and may transmit the collected events to the second electronic device collectively regardless of whether a lock screen is used or not in the first electronic device and regardless of a screen off time of the first electronic device .

Additionally when an input to a corresponding event is generated by the user while the first electronic device continuously collects the events occurring during the event collection time without notifying the second electronic device of the occurrence of events and it is recognized that the user checks the corresponding events the first electronic device stops collecting the events and does not notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the events.

As described above when the first electronic device notifies the second electronic device of occurrence of an event in a related art method the first electronic device notifies the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event every time the occurrence of the event is detected. In this case the second electronic device consumes current in the form of the related art method shown in box of .

On the other hand according to an embodiment of the present disclosure the first electronic device collects events during the event collection time which is determined based on the basic driving time of the second electronic device without notifying occurrence of the events and notifies the second electronic device of the collected event collectively when the event collection time expires. In this case the second electronic device consumes current in the form shown in box of . Accordingly according to the embodiment of the present disclosure when the first electronic device collects events during a predetermined time based on the basic driving time of the second electronic device and transmits the events collectively the first electronic device may achieve the effect of reducing current consumption in comparison with the related art method.

Referring to the first electronic device detects occurrence of an event that needs to be notified to the second electronic device in a screen off state in operation . For example the first electronic device may detect occurrence of an SNS message reception event which is set as a multiple event in the screen off state without a lock screen being set.

The first electronic device turns on the screen of the first electronic device and then display information for notifying the occurrence of the event on the screen in operation .

Thereafter the first electronic device determines an event collection time based on a driving time of the second electronic device and measures the determined event collection time in operation . Although not shown the first electronic device may notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event detected in operation .

Thereafter the first electronic device determines whether the event collection time expires or not without a user s checking the event in operation . For example the first electronic device may continue detecting the multiple events occurring in the first electronic device during the event collection time and may determine whether the event collection time expires or not in a state in which a user input to the detected multiple event is not generated.

When the event collection time expires without the user s checking the first electronic device notifies the second electronic device of the events occurring during the event collection time in operation .

On the other hand when the event collection time does not expire without the user s checking that is when the event collection time does not expire the first electronic device proceeds to operation to detect an additional event occurring during the event collection time and resumes operation to re perform the subsequent operations. Although not shown when an input is generated by the user during the event collection time and it is recognized that the user checks the events the first electronic device stops collecting the events and does not notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the events.

In the above described example while the first electronic device collects the events during the event collection time the second electronic device may display a notification that was received from the first electronic device at the starting point of the event collection time that is the most recently received notification or may provide a user interface showing that the second electronic device is in progress of receiving or loading a next notification. In addition the second electronic device may provide a setting screen for the screen display during the event collection time of the first electronic device so that the user may set whether to display the most recently received notification or display that the second electronic device is in progress of receiving a next notification.

Additionally according to an embodiment of the present disclosure when an event notification display remains on the screen for more than a predetermined time the first electronic device may notify the second electronic device of occurrence of the event even when the screen of the first electronic device is in the on state. That is when occurrence of a transient event is detected while the lock screen is unused the first electronic device may turn on the screen and displays a display indicating occurrence of the event on the screen and when the screen is turned off without a user s checking the event occurrence notification the first electronic device notifies the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event. However when occurrence of another transient event is repeatedly detected before the screen of the first electronic device is turned off the first electronic device maintains the screen on state continuously and thus delays notifying the occurrence of the transient events. According to an embodiment to prevent the delay in notifying the occurrence of the transient events the first electronic device may notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event remaining on the screen when the event notification display remains for more than a predetermined time even when the screen of the first electronic device is maintained in the on state. For example when the event occurrence notification display is maintained on an upper bar which may be called a Ticker of the screen for more than a pre set threshold time the first electronic device may notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the corresponding event. However when the screen is maintained in the on state by a user s input or the screen is maintained in the on state by a specific application driven by a user request the first electronic device may not notify the second electronic device of occurrence of the corresponding event even if the event occurrence notification display is maintained on the upper bar of the screen for more than a threshold time.

Additionally according to an embodiment when occurrence of an event is detected in a state in which a lock screen is used the first electronic device determines whether a specific application is being driven or not through the lock screen according to a user request. When a specific application is being driven the first electronic device may display a notification of the detected event occurrence only on the screen of the first electronic device and may not notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event. In this case after the driving of the specific application is stopped when the first electronic device turns off the screen or a predetermined time elapses without a user s checking the event occurrence notification the first electronic device may notify the second electronic device of the occurrence of the event.

Referring to the first electronic device detects occurrence of an event that needs to be notified to the second electronic device in operation . For example the first electronic device detects occurrence of an event that needs to be recognized by the user from among the events occurring by an application which may be referred to as an app installed in the first electronic device . In this case the first electronic device may display an event occurrence notification on the screen.

The first electronic device determines whether a lock screen is used or not in operation . The lock screen recited herein refers to a screen that requests the user to input at least one of dragging a signature a pattern a PIN and a password to determine whether to allow user access to the first electronic device and the user may set whether to use the lock screen or not.

When the lock screen is not used the first electronic device determines whether the detected event is a transient event or not in operation . For example the first electronic device determines whether the detected event is a transient event that is not expected to be followed by the same event like an SMS reception event an e mail reception event or a schedule notification occurrence event or the detected event is a multiple event that is expected to be followed by the same event like an SNS message reception event.

When the detected event is not a transient event but is a multiple event the first electronic device transmits a notification on the initially detected event to the second electronic device unconditionally and then detects and collects events occurring in the first electronic device during an event collection time T and when the event collection time expires transmits notifications on the collected events to the second electronic device collectively in operation . The first electronic device may repeat operation until a user input to the event occurrence notification display is detected in the first electronic device or until an event is not detected for more than a threshold time. When a user input to the event occurrence notification display is detected in the first electronic device or an event is not detected during more than the threshold time the first electronic device finishes the procedure according to the embodiment.

When the detected event is the transient event the first electronic device determines whether a driving holding time T elapses from the time a previous notification was transmitted to the second electronic device in operation . The driving holding time T may be a driving time of the second electronic device or may be a time which is calculated by subtracting a time of communication between the first electronic device and the second electronic device from the basic driving time of the second electronic device . In addition the driving holding time T may have the same value as the event collection time T.

When the driving holding time T does not elapse from the time the previous notification was transmitted to the second electronic device the first electronic device determines that the second electronic device is being driven and promptly transmits a notification on the detected event to the second electronic device in operation . Thereafter the first electronic device finishes the procedure according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.

On the other hand when the driving holding time T elapses from the time the previous notification was transmitted to the second electronic device the first electronic device determines that the second electronic device is not being driven and determines whether a predetermined time elapses without a separate application being driven in operation . For example after displaying the event occurrence notification on the screen the first electronic device determines whether a screen holding time elapses without an additional application being driven.

When the predetermined time elapses without the separate application being driven the first electronic device proceeds to operation to turn off the screen and transmit the notification on the detected event to the second electronic device . On the other hand when the separate application is driven before the predetermined time elapses or if the predetermined time elapses the first electronic device proceeds to operation to determine whether the screen is turned off or not. For example the first electronic device determines whether the screen is turned off after an application is driven by the user and the driving of the application is stopped before a predetermined time at which the screen is automatically turned off expires or may determine whether the screen is turned off by a user input which is generated before the predetermined time at which the screen is automatically turned off expires. When the screen is not turned off the first electronic device resumes operation to re perform the subsequent operations.

On the other hand when the screen is turned off the first electronic device transmits the notification on the event which is unchecked by the user to the second electronic device . Thereafter the first electronic device finishes the procedure according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.

Meanwhile when the lock screen is determined to active and or as being used as a result of the determining in operation the first electronic device determines whether an application usable in the lock screen state is being driven or not in operation . When an application usable in the lock screen state is being driven and the user does not check the event occurrence notification within a predetermined time after the driving of the application is terminated the first electronic device transmits notifications on the events that have occurred until the predetermined time to the second electronic device collectively in operation .

On the other hand when it is determined that the application usable in the lock screen state is not being driven in operation the first electronic device determines whether the detected event is a transient event or not in operation . When the detected event is the transient event the first electronic device promptly transmits the notification on the transient event to the second electronic device in operation .

On the other hand when the detected event is not a transient event but is a multiple event then in operation the first electronic device transmits a notification on the initially detected event to the second electronic device detects and collect events occurring in the first electronic device during the event collection time T and transmits notifications on the collected events to the second electronic device collectively when the event collection time expires. The first electronic device may repeat operation until a user input to the event occurrence notification display is detected in the first electronic device or until an event is not detected for more than a threshold time. When a user input to the event occurrence notification display is detected in the first electronic device or when an event is not detected for more than the threshold time the first electronic device finishes the procedure according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.

Additionally the first electronic device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may minimize traffic for the second electronic device by controlling a periodic synchronization time with the second electronic device .

Referring to the first electronic device may transmit data that is set as a synchronization target from among data stored in the first electronic device to the second electronic device in a pre set synchronization period and may perform synchronization. According to an embodiment the first electronic device may not perform synchronization in a synchronization period and may perform synchronization when traffic to the second electronic device is detected before a synchronization time set according to the synchronization period so that current consumption in the second electronic device caused by the traffic may be minimized. More specifically when traffic to the second electronic device is generated within a pre set time before the synchronization time the first electronic device may transmit synchronization data by making the synchronization data piggyback on the corresponding traffic. In this case the pre set time may be set considering a driving time of the second electronic device . On the other hand when traffic to the second electronic device is not generated within the pre set time before the synchronization time the first electronic device may wait until the synchronization time according to the synchronization period and may perform synchronization at the synchronization time.

In the embodiment of described above when generation of traffic to the second electronic device is detected before the synchronization time according to the synchronization period the synchronization is performed at the time the generation of the traffic is detected in order to minimize current consumption caused by the traffic. However according to various embodiments of the present disclosure when traffic is generated between synchronization times processing of the traffic may be delayed and the traffic may be processed at the synchronization time. For example the first electronic device may perform synchronization with the second electronic device at a first synchronization time and then when specific traffic to the second electronic device is generated before a second synchronization time may not promptly process the traffic and delay processing the traffic until the second synchronization time. When the second synchronization time arrives the first electronic device may transmit the specific traffic while performing synchronization with the second electronic device .

Referring to after data of a specific application installed in the first electronic device is updated when the specific application is executed in the second electronic device the first electronic device and the second electronic device determine whether updated data exists or not and perform synchronization by exchanging information on the updated data with each other. For example when a recent record and contact information are updated in the first electronic device and execution of a recent record application and or a contact information application is detected in the second electronic device the first electronic device and the second electronic device may exchange the updated recent record and the updated contact information with each other. In this case since the first electronic device and the second electronic device perform synchronization with respect to the corresponding application after execution of the application is detected in the second electronic device the user recognizes that synchronization is not performed with respect to the corresponding application for a predetermined time after the application is executed. Therefore according to an embodiment of the present disclosure when data of a specific application installed in the first electronic device is updated and traffic to the second electronic device is generated in the first electronic device the first electronic device may transmit the updated data of the application by making the updated data piggyback on the corresponding traffic even in a state where the specific application is not executed. In this case the second electronic device receives the updated data of the application and performs synchronization in advance before the specific application is executed so that quality of experience of the user may be improved.
