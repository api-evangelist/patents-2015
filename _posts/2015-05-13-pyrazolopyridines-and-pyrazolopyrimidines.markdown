This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 993 138 filed May 14 2014 the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention relates to pyrazolopyridines and pyrazolopyrimidines pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and their use as medicaments. More particularly the present invention provides 6 phenyl 1H pyrazolopyridines derivatives and 6 phenyl 1H pyrazolopyrimidines derivatives which are Janus Kinase JAK inhibitors and useful for the treatment of allergic and respiratory conditions particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the US and is characterized by airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible with bronchodilators. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases primarily cigarette smoke. Symptoms are typically breathing related e.g. chronic cough exertional dyspnea expectoration and wheeze . Patients experience periods of stable disease interspersed with inflammatory exacerbations resulting in acute decline in lung function and often hospitalization.

Current treatment guidelines recommend bronchodilators as the mainstay of COPD drug treatment. However anti inflammatory inhaled corticosteroids ICS and bronchodilator inhaled corticosteroid combination products are extensively used. Whilst inhaled corticosteroids do provide some benefits with respect to short term lung function improvements and exacerbation frequency they do not address the corticosteroid refractory inflammation which is characteristic of this disease and thought to play a key role in disease progression. There is a clear medical need for anti inflammatory therapies in COPD that will address the chronic inflammatory component of the disease and ultimately provide symptomatic relief a reduction in exacerbation frequency and an amelioration of exacerbation severity.

The Janus kinase JAK family of receptor associated tyrosine kinases JAK 1 JAK 2 JAK 3 and tyrosine kinase 2 TYK2 are involved in signal transduction associated with a variety of inflammatory cytokines. JAK kinases can function as either hetero or homo dimers phosphorylating STAT transcription factors which regulate inflammatory gene transcription. Oral JAK 1 JAK 3 inhibitors such as CP 690550 have shown impressive anti inflammatory activity in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

Many JAK dependent cytokines are thought to play key roles in the pathology of COPD which involves the interplay of multiple inflammatory cells such as T lymphocytes neutrophils macrophages and lung epithelium. For example the JAK 1 JAK 3 heterodimer plays a key role in T lymphocyte survival and activation whereas JAK 2 is thought to be critical for regulation of neutrophil activation and apoptosis. JAK 1 and JAK 2 play an important role in IL 13 mediated inflammatory signaling in macrophages which is thought to link acute inflammatory events to chronic progressive disease. Importantly JAK 1 JAK 2 and TYK 2 also play an important role in signaling mediated by IFN a cytokine associated with the chronic inflammation observed in COPD which modulates the activity of T cells epithelium and macrophages whilst not being modulated by corticosteroids.

Macrophage phagocytosis of bacteria is impaired in the lungs of COPD patients potentially in part due to high local IFN levels. In vitro studies with isolated patient cells have shown that JAK inhibitors increase phagocytotic rate in the presence of IFN . Consequently as well as exerting a direct anti inflammatory effect JAK inhibitors may also increase the ability of the lung to maintain a sterile environment.

JAK inhibitors are therefore likely to have utility in the treatment of a range of inflammatory diseases including lung diseases such as COPD asthma and pulmonary vascular disease. Compounds which have a broad inhibitory activity across the range of Janus kinases in particular are likely to have a potent anti inflammatory effect. However such a selectivity profile can also lead to undesirable side effects in systemically circulating compounds particularly anemia and neutropenia associated with JAK 2 inhibition. For the treatment of lung diseases it is therefore particularly favorable to provide JAK inhibitors which can be administered by inhalation and which inhibit Janus kinases locally in the lung without having a significant systemic exposure.

There is thus a need to provide new JAK inhibitors that are potent selective inhibitors of Janus kinases with appropriate metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic properties particularly compounds which can be administered by inhalation and are active in lung tissue whilst having poor systemic penetration or high systemic lability.

The present invention provides pyrazolopyridines and pyrazolopyrimidines which are potent and selective inhibitors of Janus kinases including a compound having the structure

The term excipient is used herein to describe any ingredient other than a compound of formula I Ii . The choice of excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability and the nature of the dosage form. The term excipient encompasses diluent carrier or adjuvant.

One way of carrying out the invention is to administer a compound of formula I Ii in the form of a prodrug. Thus certain derivatives of a compound of formula I Ii which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can when administered into or onto the body be converted into a compound of formula I Ii having the desired activity for example by hydrolytic cleavage particularly hydrolytic cleavage promoted by an esterase or peptidase enzyme. Such derivatives are referred to as prodrugs . Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in Pro drugs as Novel Delivery Systems Vol. 14 ACS Symposium Series T. Higuchi and W. Stella and Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design Pergamon Press 1987 Ed. E. B. Roche American Pharmaceutical Association . Reference can also be made to Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2008 7 355 and Current Opinion in Drug Discovery and Development 2007 10 550.

Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can for example be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of formula I Ii with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as pro moieties as described for example in Design of Prodrugs by H. Bundgaard Elsevier 1985 .

Thus a prodrug in accordance with the invention is a an ester or amide derivative of a carboxylic acid in a compound of formula I Ii b an ester carbonate carbamate phosphate or ether derivative of a hydroxyl group in a compound of formula I Ii c an amide imine carbamate or amine derivative of an amino group in a compound form formula I Ii d a thioester thiocarbonate thiocarbamate or sulphide derivatives of a thiol group in a compound of formula I Ii or e an oxime or imine derivative of a carbonyl group in a compound of formula I Ii .

 COOH an ester thereof such as a compound wherein the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid functionality of the compound of formula I Ii is replaced by C Calkyl e.g. ethyl or C Calkyl C O OCH e.g. BuC O OCH

 iv where a compound of formula I Ii contains an alcohol functionality OH a phosphate thereof such as a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the compound of formula I Ii is replaced by P O OH or P O ONa or P O O Ca 

 v where a compound of formula I Ii contains a primary or secondary amino functionality NHor NHR where R H an amide thereof for example a compound wherein as the case may be one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of formula I Ii is are replaced by C C alkanoyl COCHNHor the amino group is derivatised with an amino acid 

 vi where a compound of formula I Ii contains a primary or secondary amino functionality NHor NHR where R H an amine thereof for example a compound wherein as the case may be one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of formula I Ii is are replaced by CHOP O OH .

Certain compounds of formula I Ii may themselves act as prodrugs of other compounds of formula I Ii . It is also possible for two compounds of formula I Ii to be joined together in the form of a prodrug. In certain circumstances a prodrug of a compound of formula I Ii may be created by internally linking two functional groups in a compound of formula I Ii for instance by forming a lactone.

References below to compounds of formula I Ii are taken to include the compounds themselves and prodrugs thereof. The invention includes such compounds of formula I Ii as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates of said compounds and salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I Ii include acid addition and base salts.

Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non toxic salts. Examples include the acetate adipate aspartate benzoate besylate bicarbonate carbonate bisulfate sulfate borate camsylate citrate cyclamate edisylate esylate formate fumarate gluceptate gluconate glucuronate hexafluorophosphate hibenzate hydrochloride chloride hydrobromide bromide hydroiodide iodide isethionate lactate malate maleate malonate mesylate methylsulfate naphthylate 2 napsylate nicotinate nitrate orotate oxalate palmitate pamoate phosphate hydrogen phosphate dihydrogen phosphate pyroglutamate saccharate stearate succinate tannate tartrate tosylate trifluoroacetate naphatlene 1 5 disulfonic acid and xinofoate salts.

Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non toxic salts. Examples include the aluminium arginine benzathine calcium choline diethylamine diolamine glycine lysine magnesium meglumine olamine potassium sodium tromethamine and zinc salts.

Hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed for example hemisulfate and hemicalcium salts. For a review on suitable salts see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts Properties Selection and Use by Stahl and Wermuth Wiley VCH 2002 .

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I Ii may be prepared by one or more of three methods 

 ii by removing an acid or base labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of a compound of formula I Ii or by ring opening a suitable cyclic precursor for example a lactone or lactam using the desired acid or base or

 iii by converting one salt of the compound of formula I Ii to another by reaction with an appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column.

All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non ionised.

The compounds of formula I Ii and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. The term solvate is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of formula I Ii or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules for example ethanol. The term hydrate may be employed when said solvent is water.

A currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines isolated site channel or metal ion coordinated hydrates see by K. R. Morris Ed. H. G. Brittain Marcel Dekker 1995 . Isolated site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates the water molecules lie in lattice channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal ion coordinated hydrates the water molecules are bonded to the metal ion.

When the solvent or water is tightly bound the complex will have a well defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When however the solvent or water is weakly bound as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds the water solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases non stoichiometry will be the norm.

Also included within the scope of the invention are multi component complexes other than salts and solvates wherein the drug and at least one other component are present in stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts. Complexes of this type include clathrates drug host inclusion complexes and co crystals. The latter are typically defined as crystalline complexes of neutral molecular constituents which are bound together through non covalent interactions but could also be a complex of a neutral molecule with a salt. Co crystals may be prepared by melt crystallization by recrystallization from solvents or by physically grinding the components together. Cf. Chem. Commun. 17 1889 1896 by O. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko 2004 . For a general review of multi component complexes see J. Pharm. Sci. 64 8 1269 1288 by Haleblian 1975 .

The compounds of the invention may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. The term amorphous refers to a state in which the material lacks long range order at the molecular level and depending upon temperature may exhibit the physical properties of a solid or a liquid. Typically such materials do not give distinctive X ray diffraction patterns and while exhibiting the properties of a solid are more formally described as a liquid. Upon heating a change from solid to liquid properties occurs which is characterised by a change of state typically second order glass transition . The term crystalline refers to a solid phase in which the material has a regular ordered internal structure at the molecular level and gives a distinctive X ray diffraction pattern with defined peaks. Such materials when heated sufficiently will also exhibit the properties of a liquid but the change from solid to liquid is characterised by a phase change typically first order melting point .

The compounds of formula I Ii may also exist in a mesomorphic state mesophase or liquid crystal when subjected to suitable conditions. The mesomorphic state is intermediate between the true crystalline state and the true liquid state either melt or solution . Mesomorphism arising as the result of a change in temperature is described as thermotropic and that resulting from the addition of a second component such as water or another solvent is described as lyotropic . Compounds that have the potential to form lyotropic mesophases are described as amphiphilic and consist of molecules which possess an ionic such as COONa COOK or SONa or non ionic such as NN CH polar head group. For more information see by N. H. Hartshorne and A. Stuart 4Edition Edward Arnold 1970 .

Hereinafter all references to compounds of formula I Ii include references to pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates multi component complexes and liquid crystals thereof and to solvates multi component complexes and liquid crystals of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

The compounds of formula I Ii may exhibit polymorphism and or one or more kinds of isomerism e.g. optical geometric or tautomeric isomerism . The compounds of formula I Ii may also be isotopically labelled. Such variation is implicit to the compounds of formula I Ii defined as they are by reference to their structural features and therefore within the scope of the invention.

Compounds of formula I Ii containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of formula I Ii contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group geometric cis trans or Z E isomers are possible. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier tautomeric isomerism tautomerism can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of formula I Ii containing for example an imino keto or oxime group or so called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.

The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I Ii may also contain a counterion which is optically active e.g. d lactate or l lysine or racemic e.g. dl tartrate or dl arginine .

Cis trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art for example chromatography and fractional crystallization.

Conventional techniques for the preparation isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate or the racemate of a salt or derivative using for example chiral high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC . Alternatively the racemate or a racemic precursor may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound for example an alcohol or in the case where the compound of formula I Ii contains an acidic or basic moiety a base or acid such as 1 phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer s by means well known to a skilled person. Chiral compounds of formula I Ii and chiral precursors thereof may be obtained in enantiomerically enriched form using chromatography typically HPLC on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon typically heptane or hexane containing from 0 to 50 by volume of isopropanol typically from 2 to 20 and from 0 to 5 by volume of an alkylamine typically 0.1 diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture. Chiral chromatography using sub and supercritical fluids may be employed. Methods for chiral chromatography useful in some embodiments of the present invention are known in the art see for example Smith Roger M. Loughborough University Loughborough UK Chromatographic Science Series 1998 75 Supercritical Fluid Chromatography with Packed Columns pp. 223 249 and references cited therein . In some relevant examples herein columns were obtained from Chiral Technologies Inc West Chester Pa. USA a subsidiary of Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd. Tokyo Japan.

When any racemate crystallizes crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound true racemate referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer. While both of the crystal forms present in a racemic mixture have identical physical properties they may have different physical properties compared to the true racemate. Racemic mixtures may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art. See for example by E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen Wiley 1994 .

The present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically labelled compounds of formula I Ii wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature. Isotopically labelled compounds of formula I Ii can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically labelled reagent in place of the non labelled reagent previously employed. In particular hydrogen atoms may be replaced by deuterium atoms since such deuterated compounds are sometimes more resistant to metabolism.

Also included within the scope of the invention are active metabolites of compounds of formula I Ii that is compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug often by oxidation or dealkylation. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include

For administration to human patients the total daily dose of a compound of formula I Ii is typically in the range of 0.01 mg to 500 mg depending of course on the mode of administration. In another embodiment of the present invention the total daily dose of a compound of formula I Ii is typically in the range of 0.1 mg to 300 mg. In yet another embodiment of the present invention the total daily dose of a compound of formula I Ii is typically in the range of 1 mg to 30 mg. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses and may at the physician s discretion fall outside of the typical range given herein. These dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 65 kg to 70 kg. The physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside this range such as infants and the elderly.

In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols the dosage unit is determined by means of a prefilled capsule blister or pocket or by a system that utilises a gravimetrically fed dosing chamber. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or puff containing from 1 to 5000 g of drug. The overall daily dose will typically be in the range 1 g to 20 mg which may be administered in a single dose or more usually as divided doses throughout the day.

A compound of formula I Ii can be administered per se or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition which as active constituent contains an efficacious dose of at least one compound of the invention in addition to customary pharmaceutically innocuous excipients and or additives.
