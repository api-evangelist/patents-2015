The subject matter of the present disclosure was developed with government support under Department of Energy Cooperative Agreement DE EE0006429 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. Accordingly the government has certain rights in the subject matter of the present disclosure.

The present specification generally relates to electric drive systems including cooling devices and cooling systems for smoothing capacitors and more particularly to cooling devices for smoothing capacitors including active cooling components.

Vehicles include various components that generate heat that must be dissipated to maintain the performance of the components. For example hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles include power electronics such as inverters and or inverter modules that generate a significant amount of heat. The inverters and or inverter modules change DC power to AC power and provide the AC power to an electric motor and may include smoothing capacitors that are electrically coupled to the inverter module. In some instances a wide band gap inverter may be utilized to change DC power to AC power which may increase the amount of heat exposed to the smoothing capacitors.

Accordingly a need exists for alternative cooling devices and cooling systems for smoothing capacitors.

In one embodiment an electric drive system includes a smoothing capacitor including at least one terminal a bus bar electrically coupled to the at least one terminal a thermoelectric device including a first side and a second side positioned opposite the first side where the first side is thermally coupled to at least one of the at least one terminal and the bus bar and a cooling element thermally coupled to the second side of the thermoelectric device where the cooling element dissipates heat from the thermoelectric device.

In another embodiment an electric drive system includes a battery an electric motor electrically coupled to the battery an inverter module electrically coupled to the battery and the electric motor where the inverter module receives DC power from the battery and delivers AC power to the electric motor a bus bar electrically coupled to the inverter module and the battery a smoothing capacitor including at least one terminal electrically coupled to the bus bar a thermoelectric device including a first side and a second side positioned opposite the first side where the first side is thermally coupled to at least one of the at least one terminal and the bus bar and a cooling element thermally coupled to the second side of the thermoelectric device where the cooling element dissipates heat from the thermoelectric device.

These and additional features provided by the embodiments described herein will be more fully understood in view of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.

Electric drive systems according to the present specification include a battery an electric motor electrically coupled to the battery and an inverter module electrically coupled to the battery and the electric motor. The electric drive systems may include a bus bar that electrically couples the inverter module and the battery and a smoothing capacitor including at least one terminal electrically coupled to the bus bar. A thermoelectric device is thermally coupled to the terminal and or the bus bar. By thermally coupling a thermoelectric device to the terminal and or the bus bar the thermoelectric device may be used to actively cool and maintain the terminal and the bus bar at an operational temperature. These and other embodiments will be described in more detail below in reference to the appended drawings.

The phrase electrically coupled is used herein to describe the interconnectivity of various components of the cooling system and means that the components are connected through wires or the like such that electrical current may be exchanged between the components. The phrase thermally coupled is used herein to describe the interconnectivity of various components of the electric drive system and means that the components are coupled to one another such that thermal energy may be exchanged between the components. Components that are thermally coupled may be directly coupled or may be coupled via an intermediate thermally conductive substrate layer for example and without limitation thermal paste epoxy direct bonded copper DBC direct bonded aluminum DBA or similar materials and may be coupled by bonding techniques such as soldering transient liquid phase bonding TLP or nano silver sintering for example. Alternatively components that are thermally coupled may be detached from one another but placed proximate to one another such that thermal energy may be exchanged between the components.

As used herein the term longitudinal direction refers to the lengthwise direction of components of the electric drive system i.e. in the X direction as depicted . The term lateral direction refers to the cross component direction i.e. in the Y direction as depicted and is transverse to the longitudinal direction.

Referring initially to a circuit configuration diagram of one exemplary embodiment of an electric drive system is schematically depicted. The electric drive system includes a battery a motor and an inverter module that are electrically coupled. The inverter module receives DC power from the battery converts the DC power to AC power and provides the AC power to the motor . The motor may include a three phase motor that is part of a vehicle drivetrain and may provide a driving force to a vehicle. The inverter module includes an inverter element or inverter elements e.g. semiconductor devices such as MOSFETS IGBTs and the like an inverter control circuit not depicted and may include a diode or diodes that are electrically coupled in parallel with ones of the inverter elements . The electric drive system includes at least one smoothing capacitor that is electrically coupled to the battery and the inverter module by a first bus bar and a second bus bar . The smoothing capacitor may smooth the DC power provided by the battery to the inverter module .

Referring to the smoothing capacitor or smoothing capacitors are electrically coupled to the inverter module through the first bus bar and the second bus bar . In particular the first bus bar is electrically coupled to the smoothing capacitors and to an N terminal of the inverter module and the second bus bar is electrically coupled to the smoothing capacitors and to a P terminal of the inverter module . The inverter elements and the diodes may be positioned within the inverter module and are electrically coupled to the smoothing capacitors through the N terminal and the first bus bar as well as the P terminal and the second bus bar . In the embodiment depicted in the inverter module includes a W terminal a V terminal and a U terminal at an output side of the inverter module . The W terminal the V terminal and the U terminal correspond to input terminals of the motor and electrically couple the inverter module to the motor .

Referring to a perspective view of one of the smoothing capacitors of is depicted in isolation. The smoothing capacitor includes a first terminal and a second terminal that extend outward from a body of the smoothing capacitor . In the embodiment shown in the first terminal is coupled to the first bus bar while the second terminal is coupled to the second bus bar . The first terminal and the second terminal are also electrically coupled to the first bus bar and the second bus bar respectively thereby electrically coupling the smoothing capacitor to the battery . As described above the first bus bar and the second bus bar are also electrically coupled to the N terminal and the P terminal of the inverter module thereby electrically coupling the first terminal and the second terminal to the inverter module . As the battery provides DC power to the inverter module electrical current passes through the first bus bar and the second bus bar . As electrical current is transferred between the first bus bar and the first terminal and between the second bus bar and the second terminal the electrical current generates heat at the connection between the first bus bar and the first terminal and at the connection between the second bus bar and the second terminal . When the smoothing capacitor of the electric drive system is part of a vehicle drive train significant electrical current may be transferred between the first bus bar and the first terminal and between the second bus bar and the second terminal thereby generating a significant amount of heat at the connection between the first bus bar and the first terminal and at the connection between the second bus bar and the second terminal . Further in embodiments where the inverter module includes a wide band gap inverter such as a SiC a GaN or a diamond wide band gap semiconductor inverter a significant amount of heat may be generated at the first terminal and the second terminal and or may be communicated from the inverter module through the first bus bar to the first terminal and from the inverter module through the second bus bar to the second terminal .

Referring to a section view of the smoothing capacitor is schematically depicted. In the embodiment shown in a pair of thermoelectric devices are thermally coupled to the smoothing capacitor . The thermoelectric devices operate to cool the first terminal and the second terminal of the smoothing capacitor during operation. One of the thermoelectric devices is thermally coupled to the first terminal of the smoothing capacitor and another of the thermoelectric devices is thermally coupled to the second terminal . The thermoelectric device that is thermally coupled to the first terminal is also thermally coupled to the first bus bar and the thermoelectric device that is thermally coupled to the second terminal is also thermally coupled to the second bus bar . While the thermoelectric devices are thermally coupled to the first terminal and the second terminal as well as the first bus bar and the second bus bar the thermoelectric devices are electrically isolated from the first terminal the second terminal the first bus bar and the second bus bar . Accordingly electrical current passing through the first bus bar and the second bus bar and or the first terminal and the second terminal is isolated from the thermoelectric devices . In the embodiment shown in the thermoelectric devices include an annular shape that is positioned around the first terminal and the second terminal of the smoothing capacitor . Alternatively the thermoelectric devices may include any suitable shape that may be thermally coupled to the first terminal and the second terminal and or the first bus bar and the second bus bar .

The thermoelectric devices include any device that generates a temperature differential across the thermoelectric device when an electric current is applied to the thermoelectric device as a result of the Peltier effect. In embodiments the thermoelectric devices may be formed from Bismuth Antimony Telluride BiSbTe . Alternatively similar thermoelectric device materials may be used. Each of the thermoelectric devices include a first side and a second side that is positioned opposite of the first side . In the embodiment depicted in the first sides are spaced apart from the second sides of the thermoelectric devices in the longitudinal direction. When an electrical current is applied to the thermoelectric devices the current generates a temperature differential across the thermoelectric devices and the electrical current may induce a relatively low temperature on the first side of the thermoelectric devices as compared to when electrical current is not applied to the thermoelectric devices . Additionally when electrical current is applied to the thermoelectric devices the current may induce a relatively high temperature on the second side of the thermoelectric devices as compared to when electrical current is not applied to the thermoelectric devices . Accordingly when electrical current is applied to the thermoelectric devices a temperature of the first side is less than a temperature of the second side of each of the thermoelectric devices .

In the embodiment depicted in the first side of one of the thermoelectric devices is thermally coupled to the first terminal and the first side of another of the thermoelectric devices is thermally coupled to the second terminal of the smoothing capacitor . The first sides of the thermoelectric devices may also be thermally coupled to and or mounted to the first bus bar and the second bus bar . In particular the first side of one of the thermoelectric devices may be thermally coupled and or mounted to the first bus bar and the first side of another of the thermoelectric devices may be thermally coupled to and or mounted to the second bus bar . By thermally coupling the first side of the thermoelectric devices to the first terminal the second terminal the first bus bar and the second bus bar the thermoelectric devices may be cooled such that the first terminal the second terminal and or the first bus bar and the second bus bar are maintained at an operational temperature.

In the embodiment depicted in each of the thermoelectric devices are thermally coupled a cooling element . In particular the second side of each of the thermoelectric devices is thermally coupled to one of the cooling elements . In the embodiment depicted in each of the cooling elements include a heat sink including a plurality of fins that extend radially around the cooling element and that dissipate heat from the cooling element . In particular the fins facilitate the transfer of heat from the cooling element to a medium surrounding the fins such as ambient air. As the second sides of the thermoelectric devices are thermally coupled to the cooling element heat from the second sides of the thermoelectric devices may be dissipated by the fins of the cooling element .

In embodiments the electric drive system may further include a flow inducer that induces fluid flow over the cooling elements . In the embodiment depicted in the flow inducer includes an axial fan that induces the medium surrounding the fins such as ambient air to flow over the fins . By inducing flow of the medium surrounding the fins the flow inducer may increase the amount of heat that may be dissipated by the fins of the cooling element as compared to when flow of the medium is not induced across the fins of the cooling elements .

Referring to in embodiments a phase change component or phase change components are thermally coupled to the smoothing capacitor . In the embodiment depicted in one phase change component is thermally coupled to the first bus bar and or the first terminal of the smoothing capacitor and another phase change component is thermally coupled to the second bus bar and or the second terminal . The phase change components may include an annular shape that is positioned around each of the first terminal and the second terminal . Alternatively the phase change components may include any suitable shape thermally coupled to the first terminal and the first bus bar and or the second terminal and the second bus bar . The phase change components may include a material that changes phase for example between a solid state and a liquid state or between a liquid state and a gaseous state when exposed to heat generated from the first terminal and the first bus bar and or the second terminal and the second bus bar . For example in some embodiments the phase change components may include and or be formed from paraffin a paraffin composite or the like. When the phase change components change between phases the phase change components absorb heat from the first terminal and the second terminal and or the first bus bar and the second bus bar . Accordingly the phase change components may temporarily absorb heat from the first terminal and the second terminal and or the first bus bar and the second bus bar while the phase change components change between phases. By temporarily absorbing heat the phase change components may assist in maintaining the first terminal and the second terminal at an operational temperature when the electric drive system is initially started as will be described in greater detail herein.

Referring to a cross section of the smoothing capacitor with another embodiment of a cooling element or cooling elements is depicted. Similar to the embodiment depicted in one of the thermoelectric devices is thermally coupled to the first terminal and the first bus bar and another of the thermoelectric devices is thermally coupled to the second terminal and the second bus bar . However in the embodiment depicted in the cooling elements include a cooling plate or cooling plates thermally coupled to the second sides of the thermoelectric devices . The cooling plates may include a working fluid that absorbs heat from the second sides of the thermoelectric devices and in operation the cooling plates absorb heat from the second sides of each of the thermoelectric devices . While in the embodiment depicted in one cooling plate is depicted as being thermally coupled to the second side of one thermoelectric device while another cooling plate is schematically depicted as being thermally coupled to the second side of another thermoelectric device it should be understood that a single cooling plate or multiple cooling plates may be thermally coupled to the second sides of the thermoelectric devices .

Referring to a block diagram of the interconnectivity of components of the electric drive system is schematically depicted. In the embodiment depicted in the thermoelectric device or thermoelectric devices are directly or indirectly electrically coupled to a power source and in particular to the battery . In some embodiments the thermoelectric devices are indirectly electrically coupled to the battery through a power converter which may include a DC DC converter. In operation the battery provides electrical current to the thermoelectric devices thereby inducing a temperature differential across the thermoelectric devices . By inducing a temperature differential across the thermoelectric devices the electrical current provided by the battery induces the first sides of the thermoelectric devices to have a relatively low temperature as compared to when electrical current is not applied to the thermoelectric devices . As described above as the first sides of the thermoelectric devices are thermally coupled to the first terminal and the first bus bar as well as the second terminal and the second bus bar the first sides of the thermoelectric devices may assist in cooling and maintaining the first terminal and the second terminal at an operational temperature. In embodiments where the inverter module includes a wide band gap semiconductor inverter the inverter module may operate at temperatures exceeding 150 C. and heat generated by the inverter module may be communicated to the first bus bar the second bus bar the first terminal and the second terminal . By cooling the first bus bar the second bus bar the first terminal and the second terminal the thermoelectric devices may assist in maintaining the first terminal and the second terminal at an operational temperature which in some embodiments may be lower than 85 C.

The battery is also electrically coupled to the flow inducer and may directly or indirectly provide electrical power to drive the flow inducer . In some embodiments the battery is indirectly electrically coupled to the flow inducer through a power converter which may include a DC DC converter. As described above the flow inducer may induce flow of a medium over the fins of the cooling element which may increase the amount of heat that may be dissipated by the cooling elements . As the second sides of the thermoelectric devices are thermally coupled to the cooling elements the flow inducer may increase the amount of heat dissipated from the thermoelectric devices .

Referring collectively to in embodiments the thermoelectric devices are electrically coupled to a power source and in particular to a thermoelectric generator or thermoelectric generators . The thermoelectric generators are thermally coupled to the inverter module and in particular one end of the thermoelectric generators is thermally coupled to the inverter module . While the embodiment depicted in shows a thermoelectric generator thermally coupled to a housing of the inverter module it should understood that the thermoelectric generators may be thermally coupled to various components of the inverter module . For example the thermoelectric generators may be thermally coupled to a thermoelectric device terminal not depicted of the inverter module as outlined in U.S. Pat. No. 8 552 283 which is assigned to the Toyota Motor Corporation the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

As described above in operation the inverter module changes DC power provided by the battery into AC power provided to the motor . As the inverter module changes the DC power into AC power components of the inverter module such as the inverter elements generate a significant amount of heat. While one end of the thermoelectric generators are thermally coupled to the inverter module an opposite end of the thermoelectric generators is exposed to a medium such as ambient air or an inverter cold plate not shown . The medium is at a second temperature that is less than the temperature of the inverter module thereby producing a temperature differential across the thermoelectric generators . The thermoelectric generators generate a voltage potential when exposed to a temperature differential and produce an electrical current when the voltage potential is electrically coupled to a load as a result of the Seebeck effect. In embodiments the thermoelectric generator may be formed from Bismuth Antimony Telluride BiSbTe . Alternatively similar thermoelectric generator materials may be used.

Accordingly by thermally coupling one end of the thermoelectric generators to the inverter module the heat generated by the inverter module by changing DC electrical power to AC electrical power may be harvested by the thermoelectric generators to produce an electrical current. In the embodiment depicted in as the thermoelectric generators are electrically coupled to the thermoelectric devices the thermoelectric generators may provide an electrical current to the thermoelectric devices . In some embodiments the thermoelectric generators may be electrically coupled to the thermoelectric devices through a power converter which may include a DC DC converter and or an energy storage device which may include an energy storage capacitor. By providing an electrical current to the thermoelectric devices the thermoelectric generators may induce the temperature differential in the thermoelectric devices thereby cooling the first terminal the second terminal the first bus bar and the second bus bar as described above. In some embodiments the thermoelectric generators may alternatively or additionally be electrically coupled to the flow inducer a pump for the cooling plates or other powered components and or sensors electrically coupled to the electric drive system .

Referring collectively to when the electric drive system is initially started the inverter module may be at a relatively low temperature as compared to when the inverter module is in operation. As the inverter module may be at a relatively low temperature the temperature differential in the thermoelectric generators may be relatively low as compared to when the electric drive system is in operation. As the electrical potential and the electrical current generated by the thermoelectric generators may be proportional to the temperature differential in the thermoelectric generators the electrical current generated by the thermoelectric generators may be relatively low when the electric drive system is initially started.

Accordingly the electrical current provided to the thermoelectric devices may be reduced when the electric drive system is initially started. As the temperature differential induced in the thermoelectric devices may be proportional to the amount of electrical current provided to the thermoelectric devices the temperature differential in the thermoelectric devices and accordingly the ability of the thermoelectric devices to cool the first terminal the second terminal the first bus bar and the second bus bar may be reduced when the electric drive system is initially started.

Referring to the phase change components are thermally coupled to the first terminal and the first bus bar as well as the second terminal and the second bus bar . As described above the phase change components may temporarily absorb heat from the first terminal and the first bus bar as well as the second terminal and the second bus bar . By temporarily absorbing heat from the first terminal and the first bus bar as well as the second terminal and the second bus bar the phase change components may assist in maintaining the first terminal the first bus bar the second terminal and the second bus bar at an operational temperature when the electric drive system is initially started. Once the electric drive system is in operation heat generated by the inverter module may be sufficient to generate electrical current using the thermoelectric generators to induce a temperature differential in the thermoelectric devices to cool and assist in maintaining the first terminal the first bus bar the second terminal and the second bus bar at an operational temperature.

It should now be understood that electric drive systems according to the present specification include a battery an electric motor electrically coupled to the battery and an inverter module electrically coupled to the battery and the electric motor. The electric drive systems may include a bus bar that electrically couples the inverter module and the battery and a smoothing capacitor including at least one terminal electrically coupled to the bus bar. A thermoelectric device is thermally coupled to the terminal and or the bus bar. By thermally coupling a thermoelectric device to the terminal and or the bus bar the thermoelectric device may be used to actively cool and maintain the terminal and the bus bar at an operational temperature. Further in some embodiments a thermoelectric generator may be thermally coupled to the inverter module and electrically coupled to the thermoelectric device such that heat generated by the inverter module may be used to power the thermoelectric device to cool the at least one terminal and or the bus bar. In this way heat that would otherwise be lost as waste heat may be harvested and utilized to power the thermoelectric device to actively cool and maintain the at least one terminal and or the bus bar at an operational temperature.
