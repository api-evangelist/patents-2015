title: Systems and methods of secure data exchange
abstract: An example method for managing digital rights management (DRM) protected content sharing in a networked secure collaborative computer data exchange environment includes establishing, by a secure exchange facility and managed by an intermediate organizational entity, a procedure that allows a user from a first entity to share access to computer data content with a user from a second entity based on indicated access rights. The method includes transforming the computer data content into DRM protected content, utilizing a DRM engine provided by a separate entity. The method includes granting access to the content to the second user, providing permissioned control to entities utilizing a number of data storage nodes, and managing secure data exchange of the content and metadata, without the secure exchange facility having access to the content. The method includes operations to support content services including data transformation, filtering, analytics, and searching tools for the content.

The present invention relates to networked secure content and more particularly to sharing viewing and collaboration of networked secure content between entities.

Despite the availability of the Internet there is still no entirely satisfactory way for people at different companies or other entities to have the benefits of private network security such as for file sharing or collaborative work between enterprises on a daily basis and for ad hoc alliances i.e. different sets of entities coming together to function as one mega or meta entity for the duration of some particular project. In such cases the time and expense of actually wiring a network between two or more companies or other entities and agreeing on one common software package or standard presents a barrier to conventional network solutions. In addition any new process for the sharing of content has in the past generally required the user to adopt new workflow components applications and habits that tend to be disruptive to the user s normal day to day workflow routine e.g. when working internal to their enterprise and with personal use. Simply using the Internet remains imperfectly secure for the sharing of confidential information without some pre arranged secure encryption processes has been cumbersome and unproductive especially in today s increasing use of personal devices being incorporated into the workflow. Further secure storage and sharing of content across diverse storage facilities makes it difficult to meet requirements for tracking content such as for maintaining the ability to access all versions of a document to all users with a copy of a document and the like. For instance with content shared across diverse storage facilities it may be difficult for a user or enterprise to respond to a discovery request for electronic content. There is a need for such systems and for users to utilize the systems in such a way that does not force them to adopt new infrastructure software and business and personal processes in their daily workflow in order to achieve a shared and potentially secure extended work environment.

Thus there are still yet unsolved problems associated with different groups of companies or other entities to sharing securely over an expanding global network environment.

The present disclosure describes methods and systems contributing to managing digital rights management DRM protected content sharing in a networked secure collaborative computer data exchange environment through a secure exchange facility managed by an intermediate organizational entity amongst users of a plurality of other organizational entities wherein computer data content and access rights for the computer data content is shared between a first and second user and the computer data content and access rights for the computer data content are translated into a DRM protected computer data content through communications with a DRM engine wherein the DRM engine is selected based on a content type of the computer data content and the DRM engine is not associated with the intermediate organizational entity or the plurality of other organizational entities.

In embodiments a method for managing digital rights management DRM protected content sharing in a networked secure collaborative computer data exchange environment includes establishing by a secure exchange facility managed by an intermediate organizational entity a user login data authentication procedure that allows a user through at least one client computing device to access the secure exchange facility wherein the user is one of a plurality of users of a plurality of other organizational entities that access content shared through the secure exchange facility where communication between the secure exchange facility and the plurality of users is through a communications network receiving computer data content and at least one indicator of access rights for the computer data content from a first user of the plurality of users associated with a first organizational entity of the plurality of other organizational entities wherein the first user permits sharing access to the computer data content by at least a second user of the plurality of users associated with a second organizational entity based on the indicated access rights wherein the second organizational entity is one of the plurality of other organizational entities and is different than the first organizational entity transforming the computer data content into DRM protected computer data content through communications with a DRM engine wherein the DRM engine is selected based on a content type of the computer data content and wherein the DRM engine is provided by an entity other than the intermediate organizational entity and other than any of the plurality of other organizational entities that access content shared through the secure exchange facility and granting by the secure exchange facility shared access to the DRM protected computer data content to at least the second user.

These and other systems methods objects features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the drawings. All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.

While the invention has been described in connection with certain preferred embodiments other embodiments would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art and are encompassed herein.

The present disclosure describes a secure exchange system alternatively referred to as an exchange exchange platform exchange service or data exchange system throughout this disclosure where many types of communications are required between different parties that are associating for a temporary transaction or project but as competitors or for other reasons are not suitable for a permanent communication network such as an intranet or enterprise network such as a LAN or WAN as might be used for a single government agency single corporation or other single enterprise or institution. Transaction projects involving financial transactions and projects involving complex legal agreements such as mergers acquisitions and the like are situations in the which the methods and systems described herein are particularly suitable however these are not necessarily the only sort of projects appropriate as any project in which parties need to share confidential information across entities outside the boundaries of the network of a single entity may benefit from the methods and systems described herein including litigation or other disputes. In embodiments the secure exchange system may be implemented as a large multi tenant enterprise scalable global orchestration of work such as organized into work streams with work products where the secure exchange system is hosted by an intermediate organizational entity accessible by a plurality of other independent organizational entities.

In an example transactions within the banking industry may provide a situation where a secure exchange service may be particularly applicable where ad hoc syndicates are formed under the leadership of one or more lead banks to permit a number of agent or associate banks to participate in a major loan to a borrower. Such loans have become more common and may involve loans in excess of one billion dollars. Syndication of such large loans is used since any one bank is not prepared to lend such a large amount to a single customer. Conventionally proposed terms of a loan are negotiated between the borrower and the lead banks each in consultation with its advisors such as legal counsel public relations consultants accountants and insurance carriers. In some instances some advisors may be in house advisors as employees of a given entity and thus constitute an internal team. However the advisors in many instances may be independently associated with external entities such as law firms or major accounting firms and thus constitute either external teams or combinations of the above. The lead bank s negotiates with the borrower to arrive at terms and conditions for the loan such as the interest rate repayment schedule security and the bank s fee for processing and syndicating the loan. The lead bank may agree to underwrite the entire loan in which case the lead bank uses syndication to create sub loans between it and other banks to raise the funds for the loan. All of these transactions require management of voluminous amounts of documentation most of which is confidential and whose disclosure could result in huge damages to the borrower or lenders. Thus it would be desirable to provide an exchange as described herein which enables secure document transmission between users over a global communication network without requiring the users to communicate in advance to establish an encryption method. In this example the exchange service may provide a suitable level of security with respect to each of the shared transactions among companies that commonly may be vigorous competitors with numerous confidential documents that the companies do not want uncontrollably shared among other members of the loan project group or accessible by outsiders generally. Substantially secure communications is particularly of the utmost concern to all parties to a syndicated loan transaction the borrower the lead bank and the associate banks. A virtual network system provided through the exchange may readily provide substantial security to ensure that information and communications among all the various parties are secure.

In embodiments the exchange may enable electronic transmission and reception of confidential documents over a global communication network such as the Internet for distributing electronic documents containing sensitive information or data to selected entities for notifying intended recipients of the availability of such documents for tracking access downloading and uploading of such documents and the like.

In embodiments the exchange may only be accessed by authorized computers using an acceptable log in procedure including user name and password. Communications within the exchange may establish a communication session based upon a selected security protocol and thereafter messages are transmitted between using such secure encryption. Communications may be exchanged via a secure encrypted communication session using a selected encryption protocol and may deny access if a secure session cannot be established at a desired secure level.

In embodiments the exchange may provide a fully provisioned turnkey service for users where once the user s enterprise has established an account through the exchange documents in electronic form may be uploaded to the secure site maintained through the exchange host server where a variety of secure collaborative communications options may be chosen including document storage e mail video broadcasting video conferencing white boarding and the like to augment and manage interactive access to the documents including a user graphical interface for managing user interactions with one or more exchanges.

In embodiments the exchange may provide one or more secure sites for placing documents and messages to be transmitted over a secure virtual network and may allow authorized users to read or edit messages according to their level of authorization. Any documents that are edited may be immediately available on the system so that other persons involved in the exchange have access to the edited or modified documents immediately. In addition the exchange may provide tracking of each document to allow selected users to see who has had access to the messages and documents and who has modified or edited any of the documents. Content and communications shared amongst a group may be included in a work stream where the work stream may be focused on or associated with a particular topic task project event and the like. Content and communications may also be presented to users based on activity thus creating an activity stream that shows users what is active such as in a work stream within a group of work steams and the like. In this way the activity based work stream provides a location were a user might go to see what is active in one or more work streams exchanges and the like.

In embodiments the exchange may provide a centralized firewall that may be employed to protect confidential information so that no unauthorized access to such information occurs. A firewall such as may be effectively used for corporate intranets may be applied in each exchange. Groups of users such as on a virtual network may be treated like a remote corporate office and restricted by firewall protocols from uncontrollable access to the information from other users. In addition if needed respective inter user firewalls may be established to prevent one user from accessing information in the host site of another user. The exchange may be particularly suitable for communication among multiple unrelated groups of users since a centralized firewall management may simplify the logistics of each user having to separately provide secure access through their own respective enterprise firewalls. In such a centralized management architecture the host management entity as opposed to each respective user may conveniently process server access security data. Similarly system backup and recovery may be better handled by a centralized backup and recovery system through the host management entity as opposed to such recovery tasks being separately handled at a multiplicity of enterprise sites.

In embodiments a plurality of exchange service users of the secure exchange system may exchange data such as documents messages data and the like between a secure host server and a plurality of user computers across a network e.g. the Internet in a secure manner such as only accessed by authorized user computers using an acceptable log in procedure. In embodiments the user computers may interface with the network through a network server a mail server and the like and in association with an enterprise intranet where a firewall is present between the user computer and the network and where the exchange is conducted between the user computers and the host computer through a secure exchange across the network and through the network server mail server and the like. In another embodiment the user computers may interact in the exchange with the secure exchange system across the network while away from or in the absence of the enterprise intranet and enterprise firewall. For instance the user may be able to access the exchange while at home such as using a mobile enterprise computer a personally owned computer a mobile device and the like.

In embodiments the exchange host server may be distributed over a plurality of server computers and therefore the host server may be viewed as one of such multiple servers. In this way the server computers may work together to provide essentially seamless access to a large number of users on various platforms with varying communications speeds. The server computers may run under server management software which in turn may be responsible for coordination of services maintaining state and system status monitoring security and other administrative functions. In embodiments a user computer having a suitable Web browser may directly access the host server where the exchange may not need to provide each user with subscriber application software such as including software modules for access activation viewing communications and the like relative to the exchange service.

In embodiments whenever an exchange of data is initiated such as by a document being received at the host server connected to a host database the host server may extract the address of the intended recipient and create a notification to the recipient s of the existence of the data at the host server. The notification may contain the URL for the host server. However the recipient may not be able to access the message unless the recipient is authorized to use the system such as the recipient needing to be a registered user and have an assigned password to access the data or other repository at the host server where data is stored such as on a user database. If the intended recipient is granted access to the host server the recipient may then locate the message intended for them by browsing through all messages to which the recipient has been granted access.

While the notification sent to the intended recipient may be sent using standard Internet protocol without encryption once the user computer contacts the host server the server may establish a secure encrypted communication session using a selected encryption protocol. The host server may deny access if a secure session cannot be established at a desired secure level such as 128 bit encryption.

In embodiments exchange services for different users may utilize separate software structured server databases. For example company A and company B may use the secure exchange system but each company s data may be maintained in separate databases although perhaps in the same physical data storage facility. This feature offers the advantage of allowing the facilities of the secure exchange system to be customized for each company. For example when the external user accesses the secure exchange system the secure exchange system may recognize the user and associate the user with a particular one of the companies A and B. Using this recognition the secure exchange system may present a customized browser interface which makes the secure exchange system look like it is operated by or branded for the selected company. To the external user it may appear that they have been connected directly to the company server rather than the secure exchange system. Thus the present invention may allow a user to securely send data such that the network connection is substantially transparent to the user. Further the system may provide customization for each of a plurality of different users such that an external user accessing the secure exchange system may appear to be connected to an internal client server.

In embodiments the secure exchange system may be organized as a centrally hosted secure computer system a distributed hosted secure computer system and the like accessible by a plurality of organizational entities. The secure exchange system may be organized as a customizable hybrid system to accommodate the needs of organizational entities. In embodiments data stored by the plurality of organizational entities may be at least in part centrally stored stored at least in part in distributed locations stored at least in part on the premises of the organizational entity and the like. depict an embodiment secure exchange system with functional elements enabling a hybrid system having available both centralized and distributed storage capabilities each enabled with secure exchange system capabilities. The embodiment is not meant to be interpreted as limiting in any way but to be illustrative of the capabilities of the secure exchange system as described more fully in this disclosure. For example the secure exchange system may include a centralized secure exchange system that provides centralized management of the secure exchange of content with user devices including mobile devices like smart phones and tablets on enterprise premises resources such as enterprise file systems data stores and metadata stores and the like. The secure exchange system may include a secure data management facility data storage node metadata storage and the like to provide secure data exchange services to the enterprise site user devices inside or outside the enterprise firewall and the like.

As depicted in an embodiment in and as described in this disclosure the secure exchange system may comprise a customizable secure exchange system that is at least in part modularized with one or more of the modules services and or capabilities depicted on being encapsulated in one or more secure envelopes e.g. where security extends beyond a centralized hosted secure server out into the cloud computing space as part of an enterprise computing resource inside the enterprise firewall or the like and or provided for use to business entities in a location other than the secure host server such as one or a combination of on site at a business entity on a secure cloud service on a commercial cloud service distributed across a geographic area in a location local to the business entity provided through distributed hosting and the like. This architecture may provide a highly scalable platform upon which business process applications that use the data and metadata that is exchanged and stored via the secure exchange system can be built. Further the functionality provided in secure exchange system embodiments such as described herein may be modularized to enable the business entity to select basic services building blocks components toolkits and the like in building their own secure collaboration and sharing facility that is adapted to meet the needs of the business entity and its business units and users such for a specific business market in which the business entity operates a project the business entity is working with a partnered collaboration between business entities and the like.

The secure exchange system may be deployed alone or it may be deployed in a hybrid situation with the orchestration services . The intermediate host may also manage the orchestration services such as by the service manager B and or by interacting with various interfaces or APIs of the orchestration services that are designed to enable use of the various services modules functions and applications thereof.

The orchestration services may include various data stores that may be used by or in connection with uses of the orchestration services for exchange services and storage such as a workflow queue and instance store and related storage an asset assertion store and related storage a paradata store and related storage various directories and the like. Each module or set of services and its related store storage system may have associated bindings A E A E and message services that enable secure exchange of data with other modules services and store storage systems as well as within the particular module service set or store storage system such as enabling extraction of data transformation of data to appropriate protocols or formats and loading of data. For a given user some secure data exchanges may be undertaken with data hosted on data storage nodes of the intermediate host s secure exchange system while other data exchanges such as of particularly sensitive information may be exchanged using orchestration services in a manner that does not allow the intermediate host to have access to the data that is the capabilities of can be deployed as a hybrid secure exchange system that may include for example both centralized for some data and distributed for other data secure exchange functionality.

On enterprise premises facilities may include on premises storage e.g. file storage in databases on servers in logs in file systems on local devices and the like that are in locations of the enterprise as well as metadata storage analytics storage and the like . Connections may be provided either through various interfaces and APIs or through bindings to outside storage such as to cloud data storage resources including public and private clouds and to more general resources such as accessible through search engines . The on enterprise premises system may include various bindings that allow services such as a federated search service and a federated data storage services to access underlying storage resources. These may include search engine bindings cloud storage bindings metadata store bindings file data store bindings and the like. An analytics engine may be used to track record and report on the uses and activities of the various services modules engines applications and the like of the on enterprise premises system to provide analytics through analytics engine binding . The on enterprise premises system may include transformation and filtering services as described elsewhere in this disclosure such as for handling necessary data transformations that are needed to access particular systems within the enterprise including without limitation systems that may use proprietary data protocols or formats of the particular enterprise. The on enterprise premises system may include key management services such as enabling the enterprise and or individual users to manage encryption keys used to secure and access content as described in more detail elsewhere in this disclosure.

In embodiments transformation and filtering services may provide processing that is done on a file or other asset such as when that asset is uploaded to or downloaded from a secure exchange environment. These transformation and filtering services may perform various functions including security related activities as well as any other processing that is defined for a specific asset type within a specific container. These transformation and filtering services may be container specific application specific customer specific and the like or they may comprise general platform processing activities that are defined in the asset workflow. Example file transformation and filtering activities may include virus scanning publishing search indexing document encryption bulk download e.g. zip transformations from one document type to another e.g. Microsoft Office to .pdf application of DRM file chunking web application processing unique file naming per folder field validation e.g. for business fields and the like. In embodiments customer specific transforms may be provided. For example the secure exchange facility may provide transforms such as virus scanning converting a document to a different format e.g. to a PDF and providing application specific transforms prior to the system applying customer specific transforms before the secure exchange facility publishes a document. Similarly customer specific filters may be provided such as after the secure exchange facility provides filter services for application of a watermark application of DRM encryption and application specific filters or transforms optionally before a document is downloaded to a user.

User devices may interact with the other systems depicted on and with other systems and resources described throughout this disclosure. For example a user device may include a secure viewer as described in more detail elsewhere in this disclosure by which a user may have access to data in various parts of the on enterprise premises system such access being managed by the secure exchange system and or the orchestration services in various embodiments such as to confirm the identity of the user of a user device to confirm the authorization of the user and device to access particular data to limit viewing to situations in which it is permitted e.g. when the user is alone when the user in in a permitted location and the like to cease access to certain content such as by un sharing and the like. The user device may also include a local store which may be managed and accessed by the secure exchange system and or the orchestration services and may be accessed by a federated search engine of the on enterprise premises system the secure exchange system and or the orchestration services such as being included in a federated search that allows a user to search all different stores on premises cloud hosted and on local devices with a single search.

The on enterprise premises facilities may have connectivity with external search engines and associated search engine storage where search results may then be associated with internal facilities through a search engine binding. Metadata file data analytics cloud data storage and the like may be similarly bound such as through binding to federated search services federated storage services analytics and the like. On premises and user device applications and services may be interfaced and bound with orchestration applications and services through a messaging layer such as through SMTP SMS and the like. In addition as described in this disclosure key management services may be provided on enterprise premises such as to provide the enterprise side of a customer managed key arrangement.

For example the distribution facility may allow the host server to electronically distribute data using secure communications among the plurality of users. The usage facility may allow the host server to monitor the usage of the network to permit the users to be billed for the network service. The host server may be set up to manage a plurality of separate virtual networks concurrently with each such virtual network representing a different client such as company A and company B. Further a community facility may provide for users of different companies to be exposed to one other even if the different companies have not had any previous contacts e.g. through a shared exchange and a dashboard facility may provide companies the ability to manage exchanges documents contacts communications preferences and the like.

The host server may offer a high level of security for all data by employing substantially secure network connections and by means of security and encryption technologies developed for networks such as may be readily incorporated in the encryption facility . Additionally the host server may provide highly secure access control by way of the user authorization facility that may allow only authorized personnel to access individual messages and related documents and communications. The viewer facility may be able to protect documents from unauthorized viewing printing saving and the like and a mobile device interface facility may enable secure viewing on a mobile device such as a personal tablet being used away from an enterprise network. The Email in facility may provide for the ability to add content to an exchange using regular email such as that is sent to a designated secure email address.

The host server may give each user the ability to electronically link or be interconnected via a link facility with any number of other users. Although data may be preferably formatted in a particular form such as may be readily implemented with a commercially available document exchange program other formats could be optionally accommodated using a suitable format conversion facility . The multimedia facility may also be used to process data into a format suitable for presentation to the user in forms other than text such as audio still or moving images and the like.

The virtual network viewer may also include a multimedia viewer facility configured to for example provide viewing of interactive multimedia or mixed media memoranda through suitable decoders such as audio decoders Joint Photographic Experts Group JPEG still image decoders and Moving Pictures Experts Group MPEG moving image decoders. The virtual network viewer may also support various collaborative communications options such as e mail video conferencing and white boarding which are enabled for a given transaction pursuant to instructions from the appropriate user. Of course the range of multimedia capability and the collaborative communications options may vary depending on the various groupware facilities available to the user.

The notarization facility may be provided to electronically certify any electronic data forwarded to users such as incorporating electronic signature technology and the like. The network service facility may conveniently be used to display various data in connection with the network service such as additional services that may be available by the network service to the users. The above facilities may work jointly with the email facility the interface facility and the like to send notices of data for exchange and interface with to securely pass data.

A virtual network viewer or browser may conveniently provide the end user with an easy to use graphical interface to data and other particularly confidential information on the network service s virtual network service. The virtual network service may provide identification of services available over the virtual network as well as a variety of options for accessing and retrieving data. The virtual network viewer may include the transaction identification facility that for example may enable a user to quickly find and access information. The virtual network viewer may automatically provide a suitable connection to the user to the virtual network service through the sign on facility . The viewer may also prompt the user to input one or more passwords or identifications which should be recognized by either the authorized editor facility or the authorized reader facility in order to access information on a database.

For the convenience of the users some data offered through the virtual network service may be designed as interactive multimedia documents that will include video graphics audio and other multimedia elements. Multimedia communications may provide the user with a wide variety of information in addition to that provided by more standard text data.

By way of an example a syndication desk i.e. one or more individuals authorized to be responsible for the management of a syndicated transaction of a lead user may be able to broadcast and or selectively send e mail messages processed by the syndication facility to associate users and vice versa. For example amendment data processed by the amendment voting facility may be used to vote on changes to a transaction document amongst authorized users. The amended document may be conveniently distributed via email using the e mail facility for providing associate users with up to the minute information about the transaction. Amendments or messages may be appended to the document at the host site of the network service where they may be ordinarily viewed by accessing the virtual network service that is authorized to access the document. E mail messages or amendments may also be downloaded for printing or for attachment to local documents. Similarly comment data in connection with a transaction may be processed through the comment facility for appropriate distribution to authorized users. Transaction documents may also be signed by authorized users through the e signing facility .

In embodiments the secure exchange server may utilize a secure cloud architecture with meshed data centers various enterprise clouds private clouds hosted clouds and the like. For instance data centers in a meshed configuration may support the methods and systems disclosed herein in a secure cloud where each of the node entities in a mesh configuration is always or nearly always up and running Enterprises working in association with the secure exchange server may have their enterprise clouds linked to a secure cloud associated with the secure exchange server. For instance each entity may run a core platform a content router an identity federator for identities associated with the enterprise applications code and the like. In embodiments the secure exchange server may connect with partner enterprise data centers and run an image of the same configuration or a subset thereof on one more such data centers or on one or more clouds.

In embodiments there may be limited content repositories such as where distribution centers separate from the main content repositories of an enterprise provide content access interfaces such as content players for running playing or otherwise providing access to a limited set of the content associated with an enterprise a project or the like. In embodiments routing among repository elements may enable a party in control of content to allow multi tenant access to any set or subset of content such as enabling multi tenant collaborations for various work streams that require access to content. For instance a user interface may include a dashboard of work streams one or more of which could be hosted on a secure cloud infrastructure or on a specific data center based on the choice of the party controlling the work stream or controlling the content used in connection with the work stream. In embodiments for a given work stream a user may connect to the closest data center in a meshed environment with at least partial content replication so a user can get access to the data center e.g. federated or replicated for at least certain content that provides the highest quality of service e.g. bandwidth response time etc. for access to the relevant content by the particular user. To maintain effective mirroring of content in a timely manner for particular content synchronization such as for content and ID management may be defined at a plurality of levels. In an example a system platform may include ID management collections analytics a composite layer and the like.

In embodiments the platform may be replicated for distribution e.g. by sale lease or the like to a number of data centers. The platform may have a link to applications and stores where applications may access stores through or in compliance with a policy. A store may be viewed as an application and may reside in a plurality of locations such as locally in a data center public cloud private cloud laptop domain and the like. A policy access layer may determine access such as to a specified set of applications being granted access to a specified set of stores based on a policy. One store may be a location store where the location store has identifying information as to what content exists and the location where particular content is stored. The system may provide for caching such as a way for users to allow the system to cache content for access based on the policy. In this way the platform may be viewed as a service infrastructure layer.

Lenders may then receive an alert including task assignments such as for external counsel the agency team participants e.g. lenders and the like. Documents e.g. memos signature pages may be downloaded and tracked at a next step. Then signature pages such as a memo with a signature page may be signed and submitted as a response. Participants e.g. administrator agency external counsel may receive the vote response. In an external process votes may be weighted such as based on committed dollar amounts on an agent s records. The process may be finalized such as with posting totals e.g. for an agent back team where members of the process e.g. lenders and borrowers in a loan process are notified. In embodiments the amendment voting facility may reduce or eliminate the manual process surrounding a vote collection and consent process such as associated with a loan process and helps the user efficiently prioritize a vote collection strategy.

In an example on a syndicated loan one agency bank may be in charge and have a number of lenders supporting that loan often hundreds or even in excess of a thousand such lenders. As proposed modifications or amendments are made each may need to be disseminated have users react to it such as providing information making selections and the like be returned with appropriate documentation to the agency bank and the like. A typical process is conventionally performed offline where banks are required to have signing authorities pen ink sign and re submit to the agency bank. Further to the example when a new amendment comes up the agency bank may create a new transaction exchange environment for the amendment process. Through a data link the lender groups of members of those groups may be pushed into the new exchange environment such that each of them appears as a participant in the exchange. Data relating to all current positions of the lenders the amounts of their financial positions with respect to the particular loan or loans may also be pushed into the exchange so that it is available for further processing. In embodiments the current position of a user with respect to the transaction structure may have a bearing on the voting such as the weight given to a user s vote minimum amounts related to the amendment and the like. Such amounts may be stored and retrieved for processing by the exchange. For instance an agency bank may ask lenders to confirm their understanding of their positions in the process some or all of the data with respect to positions may be pre populated into the system and carried through into the transaction and the like.

In embodiments the amendment voting facility may allow for the naming of an amendment vote a date for the vote a vote distribution inclusion of associated documents facility for signature providing page submissions inclusion of instructions to voters a process of approval a step for outside counsel to review and the like. Once the announcement for the vote is sent out an administrator agent may be able to view the tasks that have gone out to what individuals and groups and the status of the voting. Features of the amendment voting facility may include import and export of commitment data support of amendment vote collection workflow creation of vote template configurations configuration of election forms display of an amendment voting graphical user interface dashboard configuration of signature pages access for an administrator to complete tasks facility for client specific amendment vote definition and the like. Import and export may include users ability to populate a deal structure automatically e.g. from a source file create a list of lenders groups and tranches commitment information on a new deal exchange reconcile an existing deal structure generate reports e.g. listing commitment amounts for each participant updating commitments and the like. Support of amendment vote collection workflow may include support of a plurality of different amendment types and allow users to create process definitions available for run time execution and the like where the different amendment types may include a simple yes no a yes no with signature consent no consent amend and extend and the like. Amendment vote collection workflow may include specification of due dates and time collection of election options distribution of documentation the ability to edit voting parameters and the like. Creation of vote template configurations may include support of vote template configuration creation such as to encapsulate the amendment vote process for document control management including users setting up owners monitors and vote elements once and reusing for subsequent votes providing consistent language and instructions and documentation across transactions and votes setting up vote types that may be adjusted as needed and the like. The election form may be configured to allow users to dynamically generate election forms based on group participant relationships e.g. lenders only having visibility to cases they have access to . Display of an amendment voting dashboard may include view of a list of multiple amendments initiated for a particular transaction view of details of the process e.g. list of lenders and their related status such s progress against a task view of participant contact and additional information and the like. Configuration of the signature page may include custom text a logo and the like where users may update and maintain their own custom signature pages such as for all transactions per transaction per vote and the like.

Continuing with the syndicated loan example a lender may receive an email alert that they are invited into a new amendment task process. They may then be asked to login where they are brought into the task flow that came from the alert. Tasks may include instructions document review election options and the like. Pre populated information may also be provided in association with the task. The user may record their vote and save any amendments associated with their elections. Their election and amendments may be printable where the user may then take that document to the signatory to have it signed. In this instance all of the information including instructions may be included in the hard copy for the lender and where the signing indicates legal consent. In this way there may be one single entry point of information where the lender receives the document to be signed has it signed and is provided a facility for loading the document back into the system. In embodiments an e signature and described herein may also be utilized for signing the document and entry into the system.

In embodiments a user may be provided the user interface to view the exchanges that are running amendments to see tasks generated and what state they are in to view individual tasks for a particular lender to view signature pages e.g. where all of the election option information is carried and the like. Custom fields may also be provided such as to allow users to change commitments. In embodiments users may see information as the data is populated even before signatures are applied. A user may need to perform a calculation such as to weight each vote to see how close they are to carrying the amendment. The system may enable the user to export data to a document e.g. a spreadsheet for performing the calculation separate from the system and to monitor the amendment process and changes thereto. For instance and continuing with the loan syndication example an administrator agent may be most interested in monitoring response levels and challenges to the current commitment levels. For instance if only three users are seen to have any challenge on their commitment amounts then the administrator may need to handle those first which may be a priority if there is a discrepancy. The user may also be interested in those who are planning to take action e.g. increase their commitment reduce their commitment by how much their commitment may change and the like . Ultimately the agency bank may have the final say and so the system may provide them with priority and so enable them to decide on whether to allow the changes or not.

An exemplary amendment voting facility user interface may include various features such as an dashboard listing and graphic showing the status of a user s amendment voting where the graphic shown displays for example a pie graph of no consent consent and no response as well as a listing of specific amendment voting statuses. A user interface may show a user notification of being assigned an amendment vote task a user interface may show distribution of an amendment vote and options available to the user for making the amendment vote including to agree or to disagree with for example a specified dollar amount commitment. A listing of an amendment voting task status for a user may be displayed as well as a signature page being submitted by a user which may include for example a note stating Please find my signature page attached for review . The user interface may provide updated listing and status for the user s amendment voting tasks.

In embodiments a method for managing a networked secure collaborative computer data exchange environment may be provided establishing by a secure exchange server controlled by an intermediate business entity an authentication procedure for a client login authentication data that allows at least one of a plurality of user client computing devices operated by users of at least two business entities to access the at least one secure exchange server wherein communications between the secure exchange server and the plurality of user client computing devices is through a communications network storing by the secure exchange server the at least one client login authentication data for each of the plurality of client computing devices receiving from a first of the plurality of user client computing devices content associating access by the secure exchange server to the content to a subset of the plurality of user computing devices through an exchange content access facility the exchange content access facility managed by at least one of the plurality of business entities granting by the exchange server access to the content of the secure exchange server to a second of the plurality of user client computing devices when the secure exchange server receives a client login authentication data from the second of the plurality of user client computing devices and dependent upon the second of the plurality of user client computing devices being one of the subset of the plurality of user client computing devices and providing an electronic signature facility for managing a process of signing the received content by at least one of the subset of the plurality of computing devices wherein the electronic signature facility provides for secure viewing of the content as presented to a signing user through a computer display of the signing user s client computing device wherein the user s client computing device includes an integrated camera for viewing the environment around the signing user and a face detection facility for recognizing the signing user detecting if the signing user is the only individual present in the viewed environment and if not obfuscates the viewing of the content. The obfuscation may be blanking the screen distorting the viewing of the content and the like. The detection of the signing user by the face detection facility may be accomplished by comparing an image of a previously stored facial image of the signing user to the face detected in the viewed environment.

In embodiments the electronic signature facility may provide a unique signature code ID for a signature page such that the signature code ID is unique in the system thus providing a unique identifier for the signature page. Thus the methods and systems disclosed herein include methods and systems for creating a repository of signature pages for an enterprise with related indexing of the locations of as well as preservation of the content to which the signature pages relate. With this feature a user may print out a signature page that has the signature code ID and be able to subsequently pull the printed signature page out of a content store and search the electronic storage system of an enterprise e.g. a cloud data center file system or the like for the document associated with the signature code ID to confirm what document was signed. This allows a user to maintain a paper based record in their records files but retain the ability to search for the e document to which the signature page corresponds. The signature code ID may not only be unique to the signature page and associated document but also to the version of the document where the signature code ID may be wiped out if that document is revised or changed. In this way the system may create a parallel structure between a paper based system and the electronic system including revisions. The signature code ID may be stamped on one or more pages of the document. For instance the document may be a PDF formatted document and the stamp may be placed on all the PDF pages. This is only one simple example but the signature code ID may be used on any kind of digital content that needs to be signed or initialed in any way. For example sections of a document such as clauses in a contract requiring separate approval e.g. in real estate loan documents rental car agreements and the like may be linked to distinct signature IDs so that the approved clauses are separately searchable and verifiable electronically based on the signature IDs and so that the system can identify any changes that may have been made to the content that is associated with the signature. In embodiments the signature code ID may be stored as metadata with the digital content. The signature ID may be enabled with any conventional technique for providing a unique ID such as an encryption key or the like. In embodiments the key may be based on or include a hash of the content with respect to which the signature is associated to assist in conforming that the signed content has not been changed when it is retrieved at a later time. Search for content may be enabled using location indices by storing IDs in content metadata by searches on linked lists or similar structures by full text searches or by other search and retrieval techniques known by those of ordinary skill in the art.

Referring to the dashboard facility may provide organized facilities for managing exchanges amongst the plurality of exchange service users disseminate to users of multiple groups of users separating exchange environments and the like. For example for a corporate M A or private equity group the dashboard may provide users with the ability to take their information and create a profile and expose the information to other parties e.g. to private equity investors showing performance of their individual funds . The dashboard may present information in an organized manner allow for loading of information through an information importer provide permissions to view information allow for the exporting of information through an information exporter and the like. The dashboard may provide for a timeline view of activity in an exchange work steam project and the like thus providing a graphical view of activity over time. The dashboard facility may provide for user access and display of both structured and unstructured data access to views that provide a custom format or familiar terms to a particular category of transaction client e.g. fund investment documents capital account statement investment team and the like which also may restrict a user s view to content applicable to them or to the targeted category of transaction. In a private equity example the user may configure the dashboard to their specific needs such as including useful widgets to display information relating to the market e.g. available funds . A funds widget may provide for selection of a fund providing overview and performance information and the like. There may also be sub widgets that provide further functionality to a widget. The user may also have multiple dashboards such as for different exchanges different markets different deals and the like. One dashboard may handle information that is available to other users and another dashboard may handle all personal files that are both available and unavailable to other users. The dashboard facility may also provide a compliance feature such as to track changes made in each dashboard. In embodiments the dashboard facility may present a view of exchanges in a list form a visual folders form a tile display a card view e.g. a card view that flips amongst exchanges or lower level organizations and the like. Exchanges work streams documents and the like may be created called up closed and the like by voice command through gesture detection and the like.

In an example of setting up a file exchange an administrator user may place files within an input file directory where the files may have a nomenclature that tells what widget they will populate. The system may create a configuration run a process to populate it ensure it is correct before allowing access and the like. In this way data may be considered stage data prior to allowing access and production data once approved. Once the user is comfortable with a view they can proceed and publish the staged data into production . The system may be able to upload data as CSV file create permissions files and the like. In embodiments a specific user might be provided a view within a dashboard but be given only access to one or more records within the dashboard. For example the user might only see a particular fund rather than all funds. If they select that fund they may be able to see child data associated with that fund. But without permission the other funds or child data would not be displayed. A permissions model may give users access to specific records within the dashboard. In an M A example a user may be able to see all the live deals an organization is managing a certain human resources team might be allowed to see the dashboard and the like where specific entities are provided permissions.

The dashboard may have both optional and standard functionality such as standard filtering options converting documents to a PDF format and the like. There may be a widget catalog provided such as for textual displays graphs and charts document tracking and the like.

The dashboard may enable management of files at a document level at a record level and the like such as to allow a user to add records and manage information. A user may be able to add new content put in the required information refresh the screen e.g. on a per deal basis and the like. The user may be able to edit and delete existing records show a parent child relationship and the like. The user might want to choose the parent and find the document within the exchange and link it up to the parent document. The system may have the ability to manage individual records such as for dashboard data but also to permissions. The user may be able to take a parent record and provide permission to one of the many users to enable access to those parents. In embodiments the system may provide for an auditing facility such as for tracking who is adding records and permissions.

In embodiments dashboard permissions may be automatically matched provided and the like based on exchange permissions. For instance dashboard permissions may be driven directly from the exchange permissions associated with a particular exchange. In this instance people may be part of an exchange with various permissions and the like where they would send configuration files e.g. CSV files to permission through the dashboard while they would manage groups and permissions separately in the exchange. With permissions automatically matched permissions would be provided in multiple places such as through the configuration files as well as in the exchange. In such embodiments users may not have to use separate permission files because the dashboard permissions may be able to follow from the permissions of the exchange. In embodiments the system may use a matching algorithm between the exchange and the dashboard such as based on fund information and the like.

In embodiments a permissions view as facility may be provided during staging of permissions for an exchange. For example as a user is establishing permissions for an exchange a project a work stream or the like a user may initiate the view as permissioning feature such as by drop down menu selection clicking on an icon or the like which may include a menu or data entry capability e.g. a text field box or the like for selecting another user or category of user for which the permissioning user wishes to simulate viewing. Upon initiation of the view as capability and selecting the user or category of user to be simulated by the permissioning user the system may display an exchange a work stream a dashboard a project a store or a particular content item to the permissioning user as if the permissioning user were the other user selected by the permissioning user or as if the permissioning user is a member of the selected category of user. Thus the permissioning user may see documents as if they were another user so as to confirm that they have established the desired permissioning before going live with the exchange project work stream or the like. In effect in such embodiments the system combines the staging and verification of permissioning into two concepts with simulated viewing providing verification that is simultaneous with or proximate in time with staging.

A user interface may be provided which for example provides a listing of available funds and fund information providing a plurality of columns for content. Editing tools for editing specific column content may be provided. Various tools may be provided for editing a fund such as editing specific column content. Alerts may be generated for a condition under which the user cannot save edits such as because the user no longer has the latest version of the data e.g. new data was uploaded or another user edited the content since the time the user interface dashboard was opened . In this instance a control button may be provided to update the dashboard data. A dialog box for creating a new fund may also be provided for attaching a documents for providing permissions in association with the example fund including for example providing an ID of the user wanting to change permissions and the like.

Referring to the Email in facility may provide for the ability to add content to an exchange using regular email such as sent to a designated email address. This facility may be especially important with respect to users that circulate critical information and documents via email and where there is a tendency to lose track of it at some point. Users may use the system s email in facility to store email in a secure repository and to be able to tell people to send email to this repository as part of a regular business process. The exchange manager may then review and process the information further. This may simplify the learning curve of using any web application. If the manager is very knowledgeable he may not need all of the counter parties to spend time learning the application. They simply send the content into an exchange. Other features may include an email address being associated with a folder in an exchange a maximum number of allowed emails in an exchange e.g. a user may define a cap an email conversion facility a white list and black list of users notifications of success and or error and the like. In embodiments email in may be limited to authorized users only such as already in the exchange listed on a white list and the like.

Use cases for email in may include submission of analysis documents for review a method for having a third party review applications e.g. in order to create accounts while ensuring the third party does not gain control over attachments that contain private information and the like. In addition the system may provide for folder permissions in the email folder that can be used to prevent misuse. For compliance the user may be able to store communications in an archive and track what was done in association with the communications.

In embodiments any exchange may be set up with email in as a feature. An administrator or client may go through the process such as defining where the sender s email address is stored in the system using custom fields for the from field storing the message as an email cap the maximum emails it can accept choosing the folder it will be associated with and the like. A folder location may thus be mapped to an email address e.g. with the domain pre defined but the pre fix available for end user definition . The user may select users to be included for the feature set alert settings and notification settings e.g. problem alerts that something was added and the like. A white list may be included such as for who should be able to send emails into the exchange e.g. could be domains or even addresses . If a user is not on the white list they may not be able to send emails to the exchange. A black list may be included where a user may choose users to refuse acceptance onto the exchange.

The email in facility may create a folder structure within a pre defined mapped folder and create a sub folder for each email that is sent into the exchange such as with the subject as the title of that folder. Contents of the folders may then include any attached documents. The email in content may be organized like any exchange where new emails are added as they come in. The system may be configured to send to a group or to only one. For instance a user may send the folder to one person to review but not give the recipient the right to do resend print or save the document. Permission may be applied to the documents like any other document as described herein such as who can review the correspondence who can modify it save it print it and the like. In embodiments an event trigger facility may be provided where received email may trigger an event such as a task a process and the like. For instance if a contract comes in it may trigger a renewal process. In another instance an amendment process may be triggered with the reception of an email.

In embodiments the email in facility may include the collection of emails from various parties into a structured database for later management and processing by a critical information exchange manager eliminate the learning curve of using a web application to upload document to the cloud allow specific internal external parties to post documents into a web folder that may be shared with predefined individuals at various control levels and the like. Components may include an email address associated with a folder in an exchange a maximum number of allowed emails in an exchange a definition of email conversion options a white list a black list notifications on success and or error and the like. In an example client or prospect requests may be processed such as for an investment firm with a need to submit documents for analysis a bank looking for a way to have a third part review applications to create new accounts while ensuring that the third party does not gain control over the attachments that contain private information a bank having compliance needs such as needing to archive all communications they have e.g. cc ing and replying to the system on all correspondences and the like. A user interface for email in may include an introduction to email in to the user and a control button to begin the process. In embodiments there may be a number of steps options in the execution of email in such as choosing basic options mapping folders selecting alert recipients creation of a white list creation of a black list enabling disabling of the system and the like. A dialog box may be provided for selection of basic options including a custom field selection for the from of an email how incoming email body content be stored definitions for the maximum number of emails that should be accepted into the exchange and the like. Dialog boxes for selection of a folder in association with mapping folders may be provided with an alert being generated when a duplicate email address is used for example. Users and their alert settings may be selected via a user interface and warnings generated for a duplicate domain or email address associated with the creation of a blacklist. A checklist in association with the enabling of the system may be provided such as shown in the figure for selection of a custom field mapping to two folders folders for mapping email into no maximum specified for number of emails two domains listed on a white list and one domain listed on a black list. A user interface may be presented to the user once email in is enabled showing tabs for listing options mapped folders alert recipients white lists black lists and the like and showing specifically the email in options.

In embodiments intermediate fields forms for mapping an email thread to the right place on an exchange may be provided. For example if a user emails content relevant to a transaction or other project that is being executed on or with the help of an exchange e.g. foreign exchange statement a request to do a transaction a securities document a request for materials a status update or any of a wide range of other communications relevant to a project or an exchange the system may map from an email application or environment where an email or email thread resides such as Outlook Gmail or the like to a location of an exchange. The system may for example identify to which customer enterprise project or individual the email is related. For instance by recognizing the domain or the identity of the sender the domain or identity of the recipient the subject an identifier related to the exchange such as automatically embedded in content or communications relating to the exchange content in the email thread or the like. Once recognized the system may map the email thread to the appropriate exchange location store project or the like associated with the exchange. In embodiments once a mapping is identified or a possible mapping is proposed a form may be presented that if used will facilitate effective association with the exchange. For example a form may have appropriate custom fields that map data of selected types to appropriate locations associated with the exchange so that content of particular types is automatically and intelligently routed to the right places on an exchange. In this way for instance the To field of an email environment can be expanded in the form to present a set of fields or a mapping to a set of exchange locations not just an email address or list of addresses. The rules for presenting a form and managing mapping from email forms to exchanges may be built into the exchange such as in a meta data triggered or meta data managed business process. In one example a user may create a safety report for a drug such as where there has already been a related death using an exchange to manage storage and distribution of the safety report to appropriate recipients. In this case external regulations may specify who needs to be informed of what information in the safety report and the exchange may store such rules embodying them in forms that are presented when an email is identified as relating to that exchange or that safety report so that distribution of the safety report to the right individuals via the correct locations on the exchange is enabled directly from the email environment in which the safety report is initially distributed. In another example an email related to a merger transaction may have a subject line indicating that attachments to the email are responsive to a due diligence request on real estate matters of a target company. Upon recognizing the subject the exchange based on its specified rules may present a form in the email environment prompting the user to direct the email to the section of the exchange that relates to real estate due diligence thus assuring that the content thread is appropriately mapped to and stored with the other content for that section of the exchange and subsequently allowing the exchange to provide other features described herein and known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as automatically notifying participants of updates to the content . Thus exchange specific rules which may apply to exchanges or to projects work streams or the like within an exchange may indicate what information is required who should be informed and the like and custom or even pre populated fields may conveniently be presented in response to initiation of email interactions with an exchange project work stream or the like. Thus this may be a convenient mechanism to trigger actions and provide greater flexibility to improve system capabilities.

In embodiments a method for managing a networked secure collaborative computer data exchange environment may be provided the method including establishing by a secure exchange server controlled by an intermediate business entity a client login data authentication procedure that allows at least one client computing device of a plurality of client computing devices operated by users of a plurality of business entities to access the secure exchange server wherein communications between the secure exchange server and the plurality of client computing devices is through a communications network storing by the secure exchange server at least one client login authentication data for each of the plurality of client computing devices receiving content from a first of the plurality of client computing devices by the secure exchange server permitting access to the content for a subset of the plurality of computing devices through an exchange content access facility wherein the exchange content access facility is managed by at least one business entity of the plurality of business entities granting by the exchange server access to the content to a second of the plurality of client computing devices when the secure exchange server receives from the second of the plurality of client computing devices its client login authentication data provided that the second of the plurality of client computing devices is one of the subset of the plurality of computing devices and providing a secure email input facility for accepting non secure email from outside the exchange into the secure collaborative computer data exchange environment wherein the non secure email is received and stored as secure email in the secure exchange server.

In embodiments access to the exchange server by client processors may be through a host server controlled by the business entity that controls the client processor. The client computing devices may be at least one of owned and managed by at least one of the plurality of business entities. The client computing devices may be owned by individual users. The secure exchange server may be at least one of a plurality of exchange servers. The content may be at least one of a document a spreadsheet a message data an image audio content video content multimedia content and the like. The content may be transferred to the secure exchange server via encrypted data transmission.

In embodiments the acceptance of the non secure email may be dependent upon a controlled listing stored in the secure exchange server where the listing is a white listing specifying emails that are allowed a black listing specifying email that are not allowed and the like. The reception of a non secure email may trigger an event where the triggered event is the initiation of a content amendment process the initiation of a new exchange the distribution of the email within the exchange storage of the email in a secure archive facility and the like. The email may be automatically associated with an area of content on the exchange based on the sender of the email the subject line of the email the destination address of the email within the exchange and the content of the email and the like.

Referring to the viewer facility may provide for a secure viewing protection of documents from unauthorized viewing printing saving and the like such as without having to install custom client software e.g. without installing anything beyond Adobe Flash . Documents in certain formats such as Microsoft Office products PDF documents and the like may be supported for protection. For example for a PDF document a security warning may appear that a user is only allowed to view the document. However if the user tries to print the screen the screen may distort such as transitioning to a fuzzy state. In embodiments the user may need to hold the enter key down to make the document viewable. The user may be able to page up and down rotate zoom and the like. The system may provide for watermarking the document so that if a user is permitted to print screen the document will print with the watermarking. The viewer facility may also include functions such as viewing annotations in the viewer connectivity with the e signing facility e.g. with a stamping tool document visibility based on face detection document protection from eavesdroppers e.g. automatic limitation of document viewing also referred herein as spotlighting based on detection of a second face granular page level document access reports document protection using facial recognition based encryption text to voice feature e.g. such as in Apple Siri hand gesture based controls e.g. scrolling control based on hand fist movement real time white boarding secure video chat e.g. one on one group and the like. In embodiments the viewer facility may include an audio comment component such as to allow a user to input comments into the document through audio dictation to have the viewer facility play back the comments in audio to provide audio output for various aspects of the document and the like.

In embodiments the viewer may be able to detect faces and enhance security based on face detection such as through utilization of a camera connected to or integrated with the computing device being used to view content. The viewer may also utilize a secure view such as where only a portion of a document is made viewable by the person viewing the document. Secure view may implement security measures e.g. blanking the screen distorting the screen putting up a screen based on eye motion movement of the face the presence of a second face and the like. Viewing time may be monitored and reported audited and the like based on how long the user s face has looked at the document where the monitoring reporting auditing and the like may be provided automatically. Reports of viewing time may be developed as a result of the viewing monitoring such as reporting of page based timing during the viewing of a document. In this instance every page may be tracked. But many more details from the monitoring may also be reported such as whether the person closed the browser whether a person is looking at the screen looking away from the screen or walking away from the computer Internet connection status and or computer configuration status e.g. computer going into sleep mode initiation of a screen saver folding up of the computer presentation of other content on another open window of the screen e.g. entertainment content playing of audio content via the audio system of a computer e.g. if the user is listening to music and the like. The system may take this information and develop a mapping of or report on the person s viewing actions and behaviors with respect to pages of content.

Document encryption and decryption may be provided based on document permissions. For instance if the document can only be opened by a specific number of people face detection may use the author or any other permissioned user s face to encrypt the document and require the same face to be detected to allow un locking of the document. Encryption of the face may then be recorded and used as an electronic signature thereby tying the face to the user s profile. Recording of viewing time may be on a document level on a per page basis and the like. For instance a computing device being used for viewing a document may have a camera that views and detects the surrounding environment to determine how many people are currently viewing the screen and if a condition exists where there is not only one person viewing the screen the screen may obfuscate the document being viewed such as blurring blanking screening and the like. For example if the computer device detects that no one is viewing or multiple people are viewing the screen the screen may blank out the document. In another instance the computing device may utilize a camera to match the face of the person viewing the screen with a stored image of the person that is authorized to access and view and if the match is made permitting the process of access and viewing to proceed. In another instance a biometric match may be required to permit the process of viewing to proceed such as through the use of a match to an iris as viewed through a camera an e fingerprint through a fingerprint pad for input to the computing device or any other biometric verification method known to the art. In embodiments conditions for enabling an access and viewing process to proceed may be stored in a user profile where if the conditions e.g. number of people viewing authorization matching though images and or biometrics are not met the document may be obfuscated or access denied.

In embodiments viewing statistics may be mined for business intelligence by sellers in a strategic transaction such as through a CIO with an enterprise a marketing analyst or any such user who may benefit from knowing with content is being read and what content is not being read.

In embodiments the viewer may provide a search facility to search within a document. The system may allow for highlighting a search result highlighting a selected portion of the document and the like. The system may provide facilities for annotating marking commenting and the like to a document such as a private annotation for the user a shared annotation for other users and the like. The system may provide for a secure document view where only some portions of the document are viewable. For instance a user may only want to show another user a selected portion of a document. The secure document view may also allow a user to increase the size of the document view window which may better ensure that people proximate to you only see the relevant portions of the document. Another feature of the secure document view may include distorting those portions of the document that are not selected for viewing such as making those sections fuzzy. The secure document view may react to the eye movement of the user such as scrolling the document as the user s eye gaze direction shifts distorting or blocking the document from view if the user looks away from the viewer and the like.

The viewing facility may have capabilities for dealing with certain document formats in a standard way. For instance the system may automatically convert Microsoft Word and PowerPoint documents to a PDF format open spreadsheets e.g. Microsoft Excel in a spreadsheet viewer and the like. For instance when an Excel document is opened it may be rendered on the fly decrypted on the fly as a user scrolls down retrieved from the server and encrypted on the fly and the like.

A viewing facility may be provided such as for use in a spreadsheet word processor and the like. As applied to a spreadsheet document the viewing facility may provide features and tools such as a toolbar a page sheet count a document search box a spotlight interface and a scrollbar. The viewing facility may also provide a search function and sample results and include a search window a search results window various ways that the results may be grouped by page worksheet name a search term highlighted and a displayed message such as if some search results are displayed before the entire document search is complete. A spotlight function may be provided where only a portion of the document is viewable. A dialog box may be provided to be responsive to a user clicking on the print icon. Note that printing may be restricted as described herein where the dialog box may send an alert to the user identifying the restrictions. Various other features of the viewing facility can be provided with respect to a sample word processing document such as a toolbar a page sheet count a document search box a spotlight interface and a scrollbar. Various features of the viewer facility functions related to a print command may also be provided including a print icon a document window grayed out a print window printer options range of pages for print a cancel control button where if the user cancels the print the gray out function may be turned off and again reveal the document and a next control button to close the pre print window and open an operating system print dialog.

The control may be actualized through monitoring user hand gestures monitoring user eye movements through monitoring user head movements and the like. The control may be enabling the viewing of the content tuning a page in viewing the content inserting a signature into the content closing a viewing session for the content and the like.

In embodiments viewer based time reporting and viewer based tracking may be provided in an interactions playback facility to allow a user of the system to replay the interactions of other users with particular content associated with an exchange. In embodiments playback may be used to assist in review of user interactions in a transaction diligence process. In such an example a user s interaction with a viewed content may be played back to make it available in the context of a diligence process that involves review of content on an exchange. For instance if a user reads a contract the system may be able to replay the reading experience to show what the user did when the viewer was looking at the document. The replay may include a summary or report of statistics associated with viewing such as time spent on a page engagement in other activities during the review copying of material focusing on particular sub parts of content note taking related the content annotation of the content or the like. In embodiments rules of an exchange may be specified for particular content to require a user to enable content interactions playback. For example a user may be required to turn on the user s device camera so that the user can be viewed during the time in which the user engages with the content. Similarly a user may be required to allow the exchange to capture any text entered into the user s machine during the review of the content. Content playback may provide some insight and intelligence associated with the original interaction of a user with the document. For example if a user spent considerable time on a page of a contract this may provide an indication of concern with that page such as difficulty understanding the content or with a high degree of interest in the content. As another example if a user spent considerable time on a document containing a trade secret that may indicate a high likelihood that the user learned the trade secret in the course of the review.

In embodiments viewer time tracking information may be used to enable various analytic processes. For example tracking information may help a seller determine the interest level of a potential buyer such as in the development of a buyer interest index to aid sellers in deal evaluation. Based on viewing patterns a user may be able to utilize such a report or other analytic result to determine which buyer is most likely to buy such as in projecting a winner in a bidding process where the projection is based on a particular buyer s viewing history with respect to documents associated with the deal or other actions taken by a buyer with respect to an exchange e.g. the extent to which various individuals associated with a buyer engage with an exchange or sections of an exchange or a particular file . For example a user spending a great deal of time looking at a financial document might be an indication that the potential buyer is skeptical and not favoring an investment. On the other hand if the system determined a user was looking at content for less time and or not revisiting the content that might show they have no questions and be an indication that the potential buyer has a greater inclination to invest. Similarly if a buyer has engaged a large number of personnel widely across all of the information on an exchange this may be an indicator of strong interest as the user may be moving into the late stages of due diligence prior to making a bid. Over time observations about viewer behavior across various enterprises and prospective deals can be correlated with results such as comparing time spent by winning bidders on the exchange or on particular types of content to time spent by other bidders and time spent by parties that did not elect to bid. Time spent can be correlated with various results including winning bid information information about prices information about transactional costs e.g. determining what types of content appear to create the largest delays during the deal process or contribute to the greatest costs . If the system provides this intelligence to people on the sell side of a deal the seller may make use of the information in making the sale such as by providing clarifying information about areas of potential concern or initiating discussions over such areas.

The buyer interest index or other analytic measure of buyer activity may be developed based on what various users have done in past activity to provide a predictor of future interest. In embodiments the system may extrapolate the viewing behavior of users to develop analytical trends for behavior of the user or like users such as looking at data from viewing specific documents and making predictions about what a buyer who looks at particular content tends to do in subsequent actions.

Such an index may apply to a buyer organization as a whole or to particular individuals or roles within a buyer for example an interest index may apply specifically to a CFO of a buyer such that interest in financial documents is likely to be higher than interest in other items such as intellectual property disclosures. Determinations of similarity used for purposes of predicting interest may compare various attributes including organizational size organizational type or industrial classification category transaction type past history of deal making and the like at the enterprise level and may also be based at the individual or role level involving comparison of attributes relating to the individual or role including past activity history e.g. tracking that the individual tends to explore the balance sheet and profit and loss statement first level in the organization tenure with an organization past employment history and many others. Similarity may be determined based on rules e.g. those with the same role or title are treated as the same or by attribute weighting or distance calculations such as used in various fields to cluster groups based on multiple attributes. The system may assign various scores or metrics to users based on these analytics at the entity or individual level thus providing a seller or a buyer with insight into the potential for an investment a purchase or other transaction. On the buy side of a deal tracking of behavior of the seller may provide insight into various topics such as a high level of seller activity indicating that a buyer is taking a bid seriously and a low level of activity suggesting the opposite. Again for both buyers and sellers correlations of activity with actual market results over time can suggest which of these insights are most robust and various hypotheses can be tested in an analytic environment that collects data regarding entity and individual viewing activity across various transactions for various enterprises collects data regarding transactions themselves e.g. price timing bidding history and the like and allows analysis e.g. correlation of various types on the data sets. In embodiments transaction data can be cleaned to remove identifying information for a specific individual for a specific entity and or for a specific transaction including by aggregating data across many transactions so that analytic results relating to the impact of viewing activity can be understood over many transactions without revealing confidential data relating to any particular transaction individual or enterprise.

Referring to the mobile device interface facility may provide for facilities such that a mobile device can be used while maintaining the secure exchange environment provided by the host server as described herein such as for a tablet e.g. an iPad a smart phone and the like where for instance the mobile device is provided functionality provided through the e signing facility the viewer facility and the like. Facilities normally provided through the host server as shown in may be provided in part or whole on the mobile device such that the mobile device may be utilized when the mobile device does not have connectivity with the host server . For instance the user may be able to login to the same interface as when they are working through a non mobile computer such as on their personal computer and see their list of exchanges all of their documents all of their contacts and the like. Using an iPad as an example all of the user s documents may be encrypted when sent to the iPad and decrypted for viewing such that none of the information is decrypted and stored on the iPad. A user may not be able to print or save from the mobile device and be provided with a secure document viewer as described herein such as partial viewing eye gaze motion control watermarking and the like.

A mobile device viewing interface may include various configurations such as public vs. private exchange views where certain exchanges are visible as restricted by public private declarations more exchanges are viewed when all exchanges are able to be viewed and certain other exchanges are viewable with viewing only mobile exchanges. Various functions can be provided for accessing exchanges folders files and the like. For example a message may be displayed if a user attempts to access an exchange or entity without the required declaration. Public vs. private document views may be displayed. Document classification may be provided where a document control button may be provided for uploading an appropriation may be specified and the like. Public and private users and groups may be specified. Document access reports may be generated. File uploads may be made to various exchanges.

In embodiments a secure viewing application for a mobile device may be provided to provide secure viewing such as for a tablet e.g. an iPad a smart phone or a mobile computer. In various embodiments disclosed herein the user of a mobile device may be an employee or other individual associated with a business entity. In embodiments users may include employees or individuals associated with business entities that place documents on secure data exchanges as well as employees or individuals associated with separate business entities that retrieve documents from secure data exchanges or view or consume documents on data exchanges. The entities in each case may further be separate from an intermediate business entity that hosts one or more secure data exchanges. The user of the mobile device may be able to login to the secure viewing application such as when the user is working through a mobile device to see a list of exchanges all of the user s exchange related documents all of the user s exchange related contacts or other information where the application may be resident on the mobile device. In embodiments the user may be able to login to the secure viewing application whether or not the mobile device is connected to an exchange while in other embodiments some or all features of the application may be limited to situations where a connection to an exchange is maintained or to situations in which the application has been connected to an exchange within a certain time period prior to using the secure viewing application. The secure viewing application may require the user to enter a personal identification number PIN password or other indication of authentication optionally including biometric authentication indicators in order to access the application.

A user may be able to mark a document as a favorite by accessing the document from a mobile device a personal computer a web portal an exchange or the like. The secure viewing application may allow a user to view a list of documents that have been marked as favorites. The user may be able to select an individual document from the list and view the document on the mobile device. The secure viewing application may track which documents and versions thereof have been selected and when the documents or versions thereof have been viewed by users. The secure viewing application may track versions of documents including when each document version has been viewed by a user whether or not the secure viewing application is connected to an exchange during viewing such as by storing relevant data on viewing on the mobile device for delivery to or retrieval by an exchange when the mobile device is connected or by sending viewing information at the time of viewing from the mobile device to the relevant exchange. The secure viewing application may communicate the tracked information to an exchange. The tracked information may be communicated to an exchange immediately if the mobile device is connected to an exchange. If the device is not currently connected to an exchange the tracked information may be communicated to an exchange when the secure viewing application later becomes connected to an exchange. A document may be made available by an exchange to be marked as a favorite by a user. A document may be protected by an exchange to prevent a user from marking it as a favorite for downloading and the like. A protected document may be restricted from off line viewing may be restricted from being screen printed may be restricted to viewing only by authorized personnel and the like.

Authorization for viewing may be provided by various methods such as via face recognition using an integrated camera or some other type of biometric sensing location based services network connectivity and the like. As described herein an integrated camera may be used to detect the authorized user s face the authorized user s iris the presence of other people in the camera s field of view and the like and when detecting the presence of an unauthorized individual place restrictions on viewing such as described herein. An integrated camera may be used in conjunction with a view restricting layer such as a physical sheet over the display of the mobile device such as privacy screen e.g. a polarizing filter preventing viewing outside a restricted angle of view or by manipulation of the display to make off angle viewing more difficult. In this way the integrated camera is preconfigured to see any individual that is able to view the device screen within the restricted angle of view of the privacy screen. Location based services may be used to restrict viewing by enabling or disabling a user s authorization for viewing based on the user s geographic location. For instance the user may not be authorized to view a particular document in certain counties outside their home country outside a small geographic area around an office of an enterprise around the user s home on a known transportation route e.g. a plane flight on which the user has a reservation and the like. A user s authorization for viewing may be determined at least in part on the network connectivity of the mobile device such as with the enterprise network a trusted network a WiFi network and the like. For instance a user may not be authorized to download a secure document through a cellular network such as when they are not connected to a WiFi or wired network connection. The authorization for viewing may be a combination of these and other related parameters where the restriction based parameters and settings are controlled through a system administrator such as stored in a user profile determined by a policy and the like.

If a user is connected to an exchange through an authorized network connection a user may mark the document as a favorite and the document may then be downloaded to and stored securely on the mobile device of the user such as being encrypted and or provided with an unconventional dedicated file format that is accessible only by the secure mobile application. If a mobile device is not connected to an exchange or if the connection from the mobile device does not have sufficient bandwidth to download the document from an exchange a document that has been marked as a favorite by the user may be tagged as a favorite by the user and then later downloaded to and stored securely on the mobile device of the user when the user becomes connected to the exchange and the connection has sufficient bandwidth. The postponed download may happen automatically or it may happen after the user later initiates the download or confirms that the download is still desired. The secure viewing application may alert the user that the download is taking place provide the user with a download progress indicator or download the file in the background without alerting the user.

The document may be downloaded over a secure connection between the exchange and the secure viewing application. The document may be stored in a secure location that may be accessed only by the secure viewing application an encrypted memory location or an otherwise secured memory location. The encryption used may be any encryption scheme known to one skilled in the art such as AES 128 encryption AES 192 encryption AES 256 encryption and the like.

A document may be constrained on an exchange such that it may only be accessed through the secure viewing application or access may be allowed through any application that is compatible with the format of the document. In embodiments the document may be accessed by the secure viewing application whether or not the user is connected to an exchange. A setting may be provided which may be selected by an administrator to allow the administrator to restrict how or when a document can be accessed. For example a setting may allow a document only to be accessed by the secure viewing application. Another setting may allow a document to be accessed by both the secure viewing application and any other application that is compatible with the format of the document. In embodiments the setting may be configured by the administrator of an exchange such as working within an intermediate business entity or working for an entity that places documents on an exchange. The setting may be selected for an individual document a document folder or a group of documents. A document that is made available to be accessed by any application that is compatible with the document may be edited by another application and saved back to an exchange through the secure offline mobile application.

An exchange may verify changes to documents through indicators of modification or modification stamps on the documents that have been marked as favorites by a user. Such indicators may indicate when changes have been made to items accessed through an exchange so that a determination can be made whether any modification has occurred to a document file etc. between the time the user last connected to the exchange. Modification stamps may take the form of metadata stored in or associated with a document file etc. a tag or similar facility for tracking status or state information. An exchange may verify the modification stamps on the documents that have been marked as favorites by a user when the user connects to an exchange and logs into the secure viewing application. A document may be deleted from the mobile device if its modification stamps indicate that the version of the document on the mobile device is not the current version. A document may be marked as being out of date when a user logs into the secure viewing application if it is not the most current version of the document. In embodiments the out of date document may be visible to the user. The out of date document may include an indicator to communicate to the user that the document is not the current version of the document. Access may be denied to an out of date document. The current version of the document may be downloaded. Download of the current version may happen automatically or upon user request or upon a confirmative response to an offer for the current version. The user may immediately download the current version at the time the user selects the document for viewing. The download may take place whether or not the user is logged into the secure viewing application. A visual indication may alert the user that a document is being downloaded. The user may not be able to access a document if the download of the most recent version of the document is not completed before the user disconnects from an exchange.

A secure viewing application may be provided and may include a screen asking a user to setup a PIN a screen that prompts a user to enter a PIN and a screen that is used by a user to select a setting. The application may provide a list of various documents that have been selected as favorites by a user connected to the exchange as well as other documents that are selected by a user and loaded for viewing. A screen of the secure viewing application may allow a user to select a document as a favorite when the mobile device is connected to an exchange. A screen of the secure viewing application may allow a user to select a document that is made available through the secure viewing application and is available to be opened in a different application. Various documents may be made available for a user to view when a mobile device is not connected to an exchange and the mobile device includes a secure viewing application.

The secure offline mobile viewing application may be employed when a user desires to access a document especially one that is subject to frequent revision when there is no connection between the mobile device and the exchange The secure offline mobile viewing application may also be used in situations when a document is subject to a corporate policy which requires access to only the current version of a document. The secure offline mobile viewing application helps to ensure compliance with corporate policies that require prevention of access to superseded document versions and may be used as proof that the user accessed the current version of the document. The secure offline mobile viewing application also permits users to collaborate on documents with other users through an exchange when the documents are not subject to any corporate compliance requirements with regard to version accessibility.

Current methods for sharing computer files are not adequately secure in that a user may make errors in sending information such as with a single errant click and send sensitive information into the wrong hands with no way to recover the sent materials. Alternately sensitive information may be provided to a trusted associate that subsequently leaves a company or department to a vendor where the user s company subsequently switches vendors to someone outside the company that is subsequently identified as a risk to the spread of sensitive information and the like where the sender would like to revoke access to the shared content. The present invention may provide for methods and systems for securely sharing content e.g. computer data content such as documents presentations spreadsheets emails blog entries texts calendar notes meetings social media messages browser history bookmarks and the like that allows for un sharing of content that has been previously shared. The facility to un share content may be implemented through the content being associated with a secure protection feature such as through digital rights management DRM encryption permissions and the like. In embodiments each content item may shared with the protection feature where the protection feature specifies a user or group of users that are authorized to access the content for viewing. Then when the content is shared with that user access to the content may be revoked at any time e.g. by changing the DRM removing access to the key changing permissions and the like . Further if the sender of the content controls the protection feature then the sender has complete lifetime control of any content they distribute or provide access to.

The secure un sharing facility may be used to securely share content beyond the secure protective facilities of their enterprise e.g. allowing secure sharing beyond the firewall of the sender s enterprise out to users in other companies into the public space to users not intended to get the content and the like where the sender maintains complete control to access of the content no matter where or to who the content has been distributed. In this way the secure sharing of content is made to be easy across corporate boundaries at the user level and at the individual content level e.g. at the level of an individual document . Further the process allows a user wishing to unshare content to be discrete in its execution allowing the sender to revoke access without having to contact or to track down the recipients who may not have any indication sent to them that access has been revoked. With the unsharing facility the content simple stops being accessible. And the revoking of access may be for not only the original content but for all instances of the content such as copies stored on various devices and computer environments e.g. stored on desktop computer tablet mobile smart phone in an application through a web browser and the like copies sent to third parties and the like. And since the protection feature may apply to all versions that have been modified e.g. edited versions redline versions commented versions signed versions and the like access to modified versions of the content may also be revoked when the access to the original content is revoked.

In embodiments access to a shared content may require an access authentication to a secure facility such as the secure exchange server. That is even if content has been shared with a user the user may only be able to view the content if their access is authenticated. Authentication may be a manual login to verify that the user attempting access to the document is a user that is listed to have access to the content. Alternately a user that has access may establish a computer device that is tied to their personal authentication such as through the secure facility. For instance an authorized user may associate their personal authorization to their portable computing device e.g. tablet smart phone such as where the portable computing device has a password to access the device thus ensuring that the person requesting the access from the mobile device is the authorized user.

In embodiments the security process that protects the content such as a document to be uploaded and shared may incorporate a plurality of protective steps. For example when a document is uploaded a virus scan may be run permissions may be established a search index may be created digital protection may be applied the document may be converted e.g. formatted the document may be encrypted and the like where encryption may be applied individually to each new content such as through a randomly generated encryption key. When a download of the document is requested such as when an authorized user is downloading as part of the document being shared a random key with a key ID may be generated for that particular document where the document is encrypted with the random key. A master key may be split between a database and a file system where the encrypted random key and random key ID are stored in the database and the random key may be encrypted with the master key and the like. Permissions virus scan watermark digital protection and the like may then be applied before delivery of the document.

In embodiments the un sharing facility may enable the control of access down to the individual content level such as with the creation of a new document which may be part of or be the start of a collaborative social work stream allowing users to share content and then initiate and perpetuate conversations and interactions around those contents. Social work streams may support discussion threads activity streams and other common social interaction facilities which may utilize the content as the organizing basis. The process of un sharing a content may result from removal of the content from the work stream retiring the work stream removing the individual content entirely and the like.

The present disclosure describes a secure content sharing and productivity solution for organizations to share confidential and non confidential content between and amongst enterprises over a global communication network such as the Internet including outside enterprise firewalls. The present disclosure may provide a secure content sharing and collaboration environment that goes beyond the enterprise firewall establishing a seamless dual use user workflow environment that accommodates both secure and personal exchange of content without the need for the user to adopt substantially new workflow process and applications providing secure interfaces for viewing documents using mobile computing devices such as touch interface tablets e.g. including the incorporation of personal user devices and the like.

The need for beyond the firewall content sharing space has been created by the confluence of technology evolution e.g. cloud computing and virtualization portable form factor innovation big data BI tools organizational shifts e.g. rapidly growing cross enterprise collaboration global fragmentation of enterprise cross functional teams demographics shifts changes in the role of integration technology e.g. cost and complexity reduction pressure for measureable business value computerization of enterprise IT and bring your own device government and regulatory issues e.g. increasing regulations cyber security threats and the like that collectively increase the importance of easy and secure collaboration of documents and content beyond the enterprise firewall. Other solutions have taken a variety of approaches to address fragments of these requirements but important unmet needs remain for information technology directors business leaders and users remain including in the areas of integration of security control ease of use seamless operation across different ways of sharing and the like.

In embodiments the system may include methods and systems for providing a single fabric to enhance the most common forms of beyond the firewall content sharing improving individual and team productivity across the extended enterprise while providing unified security and compliance for IT and business leaders allow users to continue beyond the firewall sharing however they prefer with a single user interface enhancing the security and productivity of e mail sync and share folders externalized enterprise content management and enterprise social collaboration tools integrate with consumer focused sync and share services where possible to enable their secure and compliant use within the enterprise enhance forms of collaboration to which users are already accustomed and not require adoption of a new way of working or collaboration destination target the unique collaboration and sharing requirements of the extended enterprise and complement other enterprise systems and the like.

In embodiments a need for a comprehensive sharing system may include an ease of use and intuitive user interface with granular security permissions to help ensure that unauthorized individuals can t open documents ability to control content post sharing e.g. the ability to pull back a document enabling a user to recover and destroy data remotely such as in using a virtual data room productivity tools integrated with content sharing consolidating a plurality of user log ins and passwords the ability to integrate with existing infrastructure to eliminate the need for a plurality of sharing tools providing multiple channels for collaboration in order to integrate the methods and systems into as many productivity platforms as possible and the like. For instance with a single user action within the user interface the user may be able to revoke access to a shared file or resource regardless of where the file or resource is stored thus providing an enterprise workforce the freedom to share as well as the ability to un share. In addition reporting of actions may include audit trail facilities such as at the gateway level and governance including policies embedded in workflows. Collaboration may be provided with significantly reduced risk through tools provided by enterprise information technology personnel thus reducing the risk of employees sharing sensitive documents outside the firewall e.g. through email USB transfers FTP through third party services web cloud file sharing and the like . Security may provide additional protection such as through IRM encryption and the like. The sharing facilities may include sync and share functionality workflow tools business intelligence and the like and provide greater secure connectivity and productivity improving the workflow in association with customers suppliers partners professional service organizations business prospects and the like. Thus methods and systems disclosed herein may include client and server side as well as cloud deployed components for managing access to resources including based on policies associated with such resources as well as such components for tracking reporting and managing access to resources such as to keep consistent synchronized versions of such resources across multiple access devices.

Referring to the present disclosure describes an exchange content access facility content access management facility as in in association with the secure exchange server that improves the security with which a plurality of users collaborate freely including through a plurality of different content sharing devices and facilities while providing lifetime control of their content. For example suppose a user sent quarterly sales data to an old accounting firm employee records to someone outside of HR the wrong contract to the wrong vendor. When a user un shares content access may be instantly revoked including any content that may have been from copies of the original content. In embodiments the user may have total lifetime control of each and every content item such as documents emails communications and the like. In embodiments the content may be stored and tracked in a secure database . Users may share and revoke access to content all the way down to the document level providing a secure place to upload files and share them across devices. In this way users may be provided a secure storage facility for company sensitive information where users are able to work more securely such as with their existing infrastructure e.g. seamless integration with applications like Microsoft Outlook SharePoint and the like . The un share facility may allow a user to create a new work stream securely upload the documents and work with teams that are enabled to securely collaborate. In addition the un sharing facility may provide for reports audits summaries and the like through a dashboard facility such as a summary view of all work streams customized security settings ability to add new participants provide automated reporting and the like. The exchange content access facility may utilize a user login data authentication facility to authenticate users access to content where there may be the option of having a single sign on in association with other user logins. In embodiments the login may utilize security hashing in a redirect URL such as to secure the login against Phishing attacks. The single sign in may extend to mobile devices including personal mobile devices were a lookup table may be used to verify that the user has single sign on capabilities or not.

In embodiments a method for managing a networked secure collaborative computer data exchange environment may be provided. The secure exchange server such as managed by an intermediate business entity may establish a user login data authentication procedure that allows a user to access the secure exchange server where the secure exchange server may store user login authentication data for each of the plurality of users such as in a secure database. Users may access the secure exchange server through a plurality of different computer devices applications communications channels and the like. The user may be one of a plurality of users that work for a plurality of other business entities e.g. users may be employees of the same business entity or users may be working for different business entities where the users of the other business entities communicate with the secure exchange server through a communications network such as a wide area network e.g. the Internet . To share a computer content item a first of the plurality of users may request a sharing access from the secure exchange server to a content item to at least a second of the plurality of users. Management for access to the content may be through an exchange content access facility managed by the intermediate business entity. After the exchange server receives the content from the first of the plurality of users it may grant sharing access to the content when the secure exchange server receives from the second of the plurality of users its client login authentication data provided that the second of the plurality of users is one of the subset of the plurality of users to which sharing access is permitted . The second of the plurality of users may then request a copy of the content from the secure exchange server wherein a copy of the content is made. Further the second of the plurality of users may further copy the content onto a plurality of different computing devices make changes revisions annotations and the like to a new version of the content send the content to other users send the content to people and computing devices beyond the boundaries of the business entities and the like. To un share the content the first of the plurality of users may then make a request to the secure exchange server to revoke sharing access to the content to the second of the plurality of users. As a result the secure exchange server revokes access by the second user to the content such as through encryption and DRM facilities described herein. Further this revocation of the second user s access to the content may similarly be applied to all instances of the content within the plurality of users wherein the revoking of sharing access to the content revokes access to all instances of the shared content and all copies of the content made by the plurality of users. In a similar fashion any individual that does not have authority to access the content may not have the ability to access any instance of the content. In embodiments copies of the content may be deleted from the secure data server wherein the deleting access to the copy of the content is revocation of digital rights management of the content. The digital rights management of the content may be controlled in part by the first of the plurality of users including revoking access to the content through changes in the digital rights management associated with the content. The content may be a secure encrypted content. Users may securely view the content through a secure viewing facility. Users may be connected to a public network that is outside of the firewall for the business entity that manages them. Users may access the content through a personal computing device that is not owned by the business entity that manages them such as through a personal computer personal mobile device and the like. Users through a dashboard facility may interface the exchange content access facility where the dashboard facility may provide reports showing activity related the sharing of content. The dashboard facility may be accessible through third party environments. The dashboard facility may track the location and version of the shared content on computing devices accessible by the at least second of the plurality of users.

In embodiments the system may provide for the ability to remotely delete content from a device while the device is off line or not connected to a network. This capability may be implemented by providing a lease to a desktop application when it starts up and has a successful logon such as configured by a policy through an administer console. When a device is powered up and a lease period is expired without a successful logon during the lease period the system may initiate a deletion of files such as would be the case if the device had been lost or stolen. This application may be a separate desktop service running on the device in the background e.g. sleep and awake in pre defined time intervals . When a device is powered up the application may record the values of a lease expiration date time of a previous successful login. In another instance the service may try to connect to a server and if it detects connection failures continuously past the lease expiration date and time it may assume that either the device no longer needs to run the application or it could be lost or stolen. In the case of the device that is subsequently found or re used the content may be re synced for the user once they login to the application successfully. There may be hard or soft leases implemented in the system. In the instance of a hard lease files may be deleted permanently on the local machine when the lease is expired. In a soft lease rather than deleting data the system may move the data to a random location on the disk where a user cannot find it. For example the system may modify the folder attribute for the data such as to S H . Setting those attributes will mark it as an important operating system file so that the operating system won t display the data even if settings allow the display of hidden files and folders. In embodiments the system may provide for automatically deleting documents whether the device is online or not based on a date time range. For instance setting a range of dates for the life of documents to be between on date time and another at which time all related documents and folders are deleted. The system may also delete documents folders desktop and the like after a predetermined number of login failure attempts where the system may provide access again upon restoration of access privileges.

In embodiments the system may provide for remotely deleting documents through a limited local access facility where the user may have access to a document folder and the like only through an encrypted local application. In this way files stay encrypted on a user machine and the only way to access them is to use the application that will decrypt the documents. The local application may also be embedded as described herein such as through a browser where a user may only be able to access documents with credentials that tie to the encryption key. The local application may be a viewer application where documents are distributed through a distribution engine but where the user can only view the documents using the viewer that would decrypt the document for viewing.

In embodiments the system may integrate the sharing capability with other third party environments such as including existing file sharing solutions e.g. Dropbox Google Drive Skydrive Box.com MediaFire SugarSync TitanFile YouSendlt SparkleShare Ubuntu One providing cloud storage file synchronization client software and the like. In addition to sharing resources the present invention may also provide a share option within other third party day to day workflow solutions such as desktop tools e.g. Microsoft Office iWork Google Docs OpenOffice and the like and enterprise tools enterprise DBs CRM tools analytical tools and the like where without departing the interface of the third party tool or application the present invention may allow content to be shared outside the enterprise with another party but with the secure data room and secure viewing features as described herein e.g. the ability to track access and viewing ability to have read only viewing and annotation secure viewing on a mobile device ability to pull back a document and the like. Further the present invention may be able to interface with templated secure sharing processes such as by having input events and output actions consist with those e.g. Outlook receives an email from a secure process and signals an action LinkedIn lets a user view and approve a corporate voting item .

In embodiments the system may enable an organization to maximize the value of content by balancing the freedom to share with the necessary control and monitoring provided by the system which extends the way an organization works such as by allowing them to share and access content wherever it is needed controlling and monitoring content wherever it goes coordinate work across people organizations and devices as a natural extension of familiar tools and experiences. The system may provide for a full service global facility as a partner wherever the user may go providing visibility and control of work centric content freedom to collaborate and the like. The system may provide a trusted standard for information security beyond the firewall providing automation and monitoring of corporate information policy extending a familiar user experience and existing infrastructure and the like. Collectively the methods and systems of the present invention may provide for an intent based sharing fabric for enabling comprehensive collaboration.

In embodiments the system may provide for improved connectivity security productivity and the like as related to a shared collaborative work environment. Productivity may include the ability to assign and manage document centric business actions e.g. e signature project task management and the like such as to provide more structured document sharing platforms e.g. more than just email which may be an ad hoc communication . Security may include role and file based permissions outside the firewall pullback of document permissions automatic document content and security classification and the like. Connectivity may include single secure connection to document sharing tools across devices secure access to internal ECM platform for external parties integration of enterprise class security into existing sync and share tools and the like such as to enable access anywhere the client needs it and the ability to make updates to documents easily regardless of where the user is located. The system may provide advanced analytical features to improve productivity such as audit compliance document versioning and tracking document contextualization historical performance analysis predictive analytics task productivity optimization and the like. The system may also include social collaborative features to improve interactions within projects such as improved communications within the workflow secure project management tablet based collaboration synchronous co editing social collaboration a social layer around business applications and the like.

In embodiments the system may provide for synchronization and sharing for the individual business professional including a plurality of channels e.g. Windows desktop client web browser Microsoft Outlook for Windows iOS support such as a native app for the iPhone and iPad features e.g. desktop file and folder synchronization secure file sharing from desktop browser and iOS push notifications collaborative discussion threads and commenting user self sign up for work with business intent e.g. sending a copy for download sharing access to a centrally located file for review administration e.g. canned activity audit reports such as for compliance canned accounting reports such as for billing centralized group policy such as for security defaults security e.g. with strong per file encryption and permissions browser based read only file access integrated file information rights management IRM and digital rights management DRM file access revocation mobile device security full compliance audit and the like. The term work with business intent may include the ability of users to share files with intent . For instance the intent may come in the form of document tasks that may be assigned to recipients where the system may let users send files for review send for signature send for annotation comment and the like. For instance the system may want to give users the ability to combine document tasks verbs into ad hoc workflows and save as a template which may also be referred to as a verb cluster. In an example if a manager has to get slides ready for a board of directors BOD meeting they may start up a BOD workflow that included several document tasks and individuals responsible. One employee may get a task to comment on the slide deck another gets a task to review and approve the material and the manager gets a task to sign the document for auditors after the first two tasks are completed.

In embodiments the system may provide for document collaboration and intent based work including a plurality of channels e.g. native Android iPhone and the like support plugins for Microsoft Office apps SharePoint Connector integration Mac Client such as file folder sync features e.g. desktop file and folder synchronization for Mac file sharing with intent such as for document centric work assignment and task management calendaring in document task completion collaborative editing and annotation in app publishing and collaboration such as check in out for work with business intent e.g. work items such as send for review and approval send for feedback and annotation request edits to a document send for electronic signature request form completion administration e.g. bulk user administration through active directory UI customization and branding report creation and scheduling security e.g. device registration data loss prevention filters such as reminders to users when they share files in a risky way remote device wipe and the like.

In embodiments the system may provide for enterprise integration and business process management including a plurality of channels e.g. published integration API third party app integration Outlook for Mac features e.g. work template creation team collaboration spaces milestone and project management in browser document editing for work with business intent e.g. work item customization such as combining document tasks to create lightweight ad hoc business processes administration e.g. user and administrator authored business process security e.g. data loss prevention such as blocking unsafe actions security information manager SIM and security event manager SEM integration customer managed encryption keys governance risk management and compliance GRC system integration and the like. For instance disclosed features e.g. an un sharing feature to pull back documents as described herein may be embedded into daily use tools such as into communications software e.g. Microsoft Outlook Gmail browsers e.g. Windows Explorer Firefox Safari Enterprise Resource Planning ERP applications legal systems collaboration systems and the like and to make it easily available and easy to use. All these systems have a need to distribute documents outside the enterprise firewall to users who are not logging into these systems on a daily basis and by embedding these capabilities enables users for secure sharing auditing compliance and the like for documents within user applications. In an example suppose sales personnel are building a quote for a customer in a third party application such as Salesforce.com for instance. Typically users would have the ability to email the quote directly or to download the document and email it where there is no audit or compliance within the third party application for these quotes. With the use of an embedded capability the document would be sent directly from the third party application with the system s secure sharing audit and compliance capabilities ability to pull back un sharing documents and would be available from within the third party application. The embedded service may have the standard components to make this service possible such as SSO authentication file viewer policy definition auditing device provisioning user profiles and compliance and the like where these would be built like a service and may be integrated directly into the standard enterprise applications. Security rules may also be implemented in the embedded system such as with a range of security e.g. ranging from public to highly secure screen capture and viewing protection device control auditing enforced and the like.

In embodiments a sharing process may utilize encryption to make the process of sharing documents files and the like more secure otherwise downloaded shared documents may reside unsecured on the destination system such as on a client device of the destination user. In embodiments a document may be provided for download only in an encrypted format and the exchange systems disclosed herein may provide a desktop tool such as a viewer that manages access to the encrypted items and tracks all actions taken by the destination user with respect to the encrypted item. The viewer may be provided for example via a web interface so that the shared viewed content and the like viewed in the viewer and the functionality for the viewer other than basic browser features resides on the host system or the system of the party providing the secured item. Thus the viewer or its functions may be controlled by the host or the party providing the secured item such as based on policies that apply to the destination user s access thus the shared document is secured by the control of the viewer. In embodiments un sharing is enabled by removing the ability of the destination user to decrypt the document at which point the document although downloaded becomes inaccessible. This may be accomplished for example by changing the encryption for the item removing the user s access rights to the viewer or initiating deletion of the secured item by the viewer. Un sharing may be triggered based on a policy based on time based factors e.g. access is provided for a limited time based on a requirement that the destination user re establish credentials to use the viewer and the like. In such embodiments a shared document may reside encrypted so that the existence of the document can be viewed on the destination user s system but the contents may be viewed only if a remotely controlled viewer or desktop application is there to allow the content to be viewed or played. Such methods and systems may be effective within an enterprise such as when a user brings the user s own device. By remotely controlling a viewer that is necessary to view a file files residing on such devices are more secure notwithstanding an enterprise s lack of control over the user s device.

In embodiments methods for a time delayed automatic file deletion facility may be provided that trigger the deletion of a file after a set period of time after the file e.g. any digital content moves beyond a pre defined boundary parameter such as a network boundary e.g. beyond a trusted network a geographic boundary e.g. a national boundary an enterprise boundary e.g. beyond the network s of an enterprise a device boundary e.g. the document is only allowed to be on a specified machine or machines a time boundary and the like. In an embodiment in order for the file to execute the automatic deletion the file may have a time delayed automatic file access policy embedded with the document. In an example a document may be encrypted and provided with a policy that determines under what boundary conditions a timer for file deletion is set and for what duration the timer may be set. Once the timer has elapsed a deletion function may be executed such as some form of encryption change encryption key holdback password change or holdback or the like making the document inaccessible and thus effectively deleted or the item may be simply deleted from the machine. In another example the document may not be permitted to leave a specified enterprise network and the timer may be set such as for one hour. If an employee leaves work with the file loaded on the employee s laptop one hour after the enterprise network connection is lost the document may be automatically deleted such as through a detection that the network connection has been lost and the timer has expired. However if the employee only lost network connection for thirty minutes the document would not be deleted. Under this condition the timer may be reset for another potential event. In another example the policy may declare that a new password encryption key or the like is to be sent to either the document itself or to the authorized access user every set period of time. In the event that the new password is not received such as because the document is now beyond the pre defined boundary the document would not receive the necessary means for unlocking the document and can no longer be opened and as such is effectively deleted though inaccessibility. In another example a permanently infected file may destroy itself when the set period of time elapses. This time delayed automatic file deletion process provides a composite protection scheme where 1 a digital content is protected from moving outside a pre defined boundary and 2 once outside the boundary access to the content is not immediately terminated but rather delayed by a period of time thus allowing the content to be temporarily outside the protective environment without the content being deleted made inaccessible and the like.

In embodiments a method may be provided that enables an authorized user to disable the time delayed automatic deletion of content where the authorized user is able to prevent the automatic deletion undo the deletion recover the content after deletion and the like where deletion may be a deletion a denying of access an encryption element changed or held back and the like. For example an authorized user may have access to a facility that enables the user to recover the content after it has been deleted such as through a recovery password recovery encryption key recovery application and the like. In this way a file would be secure if the boundary and time conditions have been violated but recoverable if the authorized user deems it secure or if the content is again within the secure boundary.

In embodiments a document that is shared may be marked with sharing information such as incorporated in the document s associated metadata so that the system is able to use this information to implement sharing limitations restrictions controls and the like. This information may change as the document undergoes access events such as viewing sharing signing copying revising and the like. In embodiments sharing information may also be visually presented through a watermarking facility such as in the form of a watermark on the document such as to indicate that document is confidential restricted public private and the like. The watermark may also indicate the conditions under which users may access and or view the document including restrictions on individuals applications enterprises geographic location and the like. The watermarking may be especially useful for viewing documents through a mobile device. For instance a watermark may include information related to the user that is viewing the document such as the user s name the date and time of viewing by the user and the like. Watermarking may also include any other access and or viewing limitations and actions for the document. For instance a watermark may indicate who and when users have viewed the document what users have signed the document what user created the document and the like. In embodiments information included in the watermark may be determined though a policy by the sender by the creator and the like.

In embodiments a question and answer management facility may be provided where a collaborative group of users may exchange questions and answers such as in a project and where at least one user may manage exchange through the question and answer management facility. For instance users may be buyers and sellers in a transaction where buyers ask questions and sellers answer questions. In another instance users may be customers and expert representatives of a product service deal and the like where customers are asking questions and the expert representatives are answering questions. Through the question and answer management facility the at least one user may then manage the exchange such as being identified as a question and answer coordinator . Alternately each user in the exchange may use the question and answer management facility to manage the exchange thus creating a dynamic collaborative question and answer environment. Management functions and features of the question and answer management facility may include the ability to trace questions and answer exchanges archive the history of a question and answer exchange and resolution provide the facility to import bulk questions into the exchange remove a question from the exchange once the question is answered match questions for answering to an individual or group of individuals based on a criteria or metadata extracted from the question and the like. A question and answer exchange may be provided a question status a delegation status and urgency indicator and the like and marked as proposed new in process closed FAQ and the like. Questions and answers may be sorted searched organized and the like based on a criterion such as by submission date status category a question ID keyword priority and the like. A user or coordinator may assign a question one or more criteria such as a level of priority e.g. high medium low which may aid experts to focus their attention on issues that are most important.

In an example suppose a group of individuals is engaged in an acquisition transaction where there are buyers and sellers where there are a number of buyers and sellers on each side of the potential transaction and where the buyers and sellers have different roles and expertise relative to the acquisition. A buyer may ask a question to the sellers. Through the question and answer management facility the question may be presented to the sellers where one seller addresses the question and after an exchange the question is resolved. The question and answer management facility may track the exchange archive the exchange remove the question from further discussion remove the question from a pending question queue as provided to buyers and or sellers such as though a dashboard interface and the like. Further the question may be matched to a particular buyer and or seller for answering and resolution such as based on a user expertise criteria associated with the user e.g. the user is identified as being legal finance technical and the like. The matching may also be determined through a facility of the question and answer management facility that uses characteristics or metadata associated with the question to match the question to an individual best suited to answer the question. For instance the question may contain a word string phrase and the like that matches a criteria of being a financial question and so the question is then directed to users on the other side of the exchange that represent finance. In embodiments once the question and answer exchange is resolved the question and answer management facility may mark the question as resolved remove the question from the exchange archive the exchange and the like.

In embodiments a user may import bulk questions and or answers into the exchange through the question and answer management facility. For instance a buyer and or seller in an exchange may have a set of frequently asked questions and or answers that are relevant to the exchange and import them into the exchange. In an example a buyer may have a standard set of questions for a seller such as where the standard set of questions have been developed over time. To facilitate this import the question and answer management facility may accept the bulk import in a plurality of formats and from a plurality of computer applications e.g. imported to the system from a Microsoft Excel workbook .

In embodiments the entrance of a user into an exchange may be as an authenticated access an un authenticated access a semi authenticated access and the like as described herein. For instance management of an exchange may require the user be authenticated as having the privileges to manage the exchange to view the exchange and the like but an unauthorized user may be able to insert a question into the exchange and receive an answer from within the exchange group but not have access to content within the exchange that requires authentication. In embodiments a question and or answer from an un authenticated user may show an indication of such to other users in the exchange.

In embodiments the question and or answer in an exchange may include links to further information regarding the question and or answer. For instance the question may request data and a link may be provided by the user answering the question to direct the user to the location of the data.

In embodiments the question and answer management facility may provide the ability to retract correct or redact questions and or answers as part of the exchange. For instance an answer may be provided by a user but later found to inaccurate. In this instance the answer may be optionally refracted or corrected. In embodiments users in the exchange may be informed when a retraction correction or redaction is executed.

In embodiments the question and answer management facility may be provided through a user dashboard interface to manage the question and answer environment such as to increase client usability provide operations e.g. delegate close withdraw answer change priority and the like in association with a question and answer exchange provide for a facility for importing and exporting content associated with a question and answer exchange manage priority e.g. including management voting questioning and the like the priority of a question provide filtering facilities for questions and answers ability to re open a closed question e.g. for changing the answer to reopen discussion to solicit additional answers alerts to questions and or answers being changed the ability for a respondent to save a draft answer prior to posting and the like.

In embodiments there may be scenarios where a coordinator does not have sufficient visibility in a question and answer session such as on the answering question side. In this instance a special coordinator may be assigned for a category. For example a CFO of a selling company might be acting as the coordinator on the selling side delegating out to various subject matter experts SME such as accounting sales contracts and the like. On the other side a buyer may want greater or more focused visibility such as an effective tax rate and the like. Ordinarily a coordinator would have to use standard communications channels to manage this delegation such as through emails. Now the CFO can assign it to any of their groups through a SME delegation or limited coordinator method. Thus the question and answer exchange may be improved such as for a particular category.

In embodiments a question and answer mobile facility may be provided for mobile devices to provide a user with question and answer facility capabilities while away from their computer such as when they have access to a smart phone tablet and the like. This mobile facility may provide for voice recognition for input text to speech for output text recognition such as with a scanner or the mobile device s integrated camera and the like. For example a user may take a photo with the user s camera have it captured and placed in the right place within an exchange with permissions and the like where the photo is of text an object for discussion and the like. In embodiments a user may add content to an exchange with a mobile device such as converting something to a question inside a question and answer session e.g. convert from the email . For example the user may start with a question and be able to directly convert that into a question on the question and answer session of an exchange. Then take the thread and start a work stream.

In embodiments a single sign on facility may be provided where users or organizations utilizing the system may be provided a private channel access to an exchange such as through a single sign on to the system with protected access. A Channel may provide a way to implement a private slice on the system such as though a portal that allows users to view only those exchanges explicitly permissioned to the Channel. For instance a Channel may be a list of allowable brands combined with an Identity Provider IdP . When a user is authenticated by that IdP that user may be considered to be in the associated Channel and his her view of permissioned ILP data may be restricted to that of the Channel. In this instance a Channel is essentially a virtual private instance of the system. In customer deployments where the system user interface is hosted by a third party this system may better ensure that there is no data leakage between separately permissioned exchange domains. Private Channels may ensure that a client s information is only viewed by their SSO users. Private Channels may provide a means for ensuring that users do not see information from other organizations while using SSO even if they are permissioned to other organizations exchanges. In an example if a user is logged into the system using Company A s SSO connection they will see exchanges and data only for Company A even though the user may have access to other organizations exchanges through other access privilege. This facility may support organizations that want to authenticate external users through SSO. For instance Life Sciences and Alternative Investments clients that maintain their own portal may want to authenticate their user community to using SSO. In another instance a Johns Hopkins doctor may be in drug trials with two different pharmaceutical companies and if the doctor accesses through the channel of the Company A s website then they only see Company A s information. This functionality is especially useful anywhere that a client wants to have a private portal in a multi tenant scenario.

In embodiments the system may provide for context based automatic on demand provisioning. For instance a client may create a web page where a user could enter credentials. When they create an account e.g. new employee the system may automatically provision an exchange for them where the employee logs in by their structure. The SSO may verify that the person has permission and automatically set up an account for that user where everyone from that organization would be treated as signed in to the organization. That is once logged in the user may go through the channel and access information without logging in again such as based on the context provided through the user the organization and the like. In embodiments the context may be provided through tagging the user to enable future sign ins. For example a company may want to provide an outside law firm to access certain data in an exchange and through contextual based provisioning the law firm may be tagged to not only allow them to access again without logging in but will be restricted to only the content the organization is provided through the private channel. Thus a user s access to certain information is restricted to the context of where they sign in.

In embodiments an un authenticated document exchange facility may be provided where exchange managers may be able to mark specific exchange participants who are permitted to skip the login process e.g. skipping steps requiring the providing of their user name and password when downloading documents such as from alerts. For instance when a permissioned user tries to access a document through a special document URL in an email alert the document will start to download without asking the user for further authentication. The special document URL may allow such access for each document for the specific exchange user for a period of time such as a week a month and the like from the moment that the alert was sent. The system may identify the users to whom the alert was sent where access reports may indicate that the particular user has viewed the document even though an authentication is not required. Each exchange participant that was marked to allow such access may have a visual indication in the user s list view to make it clear that they have a different type of access rights. This type of access may be specific to a given exchange and may not necessarily be transferrable between exchanges. This functionality may be especially useful for clients that are distributing content to individuals and organizations that access services very infrequently where these individuals constantly experience challenges logging in and using the service through lack of regular use and often experience forgetting the login and password. For instance an investment client may only send out content quarterly and have a desire to allow a subset of their investors to gain access to their statements without authentication. Instead of sending these investors documents via email the system could allow the fund administrators to send statements via this un authenticated service thus alleviating the need for the investors to remember a login and password. In embodiments the user may be provided a link to access the content where after optionally providing a confirmation of who the user is e.g. an email address the document can be downloaded. The use of this system may allow for targeting users to receive special document access e.g. through alerts email links and the like and tracking of their document access e.g. for legal and security review and the like. Users who are not required to log in may be identified by a special icon or identifier such as when managers view a user list. Document access reports may also be updated whenever the link is activated e.g. clicked and the access attributed to the user who was permissioned to use the document. Since access to content may be enabled and tracked through a URL link the system may then limit distribution by de permissioning a URL which makes that URL inactive . Since the user doesn t know the URL they can t obtain access if the URL is inactive.

The use of un authenticated access to content may have many applications. For instance an organization may want to provide publicly available information where the system of un authenticated access gives public users access to the document without permissions but allows the organization providing the information with a means of tracking the access to the information. For example an organization may want to make public a teaser such as with respect to an investment opportunity. The organization now is able to track the access to the information.

In embodiments the use of un authenticated access may enable an organization to send out access to information without pre populating a contacts list with secure access users. The organization may only need to have a list of email addresses to send the URL link to without the need for credentials from the user.

In embodiments the system may utilize a semi authentication process such as requiring the user to provide a personal ID PIN such as determined by the user or the organization providing the URL link.

In embodiments a synchronization facility may be provided for metadata based content synchronization where the system may be utilized to provide synchronization and sharing of content such as amongst the various computing devices of a single individual a group of individuals an enterprise and the like where synchronization may be selective such as a user selecting what files to synchronize what computing devices to synchronize which individuals may share through synchronizing and the like. The user may also set up rules by which synchronization is selected such as rules associated with location of a computing device e.g. not synchronizing when a computing device is not on a secure network in a foreign country and the like a version number of the document e.g. only synchronizing the most recent revision of a document and the like where the rule is based on metadata attached with the document. In embodiments documents may be geo tagged and through that geo tagging the synchronization process may determine whether to sync. A user may not only be able to identify a certain folder for synchronizing with a group of individuals but also that only the latest version of a document should be synchronized. In this way a user being added to the synchronization group would not have all the old versions of a document synchronized. This capability may help the user make decisions that can reduce workload during synchronization and free cycles for synchronizing more critical content. In embodiments synchronization may be contextual. For example a person may be added to a synchronization group based on information about the person you are adding and how that person relates to a topic a group an exchange a work stream and the like where the system tries to classify people and link them.

In embodiments many to many synchronization may be provided such as when a select number of users devices needs to be synchronized to a plurality of other users devices where the users devices may be a group of users devices that are a part of a workgroup work stream application email list and the like. Many to many synchronization may utilize rules to determine what content to synchronize who to include in the synchronization and the like where the synchronization may not be restricted to just multiple devices but to multiple systems based on the rules. For example a user receives an email in Outlook. If the user has already linked that email thread to a work stream that email should automatically go to the work stream. Or the user receives something in a work stream and the rules trigger synchronization. In another instance if the user deletes an email from Outlook based on the rules the deletion may not be synchronized such as because the user needs to keep the email in the work stream. In this way the user is able to do their work in email but have the work stream synchronized correctly based on the established rules.

In embodiments a file sharing activity facility may be provided to package up and archive the history of file sharing between individuals in an exchange. The archived file sharing may be stored in a similar process as that of emails and placed in an archive for future searching e.g. for litigation or e discovery requests . With the file sharing archive stored in a similar format as that of emails searching for sharing and searching for emails may be carried out together where the email and file searching archives appear to be or actually are a single searchable archive. This archive may also be sharable with other individuals within the exchange may be synchronized with other devices active with individuals in an exchange and the like. The archiving of sharing activity may be at an exchange level a user level a document level and the like. For instance a document level archive may include the document itself plus the whole history of the document e.g. viewing history who edited the document when the document was signed and the like so that when this new archived history is found such as in a search a single document may be retrieved describing both its content and its history.

In embodiments a collaboration management facility may be provided where in the course of a collaborative exchange users may have exchanged documents and communications shared content synchronized devices and the like where the collaboration management facility may be provided to manage the sharing of content and the retention sharing and persistence of shared content. For instance a user may want to remove all trace of the exchange once the exchange is ended. The user may want to control the amount of time a recipient may have or view a document after delivery. The user may want to control the ability to print forward view the document on various platforms on various devices with certain individuals and or organizations and the like. The collaboration management facility may include a document retention policy that determines the rules under which documents are retained. For example documents may be tagged with a document retention tag that deletes the document in a set number of days until a milestone event e.g. such as tied to a Gantt chart based on a criteria e.g. when a document is signed after the document has been viewed and the like. In an example a document offering a service or product may be tagged such that if the recipient of the offering declines the offer the document is deleted. Alternatively the document offering may be through a link and the link is disabled after the recipient declines the offer. The document may be tagged with a duration based permissioning such that the document will be deleted or a link disabled at the end of a window of time has closed. The document may be tagged for temporary viewing such as only viewable for a short duration of time when the document is viewed on a mobile device. For example a recipient may have different viewing and retention permissions for the same document dependent upon the device they are viewing the document on where they may have permission to view the document for a week on a computer but only for a few minutes on a mobile smart phone. Alternately it may be a link to the document that has a limited time for activation. This form of non persistent sharing may allow the user to share documents in a time sensitive manner without the concern that the document will be retained beyond the desired duration. For example a banker may distribute research to prospects. But the research is the property of the bank and the banker needs to control access to the research. One option may be for the banker to distribute the research through a URL link where the URL is tagged for access control through the retention policy. In embodiments the retention policy may also dictate retention within a group distribution providing different retention privileges to different recipients and track the viewing actions and execute viewing retention limitations for users within the distribution.

In embodiments a geo tagging facility may be provided where a document may be geo tagged such as to indicate where a document has been created sent from received edited viewed and the like. Geo tagging a document may include information that is appended to and travels with the document through distribution sharing modification and archiving. Geo tagging information may include geographical location information e.g. city state territory country region zip code latitude and longitude a business location e.g. company name company address business unit a network location e.g. secure network an enterprise network a public network a wireless network a storage location e.g. archive location thumb dive storage DVD and the like. In an example a document may be created by a user at Company A in San Francisco where the location information may include the company name and the city as well as other information such as time and date and user s name. The document may then be distributed to two other users in two different counties working with two different companies where this information may be appended to a geo history of the document e.g. as stored as metadata along with the document . Additional information may be appended to the document as it is edited redistributed and finally archived. The geo location information may be searched on such as during its life as an active document or while stored in archive. Geo tagging of data may better enable the discovery of the document s history and content therein such as for legal or e discovery searches.

In embodiments an input file optimization facility may be provided where rules and or intelligence on document actions increase efficiency with which tasks especially large tasks are executed. For instance when attempting to add a folder with a specific name it may check and open the folders tag check if a folder tag is already open and if the current open folder is different to the new folder then close the existing folder and open the new folder tag.

In embodiments an archive facility may be provided such as where there is a need for same day next day delivery of archives such as in a quick and efficient way to create HTML archives snap shots of exchanges without leaving any footprint on the exchange. In embodiments an API archive facility created through API calls may allow automation of the system that decreases delivery time as well as improving other key considerations for archives including reliability efficiency time to production scalability predictability simplicity of process support market needs audit compliance security compliance cost and the like. The tool also may have logic built in that allows the splitting of a single exchange into multiple volumes and splitting at a folder level or documents level. As well as pulling down HTML archives the tool may be modified from within the configuration file to only download meta data. Doing this may allow the tool to provide full meta data reports similar to back end database reports on folders and documents.

Features of the archive facility may include automated confirmation letter creation e.g. such as including e signature configurable viewpoint and naming structure e.g. by user ID email address exchange group composite group automated exchange freeze to create non permissioned groups archiving from frozen exchange to check a user s pre freeze role and impersonation against old inactive profile freeze letter creation and the like. illustrates an example archive process including authentication and impersonation of users metadata collection e.g. including reports such as permission reports folder reports document reports viewpoint reports and the like download and data processing and creation of archive .

The design of the archive facility may include a two part routine that will firstly quickly and efficiently impersonate a user and download all the documents and folders to which they have visibility. The second path may be to create a HTML file that is a representation of the exchange that the end user may navigate thorough to get to documents. Key functionality of the archive facility may include downloading user coverage for a selected user ability to impersonate any user within an exchange if logged in with a role of manager or a hidden manager minimal user interaction automated download procedures which may happen sequentially ability to split archive volumes based on a defined size specified process messaging relevant to a splitting process support of UTF 8 encoding of document and folder names debug mode for advanced logging and trouble shooting audit files for tracking activity e.g. user successful logins exchange ID of where to download from downloaded files warnings system errors ability to split a large exchange over n number of volumes based on size of the volumes splitting at a determined level e.g. document level folder lever downloading of questions and attached documents ability to freeze an exchange into several states e.g. cold freeze the phase of the exchange is placed into hold and all users that are not reviewers are changed to reviewers partial freeze the phase of the exchange is placed into preparation and all users that are not previewers or reviewers are changed to previewers warm freeze the phase of the exchange is placed into Open and then all users that are not previewers or reviewers are changed to previewers ability to un freeze an exchange and revert it back to a previous state e.g. in regard to exchange phase and user role and the like.

The functional structure of the archive facility may include a model a view a controller and the like. For instance the role of the model may be to make calls to the controllers which are the classes that hold all the controllers. The model may also provide a specific response that is parsed into the model object which may keep the controller layer response away from the view and controller local . Within the view the user may be able to enter their login credentials this may also be where files e.g. excel files are created and read in. There may be a status display that is updated with events. It also may be in the view that the user is able to see if the process has completed with any errors. There may be multiple controllers such as one for handling local events and a second within the combined layer that creates a web request. The local application may take user inputs and handle button events call the models within a combined layer contain the business logic to process the response from the combined layer model and the like. The combined layer may be able to execute commands and when a response is given it may be parsed into the models response objects.

The archive process may be designed to be run by a trained individual as opposed to a user in an exchange. The process may use a combination of public and private API calls. Actions relating to this tool may include login logout getting folders getting documents downloading documents downloading Q A attachments get all categories get all questions using smart folders get all workspace settings update workspace phase get user coverage report create group get group get all workspace groups and details get all workspace users and details add existing user to group and the like.

Secure Collaborative Content Fair Share Queuing Location Based File Access Multi Factor Authorization Configurable Password Client Archiving Client Key Hosting Facilities

In embodiments a secure collaborative content facility may be provided for the secure management of a plurality of secure documents resources communications workflows and the like among a plurality of users where secure documents communications and the like may contain or have associated therewith metadata content. In embodiments a one or more workflows may be created triggered modified or redirected based on the metadata. The workflows may include without limitation workflows that include steps that take place across multiple entities or enterprises such as work flows involve in inter enterprise negotiation collaboration or cooperation. Secure communications may include an email FTP USB transfer a secure third party document sharing facility and the like. The secure management may be for an information technology environment that is inside or outside an enterprise firewall for secure or public use through consumer grade or enterprise grade and the like. The trigger may be metadata content in association with a signature request for information request for collaboration communication with a new contact and the like. For example an enterprise user working inside the enterprise firewall may receive a new contact from a prospective client where metadata in or associated with the communication triggers a new workflow for a new project. In another example a manager may provide a new project document to an associate where the new project document includes metadata that triggers the generation of a new workflow. In this way the secure collaborative content facility enables a more seamless process for generating or managing workflows from metadata content in an initiating exchange. Metadata may be stored for example as part of a document file of the like such as in one or more tags fields or headers. A host system of the type described throughout this disclosure in connection with creation and handling of secure information exchanges may define metadata types and associate the metadata types with one or more actions including actions that may be linked to workflows. Such a system may indicate locations for storing and retrieving metadata as well as rules pursuant to which metadata may be processed in connection with workflows. A metadata definition might correspond to any of a range of states features attributes events activities or actions that are typically stored or used in connection with an exchange such as user attributes e.g. linkage of users to enterprise work group or the like enterprise attributes department information and the like security attributes policies access rules storage attributes and the like. Thus a metadata definition may indicate how a user may via metadata stored in a file or other resource or stored in a separate location but linked to the file or other resource ensure the handling of the same by the system. For example a metadata definition may allow a resource to be designated as a particular type of resource with respect to which upon creation and inclusion of the metadata definition a work flow is automatically initiated that sends the document to a defined type of user within the entity for review and comment notifies another user of creation notifies another user of a requirement to create another resource notifies another user to hold in taking action or the like. Thus a single definition may set out or invoke stored rules by which a series of different actions or even set of multiple work flows may be initiated modified or stopped.

In embodiments a fair share queuing facility may be provided for the execution of processes described herein exchanges sharing collaboration and the like when jobs are required to be queued for processing through the system. Traditionally queuing is on a first come first serve basis but with large jobs such as with some processes described herein this may lower performance of the exchanges that are hosted. For example suppose a client 1 posts a job with 20 000 tasks into a queue. On a first come first serve basis the system would have to process all 20 000 tasks of this job before beginning the processing of a second job. This may be adequate if all jobs are large but if a small job is queued behind the large one undue degradation of system performance may result as related to a project for which the small job is associated. However queuing may be adjusted so as to queue jobs in an equitable manner through a dynamic share queuing facility allowing multiple clients to submit bulk requests to the same work queue to be processed in parallel. On such jobs only the first n messages out of N may be created and after that a bulk message containing N n messages is added at the end. Once n first messages are processed only then another n tasks get processed and another bulk message at the end with N n n tasks. In this example the system may take 5 tasks out of 20000 tasks and put them in a queue as separate messages and add a bulk message with 19995 tasks in it 20000 5 . Once the first 5 tasks are processed and the bulk message is picked up from the queue may the processor take another 5 tasks and put them back in a queue and add a bulk message of 19990 tasks at the end of the queue. In this instance if Client 2 comes in with a task it will have to wait no more than the time to complete 5 tasks. If Client 2 comes in with 20000 tasks tasks of Client 1 and Client 2 may be interspersed. This solution may work with multiple processors on the queue as well. Processing of bulk messages may be used to reorder execution priorities of tasks so every time bulk messages get processed the system may specify a rule as to how to determine what next n tasks should be converted into messages to be processed.

In embodiments a dynamic share queuing facility may be provided where multiple clients are able to submit bulk requests to the same work queue to be processed in parallel such as with the following steps a receiving a large job of N tasks wherein the job is categorized as a large job when N is greater than n predetermined maximum number of tasks permitted to be queued for processing in a single job b queuing the first n tasks out of the N tasks in the large job wherein the remaining N n tasks of the large job are stored in a holding queue c queuing a subsequent job based on the following criteria i if no subsequent job is received queue the next n tasks of the large job as taken from the holding queue ii if a subsequent job is received where the number of tasks in the second job is equal to or less than n categorize the subsequent job as a small job and queue all the tasks in the subsequent job iii if a subsequent job is received that is a second large job queue the first n tasks out of the N tasks in the second large job wherein the remaining N n tasks of the second large job are stored in a second holding queue and d continuing the steps in c for additional subsequent queuing wherein queuing of jobs for processing alternates between new jobs being received and jobs having remaining tasks stored in holding queues.

In embodiments a location based security facility may be provided for file or other resource access within a cloud based or server based file storage facility where permissions of the file determine access based on location such as the location of the device requesting the file or resource. Enterprises often want to limit access to sensitive data based on whether someone is physically present at a facility or location. In the past this has been achieved using physical security meaning the individual who needs access was required to be co located within the same premises as the entity that provides access. There have been no solutions to the problem other than physical security or network based security e.g. based on a person s Internet Protocol address and restricting access to data using a networked personal computer or mobile device. Virtual Private Networks have helped in this regard but they are still very restrictive when allowing access to individuals who do not belong to the same company as the source of the file or data. With the proliferation of devices that can determine the geographical location of a person using the device this job becomes much easier. The location based security facility applies geographical location based security to files accessed from a cloud or server based storage or service. In this system files may have attributes of geographical location and rights to view the file or save portions thereof may require the file to be accessed from a device where the location of the device can be determined and determined to be within range of a geographic location such as specified on or in relation to the file. Files may be stored in a cloud based or server based system from where they can be retrieved by a person who has rights to the said file. Within this system file attributes may be defined where these attributes may be part of the metadata associated with the file and therefore searchable. To these existing attributes spatial data location where the file can be accessed from may be added. The location may include geographical coordinates latitude and longitude a country a region a city an enterprise location and the like. The system may provide a way for an individual to add a file to the service with a desired location where the file can be accessed. The system may also provide a way for the individual to add a radius from the aforementioned location to the file attributes. Based on these two inputs location and radius the file attributes may now be updated. Once the file attributes are set they may be searchable and indexed via a geographical positioning data store. When an individual who has access to the file e.g. based on permissions in the service tries to access the file from a device e.g. any mobile computing device or a personal computer the service determines the location of the device. If there is no mechanism to obtain the location then the file access is not allowed. If there is a mechanism to obtain the location then the service compares the location to the location information associated with the file on the service. Once the comparison is done the determination of whether the file is accessible or not may be provided by the service using the stored location and radius attributes. If the individual can access the file then the right level of access is provided e.g. read write save print . If not the file is not provided. Multiple locations and radii may be defined per file such as several addresses and radii from those addresses where the file can be accessed.

In embodiments a multi factor authentication facility may be provided when access to the system includes multi factor authentication such as at login. Multi factor authentication may set authentication requirements beyond username and password to not only challenge questions but to risk based questioning and detection based on a user or device history such as location device type pattern of use and the like. This method may be used at login when moving between exchanges within the system on a per exchange basis and the like where preferences and or settings may set whether multi factor authentication is used and to what level of complexity. For example some work environments may require a mid risk level of complexity required for login while others may require a greater complexity for access. The system may require a level of complexity that looks at a plurality of channels such as different devices mobility vs. desktop use and the like.

In embodiments a configurable password facility may be provided for configurable passwords. For instance at the exchange level or the customer level a user may be able to determine what a password policy would be such as when it will expire what complexity is required and the like. A user may login and use their most stringent policy based on all the exchanges for which the user is a member. For example in one exchange a user might need a very secure password while others it would not so the user may use a password that is compliant to the more stringent of the two. The user may be able to use the greatest common denominator in password usage across multiple exchanges such as at the customer level at an individual exchange level and the like.

In embodiments a client archiving facility may be provided for archiving of content made to an internal archive storage facility within the system to at least one of plurality of customer server s to a third party storage center and the like. In the instance where content is being stored on a customer server or to a third party storage center the system may have the capability to pull back data in part or in total such as in a similar manner as that of a document sent to an individual may be pulled back. For instance in the case of a multi partner collaboration where multiple partners have elected to store data in their system as archive one partner may decide to drop out of the collaboration and the system may then pull back all the data previously archived on the partner s server. In another instance customers may want to take over an archive such as when an exchange is going to be closed where the content may be written from the system to the customer s server. In this instance the system may relinquish access to the content. In another instance there may be a hybrid archiving structure set up such as having a different archiving configuration on a per unit per organization and the like basis. The ability for a customer to archive content to their own servers may be enabled through an application API and the like. When archiving is transferred between entities such as when an archiving configuration is changed a chain of custody a history of ownership and the like may be maintained. Configurations may also be able to set a level of granularity for the archived content such as to a lower level of granularity when the content is in a dormant cold storage but in a higher level of granularity when the content is being actively accessed such as when an exchange is active.

In embodiments a client key hosting facility may be provided to enable users to host their own keys in association with access to content. For instance a client may want some form of extra protection such as ability immediately close off access to content a red button or kill switch of sorts so secure content will be shredded. To implement this the system may encrypt content with a key over which the client has control. The client may host the key such as creating an application web application that they host and completely control where this application can expose the key back to the system for the application. The client can then pull out the application so the system does not have the keys eliminating access to the content. There may be a plurality of different options for handling the keys such as the system having an application that the system provides to a client that deploys to a semi public cloud that the client hosts on their own that the system host it for the client have a red button or kill switch in the system s own application e.g. the system holds the keys but the keys are shred when the client hits the button the client has a master key for their exchange the client is able to download the key and get the material back but otherwise can shred the content and the like.

Referring to in embodiments an offline file access facility may provide offline file access to remotely stored files such as protected by information rights management via an encrypted key lease e.g. where a single key enables a single file access . Secure offline file access is a significant business problem. In the past providing offline access to files increased the risk of data loss or theft of intellectual property that could prove disastrous to a company. However providing convenient offline accessing of protected or secure files is also very important as individuals accessing files are not always connected to a network that allows them to do further work on the files while offline. Existing solutions are very limited such as only allowing for a date based file access where the date is set on the file or on a server. Existing solutions also do not provide for encrypted key stores such as protected by a personal password identification number and the like.

In embodiments files may be stored through the offline file access facility in a cloud based or server based system from where they can be retrieved by a user who has rights to the file. Within this system files may be protected by an information rights management mechanism. Retrieval of these files may be based on any of a plurality of public key exchange mechanisms available in the art e.g. Diffie Hellman . To view files generated keys are sent from the file access facility to the user wishing to view these files on a computing device. When a user who has access to the file e.g. based on permissions in the file access facility tries to access the file from a computing device e.g. any mobile computing device or a personal computer the offline file access facility determines whether offline access is allowed for such a file. If offline access is allowed e.g. access to the file on a user computer device while the computer device is not connected to the network one or more generated keys may be sent to the computing device for future use such as one key for each access. The number of times the files can be accessed at a later time without network connection such as determined by the number of keys provided may be set at the offline file access facility . This number may also be used in conjunction with an expiration date on the keys e.g. which may also be set at the file access facility to provide further constrained access to the file. Keys for file access may be handed out to the computing device when it is online to a user that has been authenticated and with permissions to download the encrypted file for offline access. Keys may be stored in an encrypted storage and a Personal Identification Number or a password selected such as by the owner of the device to protect the encrypted storage.

In a non limiting example and continuing to refer to a user may be online with a mobile computing device and make a request to download an encrypted file from a secure database associated with the offline file access facility . The user may provide a password to the offline file access facility in order to gain access to the file which may then be authenticated by the offline file access facility. Once authenticated permissions may be checked to determine if the user has permission to download the encrypted file for offline access. If so then the offline file access may download the encrypted file along with at least one of a plurality of encryption keys . Now when the user moves offline from the network the user is able access the encrypted file by using an encryption key that is stored on the mobile computing device along with the encrypted file. When the user moves back online with the network the offline file access facility may continue to synchronize keys and files such as stored in the secure database and on the mobile computing device as based on the usage of encryption keys and access to the encrypted file by the user while the mobile computing device was offline.

Additionally to access the encrypted file the user may need to provide a password to access the encrypted file to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the encrypted file with the encryption key. In the instance when one key provides a single access if the user was downloaded multiple encryption keys they may be able to access the file multiple times. Alternately a single encryption key may provide for multiple accesses such as determined by the offline file access facility at the time the encryption keys were downloaded to the mobile computing device.

In embodiments a method may be provided for secure offline computer content access comprising at a server based file access facility connected to a network and to a secure database storing a data file as an encrypted data file along with a plurality of encryption keys in the secure database each of the plurality of encryption keys providing access to the encrypted data file the encrypted data file accessible as downloaded to a mobile computing device that is not connected to the network only through use of at least one of the plurality of encryption keys and presentation of a user secure identifier from a user of the mobile computing device wherein the at least one of the plurality of encryption keys allows the user of the mobile computing device to access the encrypted data file a limited number of times receiving at the file access facility a request from the user of a mobile computing device for offline access to the data file when the mobile computing device is disconnected from the network the access request using the user secure identifier authenticating at the file access facility the user s permission for offline access to the data file while the mobile computing device is disconnected from the network and downloading upon authentication to the mobile computing device the encrypted data file along with the at least one of the plurality of encryption keys while the mobile computing device is connected to the file access facility through the network. In embodiments the encrypted data file stored on the mobile computing device may be assessed through the use of the at least one encryption key and the presentation of the user secure identifier by the user on the mobile computing device while the mobile computing device is disconnected from the network. The encrypted data file may be access controlled through digital rights management. The file access facility may be connected to the secure database across the network. The secure database may be a cloud computing storage facility. The mobile computing device may be a laptop computer a tablet computing device a mobile phone enabled computing device and the like. The secure identifier may be a password. Authenticating may be performed by utilizing the user secure identifier to check the user s permission profile for permission to access the data file offline. The permission profile may identify a number of offline accesses the user is permitted while disconnected from the network. The file access facility upon authentication and identifying the number of offline accesses the user may be permitted when disconnected from the network to download the encrypted file to the mobile computing facility along with at least one of a number of encryption keys equal to the number of accesses the user is permitted while disconnected from the network and an encryption key that can be used the number of times. A number N encryption keys may be downloaded to the mobile computing device such as where one of the number N encryption keys enables one access to the encrypted data file and after the one access the one of the number N encryption keys cannot be used for a subsequent access to the encrypted data file. The limited number of times the user is allowed to access the encrypted data file with the at least one of the plurality of encryption keys may be limited to one time. The plurality of encryption keys may be only valid for a certain time period.

In embodiments a server based spreadsheet viewer facility for rendering a spreadsheet document to a client computing device may be provided that enables the client computing device to view a spreadsheet document without the use of the spreadsheet s source application e.g. Microsoft Excel . Rather than opening the spreadsheet document directly with the spreadsheet application a client spreadsheet viewer on the client computing device may enable a user to view and interact with a viewable spreadsheet document that has been rendered by the server based spreadsheet viewer facility where the original spreadsheet document is stored with the server based spreadsheet viewer facility such as transmitted to the spreadsheet viewer facility by a first user trying to share the spreadsheet document with a second user by the second user who has been sent the spreadsheet document by the first user and the like.

In a non limiting example and referring to the user of a first client computing device may send the spreadsheet document to the server e.g. a secure server hosting the spreadsheet viewer facility along with a sharing invitation to the user of a second client computing device with permission to view the spreadsheet document. The second client computer may upon the user s request communicate with the spreadsheet viewer facility to render the spreadsheet document with a spreadsheet renderer to a client spreadsheet viewer on the second client computer . The spreadsheet renderer may then transmit spreadsheet document data to the client spreadsheet viewer for the initial rendering of the rendered spreadsheet document. The user of the second client computer may then interact with the rendered spreadsheet document where the client spreadsheet viewer transmits user actions e.g. keyboard and mouse actions to the spreadsheet viewer facility for interpretation and updating of the rendered spreadsheet.

In this way the rendering is an active rendering of the spreadsheet document where the spreadsheet renderer keeps updating the rendered spreadsheet document as presented to the user of the second client computing device through the client spreadsheet viewer . In embodiments the spreadsheet viewer facility may utilize a spreadsheet application such as located on the server or interfaced with remotely such as a software as a service type remote interface. The spreadsheet viewer facility may then utilize the spreadsheet application the spreadsheet document and the transmitted user actions to generate the rendered spreadsheet document data for transmission to the second client computing device . The client spreadsheet viewer may then transform the spreadsheet data to a viewable spreadsheet format and provide viewing capabilities to the viewable spreadsheet document on the second client computing device where viewing may include viewing spreadsheet cells associated cell formulas and the like and where the user may be able to also extract data as well as view the data.

In embodiments the client spreadsheet viewer may enable the user to take photos or screen shots of the viewed document such as part of an audit trail signature verification and the like. Because the client spreadsheet viewer is able to view content without the actual application present the client spreadsheet viewer may be able to provide these functions without a license to the spreadsheet application use. In embodiments the client spreadsheet viewer may be implemented through a browser interface on the second client computing device . In such embodiments server side processing and execution may run the application taking mouse clicks touches keyboard inputs and the like from the client computing device interface performing functions and rendering views back to the client spreadsheet viewer . Thus a user of the second client computing device may see calculations view formulas such as by mousing over a cell and manipulate data but the execution of such interaction takes place on a version of the spreadsheet application that is associated with the server such as behind a firewall in a secure data location. Among other things this capability allows users to temporarily access spreadsheet content while assuring the security of such content including making it more convenient to revoke access to content without leaving versions of an important spreadsheet.

Referring to in embodiments the first client computing device may send the original spreadsheet document directly to the second client computing device . In this instance the second client computing device may transmit the spreadsheet document to the spreadsheet viewer facility for rendering as described herein.

In embodiments a method for rending a spreadsheet document may be provided comprising providing on a server based computing device a spreadsheet viewer facility configured to render a spreadsheet document created by a spreadsheet application as an actively rendered spreadsheet document in a client spreadsheet viewer running on a client computing device without the use of the spreadsheet application running on the client computing device rendering the spreadsheet document as an actively rendered spreadsheet document from the spreadsheet viewer facility to the client spreadsheet viewer transmitting at least one keyboard and mouse action on the client computing device to the spreadsheet viewer facility wherein the at least one keyboard and mouse action is associated with a selection of a cell in the actively rendered spreadsheet document subsequent to the rendering of the spreadsheet document and transmitting a spreadsheet data content for the selection of the cell of the actively rendered spreadsheet document from the spreadsheet viewer facility to the client spreadsheet viewer. In embodiments the spreadsheet document may be received at the client computing device from a second client computing device where the second client computing device sends the spreadsheet document to the spreadsheet viewer facility for rendering. The spreadsheet document may be received at the server based computing device for rendering to the client computing device. The spreadsheet document may be disabled from being opened by the spreadsheet application running on the computing device. The spreadsheet viewer facility may provide permission for access to the spreadsheet document as an actively rendered spreadsheet document. The spreadsheet document may be disabled from being opened by the spreadsheet application of a software as a service application. The spreadsheet viewer facility may provide permission for access to the spreadsheet document as an actively rendered spreadsheet document. The spreadsheet application may be run directly on the server based computing device run remotely as a software as a service from a remote networked location and the like. The spreadsheet data content may be numeric data from the cell text data from the cell a formula associated with the cell and the like. The rendering of the spreadsheet document may transform a plurality of spreadsheet data comprising with the spreadsheet document into the actively rendered spreadsheet document. The transformation may be on a cell by cell basis and dependencies among cells are maintained in the transformation. The client spreadsheet viewer may be adapted to provide permission to copy the spreadsheet data content. The client spreadsheet viewer may be adapted to provide manipulation of the spreadsheet data content in the cell. The client spreadsheet viewer may be adapted to provide permission to take screen shots of the actively rendered spreadsheet document. The client spreadsheet viewer may run through a browser running on the client computer device.

In embodiments a virtual container digital rights management DRM facility may be provided that utilizes a virtual container environment e.g. virtual machine drive x partitioning to provide DRM control over content such as to provide a facility for editing but still blocking the ability to print save print screen and the like. Special plug ins to an application may be used for such purposes but although this configuration may still enable a user to read the content they may not be able to make updates or send it back to the originator. However through the use of a virtual container environment a proxy to the application system may be created that would mount an encrypted file such as a protected drive X item enabling the control and or prevention of operating system calls e.g. in the Windows O S the Win32 calls to save files access the network and print screen but allow applications to work with the content. For instance while the file is protected as a drive X item the application may work with the content while protecting the document. Formatting updating documents and the like may thus be allowed enabling the system to save it back encrypt it and the like enabling the document to be sent to the creator of the protected package allowing someone to edit a file even when they can t copy print and the like.

In this way the virtual container environment may control further dissemination of the document that a user is sharing by blocking the various operating system commands e.g. print print screen save send and the like that are the normal mechanisms by which a recipient of a sensitive document would save or disseminate a copy even though the recipient may only supposed to have temporary limited access. A plug in to an application that is being used to interact with the content can accomplish blocking the operating system calls but may do so mainly by creating read only versions. Often the original sender of the document wants feedback from the user such as edits or annotations which could be embodied in the document if the user were able to edit. The virtual container may be used to create a virtual drive encrypted version of the content e.g. document . The virtual container may allow applications e.g. office applications and editing applications to edit the content annotate the content and the like but where it can only be saved back to an encrypted form on the virtual container so that when a virtual container permission expires only the original sender has access to the edited version.

Referring to a non limiting example functional flow diagram depicts an embodiment process flow for a document being edited through the protective virtual container DRM facility . In this instance a first user utilizes the virtual container DRM facility to permit a second user to edit a protected document version of the document while protecting the document from saving copying printing print screen and the like functions as applied to the protected document . As depicted in this instance in a first step the first user may save the document as a protected document where the document is protected by being configured as or as part of a drive X storage location. The drive x may have drive x protections such as disallowing commands from an operating system from the second user saving the protected document to a location other than the drive X copying the protected document printing the protected document print screening while the protected document is being accessed and the like. In a second step permission may be set for the second user to edit the protected document such as for a period of time e.g. one day a week . Alternately permissions may be restricted to a number of accesses the second user is permitted such as limited to one access three accesses and like where the second user then has that many accesses to edit the protected document such as representing the number of editing cycles the first and second users have in editing the protected document . In a third step the second user may edit the protected document to create an edited protected document where the second user is restricted from anything but editing the protected document by way of the drive X protections . In a forth step the first user may view and optionally save the edited document where the first user may maintain all of the functions of saving copying printing print screen and the like that the second user is blocked through the drive X protections . In a fifth step the first user may remove permission for the second user to access the protected document or edited protected document thus eliminating all access to any version of the document that the second user may have been previously granted.

In embodiments a method for securely sharing documents among users within separate business entities may comprise providing a virtual container control facility on a computing device with an operating system and at least one virtual container where commands from the operating system for saving copying and printing of computer files are restricted for users other than unrestricted users storing by a first unrestricted user of a first business entity a computer file in the virtual container granting access permission by the first unrestricted user to view and edit the computer file by a restricted user of a second business entity and receiving editing of the computer file by the restricted user the editing creating an edited computer file within the virtual container that is accessible by the unrestricted user. In embodiments the first unrestricted user may save copy print print screen and the like the edited computer file by the first unrestricted user including any portion of the edited computer file. Access permission may be removed for the first unrestricted user to the computer file and the edited computer file. The data file may be encrypted with digital rights management protection. The virtual container may be a file location within a virtual machine configured to restrict the commands from the operating system. The virtual container may be a file location within a computer drive configured to restrict the commands from the operating system. Editing the computer file may be through a source application for the computer file where the source application is permitted to edit the computer file. The granted access permission may be for a limited time period. The granted access permission may be for a limited number of accesses to the data file. The granted access permission may be based on a role of the restricted user within a transaction process involving the first and second business entities.

In embodiments the offline file access facility the spreadsheet viewer facility and the virtual container DRM facility may be combined to provide a comprehensive method for secure viewing or editing of a document such as a spreadsheet where the spreadsheet viewer facility provides secure viewing and in some embodiments editing of a document when a client computing device is online and the offline file access facility and virtual container DRM facility provide secure viewing and in some embodiments editing of the document when the client computing device is offline. For example in order to provide secure access to a document the display of the document may be rendered from a secure server to the client computing device rather than downloading the document to the client computing device. Remote screen rendering may be enabled by protocols known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as the remote desktop protocol of the Windows operating system similar protocols in Linux operating systems or various server or software as a service based protocols for such rendering. Such protocols may allow not only viewing but editing of the document from the client computing device without having the document itself reside on the client computing device. In this way access to the underlying document and its file apart from the view currently being displayed e.g. a particular page or screen view of the document is controlled by the secure server. In embodiments the spreadsheet viewer facility may be used to render a plurality of different types of documents e.g. spreadsheets word processor documents presentation documents to a document viewer on the client computing device such as in conjunction with a web browser on the client computing device. However the rendering process described for such online access does not result in updating the rendered document on the client computing device when the client computing device is offline. For the offline case the secure server upon notification by a user of a connected client computing device that the user wants access to the document while offline may provide an encrypted version of the document along with a limited use encryption key. In that case the offline file access facility enables the client computing device to download the encrypted version of the document along with at least one limited use key. In this case the client computing device will have access to the underlying document file at least one a limited one time basis so that the file can be edited within the viewer. The viewer may thus include appropriate editing functions as well as viewing functions. The party wishing to share a document may wish to have the recipient user of the client computing device view and perhaps even edit a document but often it is desired to prevent further sharing of the document by the recipient. In order to prevent the user of the client computing device from printing saving sending or copying the document while it is stored on the client computing device the secure server may utilize the virtual container DRM facility to store the document in a virtual container on the client computing device the virtual container being adapted such that the document can only be edited or viewed within the viewer. The document is now secured whether the client computing device is connected or not to the secure server where user permissions may be separately controlled for online rendering of a document and for offline access to the document.

In embodiments a method for secure viewing of a document may comprising rendering from a networked server based computing device to a client computing device when the client computing device maintains an online connection to the networked server based computing device a document created by an application as an actively rendered document in a client document viewer running on the client computing device without the use of the application running on the client computing device and upon a request from the client computing device for offline viewing of the document storing on the networked server based computing device the document as an encrypted document along with a plurality of limited use encryption keys each of the plurality of limited use encryption keys providing access to the encrypted document a limited number of times the encrypted document accessible as downloaded to the client computing device that is not connected to the network only through use of at least one of the plurality of encryption keys within the limited number of permitted uses wherein when the encrypted document is downloaded to the client computing device the encrypted document is stored in a virtual container where commands from an operating system of the client computing device for saving copying and printing of computer files are restricted. Further a user of the client computing device may access the encrypted document stored in the virtual container through the use of the at least one of the plurality of encryption keys while the client computing device is disconnected from the network.

Email can be a convenient method for inviting an individual to view a resource such as a file on a secure data exchange. For instance an email may contain an embedded link or similar element allowing the recipient of the email to access a resource by clicking on the link and logging into the secure exchange environment. However emails may be stored for time periods that exceed the desired time for which access is intended to be permitted. This is particularly true across separate business entities where a transaction or other collaborative project may call for temporary sharing of information but once the need ceases access is no longer intended. For example in mergers and acquisitions transactions temporary access may be allowed to designated individuals of a prospective buyer to confidential resources that reflect the condition of a target seller in a due diligence process. This access needs to be revoked when the due diligence process ceases. In methods and systems disclosed herein an effective period may be specified for an email so that once the effective period ceases either based on expiration of time or based on triggering of a condition that ceases the effective period the email is no longer effective to access the resource on the secure data exchange.

Further complicating exchange of information across business entities over time is the presence of multiple email addresses for a single individual. An individual may have different roles reflected in different addresses e.g. personal and business or may have different email addresses associated with a single role e.g. bill companyx.com and William companyx.com . In embodiments an email effectivity facility may be provided in connection with the secure exchange environment disclosed herein where email addresses are linked to the identity of a user such as a designated individual who will receive email and the relationship of the email addresses to the user are tracked over time to provide a current association of email address to a designated individual. In embodiments once email addresses are linked to a person such as by a business entity associated with the person then the person may be allowed access to a resource from any current email address not just the email address to which a link or other access capability was initially sent. Similarly all email addresses of a user may be de commissioned and all email based links rendered ineffective if the role of the individual changes such as if the individual leaves the business entity that is the intended recipient of access rights.

Thus in embodiments access to data by a designated individual may be permitted based on the union of a emails or email accounts that are currently effective that is within their applicable effective period and b the set of resources for which any valid email address of that designated individual has been granted access. In such embodiments a user may readily access data relevant to multiple projects and resources without needing to track down the particular email that allowed the user access to a particular resource yet the individual is not allowed to access resources that have expired or to access resources in cases when the role of the individual has shifted resulting in a change in the identity of the user and the access permissions allowed for all emails associated with that user .

Once an identity has been established for a user that identity may be tracked over time as the individual moves from company to company eventually allowing a host to establish a comprehensive authoritative collection of identities and associated email addresses for a large number of individuals.

In embodiments the same email address may be used at different times for two different individuals in which case the methods and systems may include further information such as metadata for tracking the real individual that is associated with a particular address at a particular time. Different effective periods may be used to confirm which individual is allowed access to particular resources. A person may have multiple effectivity periods if they work at a company over two different periods of time e.g. hired January 2000 quit June 2005 then hired again in February 2008 and quit again in December 2012.

In embodiments the email effectivity facility may track identity and conditional access permissions over time for the different email addresses for the individual as they change roles as well as tracking the effective dates for those email addresses. The system may track the effective date that a particular email account was active and or inactive the effective date the email account was linked into the email effectivity facility and the like. The email effectivity facility may extend control of access beyond a user s current association with a business entity such as an individual having had different email addresses for the different companies the individual has worked for along with personal emails each with effectivity conditions. The email effectivity facility may provide an authoritative source of workspace identity tracking the plurality of email accounts and associated access conditions and keeping them associated with this one person and controlling access that this person has over time in association with each email.

The email effectivity facility may aid a user in managing a user s email identities over time where the user s identity shifts over time where an individual shifts between roles e.g. with respect to personal email and work email for example or shifting from one company to another . The system may associate a user s permissions for access editing and other features based on a correct interpretation of the current role. For instance an email sent to an individual with a link to content in a data room may have an effectivity date e.g. the individual s access is between time and time . That email and link may also be associated with a catalog of email addresses so that if the user leaves that role the link is no longer effective even if the user attempts to activate it within the originally permissioned time range. For instance the user leaving a role may be indicated in a catalog by de permissioning that email address by the user s employer or other sender of the email and perhaps also triggered by the appearance of a new email address with a different company domain that is for the same person. In embodiments the companies that granted the email account may validate the user s workspace identity and provide a historical access to the workspace identity. In embodiments effective dates and expiry dates may apply for permissions as well as for documents. For instance a user may set up a request for proposal and provide everyone access on an effective date of Mar. 1. The user then sets an expiry date for Mar. 7 at which point all permissions for access are terminated.

In embodiments effectivity conditions may be managed by a host such as an intermediate business entity in response to inputs from multiple distinct business entities. A past employer may allow the individual to receive emails but not to access any company data while a current employer may limit email access to time periods associated with specific roles or tasks delegated to an individual. Further a non employer such as a third party involved in a transaction with the company that employs the individual may set effectivity conditions on specific emails directed to the individual such as allowing temporary access to the third party s data in a secure exchange environment such as to enable collaboration or sharing between the third party and the individual s employer. Thus effectivity conditions for emails directed to an individual may be managed on a per account per sender per project or per employer basis among other factors by allowing employers the individual using the account email senders including third parties in different entities and an intermediate host of an exchange environment to set and manage such effectivity conditions.

Referring to in embodiments an email effectivity facility may be provided for managing access conditions to resources in a secure exchange environment where access to the resources is provided through email. In embodiments methods and systems may use the email effectivity facility to allow a user of a first business entity to manage access by specifying conditions for email based access to at least one resource in a collection of files wherein the condition expresses a one or more effective periods for using an email providing access to the resource and b a condition of email access to the resource by a designated individual of a second business entity where the access permission may be assigned using a specific email address of the designated individual and access may be provided by sending an email to that email address with a link a log in credential or the like that enables access to the resource. Access confirmation for access to the resource e.g. the file may include confirmation steps such as in a first step where the effectiveness of the identity of the designated individual is confirmed including based on linking various email addresses to that particular individual and a second step where entitlement to access a resource such as the data file is confirmed including checking the effectivity periods that were set for access to each of the resources by the user of the first business entity .

In an example there may be an association between the identity of a designated individual and each of multiple email addresses or accounts each with effectivity periods . Email accounts or particular emails bearing access credentials may have a start date and an end date as their effectivity date range such as when email accounts are no longer effective have a future date range and the like. An email account may also only have a start date such as when an effectivity period is still current or has not yet begun. shows an instance where an identity has a file association with a file through email account . In this instance the confirmation of identity would be passed for access confirmation but the step of confirming entitlement to the data may fail such as if it is currently outside the effectivity period between start date and end date . However if the current time is within this date range the designated individual would have access to the file . The association of multiple email accounts with a single identity through the email effectivity facility enables a comprehensive management of a plurality of email accounts especially important when the email accounts are conditionally associated with emails linked to files.

In embodiments a method for managing access to a secure exchange environment managed by an intermediate business entity through a user email identity may comprise establishing a secure exchange server hosted by an intermediate business entity wherein communications and access to a collection of files established by a first business entity are managed for a second business entity and establishing an email effectivity facility that allows a user of the first business entity to specify a condition for email based access to at least one resource in the collection of files wherein the condition expresses a an effective period for using an email providing access to the resource and b a condition of email access to the resource by a designated individual of the second business entity wherein the access permission was assigned using a specific email address of the designated individual. In embodiments multiple email addresses may be associated with the identity of the designated individual of the second business entity. The designated individual may be permitted access to the resource during the effective period of the email that provided access from any current email account that is associated with the identity of the designated individual. Separate access conditions may be managed for each of the multiple email addresses of the designated individual. The first and second business entities may validate the designated individual s permissions associated with the multiple email addresses. Permission to access information on the secure exchange server may be identified by an embedded link in an email from the user of the first business entity to an email address of the designated individual. The first business entity may provide updates to the access conditions as an association of the user of the second business entity with the first business entity changes. The effective period may be a period of employment a stage of a transaction and the like. The email effectivity facility may utilize a graphical user interface to manage the access conditions such as where the graphical user interface indicates the status of the access conditions where the graphical user interface is integrated into a third party application as an application program interface API and the like. The effectivity condition may be a status of an email account of the second business entity and the status of the email account is still monitored when the designated individual is no longer employed by the second business entity.

Referring to in embodiments an electronic discovery e discovery facility may be utilized by users to facilitate the discovery process for digital content stored in a network based content storage service such as in a cloud based service. In embodiments a discovery request for digital content may be made by in association with for example an investigation a lawsuit an arbitration a mediation an audit or a dispute between entities. In embodiments a discovery request is for access to digital content by an agent wherein the agent may be for example legal counsel a legal agent a paralegal a legal assistant a law clerk a judicial agent a law enforcement agent a government agent an outside counsel an internal counsel an internal agent an auditor an accountant a forensic accountant an expert witness an employee a consultant or an enterprise knowledge worker. The digital content may be computer data or other content such as documents presentations spreadsheets emails blog entries texts calendar notes meetings social media messages browser history bookmarks and the like.

The content discovery process may comprise the identification preservation collection review analysis and production of content such as enabled through content tracking provided by the system for content exchanged between users and the network based content storage service . For instance the electronic discovery facility may support or allow response to requirements of a discovery process in civil or criminal litigation that pertains to electronically stored information ESI such as with respect to an entity such as an individual a business a government organization a non profit organization and the like. In this instance when responding to a litigation request for discovery enterprises must identify responsive documents may place those documents on legal hold status to ensure that data cannot be destroyed and may need to transfer those documents with associated metadata to an outside reviewer such as their legal counsel which may be internal or outside counsel . The legal counsel may then determine relevance and disposition of those documents. Documents may then be processed to facilitate the review and culling of documents for instance using techniques such as keyword search date range meta data based search and the like. The resulting documents may then be submitted to opposing counsel such as in formats that cannot easily be altered including PDF or TIFF.

In many regards the use of third party file sharing tools has made electronic discovery difficult or impractical and in some cases impossible. For example any number of different commercial file storage resources e.g. Dropbox may be used by individuals of an enterprise for storing and sending files and electronic messages to third parties many of which may be entirely outside the purview of enterprise Information Technology administrators. As a result responding in a timely complete fashion to litigation requests becomes a challenge.

In embodiments a set of tools may be made available to administrators of an on line network based file sharing and collaboration service that are an aid in responding to a discovery request such as a litigation request for electronic content such as files emails documents presentations calendar notes meetings social media messages browser history bookmarks and the like. These electronic discovery tools may be integrated into an existing administrator console and made available to administrators with the appropriate mechanisms for maintaining legal privilege. From the administrator console administrators may first be able to identify the relevant individuals who may be in possession of relevant content. Alternately the electronic discovery tools may be utilized directly as part of compliance with an electronic discovery reference model. Searching may include the ability to search by user by date range by topic e.g. based on metadata or tags and the like to limit the scope of the search result. To facilitate content tracking the electronic discovery facility may apply metadata tags global identifiers and the like to content being stored in a network based content storage service . For example a user may may store an electronic document in a commercial networked content storage service such as one of a plurality of cloud based commercial storage providers where the document is first sent to the electronic discovery facility for tagging with a global identifier to facilitate tracking down the content. In addition contact tracking may store information associated with the document users that have access to the document users that have downloaded the document and the like where contact tracking keeps track of where all copies and versions of the document reside. Users and or content may be searched directly such as through a user application or from the administrator console. Once identified the resulting content may be placed on legal hold where a legal hold prevents content from being destroyed or modified such as to protect and document the chain of custody. In embodiments content with rights management encoding e.g. information rights management IRM digital rights management DRM and rights management service RMS may be placed on legal hold through rights management based controls such as wherever the content is currently stored as described in this disclosure. Once placed on hold those identified electronic content may be provided to outside reviewers e.g. legal counsel by granting them access directly to the content as they reside in the file sharing service. The outside reviewer may choose to use native search de duplication techniques and analytics tools to further cull the content set.

In embodiments the relevant content that result from the search process may be exported to removable media as native files also referred to as petrified files in JPG or TIFF format to prevent data spoilage. Some content may have a mix of relevant content and other content that needs to be redacted or for which portions may be reviewed only by a limited set of eyes for the counter party to a litigation or other dispute. For example technology trade secrets in an intellectual property dispute may be limited to counsel s eyes only so that non attorney individuals of the counter party are not supposed to see trade secret portions of materials. In such cases document editing tools and rights management tools may be used such as in a secure exchange to block certain portions of content from access except by individuals that have appropriate access credentials to view the content.

This identification preservation collection processing review optional redaction and production of electronic content may be conducted through a file sharing service administrator console through an application or if required may allow the user or administrator to identify legal hold redact and export content for review in content review platforms of their choosing. In this way the culled set of content may be shared with outside reviewers without the need to export physical media and as such may be shared in place without concerns that the content or chain of custody will be modified or that unauthorized users will have access to prohibited portions of content.

In embodiments a rules based workflow management facility may be provided within a secure exchange. For instance in the case of a private equity fund a user may be executing a capital call. Rules may be used to automatically permission automatically alert and the like such as for example alerting those individuals associated with the capital call. In embodiments the system may trigger rules based actions on at least one document where the at least one document is mined for information such as the investor s name the deal the nature of the deal and the like. Based on this information the system may create a group such as based on the investor s name. For instance creation or selection of a workflow may be based on this information and the rules established therefor. Other workflows may relate to completion of debt or equity offerings including initial public offerings completion of private equity and other investment transactions completion of lending transactions of various types syndication of transactions of various types mergers and acquisitions transactions and others. A set of workflow rules for each may be based on organizational policies transaction terms and conditions and legal regulatory requirements. Under such rules an exchange such as for a particular transaction may be automatically provisioned with a suitable content organization structure e.g. a set of files named with standard naming conventions appropriate for various content normally needed for that type of transaction individuals having defined roles within each enterprise such as determined by contact information stored and or associated with an exchange may be prompted to populate and or review the content structure with appropriate enterprise content and individuals having defined roles within each enterprise may be automatically provided appropriate access credentials to access the content. Rules may also trigger actions based on conditions such as providing additional access and or prompting in response to completion of actions e.g. prompting a reviewer to provide a summary report to a supervisor when the reviewer has completed review of a file .

In embodiments improved delivery of services may be provided through the use of a delivery of service facility as shown in layered over an application program interface API layer that is able to significantly accelerate API based processes. The delivery of service facility may include a bulk operations toolkit that provides bulk operations and various spreadsheet driven operations where operation steps are validated. The toolkit may provide real time validation of inputs to an exchange so a client is able to receive real time confirmation of the results. The system may enable various operations to be assembled together. The system may also allow a user to set a variety of criteria and transfer them from one exchange to another. The toolkit may include client specific tools such as a customer alerts tool a process steps consolidation tool and the like. For instance a client specific tool may be created to create and populate field information for certification ingest spreadsheet content and create an exchange all in one process. In embodiments the delivery of service facility may provide a bulk operations toolkit for an exchange the ability to push custom alerts up to multiple exchanges in real time and the like. In embodiments the system may enable the transfer of data from an exchange via metadata such as with options to transfer custom fields or their values.

In embodiments content may be stored on a secure drive on the exchange server through a protected drive facility . This secure drive may also be replicated to an open drive such as on a user s hard drive. The secure drive may be accessible to anyone who can access it where the secure exchange server provides a managed service offering resident on the computer platform hosting the encrypted managed device. The drive may have security policies be remotely administered provide complete tracking of what goes in or goes out and the like. Accesses to the drive may be monitored and recorded in an auditable record including bulk copies. As such if an unauthorized user gets to the drive it would be encrypted and so unreadable. Thus the drive may provide a secure storage facility that is encrypted remotely managed policy managed and the like providing the user with a controlled secure storage.

In embodiments a secure drive on the exchange server may be replicated to a virtual drive through a virtual drive facility such as visible and accessible from a user s desktop computer. In an example this would allow legal teams to drag emails into an exchange directly or do the same thing from a desktop in a more integrated experience than if they had to work with a dedicated application. In this way the files may be dropped into a secure repository directly from the desktop. The virtual drive may also be integrated with the browser of the user s computer.

In embodiments the system may provide for a visual revision timeline user interface through a revision timeline facility such as for viewing and resolving document version conflicts. Through use of the visual revision timeline the system may be able to provide the user with a view into when revisions occurred and aid in determining how to resolve conflicts between overlapping revisions and when to merge the changes thus making collaboration easier. For instance the system may provide a visual view of when a revision branching occurred between two or more users. Looking at a visual timeline of document versions with snippets of conflicts may allow one user to determine if a conflict exists and whether to merge the changes from another user perhaps without looking at the source application. For instance if a user changed something from italics to bold the system could help classify whether that change is a conflict that needs to be resolved. That is there may be different levels of revisions with different conflict resolution priorities such as formatting level conflicts content level conflicts and the like. Content level conflicts might be resolved but if content and formatting changes get mixed together the system may have facilities to parse these potential conflicts out such as by categorizing them applying rules to determine what is a conflict perform automatic conflict resolution on one category of conflict but query the user for others and the like. The visual revision timeline user interface may make it simpler for a user to see what changes have occurred to a document in a secure way.

In embodiments a collections user interface may be provided for organizing work streams that allows dragging and dropping of assets users and the like to create automatic permissioning. In this way a user may be able to utilize a drag and drop action to create collections . For instance to create a folder new work stream or the like a user may drag one entity on top of the other. A user may create a collection of work streams that they drag items into e.g. other work streams contacts assets and the like . In this way a user may drag assets and the people into a collection and automatically create permissions. In an embodiment a collection will automatically provide permission to all individuals whose contact information is dragged dropped into the collection for the individuals to access all content that is dragged dropped into the collections. Collections may be annotated such as with messages to the respective contacts. For example if a partner in a law firm wants two associates to review a set of documents in connection with an M A due diligence process the partner may create a new collection in an exchange drag and drop the documents e.g. from a section of an exchange relating to a relevant topic into the collection drag and drop the names of the two associates into the collection and write a message to the collection instructing the associates which documents each is to review. In embodiments the creator manager of a collection may provide other settings such as allowing read only access having time limited access or having other features described throughout this disclosure.

In embodiments a 3D viewing facility may be provided such as for viewing secure 3D documents that are being shared though the secure exchange server. The 3D viewing facility may provide facilities for rendering a 3D document in a secure manner consistent with methods and systems described herein in relation to other digital content including secure viewing protection un sharing control and the like. The 3D viewing facility may provide a conversion facility for converting CAD drawings into the 3D rendering files for viewing on a user s computing device mobile computing device and the like. The 3D viewing facility may provide a storage facility for source CAD drawings and or the 3D files. The 3D viewing facility may provide for a permissioning mechanism auditing mechanism distribution share unshared facilities a business process based on work streams and the like. In an example a business may be going out for bids on a design to a number of vendors and through the secure exchange facility and 3D viewing facility may be able to share the 3D files for the design for the bidding process. Once the vendor is selected the business may remove shared access to the 3D files allowing the 3D files to be completely unshared from the losing vendors such as described herein. In this way the businesses people and devices that the files are shared with can be controlled as well as un sharing as needs arise.

In embodiments a metadata sharing facility may be provided where metadata is sharable without the need to share the documents files processes applications and the like that the metadata is associated with. For instance metadata may be associated with a document that has been shared such as for scheduling viewing reviewing signing status and the like. This metadata may provide insight into the progress of a document review a signature process a bidding process a manufacturing process a supply chain status and the like without the need to have the document or application that generated the document. Through being able to share metadata such as across enterprise firewall boundaries a user may be able to gain insight through the monitoring of the metadata. In an example metadata may be associated with a document that is in a signature cycle where each time the document is forwarded reviewed viewed signed and the like the metadata is updated. This metadata may then be forwarded to the metadata sharing facility where a report dashboard updates alerts notifications and the like may be provided to a user that is monitoring the progress of the signature process. Thus an individual may be able to indicate whether the signature cycle is nearing completion without having to have access to the content of the document. This is a simple illustrative example but one skilled in the art will recognize that this process may be used to monitor much more complex exchanges and processes such as between enterprise partners buyers and sellers and the like where different users have different applications but through metadata sharing there may be no need for users to have the application in order to have a view of the metadata and its embedded information. With this system in place a more time responsive process may be in place that allows real time updates of digital content events and thus enables a user with a view that helps provide real time transparency of activity to a document work stream process collaboration and the like.

In embodiments the metadata sharing facility may provide for a platform for managing assets policies work flow object life cycles auditing and the like such as for collaboration situations. For instance a user may assign metadata to a community of buyers and documents e.g. marketing promotions to those buyers who have registered as such. The metadata associated with those documents may then be sent back to the sender to help assess how the document is being received such as through pages viewed time of viewing number of times viewed stored copied distributed signed deleted and the like. In another instance documents that represent assets may be assigned metadata for monitoring such as drawings CAD models change requests deals and the like. In another instance metadata associated with documents may provide information about whom the document is being viewed by and whom that person is associated with. From this information relationships may be determined such as how these people are related to one another why they are connected and the like. Related people may then be identified as potential contacts in related projects deals sales and the like. Metadata may then be augmented with attributes fields and the like to record these relationships and thus build as a metadata held profile associated with the document. In another instance metadata may include policy information such as for the life cycle steps or states that a document or entity associated with the document goes through. For example a form may have different steps associated with the process of using a form where metadata is associated with the form the forms use actions take with the form and the like. The system may then look at an object that shows up in the form with the relevant data for a given step stages and relevant actions for each stage approval steps people that are allowed to do the next step and the like. In another instance metadata may be used to track the lifecycle of an object through its steps such as in a deal where a document has a lifecycle. There may be n levels of hierarchy in the metadata model where an action such as a workflow may be developed from the metadata at each level. For instance a lifecycle may have states e.g. done not done approved not approved as a sub level of a workflow. In another instance metadata sharing tracking may be useful when assets need to know about their relationships to other assets. For instance a document might know about another document e.g. the PDF converted version of the same document . A document might know about a format relationship if it is an assembly for a 3D model about the children components of a model and the like. In embodiments these relationships might in some cases inherit permissions e.g. if documents are just two versions of the same content a PDF version may inherit permissions from the word processor version while others might not inherit permissions e.g. a component model might not inherit permissions from the parent model . The system may build asset permissioning relationships into and from the metadata.

In embodiments an investor portal may be provided as an investor communications platform for marketing and communicating with their clients. The investor portal may fill a need for financial services organizations. For instance fund managers need to navigate considerable challenges to raise capital satisfy important investors and hold onto assets. To compete effectively these firms need a client reporting infrastructure that can accommodate information seeking sophisticated investors and the like and maintain them as clients. The investor portal provides a new way to engage with the investor community and does so with scalability security and control including content management branding and data delivery tools to help financial managers compete effectively for institutional assets. The investor portal may provide information to investors immediately via a user interface that s customizable to enhance the user s brand while meeting reporting needs of institutional investors. The investor portal may allow for permissioning in a similar way as in an exchange or through the dashboard as described herein. Permissions for these different environments may be automatically matched such as with a matching algorithm.

In embodiments a user such as an enterprise user may store content to a secure storage facility through the exchange server. Upon request to the exchange server the content may be retrieved and then sent to the user. This process creates traffic through the exchange server which combined with a plurality of other such requests may create bandwidth issues at the exchange server. However the exchange server may store the location of content locally such that when the enterprise user requests the content the exchange user provides the enterprise user with the location for direct access such as with a time based token that is good for a period of time. Then the user is able to directly access the content with the secure storage facility thus removing the exchange server from the pathway and thus eliminating the bandwidth usage through the exchange server. In embodiments the content may be encrypted while stored while in transport and the like such as in a request for the content sharing the content synchronizing the content with devices and the like.

In embodiments there may be a plurality of secure storage facilities in which user content may be stored and to further reduce traffic and or time latency the exchange server may direct the storage of the content to a location that is closest to the user such as either geographically or through a network access assessment between the plurality of secure storage facilities and the location or network connection of the user thus finding the best connection between the requester and the storage facility and improving access time. This location preference may be stored in association with the content through permission attributes which then determines where the content is to be stored. Permission attributes may also determine other parameters in association with the content such as who has access to the content what devices are permitted to access the content date time limitations on access to the content and the like.

In embodiments a comment notification facility may be provided where a user is directed highlighted linked and the like to a comment in a document created by another user. For instance a first user may send a document to a second user for review and comment. The second user may then make a comment in the document and the first user is notified of the comment through the comment notification facility. Notification may be provided to the first user upon the second user sending back the document to the first user provided to the first user after the second user has saved their comments to the document provided in near real time to the first user when the second user makes the comment and the like. The notification may take the form of a transmission of the comment to the first user such as through email through the dashboard through a text when the first user receives the document and the like. The notification may include a link that brings the first user to the comment within the document such as providing a link to the comment so that the first user only need one click on a visual icon link and the like and the first user is brought to the comment. The comment may be highlighted in some way so that the first user clearly sees the comment such as the comment being colored font colored highlighting underlined flashing and the like. The first user may be provided a highlighted comment to a document so that they are directed immediately to an animated highlighted version of the comment for expedited review. By providing an expedited access to a comment through the comment notification facility the users may be provided with a method of review and comment that is quicker and easier to use than traditional methods.

In embodiments a device pinning facility may be provided that enables the enforcement of document permissions restricting a user from accessing a document from any computer other than the computer from which the user first accessed the document. The device pinning facility may be implemented without any plug ins agents or any other additional software installation on a client machine end user device and the like.

In embodiments the exchange may only be accessed by authorized computers using an acceptable log in procedure including user name and password. Communications within the exchange may establish a communication session based upon a selected security protocol and thereafter messages are transmitted between using such secure encryption. Communications may be exchanged via a secure encrypted communication session using a selected encryption protocol and may deny access if a secure session cannot be established at a desired secure level. In embodiments encryption may include the implementation of cipher block chaining CBC with keys of various lengths e.g. with 256 bit encryption keys. The host server may offer a high level of security for all data by employing substantially secure network connections and by using security and encryption technologies developed for networks such as may be readily incorporated in the encryption facility . Encryption of files may be provided in a cloud e.g. enterprise to cloud cloud to cloud cloud to enterprise for all devices . Encryption may be implemented without any plug ins agents or any other additional software installation on a client machine end user device and the like such as in combination with DRM protection content sharing e.g. user to user user to many many to many watermarking and the like.

In embodiments a cross enterprise collaboration facility may include unified activity workspaces such as content management activity management workflow management identity entitlement enforcement and the like where these activities may plug into the system as modules. This extended environment may also extend beyond the enterprise firewall allowing user access when outside the secure network of the enterprise.

Cross enterprise collaboration in a networked secure collaborative exchange environment refers to the methods and systems disclosed herein and elements thereof in the general domain involving secure collaboration among individuals e.g. workers across two or more business entities across enterprise firewalls and other elements that would otherwise provide security if the individuals were working inside the network of one company. Unified workspaces may be provided for a given type of activity within the secure collaborative exchange environment that can be accessed from various types of systems with full management of the activities that happen in the workspace e.g. permissioning of users and groups control of access tracking and auditing . For that selected type of activity all of the necessary resources may be organized so that the activity type may be pluggable into the workspace. Resources that enable the set of capabilities for each type of activity may be in blocks plug ins sets of services and the like that can be pulled for use by the workspace such as from the cloud from behind a firewall or from another resource as needed to assemble the pluggable activity for the workspace.

Referring to a workflow management workspace may have pluggable resources to establish and drive the sequence of a workflow such as for content entitlement identity workflow case management and the like. Connectivity of these pluggable resources may be federated together such as at an integration later a platform layer and the like. The pluggable workflow management workspace may provide a many to many collaborative environment that may be located beyond the firewall in a secure auditable collaborative service. This structure may allow for virtually unlimited scalability extensibility specialization and the like. Through the flexibility of this system customers may provide their own content entitlement workflow identity and the like while the system provides compliance across the established domain. In embodiments customers may choose to build their system outside their firewall e.g. for multiple enterprise applications or inside their firewall e.g. for a content domain controlled by a single enterprise .

Resources may also be provided for identifying the sequence of a workflow e.g. using Gantt charts visual tools for depicting flow chart sequences of work e.g. Microsoft Visio and the like resources for identifying the input content used at each step in the sequence and the output content produced at each step in the sequence resources for permissioning the content and issuing appropriate credentials for the content possibly with triggers based on the timing and sequence of the workflow e.g. by user by workgroup by enterprise and the like resources for associating individuals with responsibilities for executing reviewing and or approving the completion of the steps in the workflow and resources for reporting on the status of the workflow at individual steps pending status progress toward completion and completion . Once in the workflow management workspace individuals may use the pluggable resources to create the workflow for a given project and the workspace itself may pull the enabling resources from the appropriate systems e.g. a cloud or enterprise system to perform the function of that resource.

In embodiments there may be a plurality of resources that would be appropriate for each kind of workspace. The content management workspace may have various resources that are appropriate for tracking the creation modification development approval publication use of content and the like.

In embodiments an action checking facility may be provided that manages actions to be performed with respect to application capabilities resident on a user s computing device. The action checking facility may include an action command process such as a pre check check action post action and the like. For instance an action may be a capability provided by the system. A pre check may determine whether or not to present that capability e.g. based on licensing what applications are installed whether that behavior or capability should be exposed such as in the determination whether to display a particular dashboard button. For example if a user is allowed to read annotate and approve content but not take other actions such as modification or sending the content then a button icon for approval might be included while buttons icons for printing sending or the like might be disabled or omitted from the interface of the application based on the pre check related to deployment of the application to that user. Thus an application for handling secure content may be configured based on a pre check to have the correct set of capabilities allowed for a particular user when interacting with particular content. An action check may involve the system enabling a host to install business logic that requires a particular action to occur before another action can happen that prevents an action from occurring if logic dictates or the like. Thus workflows can be enabled by action checks that follow client defined business logic. Post action checks may enable alerts sending of logs of actions taken transferring of data to another system deletion of data that is no longer relevant reporting on completion of workflows initiation of next sets of actions and the like. The action checking facility may provide a broad set of hooks for extensions from the system such as from business systems professional services client services customers partners and the like that can provide business logic work flows and the like. Each action checking process e.g. pre check check action post may include a list of items to check on. For example if an application is being installed pre check could determine if the application is currently installed in the system and if so then display a control button associated with the application. The action checking facility functionality may be interconnected with the application layer the platform layer orchestration services and the like. In embodiments the action checking facility may provide patterns and constructs as to how capabilities of how aspects of the system will be rendered to the user such as enabled in a composite services layer.

Referring to in embodiments a secure mobile device facility may be provided to manage a trusted environment policy for a plurality of mobile devices e.g. trusted devices as identified by the secure mobile device facility where the plurality of mobile devices are able to securely inter communicate with each other within a trusted environment . The secure mobile device facility may enable users with mobile devices such as smart phones to more easily communicate securely e.g. communications file transfers once each of the mobile devices has been verified as a trusted device. The trusted environment policy may establish what mobile devices are included in a trusted environment the bounds of the trusted environment the constraints upon mobile devices within the trusted environment and the like where a mobile device may be enabled to operate within more than one trusted environment and where trusted environments may have overlapping bounds. The bounds of the trusted environment may be defined as a physical location e.g. range around a physical location point a geographically defined area or region as a network connection e.g. connected to a trusted network as proximity to another mobile device of the trusted environment e.g. within Bluetooth range near field communication range RFID tag reader range and the like. Constraints upon mobile devices operating within a trusted environment may limit communications connectivity e.g. only available if the mobile device is online require updated software e.g. having software current with respect to available updates versions and the like require an anti malware scan within a defined period of time e.g. having an anti virus scanner that has scanned the mobile device within the last day require that authentication procedures be followed and or verified e.g. by verification that the device is being operated by the owner and the like. Bounds and constraints for each trusted environment may be stored in a trusted environment database .

The inter environment communications connectivity between mobile devices of a trusted environment may be through any wireless connection media approved by the trusted environment policy such as through a wireless network WiFi connection Bluetooth connection near field communications NFC cellular network and the like. Communications between mobile devices within a trusted environment may be through a peer to peer P2P network where communications are decentralized and distributed and may offline with respect to connectivity with the secure mobile device facility e.g. such as a group of mobile devices being collectively off line but able to communicate P2P. The network connection of the plurality of mobile devices to the secure mobile device facility may be via the Internet a wireless network WiFi cellular network and the like.

In embodiments the trusted environment policy may allow mobile devices within a trusted environment to operate in either a constrained or unconstrained mode where the mobile devices may utilize partitioned secure memories cryptographic methods multi level access controls and the like to manage operations in a constrained versus unconstrained mode. For instance a mobile device may have secure and unsecure memory allocations and may use separate communications protocols for communicating with trusted devices versus devices that have not been certified as trusted devices. A mobile device may be determined to be a trusted device for possible use in a trusted environment through a certification procedure such as establishing a key certificate to confirm that the device is a trusted device. When a first and second mobile device initiate a secure exchange within a trusted environment a multi factor authentication process may be executed such as including a password e.g. with a single sign on for multiple trusted environments a token exchange location personal knowledge answer biometric authentication e.g. fingerprint and the like. However the trusted environment policy may require only a single verification such as verifying that both the first and second mobile devices are trusted devices as defined by the trusted environment policy and thereafter allow the devices to exchange files without further security verification steps thus establishing a secure dynamic group membership amongst the two trusted devices. The trusted environment policy may dictate secure operations periods such as crypto periods for temporal exchange constraints. For instance files allowed to be exchanged only between the hours of 8 00 a.m. and 5 00 p.m. and the files must be encrypted.

In a use case example a trusted environment may be defined as a team of individuals working for a company where the bounds include all of their mobile devices being certified as trusted devices are only allowed to communicate securely while located at the company e.g. determined by GPS network connectivity and require an initial multi factor authentication including a biometric authentication with the device a single sign on with the secure mobile device facility and an exchange of a token during sign in. In another example the team may be the Board of the company and the physical location may be constrained to the Board Room. In another example the team may be a combination of company members and visiting counsel to the company in a location limited diligence project. In another example the team may be spread out across the world and the constraints include certain identified trusted network connections encryption protocols and biometric verifications. The secure mobile device facility may enable a plurality of mobile devices to operate freely within pre established bounds and constraints making secure ongoing collaboration possible without the necessity of secure procedures for each communication.

In embodiments a workstream synchronization facility may provide the ability for a user s secure collaboration container e.g. such as stored in the cloud to be synchronized onto the user s desktop workstream channels such as for conflicts management. The resulting synchronized container of work available on the user s desktop may allow the collaborating group of users to synchronize files events calendars activity feeds and the like. Synchronization may also take the current risk profile of a computing device into account e.g. a user is on travel in China versus they are in the corporate home office . A notification component may be provided that enables multiple users to work together more efficiently by users letting each other know what actions are occurring in the work container e.g. a messaging function associated with the container. A proactive component may be provided that pushes an alert to a user s desktop e.g. rather than just an email . Alerts may also be provided based on changes to the container that on going work is occurring e.g. to create awareness that someone else is working on files in the container and the like.

Referring to in embodiments a contextual sharing facility may be provided that manages the sharing of data based on the contextual environment of a user such as based on what computing device the user is utilizing when attempting to share information e.g. enterprise computing device enterprise mobile device home computing device personal mobile device the location of the computing device e.g. enterprise facility personal residence public location competitor location on travel in a foreign country the user s current activity state e.g. at work on work travel on personal time on personal travel network conditions e.g. connected to a trusted network using a trusted IP address connected to a public network operating offline of a network proximity e.g. near team members near legal counsel near competitors near public devices time e.g. during regular work hours on weekends during normal sleep time based on a restrictive list e.g. a white list a black list a combined listing of individuals by sharing privilege and the like. For instance a user may be constrained from sharing information with a second user because the first user is at home but whose sharing privileges become unconstrained when they get to work. The contextual sharing facility may be utilized in file sharing or workstream collaboration applied to individuals of the same or different enterprises utilized for managing the sharing as a user transitions between work and personal use utilized to restrict or to enhance sharing opportunities and the like. For instance the contextual sharing facility may be applied to sharing in a workstream where sharing may be restricted based on the conditions under which users are working. However because the users contributing to the workstream may have disparate home office locations the contextual sharing facility may enhance sharing by alerting users of changes in the environment of other users that may foster sharing such as alerting another user of the workstream that a user is currently near the same location and so encouraging an opportunity for direct interaction. The contextual sharing facility may also apply to other access related facilities as described herein such as for managing the synchronization of documents to a computing device to determine access control to files to determine viewing privileges of a document to control e signature privileges secure viewing on a mobile device and the like.

The contextual sharing facility may allow restrict deny and the like the sharing of information with a second user based upon the parameters or other contextual environment parameters under which users finds themselves. The second user may have contextual sharing constraints placed upon them as based upon their contextual environment or the second user may be an unconstrained user . For instance two users attempting to share information between them may both be operating under sharing constraints placed upon them by different contextual environments. The first user may for instance be using their personal mobile device e.g. their smart phone connected to a public network on personal domestic travel and the second user may be on an enterprise mobile device e.g. their company laptop at a competitor location. In this instance the contextual sharing facility may determine the sharing privileges between the two users based on both contextual environments such as one sharing level for information allowed to be shared from the first user to the second user and a second sharing level for information allowed to be shared from the second user to the first user.

An unconstrained user may also have sharing allowed restricted denied and the like with a second user whose ability to be shared with is constrained by their contextual environment . For instance all users may be considered to be unconstrained or relatively unconstrained under a certain set of conditions such as being at their own desk in their enterprise facility connected to the trusted enterprise network. However when an unconstrained user attempts to share data with a user constrained by a contextual environment sharing may be restricted. One of the contextual environment s parameters may also be time such as a user being able to share under certain parameter conditions during regular working hours. A set of conditions may be set for special team members or types of team members such as for legal counsel e.g. as determined by proximity to the legal counsel or for a location of the legal counsel s work place . In this instance a user may only be allowed to share information under these limited conditions where outside of these conditions the information is protected from being shared. The ability to disallow sharing may provide protection for private information not only through transfer of the information but also for storage of information. For instance during conditions where sharing is not allowed information stored on the computing device may be protected e.g. via encryption stored in a virtual or protected drive such as from someone trying to hack their way into the computing device to steal information. One example of information where privacy may be enhanced with contextual restrictions is medical information. The contextual sharing facility may provide a restricted access to the medical information stored on a computing device e.g. a mobile computing device of a patient doctor or other user that has need to store a patient s medical information. For instance medical information may only be enabled for sharing from a patient to a doctor when the patient is in the doctor s office and otherwise it is placed in a secure storage container on the patient s computing device. Through use of the contextual sharing facility sharing privileges as well as information protection states may dynamically shift as the context of the user s environment changes.

In embodiments a combination of the user selected and automatic parameter determining facilities through the computing device may determine the user s current environmental context for the purposes of sharing. For instance location may be determined by GPS functions one the device e.g. GPS functions provided on a smart phone . The computing device being used may be determined automatically or input one time into the system for each device the user accesses. The computing device may also be able to automatically determine network conditions . User activity may be input by the user determined by a combination of calendar date and time input through voice command and the like. Proximity may be input by the user automatically detected though services provided by a cellular network service provider determined through near field communications NFC determined through the user of RFID technology automatically detected through network services and the like.

In embodiments the contextual sharing facility may reside on a secure server where the users computing devices provide the parameters that comprise the current contextual environment. The server based contextual sharing facility may then continuously gather contextual parameters from the users computing devices and manage the sharing permissions for devices. In another embodiment the contextual sharing facility may be located at least in part on the user s computing device. With this configuration the contextual sharing facility residing on the user s computing device may provide the user s current contextual environment state to a server portion of the contextual sharing facility or directly to other user computing devices such as directly to another user whose computing device also has access to a contextual sharing facility e.g. located on the second user s computing device located on a server across a network . For instance a first and second computing device may both be running client versions of the contextual sharing facility where they can both assess the other s contextual environment information for determination of sharing permissions with the other. In this way the contextual sharing facility may provide for dynamic group sharing privileges where a group s sharing privileges are determined dynamically through the contextual sharing facility e.g. through client and or server based facilities and thus not require permissions to be stored in a database for retrieval. So a group of individuals each with access to a contextual sharing facility may share information amongst themselves such as upon meeting based on each of their permissions determined by their current environment.

In embodiments the contextual sharing facility may provide a user interface that provides a status of other users contextual environments so as to help manage sharing planning between users. For instance a group of users may be a sales group where individuals from the sales group are often out of the office making sales calls. In this instance users environments may continually change such as being at the location of another company on foreign travel working from a public WiFi at the home office working from a personal residence and the like where it may be desirable to restrict sharing of information under some environmental states. In another instance the group of users may be attorneys where much of the information being shared is confidential to only one client and where a strict policy related to sharing constraints needs to be in place. For example privileged information such as medical information sensitive company information information relevant to a business deal or the like may only be shared when an attorney is in the room or not shared except when specified other individuals are present e.g. CEO in house counsel . Not only can the contextual sharing facility automatically aid in preventing undesirable sharing conditions but through the user interface users may be able to track changing environmental sharing conditions that allow users to better plan sharing. For example a personal assistant to an attorney may monitor the environmental conditions for the attorney and only attempts sharing with the attorney when the attorney is in an environmental state to accept sharing of confidential materials. In embodiments the user interface may include visual indicators for different environmental states of different users such as color coding for different combined states that may be customizable for each user or group of users. For instance a green colored visual indicator may indicate that the attorney is in an environmental state that permits unconstrained transfer of confidential information e.g. not currently at a client site and on a trusted network . The user interface may provide for status alerts messaging personal setup of environmental conditions with respect to sharing visibility into policy and the like. In embodiments the contextual sharing facility may utilize a contextual sharing policy that determines sharing privileges for an individual group enterprise collaboration private vs. public data and the like where the environmentally determined sharing privileges may be tied to an access control facility such as described herein.

In embodiments the present invention may enable uses and applications and may be deployed in environments and systems related to clinical trial management safety document exchange and collaboration for life sciences pharmaceutical biotechnology and related industries. For instance a clinical trial management facility may be provided where specialized documentation management control for clinical trails may be enabled in the secure collaborative environment such as provided through the intermediary use of the secure server of the present invention such as to safeguard critical information reduce costs and streamline operations as well as for secure exchange of information both inside and outside of the network and firewall of a particular user such as a pharmaceutical company a regulatory body or the like. Further the use of functionally integrated user interfaces with existing user applications may promote adoption of new site users that have traditionally employed paper based documents in clinical studies as well as help maintain existing site users where administrative burdens placed on sites due to a paper based process has been shown to cause a high turnover of investigators. The clinical trial management facility may provide a convenient secure way to manage critical information during clinical trials such as in support of bringing new drugs and therapies to market where automated workflows help to move critical documents from one phase to the next easing the flow of information between organizations and saving time. In addition audit and reporting capabilities may be provided to support transparency and compliance which leads to faster approvals by regulatory agencies.

The distribution and collection of documents during initiation of a clinical trial has traditionally been a highly manual time consuming process prone to risk. The challenge grows with the additional dimensions of multiple sites and multiple simultaneous studies. The clinical trial management facility provides a secure online repository that can ease the study start up process enabling centralized collaboration for documents and communication. On an industry wide basis clinical trials often fall behind their timelines from the very beginning such as during protocol development site selection study start up and the like. Keeping track of a growing number of study start up documents across multiple studies with many sometimes even thousands of clinical sites while ensuring the most recent versions presents a challenge to sponsors researchers and site investigators. The clinical trial management facility may provide solutions for issues facing clinical trial study management through high site usability to drive adoption rigorous role based controls on document access comprehensive compliance reporting and the like.

The clinical trial management facility helps improve operational efficiency reduce cost and shorten document review cycles involved in clinical trials such as by supporting the creation of secure investigator portals. The clinical trial management facility enables users to better manage the distribution collection and tracking of critical information such as related to site recruitment site activation safety and the like while also adding a layer of security. The clinical trial management facility improves communication collaboration and document exchange between users involved in a clinical trial from study team personnel and clinical research organizations to investigative sites and institutional review boards IRBs . For instance managing the distribution and collection of feasibility surveys online in a secure centralized location may shorten the site recruitment process. The status of site surveys may be more easily tracked so users can follow up and get sites on boarded quickly. Regulatory documents such as study protocols may be more easily distributed and collected. Studies may be more easily kept on track such as through real time visibility into user accesses and reviews of content and to better ensure follow up action is taken. Investigator sites may be provided with a personalized view of tasks requests due dates and the like for easy study management. Reminders and alerts may be sent when documents are due or ready for review. In addition the clinical trial management facility may better ensure that sensitive patient information is secure and can t be shared with unauthorized parties such as with role based permissioning and digital rights management also referred to as information rights management .

The growth in global site participation has added complexity to the process of clinical trial management. Delays in reporting can impact both patient safety and institutional corporate reputations including safety document distribution to investigator sites IRBs and clinical research organizations CROs . Additionally the expanding number of subjects enrolled in development programs has increased the level of complexity of effectively managing the process. The clinical trial management facility may provide for investigators to securely submit reports to sponsors in real time speeding information exchange and collaboration when serious events occur decrease the time needed to receive and disseminate severe adverse effect SAE reports ensure secure communication provide automatic notification of reports and receipt help ensure documents are reviewed in a timely fashion and the like. In addition sponsors of widely dispersed global trials using multinational CROs may track document distribution with full audit trails and ensure regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions. The clinical trial management facility may enable workflows in support of collaboration such as by automatically routing SAE reports for internal review provide automated distribution of complete SAE reports to investigators IRBs and CROs provide audit reports that maintain records of report distribution recipient delivery status document access and timing to improve compliance provide a centralized repeatable scalable platform for managing SAEs provide interconnections to safety systems that facilitate the seamless routing of SAEs to the sponsor s review team for evaluation and the like.

The clinical trial management facility may improve efficiency and effectiveness of the different phases of a clinical trial such as study start up and site activation study conduct and site monitoring safety documentation distribution management of trial master files and investigator site files and the like.

Site selection is the process of identifying a sufficient number of and good quality investigators to conduct the trial. This is one of the greatest challenges in clinical trial execution. Trial managers need to find individuals with considerable medical skills commitment to research good facilities willingness to support documentation requirements access to patients who fit the patient selection standard and will agree to enroll and the like. The clinical trial management facility may improve this process through enabling centralization of management e.g. single ID and password access to clinical trial documents standardization e.g. standardization of templates document formats and naming automation of the process e.g. study start up packages automatically distributed monitoring of the trial e.g. clinical trial lead and project leads able to view the status of each site number of outstanding tasks collaboration e.g. site specific tasks enabling a clinical study associate to have guided collaboration with investigator sites and the like.

Once an investigator site has been activated for a clinical trial the investigator enrolls patients and monitors the study including ensuring that the staff is well versed with the trial s documentation e.g. the protocol informed consent forms safety guidelines case report forms managing the product and drug inventory scheduling patient visits gathering data reporting adverse events and the like. The clinical trial management facility may improve this process through providing secure mobile platform facilities e.g. mobile access to documentation associated with investigator sites centralized management of site documents permission access control e.g. quickly verify if an investigator site has access to the latest study documents and if not grant them access and notify them via email and the like.

While conducting the clinical trial at investigator sites patients may experience side effects or adverse events AE or adverse change in patient health while the patient is receiving the treatment. AEs must be reported by the investigator site to IRB EC and sponsor CRO. The clinical trial management facility may improve this process through centralized management of safety documentation and distribution e.g. each exchange represents a study that may be organized into a collection such as studies organized by product or compound allowing study teams to focus on their study and specific sites while the safety team distributes safety reports across study safety report automation safety reports automatically distributed to the appropriate sites such as when an investigator site from a specific country is activated and users are automatically granted access to relevant safety reports that were distributed prior to their activation visibility e.g. a user may quickly identify that the distribution of a safety report was successful where the advance report provides information such as when safety report was distributed when investigator site was alerted if alert was sent successfully or if it was sent back and if sent back what was the reason for the return and the like.

At the start of the trial a trial master file TMF must be established at the sponsor organization and at each investigator site. The TMF is normally composed of a sponsor file held by the sponsor organization and an investigator site file ISF held by the investigator. These files together are regarded as comprising the entire TMF for the trial and should be established at the beginning of the trial. In most cases it is essential to segregate those documents that are generated or held by the sponsor of the trial from those of the investigator. This requirement is firstly due to subject confidentiality issues for example the sponsor must not have documents such as consent forms and subject identification lists if the subject has not specifically consented to them holding this information. Secondly where the investigator site file contains source documents the case report forms CRFs contain source data or the CRFs are the investigator s independent copy of the transcribed data providing this to the sponsor would remove the investigator s control.

Filing essential documents at sites in a timely manner can greatly assist in the successful management of a trial by the investigator sponsor and monitor. Trial master files should be established at the beginning of the trial both at the investigator institution s site and at the sponsor s office. A final close out of a trial can only be done when the monitor has reviewed both investigator institution and sponsor files and confirmed that all necessary documents are in the appropriate files. The clinical trial management facility may provide for an electronic trial master file eTMF electronic investigator site file eISF and the like where a clinical trial management facility s secure collaborative environment may not only improve the efficiency of the clinical trial but also decrease the risks endemic in a paper based system e.g. it has been found that more than 20 of the issues identified by sponsors refer to document control . In addition providing site controlled eISFs private documents for sponsors and for investigator sites may be kept separate though a secure integrated system and where all documents may then be archived at the end of the trial.

Just as a site s data validates or invalidates the study hypothesis the documentation validates or invalidates the data. Regulatory documentation at least in part contributes to validation of the data. From this documentation monitors and inspectors may assess many aspects of investigator and sponsor responsibilities and the conduct of the study including the non bias of the investigators training and qualifications of study staff appropriate recruitment and enrollment of study participants adequate accountability of the test article adequate oversight by a principal investigator and the like.

Data that cannot be validated cannot be used to answer the study question. The only way for an outside person such as a sponsor monitor auditor or FDA inspector to assess the quality of the study and its results is through the site s documentation. A complete investigational site file provides documentation to support that the investigator adhered to their responsibilities under jurisdictional laws and international guidance for conduct of human subject research. An up to date eISF facilitates the effective and efficient management of studies and helps decrease procedural errors. Investigator sites must maintain full control over their eISF without the sponsor ever having uncontrolled access even decades after the completion of the study. The sponsor is responsible for ensuring agreements are in place for the long term storage whilst always meeting this key requirement. Investigator site files may have the requirement to be reviewed by the sponsor s monitors as they are responsible for maintaining an adequate level of oversight.

The site investigator or site coordinator is responsible for storing and organizing of all essential study documents and correspondence such as entering adverse event information into a safety database following up with the investigator site for additional information or clarification support the review generation and distribution of the safety report and the like. A monitor or clinical research associate CRA may spend a majority of time traveling to investigator sites. They have to know all aspects of the clinical trial and any other instruction or clarifications that have been communicated to the site by the in house team e.g. clinical study associate and needs to ensure that the investigator site is complying with protocol that the latest form e.g. informed consent form is being used review the investigator site file for completeness and accuracy review the status of the investigator site with the IRB and the like.

The clinical trial management facility may improve the process of maintaining a clinical trial s TMF and site s ISF by proving centralized electronic management through the eTMF and site ISFs through the secure server. For instance through filing and managing of essential documents in the electronic investigator controlled site file eISF including through easy to use desktop integrated browsing of the electronic investigator site file integrating the process by saving a document into the appropriate investigator site file sub folder on the exchange being able to scan a document directly into an investigator site file and the like. Remote monitoring of the eISF may be provided through a secure mobile interface secure desktop interface and or secure web interface where monitors may be provided secure and controlled access to their investigator site clinical documents remote and immediate access to navigate the latest site based documents secure granting of access to sensitive site documents e.g. tighter than available when the ISF is in a paper form and the like. Using a single ID and password both clinical study associate and investigator sites may have access to a central area that contains their clinical trials such as those for the sites that have other sponsors. By using standard templates folder structure and document naming convention across all studies site teams may be able to establish a common framework and a consistent approach to eliminate confusion and enable automation.

Benefits of the clinical trial management facility through use of eTMFs and eISFs include the ability for sponsors to maintain synchronization with the eTMF and eISFs all documents being provided online for site investigators reduction of storage costs for archiving improved facility for site monitoring e.g. remote review of CRAs controlled access to documents perfection of documents for site visits status reports derived from e reports improved facility for auditors and inspectors e.g. user friendly user interface automated summary and completeness reports direct access to previous versions of documents and the like.

Enterprise sharing of confidential documents comprises a significant activity within certain business sectors such as in finance legal governmental and the like. The secure sharing of sworn documents or formal affirmed notarized or any other types of official documents whether or not they are sworn is especially a concern where sworn documents may be sworn signed documents in a financial transaction a sworn declaration in a legal proceeding an affidavit and the like. As part of a business transaction the enterprise may need to share a sworn document with an outside counsel or with partners such as part of a financial or legal transaction where it is essential that security and confidentiality be maintained. Direct access to sworn documents is also risky as any alteration to the sworn document could affect its validity as a legally binding document. In addition such documents may contain personal or confidential information that needs to be securely maintained. Thus it is essential that the process of sharing sworn documents be secure auditable and confidential.

A secure enterprise content portal such as portal of may be provided as a service to an enterprise as a collaborative portal for transporting and distributing content between an enterprise and external entities e.g. law firms and partners . The secure enterprise content portal may reduce regulatory risk to the enterprise as associated with sworn documents be able to allocate functionality associated with sworn documents back to individual business units within the enterprise manage third party professionals separately from core enterprise systems to provide for a quicker on boarding processes while lowering security risks and the like.

Referring to the secure enterprise content portal may provide for a stateless bi directional closed loop document transport cache as an intermediary transport mechanism between an enterprise data storage facility for the storage of sworn documents and a third party. The secure enterprise content portal may be provided as a stateless process in order to establish the portal as a transport mechanism without requiring that it become a source system of record. Traceability is maintained through the transport process but the design of the system may be such that the portal is not considered a legal repository for the document but only a mechanism for providing secure sharing access between the enterprise and the third party. As such the secure enterprise content portal is also bi directional and closed loop where the system acts as a machine process that progresses through the same closed loop sequence for each retrieval sharing return process of the sworn document. For example and referring to in a first step the sharing process is initiated at the enterprise with the transfer of the sworn document from a document tracker database. In a second step the sworn documents are transferred along with provisioning details from the document tracker database. In a third step and also referring to the sworn documents are uploaded to a secure sharing facility where permissioning is assigned for third party access. In a forth step a collaborative environment is established between the secure sharing facility and the third party using the established access permissions. At this point the third party may access the document as determined in the access permissions e.g. view copy edit print . In a fifth step and also referring to the sworn document is extracted and downloaded along with metadata from the secure sharing facility back to the document tracker database. This machine process acts as a secure cache providing a temporary data holding between the enterprise document tracker database and the third party that maintains a secure and auditable access facility for the third party that is isolated from any direct interface with the enterprise document tracker database. Once the sworn document is transferred back to the document tracker database there may be no trace of the document left within the secure sharing facility. In embodiments one exception to this may be a document audit history being retained such as for a period of time until a verification step is completed in association with the document being stored within the document tracker database.

The secure enterprise content portal thus provides a secure mechanism for a third party to access a sworn document stored with an enterprise such that the sworn document is only indirectly accessed through the portal so that there is no risk to the source document stored in the enterprise database. The portal provides a stateless machine process that does not need to constitute a source system of record but it provides a mechanism for executing permissions to third parties at least in part through metadata stored with the document in the enterprise database secures confidentiality of the sworn document through implementation of the portal as a machine transport process and the like.

Digital content sharing is a convenient and easy way to exchange information between people organizations companies or any other entities. However sharing content over digital media such as the Internet may expose the content to untrusted users. Many digital rights management DRM technologies provide solutions to limit access to shared content to trusted users.

A typical digital rights management DRM system includes a rights issuer configured to create and provide access policies or permissions associated with corresponding content items and a DRM engine that typically encrypts content items and manages users and access policies. The typical DRM system also includes DRM clients or agents for enforcing access policies associated with content items within a client device. Within each DRM system the corresponding rights issuer DRM engine and DRM agents are expected to comply with proprietary or standardized specification requirements that are specific to the DRM system. As such DRM systems employing distinct DRM technologies are not interoperable.

Also once access policies are provided to a DRM client device management of the access policies is handled by the DRM engine. Dynamically modifying the rights policies once they are delivered to a client device is either impossible or calls for an active role by the rights issuer to synchronize with the DRM engine and or the DRM agents in order to revoke previous access policies and provide new ones.

In embodiments a DRM system may be provided with a middle layer enabling support of and interoperability between different DRM technologies presented by applicants. In the embodiment DRM system DRM engines do not perform encryption user management nor access policies management. Each time a protected content item is opened on a client device corresponding access policies are requested from a corresponding DRM engine. The DRM engine forwards the request to a content protection server. The content protection server retrieves the access policies from the rights issuer and provides the retrieved access policies to the DRM engine in a format readable by the DRM engine. The access policies are then provided to the DRM client or agent to be enforced in the client device. As such the rights issuer is enabled to dynamically modify access policies at any time. At each attempt to access the content item the most recent access policies are retrieved from the rights issuer and enforced at the client device.

According to at least one example embodiment a method and corresponding content protection server for managing access to electronic content comprises retrieving access policies or permissions associated with a content item from a corresponding content sharing application or rights issuer. The access policies are translated into a format recognizable by a digital rights management DRM engine and forwarded to the DRM engine. The translated access policies are then provided by the DRM engine to a client device where the translated access policies are enforced in managing any potential access to the content item.

In order to retrieve the access policies the content protection server receives information identifying the content item from the client device. The content server then requests from the corresponding content sharing application or rights issuer the access policies associated with the content item based on the received information identifying the content item. In response to the request the rights issuer or the content sharing application sends the requested access policies to the content protection server.

Retrieving the access policies includes receiving the access policies in a format recognizable by the content protection server. The access policies are translated into the format recognizable by the content protection server by an interface associated with the content sharing application or rights issuer. The access policies in the format recognizable by the content protection server are then translated by the content protection server into a format readable or recognizable by the DRM engine.

Prior to retrieving the access policies the content protection server receives from the DRM engine user credentials for authentication. The content protection server may handle the authentication of user credentials locally. Alternatively the content protection server forwards the user credentials to the content sharing application for authentication. Once user credentials are successfully authenticated the content protection server receives information identifying the content item. The content sharing application or system is identified based on the received information identifying the content item.

Also prior to retrieving the access policies the content item is encrypted by the content protection server. Encrypting the content item includes receiving the content item from the content sharing application. An encryption protocol is then determined based on a type of the received content item. The received content item may be preprocessed based on the content item format. The content item is then encrypted based on the determined encryption protocol. The content item may further be post processed based on the content item format. The encrypted content item is provided to the user client device. The content protection server also causes the encrypted content item to be registered at the DRM engine.

The access policies are dynamic. That is on a subsequent attempt to access the content item at the user device the access policies are automatically retrieved again from the content sharing application translated and provided to the DRM engine by the content protection server. So any modification of the access policies by the content sharing application or rights issuer is included in the access policies retrieved by the content protection server upon a subsequent attempt to access the content item.

According to at least one example implementation the content protection server is coupled to two or more DRM engines. The content protection server is also coupled to two or more content sharing applications or systems.

Digital rights management DRM technologies provide solutions for secure content sharing electronic content protection and user access control to electronic content. With such solutions an entity may be able to manage who has the right to access content circulated over the Internet or other digital media and what kind of rights are granted to each potential user. Electronic content herein refers to one or more media objects such as music files images video files text documents or the like.

In a typical DRM system a rights issuer issues access rights or permissions associated with a content item or object and provides the access rights to a user device. The DRM rights are enforced at the receiving user device through a DRM client or agent. A DRM engine coupled to the DRM clients is configured to encrypt content items and manage users and access policies. Each DRM engine typically has proprietary or standardized architecture protocols encryption methods policy management and processing methods. The corresponding DRM agents and rights issuer are expected to be compliant with the specificities of the DRM engine and the DRM technology employed by the DRM system in general. As such DRM system employing distinct DRM technologies are not interoperable. In order for a user device to consume protected content by a given DRM system the user device is expected to have a complying DRM agent.

Some typical DRM systems do not enable dynamic access policies and as such access policies may not be modified once they are distributed to DRM agents. Other DRM systems require synchronization between the rights issuer and the DRM engine.

The content sharing system or application B is configured to act as a content issuer and a rights issuer. For example the content sharing system B includes a content issuer module B and a rights issuer module B. The content issuer module B is configured to circulate content B over the Internet or any other communications medium for sharing with potential users. The rights issuer module B is configured to issue permissions or access rights in association with content B for sharing by the content issuer module B with client users. The content issuer module B may include or be coupled to a content repository containing content B for sharing. The content issuer module B and the rights issuer module B may reside on the same device e.g. enterprise server personal computer or the like or on different devices.

According to at least one example embodiment the content protection server B is coupled to one or more content sharing systems B and one or more RMS servers or DRM engines e.g. B nB. The content protection server B represents an intermediate layer between the DRM engines B nB and the content sharing system s B that is agnostic to the DRM engines B nB and the content sharing system s B. The middle layer is configured to normalize content processing irrespective of the content type and handle content encryption instead of the DRM engines B nB. Specifically during a publishing phase the content protection server B is configured to encrypt the content B irrespective of the corresponding content type and provide a corresponding protected or encrypted copy B of the content to the content sharing system B. The content sharing system B may then share the encrypted content B with client users.

Also when the client user attempts to access the encrypted content B the content protection server acts as an inter operability layer between a RMS server or a DRM engine e.g. B B . . . or nB and the content sharing system B associated with the protected content B. In other words during a consumption phase of the protected content B the content protection server B translates policy objects received from the content sharing system B or the rights issuer module B into a format or language recognizable by the DRM engine e.g. B B . . . or nB.

According to at least one example embodiment the content protection server B provides an interoperability interface between fundamentally different DRM technologies at the protection layer. That is the format and or language employed in creating the access rights or permissions by the rights issuer B and the DRM technologies supported by a given DRM engine may be fundamentally different and non compliant to each other s requirements yet the content protection server B provides an interface that enables interoperability between the given content sharing system B and a given DRM engine.

The content protection server B is configured to support multiple DRM technologies and corresponding DRM engines B nB. For example the RMS servers or DRM engines B nB include a LiveCycle server from Adobe a Microsoft RMS server and or other proprietary or standardized DRM engines. The content protection server B is also configured to support multiple content sharing systems B.

According to at least one example embodiment the DRM engines B nB are used to register documents and reroute access requests from client devices to the content protection server B. The DRM engines B nB do not perform content encryption user management nor policy management. However the content protection server B may employ software development kits SDKs to match the particular DRM technology for that DRM engine. Encryption is done at the content protection server side yet the employed encryption techniques are expected to be compliant with the techniques supported by the DRM engines. When a client user attempts to open the protected content B the user device B sends a request for corresponding DRM policies or permissions is sent to a corresponding DRM engine. The DRM engine forwards the request to the content protection server B which requests the DRM policies or permissions from the content sharing system B e.g. from the policy issuer B. Upon receiving the requested access policies the content server B provides the access policies to the DRM engine which provides them to the user device to be enforced. In response to each subsequent attempt to open the content item again the same process is repeated and access policies are obtained again from the content sharing application B or the rights issuer B. Such scheme enables the content sharing application B or the rights issuer B to dynamically manage and control the access policies with the certainty that the latest updated version of the access policies is employed by a user device attempting to access the content item. For example the content sharing application B or rights issuer B may update access policies associated with content items once the content items and the corresponding policies have been distributed. The access to already distributed content items may also be revoked by the content sharing application B or rights issuer B.

At B the user device B provides an authentication window or session for the user and the user is requested to enter his user credentials. The user credentials are then sent to the content protection server B for authentication. According to one example implementation the content protection server B may handle the authentication locally if for example the content protection server B maintains a database of authentic user credentials for each user. Alternatively the user credentials received by the content protection server are sent to the content sharing application B for authentication. Once user credentials are authenticated an indication of successful authentication is sent to the user device B. Once the user credentials are authenticated at B the user device B sends at B the information identifying the encrypted content item B to the DRM engine B again. The user device B may also send a notification to the DRM engine B indicating that user credentials are successfully authenticated.

At B the DRM engine B forwards the information identifying the encrypted content item B to the content protection server B. The content protection server B sends a request at B to the content sharing application B requesting access policies or permissions based on the information identifying the encrypted content item B. The content protection server B stores for example a database mapping information identifying content items to corresponding content sharing applications B rights issuers or corresponding plug in modules B. At B the plugin module B translates the requested access policies into a format or language recognizable by the content protection server B and the translated access policies are sent at B to content protection server B. Alternatively the translation to a format or language recognizable by the content protection server B may be performed by a translation module within or associated with the content protection server B.

The plug in module B resides at the content sharing application B. The plug in module B is implemented for example as an application on top a plug in an extension of the content sharing application B or the like. The plug in module B translates B permissions or DRM policies specific to the content sharing application B or the corresponding rights issuer B into a format or language recognizable by the content protection server B. The content protection server B stores information that enables mapping the encrypted content item B to a corresponding content sharing application B or plug in module B. Upon receiving permissions for a specific document the plug in module may be able to identify what content sharing application or plug in to call for the specific document in the authorization phase.

The content protection server B translates at B the access policies into a format or language recognizable by the DRM engine B and sends B the access policies in the format or language recognizable by the DRM engine B to the DRM engine B. The DRM engine forwards B the access policies received to the user device B. The access policies are enforced B in the user device B for example by a corresponding DRM agent.

The process described with respect to is performed again with each subsequent attempt to access the encrypted content item B in the user device B and each time the latest version of the access policies is obtained from the content sharing application and enforced at the user device B therefore enabling dynamic access policies that are managed by the content sharing application B or the rights issuer.

The content protection server B includes a set of application programming interfaces APIs which provide to third parties a public interface for accessing functionalities associated with the content protection server. Such APIs include analytics APIs policy management APIs document management APIs and user management APIs. Analytics APIs provide third parties with access to a set of functions that upon use by a developer of a content sharing application B return a set of data which represents the information that a user device conveyed to a DRM system regarding usage of a content item. Policy management APIs provide a third party with access to a set of functions that enables the developer of a content sharing application to manage local policies or access rights. Document management APIs provide access to a third party to a set of functions that enables a developer of a content sharing application through a customization module to encrypt content items. The user management APIs provide access to the a third party to a set of functions that helps a developer of a content sharing application to implement functionality related to managing users in a DRM system B.

The content protection server B has queuing services built in that enable processing one or more content items received for encryption asynchronously and in a scalable fashion. The content protection server B also provides encryption services including algorithms and DRM specific protocols for encrypting content items received by the content protection server B. The content protection server B is also configured to process documents. Specifically the content protection server B is configured to provide logic and algorithms to pre process or post process content items that are received by the content protection server B before or after encryption. According to at least one example embodiment the content protection server B is a computer cloud server. Alternatively the content protection server B is a computer server residing on the same network as the content sharing application B. According to yet another example embodiment some modules of the content protection server e.g. an encryption module for performing encryption is implemented within the same computer network as the content sharing application B while other modules are implemented on a cloud computer server.

In embodiments a method of managing access to electronic content may comprise retrieving by a content protection server access rights associated with a content item from a corresponding content sharing application translating the access rights retrieved into a digital rights management DRM format recognizable by a DRM engine and forwarding to the DRM engine the translated access rights the translated access rights being provided by the DRM engine to a user device and employed by the user device to provide access to the content item. Retrieving the access rights may include receiving information identifying the content item from the user device requesting from the corresponding content sharing application the access rights associated with the content item based on the received information identifying the content item and receiving the access rights requested. The determining of the corresponding content sharing application may be based on information accessible to the content protection server the information mapping the information identifying the content item to the corresponding content sharing application. Translating the access rights retrieved into a DRM format that may be recognizable by the DRM engine may include for example first translating the access rights retrieved into a format associated with the content protection server and then translating the first translated access rights in the format associated with the content protection server into the DRM format recognizable by the DRM engine. An instance of user credentials may be received and the received instance of user credentials may be authenticated based on stored information indicative of corresponding authentic user. An instance of user credentials may be received and the received instance of user credentials forwarded to the content sharing application for authentication. The access rights may be managed dynamically by the content sharing application. The content protection server may be a cloud server. The content protection server may reside in the same network as the content sharing application. The content item may be encrypted and the encrypted content item may be provided to the user device prior to retrieving the access rights. Encrypting the content item may include receiving the content item from the content sharing application determining an encryption protocol based on a type of the received content item pre processing the content item by employing one or more predetermined logic based on the content item format encrypting the content item based on the determined encryption protocol post processing the content item by employing one or more predetermined logic based on the content item format and the like. The content item may be registered within the DRM engine. In embodiments an apparatus for managing access to electronic content may comprise a processor and a memory with computer code instructions stored thereon the processor and the memory with the computer code instructions stored thereon being configured to retrieve access rights associated with a content item from a corresponding content sharing application translate the access rights retrieved into a digital rights management DRM format recognizable by a DRM engine and forward to the DRM engine the translated access rights the translated access rights being provided by the DRM engine to a user device and employed by the content rendering system to provide access to the content item. In retrieving the access rights the processor and the memory with the computer code instructions stored thereon may be configured to receive information identifying the content item from the content rendering system to request from the corresponding content sharing application the access rights associated with the content item based on the received information identifying the content item and to receive the access rights requested. In retrieving the access rights the processor and the memory with the computer code instructions stored thereon may be configured to determine the corresponding content sharing application based on information accessible to the content protection server the information mapping the information identifying the content item to the corresponding content sharing application. In translating the access rights into the DRM format recognizable by the DRM engine the processor and the memory with the computer code instructions stored thereon may be configured to first translate the access rights retrieved into a format associated with the apparatus and translating the first translated access rights in the format associated with the apparatus into the DRM format recognizable by the DRM engine.

The access rights may be dynamically managed by a rights issuer module associated with the content sharing application. The apparatus may be a cloud server. The apparatus may reside in a same network as the content sharing application. The processor and the memory with the computer code instructions stored thereon may be configured to encrypt the content item and provide the content item encrypted to the user device prior to retrieving the access rights. The processor and the memory with the computer code instructions stored thereon may be configured to receive the content item from the content sharing application determine an encryption protocol based on a type of the received content item and encrypt the content item based on the determined encryption protocol. The processor and the memory with the computer code instructions stored thereon may be configured to cause the encrypted content item to be registered at the DRM engine. The apparatus may be coupled to two or more DRM engines. The apparatus may be able to be coupled with two or more user devices or content applications.

In embodiments a dynamic entitlement management facility may provide greater control over end point or recipient content access through a community of users work stream domain geography such as through digital rights management DRM contextual control or information rights management IRM . IRM may be used herein as an alternative wherever DRM is used. Contextual content management and collaboration may be managed for communications coordination and collaboration of content context and community. For instance contextual control may be managed for communications comprising content entitlement distribution collection in the context of real time communications e.g. instant messaging notifications activity streams tagging of content and the like for a contact network of users subscribed set of users e.g. blogs news and the like. Contextual coordination management may involve content with respect to work streams work flows approvals compliance in the context of calendars action items dashboards archiving retention compliance within directories groups memberships and the like. Contextual collaboration management may comprise content with respect to editing redlining annotation in the context of group calendars team wikis meeting management within portals discussion boards expert networks dashboards analytics and the like. Collaboration coordination and communication may be managed with respect to the context of content usage amongst a select number of users or within a community. In embodiments dynamic entitlement permissioning may be based on groups that are dynamically created to assign rights where groups may cross organizational boundaries where assignments are based on collaboration relationships that are not stable and the like where group enablement is made to be dynamic to changing conditions.

The dynamic entitlement management facility may utilize an enterprise policy to override a user s personal DRM based entitlement permissions e.g. access sync share and the like . For example an enterprise policy may dynamically override a user s entitlement permissions to ensure intellectual property protection leakage protection where the user is dealing with content in an enterprise context. At the same time the enterprise is dealing with the content context of a user s entitlements. The organization s policy on people context and content may be enabled to override the individual user s choices such as based on geographic location location context network conditions collaboration connectivity and the like. For instance a user may have personal level of permission to access a document because they are the owner of the document but the enterprise may deem through a policy facility that the user should not be able to access the document within the context of their current location e.g. foreign country competitor enterprise location public network and the like . In embodiments dynamic entitlement may be determined based upon dynamic risk rated DRM protection where the system assigns a dynamic risk rating DRR to a user and based on that DRR apply dynamic DRM protection controls. For instance a DRR may be assigned to a user when they login sign in authenticate and the like and may change as conditions associated with the user change. The level of control applied to a document even if the person is the owner of the document may be based on their current risk profile as determined by the assigned DRR. For example the user may be in China and the system may assign a DRR that only permits a user to access documents in a certain format. The DRR may be based on IP address geography data node factors e.g. who controls the nodes that data has to travel across type of data metadata action the user wishes to take and the like. In embodiments there may be a matrix of DRR states such as where the DRM is based on a current DRR. In embodiments DRR may be extended beyond document access such as being associated with different features in the system. For example if a user s risk score is not higher than X they may not be enabled to start a work flow and they might have to go to an organizational level administrator to start work flow if their risk level is high e.g. due to being in a risky place geographically or where the user is on the network . The DRR may have a classification such as highly sensitive low sensitivity and the like. A DRR risk score for a document may be based on the content based on who handles it key words presence of CVV or SSN numbers document type document metadata size of document presence of types of information e.g. code and the like .

In embodiments dynamic entitlement may involve extending a user s personal DRM based entitlement permissions e.g. access sync share and the like . For example an enterprise policy may dynamically extend or open up a user s permissions to a set of DRM documents within a computing environment such as based on a policy a user s profile e.g. a user s position in the company a user s access level a user s work group or division or the like a user operating criteria e.g. automatically providing access to DRM documents based on the user working in a secure computing environment and the like. Extending a user s DRM based entitlement permissions may relate to DRM documents that the user has permission to access or to DRM documents that they do not have explicit permission to access. For example a user may normally have to provide authentication each time they access a new DRM document. However the dynamic entitlement management facility may provide such as through a policy and after a single authentication automatic access to all documents the user has DRM permission to access within a predefined computing environment. For instance the user may be provided permissions to all DRM documents to which the user has DRM such as saved on the user s hard drive while the user is in communication with the dynamic entitlement management facility to all DRM documents the user has DRM access to that are stored within an enterprise network while the user is behind the enterprise s firewall and the like. In this way the user may be saved from having to provide authentication for each document they have DRM permission to access while the user is within a policy determined secure computing environment. In another example the dynamic entitlement management facility may extend a user s DRM permissions beyond the permissions explicitly determined in the DRM permissions of a document. For instance the DRM permissions of a document may explicitly specify one or more users with permissions associated with access to the document and upon authentication those users are able to access edit print and the like the document. However the DRM permissions may also provide for a policy determined access by users other than those with explicit permissions. For instance the CEO of a corporation may have global permissions to access a DRM document an engineer of an enterprise may have permission to open any of a class of DRM protected technical documents an employee of an enterprise may have permission to open any of a class of DRM protected documents created by the enterprise while the user is inside the enterprise network firewall and the like. In this way an enterprise may specify extended permissions for DRM protected documents to accommodate specific needs for document access.

Access to a DRM protected document may require a user to authenticate. Authentication has traditionally been provided at the document level where a user would need to authenticate for each document the user accesses. In addition DRM protected documents downloaded from a remote location such as from the secure server of the present invention may have required the user to authenticate twice once on the remote location to gain access to download the document and once on the user s local computer storage to access the downloaded document. Although the DRM protection may offer needed security the user experience can become burdensome with regard to this need to continually authenticate on a document by document basis. In embodiments a DRM authentication service may be provided to keep a user authenticated as long as a set of authentication conditions or context are maintained. Context may involve the user maintaining an active session with the service the user remaining in a particular computer environment e.g. uniquely logged into their machine and the like. One of the ways the DRM authentication service may provide this continued authentication is by loading a unique machine registration token onto the user s computer environment e.g. a combination of computer hardware and operating system thus allowing the DRM authentication service to see that the user is working from a computer environment that has been verified. As long as the user maintains these conditions the user may seamlessly navigate amongst documents to which they have DRM permission to access. For instance a user may log into the service at the beginning of their day from their personal computing device authenticate for a first access to a first DRM document and then as long as the authentication conditions don t change that is as long as the user is still logged into the same device the user maintains the ability to access this document a second time to access any other DRM document for which the user has rights to access download a DRM document from the secure server to their local machine and open the document and the like without re authenticating. Thus in this example as long as a user is logged into the DRM authentication service such as located on the secure server the calls made by application DRM agents to the DRM authentication service are validated by the document application e.g. Microsoft Office Adobe Reader .

In embodiments the information provided in an authentication context may include a machine registration. For instance the first time a user accesses a protected document on a given machine a machine ID may be generated and stored on the physical machine. The association between machine ID and the user ID may be stored with the DRM authorization service e.g. on the secure server for validation of future authentication requests. The machine ID is unique such as tied to the combination of a physical machine and OS user login. For example in the case of two different users sharing the same physical machine but each logging in with his her own username password there will be two distinct machine IDs issued to the two users. The same user logging into two different machines with the same credentials will have two distinct machine IDs. The machine is ID persistent survives machine restarts upgrades and is not easily removed from a machine. With the machine ID included in an authentication context the DRM protection is maintained even when one physical machine is used by a number of different users. In embodiments other ID capabilities may be utilized such as through the user of biometric identifiers.

In embodiments the DRM authentication service may provide a user with access to DRM protected documents without having to explicitly provide their credentials in an authentication as long as it can be validated that they have maintained an active session with the DRM authentication service. Authentication may be required only at the start of an active session such as with the first requested access to a DRM protected document. At the time of this first user authentication the DRM authentication service may store a context for the authentication that is used to authenticate future access requests by the user. For example a user may request access to a document stored on the secure server and download the document to the user s local disk. Recall that in past systems the user would have had to authenticate at the time of access for the download as well as when they subsequently open the document on their local disk. However the DRM authentication service utilizes context from the first access to authenticate the second access. For instance at the time of download a context may be recorded as a record of the context of the access such as including a download ID timestamp client IP user ID token and the like. The downloaded document may be encrypted and have the download ID embedded in it. The user then opens the document through the document s source application which makes a call to the DRM authentication service to authenticate and authorize access. The DRM authentication service may then generate a context for this second access request such as including a download id timestamp machine id client IP user id and the like. With the information from context and context the system is able to validate the second access if the conditions for access have not changed. For instance if the information from context is consistent with the information from context the second access is granted. However if when the DRM authentication service finds a difference or finds no record of a context then the user would be prompted to provide authentication. In embodiments once the second context context has been utilized to access the document one of the context and context may be invalidated or deleted so that there is only one current context for future access authentications. For example the context may be invalidated for subsequent access authentications once the context information is obtained where context is then used for a next access request. This non limiting example is meant to be illustrative of the system s process but one skilled in the art will appreciate that other access scenarios may also be accommodated. For instance the example describes a scenario where the user downloads and accesses a protected document on their local disk but the system may similarly enable a user to access a second protected document on their local disk a second protected document stored on the secure server a protected document received from another user and the like. As long as the context established in a previous access authentication matches the context for a current access request e.g. the user is still logged onto the DRM authentication service the ID for the user matches the ID for the machine matches the current access request may be granted without the user being prompted for authentication. provide a DRM authentication service flow diagram with three illustrative access request scenarios in relation to use of the DRM authentication service after a document has been DRM protected including interactions between the user the secure server encryption process a services API the DRM authentication service. Scenario is where the user is making a first access request under a set of contextual conditions such as in the first access request in a session with the DRM authentication service scenario is where the user is making an access request in an active session and scenario is where the user is making an access request in a non active session. A B and provide alternate DRM authentication service flow diagrams where the document is a PDF document.

In embodiments DRM protection in combination with dynamic adaptive multi factor authentication may be provided through a browser view of a protected file. For instance a user may restrict access by providing a second user only a portion of a file rather than the whole file based on the second user s risk level. Alternatively a user may provide a second user with extended permissions such as based on the second user s profile e.g. the CEO of the company geographic location e.g. the second user is inside the firewall of their enterprise secure network connection e.g. inside the enterprise firewall and the like. In embodiments DRM protection may be used to restrict or extend DRM protection through policy user profiles a current state of a user and the like.

In embodiments the dynamic entitlement management facility may include a document destruction and retention policy where DRM policies are utilized for archiving and destruction of documents. For instance information is stored with DRM so that the file will expire based on its DRM when the time is right without further action so that self destruction of the document is based on DRM. This self destruction DRM mechanism may be able to be overridden. A user may be able to set up an auto reminder to the central storage location to confirm that the destruction policy has been carried out is still valid e.g. not suspended by a litigation order has been overridden an the like. In embodiments a corporate record such as recorded in metadata with the document may be kept with a document such as where the corporate record includes a history annotations and the like of the document e.g. who looked at the document under what conditions the document has been viewed who has set or altered a self destruct parameter the date for self destruction and the like. In embodiments the annotations and or history of a document may be separately protected. For instance there may be one DRM protection assigned to the document and another assigned to the information stored in a related file or as metadata attached to the file such that a user may be able to access the document but not the information or be able to access the information but not the document. In this way an enterprise would be able to assign permissions based on a need to know where an administrator for instance may be permitted to view metadata for a document but not the content of the document and a user or editor of the document may be able to view the content of the document but not be permitted to view the metadata for the document.

In embodiments the dynamic entitlement management facility may be implemented on a secure server remote from an enterprise in the cloud local to the enterprise e.g. inside the enterprise firewall on a user s computing device through a web browser and the like. Implementation of the dynamic entitlement management facility may not require the use of a plug in such as by extending native APIs extended to provide DRM on content. The dynamic entitlement facility may be implemented without any plug ins agents or any other additional software installation on the client making end user device and the like. For instance in a traditional DRM configuration a client device attempting to open a DRM document may have to access services e.g. for encryption authentication active directory in order to gain permission to open the document such as through utilization of a plug in for that specific DRM technology. The dynamic entitlement management facility may comprise DRM services internal to the secure server configuration such that the user s client device does not have to access any external services such as for encryption authentication permissions and the like. For example once the user is logged into the system the user may not have to authenticate again when the want to open a DRM document because the system already knows the user s permissions e.g. through a one time token password and the like .

In embodiments the dynamic entitlement management facility may enable an offline mode while allowing a user to work in a protected environment e.g. online and offline modes while in a protected mode . The dynamic entitlement management facility may provide for group level policy control with policy set ranking external share restrictions device location restrictions policies that permit sharing by device access to approved domains to restrict browser and kiosk asks secure shared link policies password password strength link expiration mobile data plan policies mobile editing policies restricted third party applications mobile sync controls automated deletion file control policies and the like.

In embodiments a secure managed key facility may be provided for managing the use of encryption keys such as for managed content sharing between users in a secure sharing and un sharing facility managing access to content through digital rights management content sharing amongst users in a customizable secure exchange platform e.g. exchange of content between data nodes sharing data across heterogeneous content repositories in a federated access environment and the like such as described in this disclosure. Encryption keys may utilize symmetric key algorithms e.g. use of the same key for both encryption and decryption asymmetric key algorithms e.g. public private key usage with a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption and the like to provide secure communications and encrypted content files between users and systems. depicts a functional flow diagram of an embodiment for the secure managed key facility involving managing key usage between two user clients where in this embodiment one user is a sender client and the other user is the receiver client of a content file . Both users in addition to the sender communicating the content file to the receiver also communicate with the secure managed key facility as part of a secure management protocol which in turn communicates with a key store .

The secure management protocol may involve the exchange of various certificates between the secure managed key facility and the users. For instance the secure management key facility may provide account certificates licensor certificates user licenses and the like to the users as part of the process of securely exchanging documents between users as well as utilizing different encryption key algorithms used in the communications and encryption of information and content files. For example the sender client may request to the secure managed key facility to send a document securely to the receiver client . The secure managed key facility may then send both the sender client and the receiver client various certificates that enable or validate the secure communication of the file content from the sender client to the receiver client. Amongst the certificates to the sender client the secure managed key facility may provide the sender client with a content key for encrypting the content file for transmission to the receiver client. The sender client may then use the content key to encrypt the content file and transmit it to the receiver client. In addition the sender may provide an access policy with the encrypted content file which the receiver client must comply with in order to be granted access to the content file. The access policy may be a digital rights management access policy such as described in this disclosure.

One aspect of the secure management protocol is the management of the content key. For instance one possible method for management of the content key is to provide the content key to the sender client have the sender client encrypt the content file with the content key and send the receiver client the encrypted content file along with the content key such as where communications are encrypted with a public key. In addition the communication may also include an access policy selected by the sending client. The receiving client receives the encrypted content file encrypted with the content key. The receiver client may then communicate with the secure managed key facility e.g. the receiver client providing the secure managed key facility with the encrypted content key and access policy to determine whether it has the right to access the content file and if access is granted such as per the access policy the secure managed key facility may then provide the receiver client with a decryption key. However this process involves transferring the content key amongst the various parties and thus exposes the content key to unauthorized capture e.g. through computer hacking Further if the content key is used for multiple document exchanges multiple clients and such then the unauthorized capture of the content key potentially places many communications at risk.

In an alternate protocol reducing the extent to which the content key is exposed to other parties especially the receiving client may better protect the content key against unauthorized capture and subsequent hacking. In embodiments the content key may be generated by the secure managed key facility such as when the sending client requests a secure transfer and is stored in the key store along with a content key reference. The secure managed key facility then sends the content key and the content key reference to the sender client which then encrypts the content file as in the first example. However this time the sender client does not transmit the content key to the receiver user but rather transmits the content key reference to the receiver user. In embodiments the sender client may then discard the content key. The receiving user may then communicate with the secure managed key facility for access as before but with the content key reference rather then the content key itself. The secure managed key facility may then use the content key reference to retrieve the content key from the key store and provide the receiver user with a decryption key if access is permitted. Thus by transferring a content key reference in the content file exchange the content key is more secure creating a more secure content exchange environment. In embodiments encrypted communications between the secure managed key facility and the sender and receiver clients may be encrypted with a key e.g. a public key provided by the secure managed key facility.

Various rights management services exist implemented to manage the exchange and uses of rights protected content that is distributed through computer networks such as the types of content shared in the environments described throughout this disclosure. An example used in connection with servers that employ the Windows operating system relates to Active Directory Rights Management Services AD RMS or RMS . Components of computer networks that employ RMS have trusted connections among each other that are implemented by a set of certificates. Enforcing the validity of these certificates is a core function of RMS technology. Each item of rights protected content such as a file a sender wishes to share with a receiver is published along with a license that expresses the conditions that apply to the use of the content. Each consumer of the content receives a form of license that reads interprets and enforces the usage rules. Thus a given type of license corresponds to a particular type of certificate. License rights can be expressed in computer readable forms such as expressed in a mark up language such as eXtensible rights Markup Language XrML . The certificates and licenses used in RMS may be connected in a hierarchy so that a client can parse a chain from a particular certificate or license through a series of trusted certificates arriving at a trusted key pair.

One type of certificate is the server licensor certificate SLC which typically contains a unique public key that corresponds to a server or a cluster of servers that operate as a single logical server . In the example of AD RMS the SLC is created when the AD RMS server is configured or the first server in a cluster . The server generates a unique SLC for itself that establishes its identity referred to in some cases as self enrollment . The public key is provided for long term validity such as two hundred fifty years so that rights protected content can be archived for long durations. In embodiments a root cluster handles both certification by issuing a rights account certificate RAC and licensing of rights protected content. Other servers added to the given root cluster may share an SLC. In complex environments licensing only clusters can be deployed each of which generates an SLC. Thus a fundamental characteristic of conventional implementation of RMS is that each entity that interacts with the RMS system is represented by a single specific certificate.

SLC certificates use the eXtensible Rights Markup Language XrML rather than a more standard form of certificate which allows SLC certificates to express complex lists of RMS access rights. The SLC is a self signed certificate and the private key corresponding to this certificate is used by the RMS server to protect other certificates used in the RMS system. The public key in this certificate is then typically used by RMS clients to encrypt materials that only the RMS server can decrypt. Client machines have an RMS machine certificate sometimes referred to as a Security Processor SPC . The SPC is used to authenticate each machine to the RMS system and allows machines to encrypt other RMS related data that s stored locally on the computer.

Another aspect of the secure management protocol involves the use of an asymmetric public private key pair to encrypt communications and content between different parties such as provided in connection with at least one of the certificates such as SLC certificates issued in the secure management protocol. For instance the secure managed key facility after it determines that the receiver user has permission to access the content file may send the receiver user the decryption key to decrypt the content file encrypted with the public key associated with the SLC certificate containing the public key issued by the server that is capable of decrypting the content file. However if the same public key is used for all of the communications for a plurality of users of a given server there is a risk that an unauthorized user may obtain the key and hack it such as using brute force decryption methods thus compromising the security of all content for the plurality of users that is secured by that particular server or cluster of servers. An improvement to the protocol can be made to increase the security of the certificate of a given server typically the SLC certificate by splitting the certificate of a given server or cluster into multiple virtual certificates. Since a certificate is comprised of a certificate chain containing the public key and the expression of the rights management rules and licenses for the content in question a certificate with a different pair of public private keys may be generated on a per user basis e.g. a particular company individual or group even if there are different users that use the server or cluster to secure content. Therefore all the operations that the particular virtual certificate was used for will be used with a specific user pair of public private keys. If a given user s public private key is compromised only the documents that were generated for that user will be compromised thus not affecting other documents generated from that server or cluster within the secure managed key facility. The virtual certificates containing pairs of public private keys for a given server or cluster may be stored independently in a different storage system according to the user s security requirements. In addition hardware security module solutions could be used in conjunction for increased confidentiality.

Customer managed keys CMK may provide the ability for customers to control their own data encryption keys i.e. for data at rest such as provided by inserting an additional step in the basic encryption process such as shown in . In this way both the system provided keys and the customer keys are needed in order to access the data such that neither can do it alone. An example sequence of the encryption processing may include the steps of generating random data key and key ID per file encrypting file with the data key encrypting the data key with a customer key and encrypting the data key with a system master key where the encrypted data key and key ID are stored in a database. Customers may be provided a partition of keys such as through a hardware security module that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides crypto processing. These modules traditionally come in the form of a plug in card or an external device that is separate from and attaches directly to a computer or network server. Customer keys may be partitioned such that users on the secure server side may be able to access the partition e.g. to identify to what parties sets of keys have been provided but such that the users on the secure server side are not able to see the actual keys. The customer may be able to access the partition through an external device such as a USB key into a laptop encrypt with the customer s key then encrypt with the secure server master key thus creating a double encrypted key at their own site. Customers may be able to generate a new key on demand supply an existing key rotate a key disable a key manage multiple keys per organization per business group and the like. Key management such as in key based service versions helps keep distributed attacks from succeeding. For instance when a new key is introduced into services the older keys may be such that they no longer work so even if there is an attacker in the system it can t use the same keys for repeated attacks. As a further protection of the customer s keys unencrypted or decrypted keys may be stored apart from the secure server or orchestration services layer such as only with the customer on their enterprise premises or network such as in a data node controlled by the customer and the like. As such the unencrypted or decrypted keys are prevented from being compromised from the orchestration server side and remain in control with the customer.

In embodiments a CMK implementation may use a data key to encrypt content that is separate from the master encryption key and also separate from the customer encryption key. This separation has a number of advantages. By having a data key that is used to encrypt the files in the file processing servers the system is able to apply significant processing power to the encryption and decryption of files e.g. outside of the hardware security module HSM in order to achieve high throughput. The HSM encryption processing may be limited to encrypting and decrypting the data key which may be done by passing the data key e.g. a very small number of bytes when compared to MB GB TB of content files into the HSM and requesting it to encrypt or decrypt the data key. The HSM then returns the result which the system is then able to use to encrypt or decrypt the actual content files. By having the customer key stored inside the HSM and restricting system access to that key to only use the key within the HSM the system provides customers full control over whether their content can be decrypted or not without the system ever having access to the customer key. This approach has benefits during key rotation because customers are able to define a new key while their old key is still active. During the key rotation process the system keeps track of which key was used to encrypt each unique data key using a key ID for reference. When a user requests viewing a file the system looks to see which customer key old or new was used to encrypt the data key and asks the HSM module to use that key to decrypt the data key so the system can then decrypt the file. Once all the data keys have been rotated decrypted with the old key and re encrypted with the new key the customer can tell the HSM to delete the old key and the rotation process is complete without the system every having access to either the old or new key and without the system ever being required to deny access to the files. Service providers who do not have unique data keys per file and instead encrypt and decrypt files directly within the HSM server would be limited by how much data they can process at any given time throughput of HSM being defined by the rate at which files can be encrypted decrypted . Since the system data keys are small such as just a few hundred bytes each the system may be able to process all data keys for a customer s entire service in a very short period of time e.g. tens of minutes . Without this system in place a system would potentially need weeks months to do the same or be limited to other key rotation processes such as requiring the old keys to stay in service as long as the files need to be accessed.

Referring to a process for encryption processing with a customer key is shown where a CMK service is inserted between the secure server and the customer HSM devices. Here a user is shown uploading a file to the secure server which encrypts and stores the file with an automatically generated data key. A request is then made to the CMK service for the data key to be encrypted with the customer key. The CMK service then sends the data key key ID and the use user to the HSM to be encrypted by the customer key. In embodiments a use user may be provided to serve in a special role that can request the HSM to encrypt and decrypt data. However the use user may be bared from any activity related to managing the encryption keys e.g. view disable delete or create but they are able to ask the HSM to use a key based on the key ID the system passes in. In an example each customer partition may have two types of users 1 a Partition Owner who manages the keys i.e. the customer and 2 a use user who is able to call the HSM and have processing done for it without actually having access to the key values.

Continuing to refer to the HSM then encrypts the data key with the customer key using the key ID and use user provided which is then passed back to the secure server where the encrypted data key is encrypted with the master key. The doubly encrypted data key and content file are then stored and the unencrypted data key from memory is destroyed. shows a top level diagram of how a customer has direct access to manage their keys where a user uploads and downloads content files and client services turns on CMK for the user. In addition professional services may be used to configure the system where a customer key manager may create disable and enable keys directly through the HSM.

In embodiments customer managed keys may be assigned at any level of granularity such as at the organization level per business group at an exchange level per content item and the like providing the highest level of possible control and yielding the smallest possible exposure if any one key is compromised. In this way the secure exchange may provide customers with multiple level CMK protection in order to prevent anyone from improperly accessing documents stored within the secure exchange environment. For example a law firm utilizing the secure exchange may have many clients each with many cases. Within each case there may be different aspects that need to be separately protected specific documents that are particularly sensitive and the like. Granular control of CMK enables the law firm to apply individual CMK to each of their clients for each case within a client to groups of documents to collaborative exchanges to individual documents e.g. word processing documents spreadsheets or content items e.g. photos audio files . In another example multiple organizational entities acting in a collaborative relationship and sharing content through the secure exchange may implement levels of CMK control that not only includes granular control within each of their organizations but for shared content again at any level of granularity. For instance some content may be CMK controlled by a first organizational entity some by a second and some jointly between the two. In this way organizations may utilize CMK to control protection to content from the intermediate entity managing the secure exchange from other collaborative organizations between departments and the like as well as to specific content. At all levels of CMK control there may be different individuals with control over keys. CMK may be applied at multiple layers and amongst different collaborative entities. For instance a manager of a department may have control of keys to content related to their department but there may also be a company wide CMK control over all company content individual CMK control for a specific content item and the like. By offering CMK at all levels of organization and content the secure exchange maximizes the ability for organizations to protect their content against the threat that any one key or group of keys is compromised. In addition CMK granularity enables different levels of access protection providing a means for organizations or individuals to immediately block access to CMK protected content acting as a type of kill switch or red button to deny access to all content protected through that key at that granular level of protection.

Customer managed keys may provide the ability for customers to control their own data encryption keys where the customer managed keys are protected through DRM technologies. In addition to system provided keys and customer keys needed in order to access the data DRM protection may be utilized to increase the protection and the access control for key management. For instance DRM protection for customer managed keys may provide access control that is controlled through a listing a policy and or contextually e.g. the user s location the security level provided by a network connection .

In embodiments the system may authenticate request messages at the application layer using a cryptographically secure keyed hash such as HMAC SHA1 which may enable protection from illegitimate requests.

In embodiments a collaborative customer relationship management CRM facility may be used in conjunction with a multi party collaboration in order to track contacts and communications of participants. For example CRM may be used in conjunction with a deal amongst enterprises such as in putting together a merger syndicated loan and the like. A data room for a deal normally has all of the relevant documents with rights and permissions assigned based on the role of individuals who support the deal e.g. an enterprise user 1 can look at IP diligence folder X as part of Task Y from a due diligence checklist . As described herein the data room may carry through a work flow of a deal from stage to stage so that the documents not only get to the right people but the whole process moves from stage to stage in an organized way. CRM may be included in this process such as when the deal involves a sales process or other process that benefits from storing information about the relationships of an entity to another entity or to the individuals within the other entity including tracking the interactions with such other individuals the role and status of such other individuals the opinions or positions of such other individuals the plans of such other individuals the need of such other individuals and other relationship relevant or project relevant information. For example in a big loan deal individuals are responsible for filling out tranches of debt by getting other individuals to commit to making a portion of the loan. So within the data room work flow it may be good to have CRM information such as contact information but more importantly information about the ongoing interactions with each contact person involved in the piece by piece building out of the transaction. e.g. a CRM system may store information like the fact that Person A at bank X is looking to take 20 of loan tranche Y but he needs to look at documents P and Q then get approval from his boss Person B and Next steps include checking in with Person A and Person B etc. . The CRM information can be consulted to develop an appropriate workflow and to initiate a series of actions within an overall collaborative exchange environment that complete the workflow. The CRM facility may track interaction characteristics with respect to participants gauge participant interest control what content individuals are able to view and access record conversations between individuals e.g. conversations with potential borrowers and investors in a syndicated loan deal and the like. The CRM facility may provide for communication and collaboration facilities including live messaging capabilities such as a secure messaging service including instant messaging or associated with commercial instant messaging platforms and the like. Integration services may be provided that enable users to embed messaging and directory functionality into third party applications e.g. word processing applications presentation applications spreadsheet applications and various enterprise software applications and workflows including workflows associated with various functions of an enterprise workflows associated with transactions and various others . Messaging facilities may be collaborative secure and fully auditable e.g. one on one multi party blast chat rooms and the like . Control of permissions for communications between individuals may be controlled through preferences determined by exchange participation enabled through contact parameters and the like.

In embodiments the CRM facility may provide collaborative interconnection with individuals within a marketplace such as a loan marketplace such as in a centralized global network of organizations and their contacts including borrowers in need of debt financing e.g. credit banks in need of business e.g. deals fees and league table status investors lenders in need of debt portfolio growth and or corporate relationships legal counsel in need of business and reputation sponsors in need of corporate relationships revenue and reputation and the like. Individuals within the marketplace may be provided contact information such as the individual s organization role e.g. borrower arranger investor lender counsel arranger and lender bank lender client relationship client profile status e.g. active vs. inactive interested vs. not interested etc. hierarchy of entities roles and personnel historical deal association deal specific contacts contact types and roles and the like. The CRM facility may provide control facilities for contacts such that users are incentivized to maintain their own profiles and connect with other community members. The CRM facility may provide a secure collaborative environment where community members choose their own privacy settings and control how they interact and are viewed by others. The CRM facility may provide search criteria with respect to contacts within the system invitation and solicitation features visibility settings advanced data mining and the like such as based on industry preferences.

In embodiments a secure exchange facility with various features and functions described throughout this disclosure may implement access rules that utilize a combination of IP address domain name and the like to restrict access to the secure exchange facility such as where a business entity restricts access to a specified set of IP addresses associated with a specified domain name. For instance an organizational entity e.g. a business entity governmental agency or the like utilizing the services of the secure exchange facility may provide a list of acceptable IP addresses for specified network domains that the secure exchange facility may then use to establish an access restriction rule. For example the rule may be applied to ensure that any user accessing the secure exchange facility using an email address from one of the domains specified in the rule can only do so if the device through which the user is seeking access is utilizing one of the IP addresses specified in the rule for that domain. Similarly a rule may be applied to ensure that any user accessing the secure exchange facility utilizing one of the IP addresses specified in the rule must be logging in using an email address that belongs to one of the domains specified in the rule for that set of domains and the like. As a result the organizational entity may benefit by restricting a user from accessing the secure exchange facility from a personal computer or other device that may be unauthorized or unsecure and downloading confidential or sensitive work documents. Similarly such rules may restrict a user from accessing the secure exchange facility from their work computer and uploading confidential work documents from their work machine to an account that they can later access from a personal computer at home and the like. These IP and domain based restriction rules may prevent users from sharing confidential work information including with themselves such as through alternate accounts in such a way that the users can further share it with someone outside the business who should not have access to the information. For example this type of IP based or domain based restriction may benefit a wide range of entities that are charged with avoiding leakage of confidential information such as large financial institutions secure facilities government entities and many others. In embodiments these complementary IP and or domain based restriction rules may work in conjunction with the organizational entity s information technology physical security. For example companies that leverage a domain plus IP range rule are also likely to turn off their users ability to plug devices into the USB ports. USB ports are one way for users to steal company information and the IP and or domain based restriction rules compliment the IT process that restricts USB stealing by also preventing an Internet based approach to the same activity.

In embodiments the secure exchange facility may provide application programming interface API functionality such as to provide various interfaces to secure exchange functions components modules services applications and the like that are accessible to other applications simply by calling the appropriate API. API calls may be public or private used internally within the secure exchange facility or provided to outside business entities and users. The system may utilize language specific APIs such as a RESTful API that makes it easier to integrate into or with various applications. In embodiments the secure exchange server may provide various building block application components that are capable of interfacing through an API of the secure exchange server and through which an outside user may access one or more of the components and or assemble multiple components to create or enhance a customized application where the application maintains the security of exchanged information while running the application or components thereof on the secure exchange platform or other secure server. Secure exchange services may be capable of using multiple versions of APIs so that new services can be brought online before older versions of the service are taken offline.

In embodiments the secure exchange facility may include or be provided with an associated software development kit SDK which may include components functions services or the like that facilitate the development of applications that integrate with the secure exchange facility or that take advantage of the aforementioned APIs. In many cases a developer may wish to have a program simultaneously interact with more than one API for example a developer may want an application to retrieve documents or files from various locations or deliver documents or files to various locations e.g. storage locations on premises cloud storage locations and locations on a server of the secure exchange platform but each of the various locations may have its own distinct API or set of APIs that is suitable for enabling communication and or integration with the language s application s storage type s operating system s and other aspects of the computing environment of that particular location. To enable that capability the secure exchange facility optionally through the SDK may provide one or more API wrappers to simplify interfacing with the secure exchange facility or various components thereof such as through providing the ability to make multiple API calls through a single function of a single software programming language of a user. A given function in a given programming language may be mapped to various different APIs so that the function is executed across multiple APIs and platform components but requires programming only once in the native programming language of the application of the developer. Thus an API wrapper may provide an interface for the user of the API wrapper that is less dependent upon the understanding of the internal workings of the functionality of the secure exchange facility. For instance an interface with even one functional component within the secure exchange facility may utilize dozens of API calls. An API wrapper may encapsulate all of these API calls into software code ready to use e.g. in Java C C C or Python and the like . In an example an API wrapper function getDocuments connection session exchange may wrap API calls to one or more HTTP APIs where a program may now retrieve a list of all the documents from a particular exchange e.g. exchange 12345 using a very short code instruction such as in a Python example documentList getDocuments connection session 12345 instead of calling a long complex URL using an HTTP method such as a GET method with the cookie ssoGlobalSessionID and then parsing an XML result as Python objects e.g. 

In embodiments the API wrapper may be made available under an open source software license or similar licensing arrangement making it easier for users to develop interfaces with the secure exchange facility thus avoiding the inefficiencies of different users needing to create their own translation system allowing users to contribute to the development or refinement of new or modified API wrappers and the like. API wrappers may provide an improved method for integration with the secure exchange facility functionality thus avoiding an interface that may be otherwise perceived as complex and difficult to use.

The secure exchange may provide end to end encryption as part of computer data content protective services as described herein such as for not only protecting content being held at rest within the system but in the transfer of content from a user client device through the secure exchange infrastructure and out to a receiving user client device. For instance once a user initiates a file upload to the secure exchange that computer data content may be encrypted and remain encrypted protected for the rest of its lifecycle. With reference to the secure exchange may utilize secure sockets layer SSL encryption while the document is in motion from the moment it leaves a first user client until it arrives in the secure network. The secure exchange may then apply various encryption technologies through file processing services including an optional CMK service as described herein so that the document remains encrypted even while in storage . Then upon a request by a second user client to download the content file processing services may decrypt the content and transfer the file such as protected through SSL encryption. In addition DRM protection as described herein may be applied so that the document remains encrypted protected even while stored locally on the second user client where the computer data content can only be opened by communicating back through the exchange system s DRM service where the user is authenticated and entitlements checked. End to end encryption protects a user s computer data content not only while the document is stored within the secure exchange storage but in transit to from and within the secure exchange and optionally while transferred to a second user client through DRM protection even after the content has left the secure exchange and is stored and further shared.

In embodiments a customizable secure exchange system may be provided wherein methods systems and services described herein in association with secure collaboration and sharing may be at least in part modularized and encapsulated in a secure envelope e.g. where security extends beyond the hosted secure server out into the cloud computing space as part of an enterprise computing resource inside the enterprise firewall or the like and provided for use to business entities in a location other than the secure server such as on site at a business entity on a secure cloud service on a commercial cloud service distributed across a geographic area in a location local to the business entity provided through distributed hosting and the like. This architecture may provide a highly scalable platform upon which business process applications can be built. Further the functionality provided in secure server hosted embodiments such as described previously herein may be modularized to enable the business entity to select basic services building blocks components toolkits and the like in building their own secure collaboration and sharing facility that is built to meet the needs of the business entity such for a specific business market the business entity operates in a project the business entity is working with a partnered collaboration between business entities and the like.

Referring to system may comprise a data management facility and a plurality of data storage nodes which may be distributed in various locations. The data management facility may comprise one or more secure servers and may implement an orchestration layer with various orchestration services as more fully described elsewhere in this disclosure. The data management facility may manage content sharing between various entities of data that is stored in the plurality of data storage nodes . For example data may be stored by a user such as a user associated with a first business entity. The data management facility itself may be hosted by a separate entity than the first business entity and may include multiple regional data management sites each serving associated data storage nodes .

The data may include data content and metadata and the data management facility may only have access to certain metadata relating to the data content such as metadata related to managing of the data in the plurality of data storage nodes . As a result the data management facility may have no access to the data content of the data stored in the data storage nodes . In embodiments the data storage node may be comprised of one or more data storage facilities such as inside an enterprise firewall at data storage B outside the enterprise firewall at data storage A and the like. Furthermore the deployment of a data storage node may also be provided inside or outside an enterprise firewall. When deployed outside the enterprise firewall the data storage node may be implemented in a cloud computing environment e.g. through a secure implementation of a commercial cloud computing provider . When deployed inside the enterprise firewall the data storage node may be implemented in either a physical configuration e.g. as physical storage and logic hardware inside the enterprise or as a virtualized service e.g. where the physical configuration is in the cloud computing environment but virtualized to within the enterprise . In either case the data storage node may be completely isolated from enterprise systems when deployed on premises.

In embodiments the user may select where the data storage associated with the data storage node is located such as on premise at a server of the entity hosting the data management facility with a cloud based storage service or the like thereby allowing the user to control where data is stored. The user may utilize the secure data exchange system to share data content with another user such as a user outside the firewall or with a user of another business entity and the like.

The data storage nodes store the data content associated with various entities also referred to herein as customers or business enterprises using the secure exchange system and this data content may include various types of content such as original files and respective metadata fully processed files and respective metadata customer compliance data customer identity information metadata generated that relates to files folders or other collections of data application related metadata such as if a customer creates a deal then various deal related metadata may be stored indexes on metadata and the like.

In embodiments content stored on the data storage node may be implemented as object storage which is a storage architecture that manages data as objects as opposed to other storage architectures such as file systems which manage data as a file hierarchy and block storage that manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks. Each object may include data metadata a global unique identifier and the like. The object storage systems may enable relatively inexpensive scalable and self healing retention of massive amounts of unstructured data associated with the data storage node and provide fine grained access control to data stored in the data storage node where data is exposed and managed as objects instead of files or blocks.

Object storage may enable the creation of redundant scalable data storage nodes using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of accessible data thus providing a long term storage system for large amounts of static data that can be retrieved leveraged updated and the like. Object storage may use a distributed architecture with no central point of control providing greater scalability redundancy and permanence. Objects may be written to multiple hardware devices with software responsible for ensuring data replication and integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters may scale horizontally by adding new storage units. Should a storage unit fail the system may work to replicate its content from other active storage units.

Object storage characteristics may include that all objects stored in object storage have a URL are replicated e.g. x3 in zones e.g. defined as a group of drives a node a rack and the like all objects may have their own metadata interaction may be with the object storage system through a RESTful HTTP object data may be located anywhere with in the node structure data storage may scale by adding additional storage units without sacrificing performance new data storage may be added to without downtime failed nodes and disks may be swapped out without downtime the system may run on industry standard hardware and the like.

Object storage may separate metadata from content to support additional capabilities such as additional metadata to capture application specific or user specific information for better indexing purposes additional metadata to support data management policies e.g. a policy to drive object movement from one storage tier to another independent scaling of data storage nodes unified access to data across distributed data storage nodes centralized management of storage across many individual data storage nodes optimization of metadata storage e.g. database or key value storage vs. data storage e.g. unstructured binary storage and the like. Storing content and metadata as objects may enable the creation modification and access of objects and metadata by using a object storage API such as implemented as a set of Representational State Transfer REST web services. The system may utilize HTTPS SSL protocol to interact with object storage and use standard HTTP calls to perform API operations. The system may utilize language specific APIs such as a RESTful API that makes it easier to integrate into applications. To assert access and change content the system may require a user to identify themselves to object storage by using an authentication token. To get a token the user may be required to present credentials to an authentication service where the authentication service then returns a token and the URL for the access. As an API accessible storage platform the system may be integrated directly into applications or used for backup archiving data retention and the like.

In embodiments the data storage node may include replicated copies of data such as onto other disks and hosts which may provide resiliency against localized disk and host failures. Further redundancy may be achieved by deploying additional content nodes in geographically distributed locations where the orchestration layer may synchronize data to these alternate locations. For example three discrete locations may be implemented for data integrity such as to reduce the risk associated during recovery time in the case of a complete data center failure.

The types of data kept in the orchestration layer at the data management facility may include certain metadata that is relevant to the orchestration of file storage and file sharing services application related identifiers file folder or collection identifiers user identity information service monitoring data such as uptime service performance and service events logs indicating history and duration of access to data content and or normalized records of compliance events which are stripped of the content of the data to which each of these relate.

As mentioned the data management facility may be distributed geographically so as to enable regional specific management of the plurality of data storage environments while enabling a user to securely access only one or only a particular set of the plurality of data storage nodes where each data storage node is securely isolated from other data storage nodes. Each of these storage nodes may be managed by a separate entity.

Each of the plurality of data storage nodes may be remotely accessed by a user through a secure application program interface API to the secure data exchange system where the secure data exchange system may utilize a two call authorization procedure executed between the data management facility and a data storage node to enable secure access between the user and these data storage environments. The secure data exchange system may be extendable by a user through modularized application functionality such as a library of selectable applications to allow an entity to create a secure exchange environment customized to requirements of the entity.

In embodiments this customizable secure exchange environment may be made available to a user through an application programming interface API with a secure server. Further this system may enable a business entity to share content securely beyond the enterprise firewall boundary while meeting operational security and compliance requirements of entities including global enterprises and financial institutions enable innovative secure sharing and collaborative document intensive business processes e.g. an intent based work stream deliver a secure customizable user experience that is on par with consumer driven but not limited to consumer experiences software and services and the like. The customizable secure exchange environment may provide a framework so business entities are able to build custom business applications that are able to meet the varied time to use needs of the business and which are also scalable to meet varying usage demands. Business compliance may be provided no matter where the modular functionality is located in order to ensure compliance with the corresponding governance frameworks of various business entities. Analytics may be provided for compliance business reporting market reporting and the like. Implementation of the customizable secure exchange environment may provide basic services infrastructure and orchestration of services such that there is isolation of logic functions service facilities and the like thus enabling the placement of components of the system outside a secure server while still maintaining a secure environment. The data model used in implementation may be modular flexible business centric customer configurable architected for scale premises to cloud e.g. data metadata and processing structures implemented to be accommodated in locations outside the exchange server or on premise of the entity storing the data highly durable and reliable highly extensible and the like such as with business analytics as a core service.

In embodiments the customizable secure exchange environment may provide for a secure instant apps library of components for collaboration across enterprises where the library of components comprises building block functionalities that can be assembled to build a custom secure collaboration and sharing facility such as for use across an API. Through this facility a user or application team for an entity may be able to build their own secure facilities applications capabilities and the like to their own needs. For instance the secure exchange server may provide building block application components that are capable of interfacing through an API of the secure exchange server and through which an outside user may assemble components into a custom secure application and where the application maintains the security and functionality of running the application on the secure server.

In embodiments the customizable secure exchange environment may allow a user to create a custom application by adding business specific logic on top of a standard offering layer such as including assets content policies relationships and the like to produce a custom instant application that is customized to their needs such as accessible through an API to the exchange server.

For example for a custom application may be created for a production part approval process PPAP by an automotive industry user. For example the system may be applied to a vendor qualification process. In this instance there may be a set of criteria that qualify a vendor to be associated with the automotive industry user. In another instance the system may be applied to a production part approval process. In this instance a manufacturing company may have a part it wants approved which goes through the PPAP process where they take the parts to vendors for quoting and then progress through the approval process such as including a series of documents inspections validation steps and the like. Exchange of content associated with this process may be interactive between the automaker tiered vendors regulators and the like. Traditionally to accommodate this process there have been stacks of paper forms that are sold as kits. With the present system the user may be able to build the forms into the application process distribute content across firewalls according to a work streams and the like all customized to the needs of a particular situation.

One of the advantages of the customizable secure exchange system may be the separation of the user interface from the logic from data store capabilities enabling external developers to build their own secure exchange facility via an API. Thus the modularity and customizability of the system may be such that a business user may be able to choose to implement a custom environment at different levels of accommodation and complexity such as a basic service level a business process application level with a limited number of building block functions implemented a business process applications level with partners and functional component functions implemented e.g. where components include a modular set of building block functions a business process application with partner communities with an application building toolkit e.g. where the toolkit comprises building blocks components or the like . In embodiments the customizable secure exchange environment may act as a platform from which business users may create scalable solutions to their needs.

Referring to a generic example for a work stream of a business entity is presented where the work stream is shown to comprise content context contacts or the like. Content may comprise lifecycle tasking reporting or the like such as reporting which provides compliance. In this example lifecycle is shown to comprise different states for which content may be in tasking is shown to breakdown into sub tasks and reporting is shown to comprise compliance reporting.

Referring to a more specific business process application example of a significant transaction of a business entity is presented that requires content sharing between entities where lifecycle states of the transaction may comprise a deal evaluation a preliminary due diligence analysis a letter of intent an advanced due diligence analysis a negotiation a sign and close state an integration the like. Each of these states may then include various content tasks sub tasks reports or the like. Dependent upon the needs of the business the customizable secure exchange environment may be used to create a secure exchange for the business that is built with these content context and reporting needs in mind.

Referring to this shows a number of example lifecycle processes and how these processes may be accommodated within a set of tasks sub tasks and deliverables. In this instance the four lifecycle examples 7 states 3 states two states and four states as shown are then represented by block represented lifecycles in association with each of the tasks sub tasks. Visual attributes may provide the user via a user interface with status such as showing a highlighted lifecycle state highlighted to show percent complete for the tasks a highlighted state transition e.g. and arrow between states to show a relative state checking indicator between states and the like.

Referring to the system may promote the exposing of content and context in user interface components such as in various graphical representations of all the active deals in process such as by type region size lifecycle process state or the like where the application may be built using user interface building blocks and or components of the system.

Various configurations for implementations of a business data model and language may be provided. The ability for applications to define their own business data model or schema is enabled using a business language that the platform can interpret. The platform itself will enforce the basics of this language like cardinality and the valid or invalid connections between various data model types and relationships.

Referring to the architecture of an exemplary customizable secure exchange platform may be described by these main functional areas 1 an orchestration layer and 2 data storage nodes for storage available to the user via an application wherein the application includes business logic and presentation such as a user interface for the user entity. The orchestration layer may provide orchestration services that keep track of and manage everything that is going on in the platform including without limitation tracking where various data also referred to herein as assets or user data resides the extent of access to data brokering interactions controlling processing managing data locations enforcing entitlements instrumenting and providing analytics and the like. The data storage nodes may provide data node services that operate on and store the customer or user data in data stores file systems store files content data store metadata provide transformations provide customer or user analytics provide searching tools and the like. While the orchestration services know about everything that is going with the user data at the data content and or metadata level such as all actions and events that take place with respect to the user data in embodiments the orchestration services don t actually see the data content of the user data itself.

Referring to exemplary platform architecture for the customizable secure exchange environment is presented showing how a data storage environment or data nodes may be separated from an orchestration layer. As shown the data storage node includes various data node services such as a data store service a search service an analytics service a transform filter service and or a service manager service along with various business applications and the like. The orchestration layer includes orchestration services such as a workflow manager service an asset and entitlement service a paradata collector service an analytics service an identity service a composite service and or a service manager service and the like. A messaging service and notification service acts to link these orchestration services with the data node. In this example the data storage node is located on the premises of an enterprise such as part of an enterprise data center although this data node may also be located elsewhere.

Each of the services implemented in this architecture may be enabled with a provider layer that insulates a basic service contract implemented as an API from the rest of the services. Each of the services may be capable of processing multiple versions of its API so that new services can be brought online before older versions of the service are taken offline. This enables the system to stay up and running without any interruption. Each of the services may be written in such a way that it can be automatically scaled up and down as required based on the level of performance of that service relative to the current workload needed by that service.

Generally orchestration services are those services that keep track of and manage all the user data and processing that is occurring. In embodiments a basic messaging system that brokers the communication among all the services and between the data nodes and the orchestration layer is utilized. For example an asset and location service may be provided that is responsible for keeping track of where all the assets in the system are located and which users persons groups and roles have access to those services from a basic containment perspective. When a client web browser iOS app or other type of client of an entity needs to access a particular asset or grouping of assets it first checks with the asset location and entitlement service. Upon validating the user of that client is entitled to the asset from a containment perspective the service returns the location of the asset along with a token or ticket that can be used preferably only for a short predetermined time period to access that asset from particular data node where that asset is stored.

Other services may include a notification service a composite service an identity service and the like. The notification service may be responsible for sending notifications via the appropriate channels e.g. SMS short message service SMTP simple mail transfer protocol . These services may pull messages from the message queue as appropriate and send them to the intended recipient. The composite service may be where application business logic or common business logic that needs to run outside the data node is processed. The identity service may be responsible for validating the identity of each user providing a basic directory also known as Global User Directory or GUD of the system. This service may support various federation models in order to support both login activities as well as rights management. Functionalities addressed within the identity service may include single sign on SSO exclusive single sign on ESSO lightweight directory access protocol LDAP active directory integration security assertion markup language SAML and the like. With regard to managing identities a user may explicitly opt in with regard to allowing their identities to be shared such as providing their personally identifiable information PII to other users of the system depending on business need. Users who do not opt in may not be provided with access to various services. As a general rule users who opt in may not have control over the geographical locations of where their PII is stored or replicated . For example there may be specific requirements related to Swiss law that need to be taken into account using some sort of federated active directory that prevents any Swiss user involved in the banking industry from having their PII leave the Switzerland borders.

A service manager in the orchestration layer may provide basic health monitoring of all services for the orchestration layer and data nodes provide scaling of services up and down provide deployment of business applications provide provisioning of data nodes initiate bulk loading and archiving provide data migration tools for migrating content from one data node to another data node provide administration of business applications configure various application and customer service extensions e.g. transforms and filters and the like. The service manager on the orchestration layer may initiate service requests to data nodes for various maintenance functions such as backup and restore deploy new versions of a service or restore an old version and the like. The service manager of the data node may carry out these functions and provide a mechanism for the orchestration layer to get status of whether the function was carried out or not. The ability may exist for tenants to be defined in such a way that full administration rights can be delegated to partners. This concept is referred to herein as a limited admin where the system ensures that administration of tenants is based on the ownership of the administration rights for those tenants. Partners who have been assigned administration ownership of a tenant should have the same level of capabilities as a system administrator who owns administration capabilities for tenants that are provisioned. System administrators may not have access to perform any administration functions for tenants that are owned by a partner. The system may reserve the right to turn off a partner s ability to provision or administer accounts but this does not mean that the system will be able to perform the administration once the partner s rights have been removed.

A workflow manager service may provide processing flow control of work that occurs in the system when user data assets are uploaded and downloaded from the system. The processing activities that occur during upload are referred to herein as transforms and the processing activities that occur during download are referred to herein as filters. These workflows may be configurable at multiple levels including at the platform level system wide across all applications at the level of specific business applications at the level of specific customers and the like. These workflow processes may cause a number of actions to occur such as a custom process blocking further execution of the workflow logging that an action occurred alerting that an action occurred and the like. These workflows may be used by entities such as professional services groups or partners to provide application or customer specific services to be processed e.g. package best in class DLP data loss prevention or PII personally identifiable information integrations for customers to use .

Transform and filter services are those services that perform processing on files as they are uploaded and downloaded respectively to a data node. The processing occurs within the data node and can be configured using the workflow management service. The configuration may occur at multiple levels such as system wide e.g. platform configured application specific client and professional services e.g. on per customer basis partner configured on per partner application basis and the like. All files that are uploaded to the system may be required to be processed by a virus scanning transform and it may be required that no files are made available for download until the virus scanning has completed and the file is determined to be safe. Some document formats may be converted to a suitable format such as PDF for rendering by the viewer facility for web viewing and the like such as from word processor formats presentation formats and the like. Watermarking may also be provided which is a filtering process that occurs as files are being downloaded. In embodiments this process may be provided for files that have been converted to PDF and are being viewed using the viewer facility only. The watermarking options can include username date and time name of the document and the like. In addition to the information contained in the watermark there may be display options that can be configured such as the location of the watermark on the page size of the watermark and the like.

For large files viewer chunking may be implemented in order to increase the viewer performance in handling the large files. For instance viewer chunking may be implemented such that portions of the file can be downloaded and viewed without the user waiting for the entire file to be downloaded. There may be both synchronous and asynchronous chunking processes that occur such as depending on the timing of the file download request relative to its initial upload. Rights management processing may also be applied e.g. information rights management IRM digital rights management DRM and rights management service RMS such as based on the type of file being processed and the technology used in the processing to protect a document that is downloaded and viewed locally or offline. Other services may be provided for files being uploaded such as full text search extraction optical character recognition OCR page counting and the like. The full text search extraction transform may process the different file types upon upload so that they can be searched such as for PDF Microsoft Office text and the like formats. OCR processing may be provided for documents such as scanned PDF files so that files that have been scanned into the system are also searchable.

Data node services are those services that process customer data. These services are required to look at customer data and perform logic based on that data. The data node layer as a collection of services can live anywhere including in a public cloud provider a system data center on premises at a customer site such as via an appliance virtual machine and the like. The purpose behind the deployment options of the components of the data node layer is to accommodate the various customer needs around data privacy legal data restrictions cost and the like.

Only users with appropriate entitlements are able to access or manage the data content in data storage nodes such as in an asset data store a file data store and the like. An asset data store may be where metadata about assets is kept. This metadata may or may not be associated with specific files. The data contained in the asset data store can only be accessed by a user with the proper entitlements and only once the client they are using has presented the data store with the appropriate token or ticket . The file data store may be where all file data for a given data node are stored.

In embodiments a search facility or search service may be provided such as to perform a full text search a metadata search and the like. A full text search capability may run on the data node and be responsible for full text searching. The indexing and other processing of file data needed for search may be provided during a transform when files are uploaded. There may also be a need for searching based on metadata. This searching may also be done on the data node layer because it is required to look at the actual contents of stored customer data.

A data node may provide a paradata service an analytics service and a reporting service a service manager a business language bulk load and archiving facilities customer managed keys and the like. Paradata is the exhaust data of all the activity that occurs in the system where a data node paradata service captures the customer entered data. The customer specific analytics and reporting needs may primarily be met by interacting with the paradata service on their data node. They may run special purpose data extraction programs that provide data they are entitled to access for the purposes of running custom reports. The service manager at the data node interacts with the service manager that is part of the orchestration services. It accepts acts and responds to messages from the orchestration service manager. Business language may provide the processing that enables an application to query and traverse the business data model using terminology defined by the application. The bulk load and archive processing may enable exporting and importing data such that a complete set of customer data can be reconstituted in its entirety including historical information with date and time information. While this service may provide a basic navigation and view of this information e.g. via raw XML any live presentation of this information in an offline mode may typically be the responsibility of the application responsible for creating and rendering the data initially.

Infrastructure and management services may be provided that control and help manage the rest of the services in the platform. For instance there may be a component of the management service in the orchestration layer and another component of it in each data node. These services may each perform local functions as well as communicate to each other in order to have functions performed on their behalf Some of the operations carried out by these components may be enabled in an automated way based on configuration parameters that have been set and other operations performed on demand through the use of API calls. The ability to deploy monitor and control both orchestration and data node services may support the ability to check on the number of service instances running at any point in time the ability to check on the health of any service instance that is running the ability to bring specific new versions of a service up the ability to bring specific old versions of a service down e.g. soft shutdown the ability to force a specific instance of a service to shut down e.g. hard shutdown auto scale a service that is not meeting its service level agreement SLA the ability to configure the SLA for a specific service the ability to identify the physical resources that are available for resources to pull from the ability for a service to request additional physical resources from a pool of resources the ability to perform backup and restore operations and the like.

In embodiments the infrastructure and management services may provide for different resource deployments such as cloud deployment on premises deployment hosted software as a service SaaS and the like as well as hybrids of the foregoing. Cloud deployment of services in a public cloud infrastructure may be supported for services including the orchestration and data node architecture components. On premises deployment of data node services may be supported such as for performing an automated self check of whether data node resources are accessible checking and monitoring the physical resources available on a data node bringing up a data node checking on the version of all services in a data node bringing up services on a data node checking on the health and operations of a data node checking on the security of a data node pushing new versions of any service down to a data node and the like. There are a number of physical data node classes that may be supported such as depending on the level of availability desired by the customer including active active fixed scale active active dynamic scale and the like. Orchestration and data node services may also be hosted on the system s secure server.

Referring to it is shown how this separation of the data node structure from the orchestration layer provides flexibility as to where data nodes with their files metadata business logic processing and the like may reside such as on premises with the business entity as a hosted software as a service SaaS stored in the cloud located in different geographic regions and the like. With this structure the presence of a separated orchestration layer in the architecture is not bound to the premises and enables tracking and reporting of actions on objects properties tasks work streams and the like at a level of abstraction that does not require access to the underlying data content itself. For example the data node may be located in a cloud service provider location and the orchestration layer located on the secure server of the system. The data files lifecycle tasking reporting and the like may be present in the cloud located data node where the orchestration layer on the secure server may have connectivity with the data structure but not knowledge of the data content itself. For instance the data node may contain data as part of the completion of a series of tasks and the orchestration layer may know of the hierarchy relating the data and completion of tasks but have no knowledge of the substance of the tasks e.g. just that they are 80 tasks that are in a hierarchy and 20 are complete .

Referring to services provided by the orchestration layer and the data node may be scalable in order to accommodate different hosted solutions where services may be automatically scaled or adjusted up or down based on actual usage where analytics in the orchestration layer may provide data that at least in part determines whether to scale up or down. For instance as shown in the illustrative example of there may be a greater need for data storage in the data node service for a hosted U.S. data node than for a hosted E.U. data node and still less for an on premises data node where needs for the data store are scalable to the needs of the three sites. In a similar way the services provided by the orchestration layer may be scalable to the needs of different business solutions such as shown where there is much greater need for support of collection in the hosted U.S. solution and less in the hosted E.U. solution. Further there may be some solutions to which no orchestration services are provided in some cases such as an entirely on premises solution. Each service may have the ability to be configured with a specific SLA service level agreement threshold and this threshold will be monitored using paradata so that the service can be scaled up as needed as long as the physical resources are available. In addition to physical resources being configured from which each service may pull there may also be a non physical equivalent that is configured for public cloud environments. The purpose of this is to put a limit on the number of resources that can be consumed if a specific service gets into a situation that it attempts to consume unacceptable amounts of resource.

Referring to data node accommodation may be by regions available zones resources available on premises and the like. For instance there may be different regions where each region may share certain capabilities assets identities and the like have data centers assigned to them have customer premises support assigned to them have a cloud node assigned to them and the like. For instance as shown there may be a region A and a region B where they may be able to share certain resources. Region A and region B may also have their own dedicated data centers such as data center A A and A for region A and data center B and B for region B. These data centers may act as stand alone data centers or may be networked together such as to share data share configuration information provide extended resources for a data center that needs to scale up due to activity. Customer premises data nodes and cloud data nodes may also be assigned to one region or the other such as based on the geographic location. This regional data structure may provide regional flexibility as user needs drive scaling of the resources assigned to each user s solution.

Referring to analytics may be a core service of a customizable secure exchange facility such as intelligently handling paradata referred to in the figure as exhaust that is siphoned off from user activity and stored. An orchestration paradata service may for example capture de identified data without needing to see the data itself. Paradata may be used for analytics and report processing of many kinds Examples of what paradata may be used for include elastic or dynamic scaling of services compliance reporting progress reporting business application reporting customer usage reporting billing reporting customer specific reporting transaction specific reporting and the like. Paradata pulls messages off the queue and stores the data in such a way that accessing that data for reporting does not affect the basic performance of the system. Stored data may be directly stored in the associated data node and stored in the orchestration layer as obfuscated data e.g. with GUID globally unique identifier . For instance a user may have complete access to a data product stored in the data node but a secure server administrator associated with the orchestration layer may not be able to see the data in the data node and only have access to obfuscated data through the orchestration layer. Paradata messaging may be organized such as with a header a basic version and timestamp information context capturing the context of the message e.g. which application user operation were involved metadata e.g. application specific data and system defined data paradata detailed status and debugging information where the original message is also included so any data can be retrieved at a later point in time even if it wasn t originally defined as interesting and the like.

In embodiments volume limitations may be improved through the use of the customizable secure exchange facility. For example a traditional platform may have fixed volume limitations such as an organization limit of 7500 users per monitored domain a user limit of 5000 users per exchange and 2500 users per group an exchange limit of 10 000 folders 20 000 documents 200 top level folders 1000 documents per folder 2500 groups a document limitation of 2 GB file size 2000 files per download 500 MB max download and the like. However with the scalability of the customizable secure exchange facility volume limitations may be virtually eliminated where the enabling technologies may provide for a reporting infrastructure asynchronous non blocking calls domain level visibility processing isolated optimized security model separating complex models from large domains elastic services horizontal scaling distributed data defined application patterns and the like.

In embodiments the customizable secure exchange facility may provide for an increase in the development rate at which a user deploys a secure exchange environment where different levels of integration may provide different levels of developmental velocity such as from a more basic services level to a business process applications level with basic building blocks to business process applications and partners level with full components to business process applications and partner communities including an applications building toolkit software development kit and the like. These systems may scale up from for instance a standardized and automated environment creation environment to a fully automated application development environment to an independent and isolated services environment to an automated API and component level testing environment to full business applications and the like. The customizable secure exchange facility may enable users to have greater control and customization potential for building unique collaborative sharing environments that are scalable such that volume limitations are virtually eliminated.

Analytics and reporting may be provided through a group of services that operate both in or with respect to the orchestration and data node portions of the system. Those services that are referred to as paradata capture all activity that occurs with respect to data. The analytics service is where data metadata and paradata are organized in useful ways such that they can be used for solving various problems that range from real time health and monitoring of the services special purpose reporting needs to ad hoc customer reporting and the like. Analytics and reporting may include compliance reporting billing reports customer usage reporting and the like. In addition to reports for market to cash applications additional capabilities to support business systems may be provided such as for throttling provisioning turning capabilities on off based on usage and adoption and the like. Throttling is the ability to restrict access to system resources based on limits defined in a business system is required. For example resources that may be restricted and the reasons for those restrictions include disk space processing e.g. number of API calls per unit of time features e.g. the ability to turn features on off based on license agreements applications e.g. the ability to provide deny access to applications based on license agreements system access e.g. the ability to provide deny access to the system based on payment or lack thereof and the like. The business systems may need to have the ability to query for how much of a given resource is being utilized against specific contracts so that they can perform processing and notifications such as when a client is approaching a specific percentage of their allotted resource when a client has used up their allocation of an allotted resource when a client has exceeded their allocation for an allotted resource by a specific percentage in cases where exceeding allocation is allowed and the like. Business systems may need to have the ability to shut off access to specific resources. Shutting off access may be temporary or permanent depending on the situation. Some examples for when access needs to be shut off are when a client does not pay their bill when a trial period expires and the like.

A provisioning facility may be provided for provisioning of users and system containers e.g. tenants exchanges workspaces etc. as needed such as to get users up and running in various modes including trial accounts freemium accounts paid accounts and the like. The ability to provision partners may also be provided such as for different types of partners that will need to be provisioned. Examples of the different partner types include partners who build and sell apps on top of our platform partners who build and sell services used by our platform and applications partners e.g. clients who integrate our platform and applications to their systems developer e.g. potential partners who want to experiment with the system s APIs and the like. The ability for partners to be administrators of their customers without system administrators may be needed such as to provision accounts provision resources monitor and throttle accounts and resources administer various aspects of their customer accounts and the like.

In embodiments other components and composites may be provided as part of the architecture such as a business language services lifecycle services tasking collection folder component data policy composite menu and commands forms tables portal tree indented table application builder toolkit and the like. The platform may provide a business language that application teams professional services partners and customers can use to write applications. This language will enable the articulation of the business data model for an application as well as a way to traverse that data model efficiently. Any object in the system may have a lifecycle associated with it where the lifecycle is a series of states through which the object traverses. Any portion of the business data model that is hierarchical in nature can be thought of as a task structure. The business objects of that model are the tasks starting at the top with the main process task and working all the way down through the structure to the deliverable leaf task nodes. A collection or folder is a basic construct used for grouping other deliverables. Permissions may be based on the parents permissions and may be overridden at any point in the folder hierarchy or at individual deliverables. How the system saves and allows data to be accessed may be policy driven where there may be a need to be able to define basic data policy with respect to how long the data is to be retained on line or in cold storage . Menu and commands may be the primary mechanism by which users interact with the user interface. They may be rendered as links buttons popup menus and the like as needed. The primary presentation may be the responsibility of the application creating the user interface. The menu command component may enable pre check filtering check and post action triggers for events application custom logic for professional services custom logic for customers and partners and the like. A form component may present the user with a basic list of name value pairs of metadata. A table component may present the user with a list of business objects and for each business object a series of fields of data about those objects or objects they are related to. The portal component is a composite screen that presents multiple widgets such as a form table chart graph tree lifecycle browser menu and commands and the like. A tree component may provide a hierarchical view and navigation of a structure. An indented table component may be a combination of the tree and table components. The application builder may consist of a builder for prototyping and making quick modifications to existing applications and a scripting language e.g. XML for building full applications in such a way that they can be controlled using source control management tools.

Referring to an embodiment of the data management facility is depicted which provides orchestration services to the system with respect to content stored in data storage nodes. One skilled in the art will recognize that represent one possible implementation of the data management facility and is not meant to be limiting in any way. These figures depict an implementation of the data management facility this is configured as a virtual private cloud VPC where an on demand configurable pool of shared computing resources is allocated within a public cloud environment such as provided by Amazon and isolated from other VPC users. Thus use of a VPC enables the data management facility to operate as a virtually private cloud secure and isolated from the public cloud. The VPC may be provided through allocation of private and public IP subnets and virtual communication systems such as with a virtual private network VPN that extends a private network across a public network e.g. the Internet . The VPN may be created by establishing virtual point to point connections through the use of dedicated connections virtual tunneling protocols traffic encryptions and the like enabling the security and management resources of the customizable secure exchange system to extend out into the public network as if it were directly connected to a private network including authentication and encryption services and with remote access to its VPC cloud computing resources.

Referring specifically to the data management facility embodiment depicted in a client may access the VPC implementation of the data management facility as well to a data storage node through a data center and VPN connection to a virtual private gateway which connects to allocated computing resources within the VPC e.g. different computing resource allocation zones such as through an elastic load balancer ELB to distribute the incoming load across several instances of service such as for paradata and service manager. The system then connects to various highly available HA proxy private subnets to correctly route request to the correct service. In embodiments the various computing resource allocation zones may be interconnected through ELB location and Paradata and ELB service managers cloud computing resources within the VPC may be provided through a plurality of public and private subnets such as for location services paradata services service management threat management and the like. In embodiments public subnets may provide connectivity through an Internet gateway to commercial computing resources such as in a limited example to Amazon cloud computing resources e.g. relational database service RDS simple storage service S simple queue service SQS elastic map reduce EMR simple workflow service SWF simple notification service SNS and the like which may provide a broad set of scalable compute storage database analytics application and deployment services. Although Amazon cloud computing resources has been used here as a representative example of commercial cloud computing resources one skilled in the art will recognize that similar cloud computing resources are available from other commercial providers and is but one example embodiment of cloud computing resources that may be employed by organizations implementing systems within the cloud computing environment.

Referring to embodiments of the data storage node may be similarly implemented in a cloud computing environment. Referring specifically to the data storage node embodiment depicted in where in this instance it is implemented as an extension of the embodiment of the data management facility depicted in a client may access the data storage node through the data center such as via a virtual private customer gateway virtual private network network interfaces and the like. This data storage node embodiment may employ a plurality of private subnets such as for asset services search services transformation services paradata management service management key management and the like. In addition data storage facilities are provided. The cloud computing embodiment depicted in is one embodiment of how the data storage node may be implemented. In embodiments a data storage node may be implemented in a cloud computing environment behind an enterprise firewall as part of the enterprise computing resources in a hybrid configuration between enterprise computing resources and cloud computing resources and the like.

Sharing data whether as a part of a work or personal activity has many options in today s diverse Internet and cloud environment. Some data sharing and storage processes and facilities are highly secure such as for an employee at work sharing and storing a document within an enterprise facility while operating a computer that resides on the network and behind the enterprise s firewall. Some processes are relatively less secure such as an individual sharing a personal document from home to a public storage site. Further there are many processes that lie between these two extremes that may leave a document in an uncertain security state. For instance an employee may be working from home and save a document to an enterprise storage facility. Or an employee operating from within an enterprise firewall may wish to share an enterprise controlled document to a third party where the third party does not have a secure storage facility or utilizes unsecure commercial cloud storage facilities. In addition documents may be shared with the individual from outside the firewall such that the document enters in an unknown security state where the individual is also put in a position of not knowing how to store that document securely send edits of that document back to the sender and the like. This diversity of available content repositories makes it difficult to determine the extent to which a document sharing storage process is secure or meets the requirements for security desired from an enterprise. This uncertainty makes it difficult to securely share and store documents with others outside of an enterprise firewall.

In embodiments a secure federated access facility may be provided for uniting heterogeneous content repositories e.g. secure public private commercial inside a firewall outside a firewall etc. under a single user interface such as where file management is agnostic to the location of content within the repositories. For instance a user operating through the user interface provided by the secure access facility may view e.g. seeing files and content items access e.g. open read edit save share and otherwise act on items stored in these disparate content repositories as if they are part of or extensions to the user s network or file system. Thus the user is able to take actions on content items without having to think about the nature or location of the storage or the type of security associated with the different repositories.

In embodiments security is provided in the distinct repositories in a manner that complies with consistent policies and requirements such as enterprise policies no matter where content items are stored within the umbrella of repositories associated with the secure federated access facility.

Referring to in embodiments the federated access facility may interface with or within an enterprise to provide federated access services amongst diverse data storage facilities such as the enterprise data storage a data storage for a second enterprise e.g. such as a partner of the enterprise a vendor of the enterprise a third party secure data storage a third party limited security data storage and the like. The federated access facility may also interface with data storage associated with computing devices B B that are internal to the enterprise and or computing devices A A that are external to the enterprise and or second enterprise .

The secure federated access facility may provide a unified architecture for federated access. The facility may be a web enabled multi layered management access environment that unites the heterogeneous content repositories including uniting them with enterprise data storage e.g. including on premises and cloud based enterprise data storage .

In embodiments exchange features may be provided for secure collaboration across multiple business entities involving the documents managed in the federated repositories. There may be for instance an orchestration layer as described in this disclosure for management of the system where the orchestration layer is managed by a host that manages the underlying federated system such as including tracking locations of content items in heterogeneous repositories managing secure e.g. key based access to content items e.g. based on policies logging metadata regarding to actions taken with respect to items in repositories and the like. In embodiments the orchestration layer may access such data as metadata and file location data but it may be unable to provide access to the actual underlying content that is stored and managed by users in the various data storage facilities. For example content itself may be encrypted with a different set of keys e.g. customer managed or managed by the vendor of a commercial storage solution than metadata and other items related to locating and tracking access to such content itself.

In embodiments in association with the orchestration layer a data layer may provide for storing and management of data by a user where the data node may provide a secure content storage facility managed by the enterprise. The data layer may comprise data node s such as including a cloud based data node outside the enterprise firewall an appliance based data node within the enterprise firewall an end point data node on a user device e.g. mobile device or personal computer and the like. In embodiments content nodes include or are part of data access engines that index and provide access to and control management and indexing of content. The data access engines may be associated with an enterprise firewall such as in a configuration where as data is brought inside a firewall such as an enterprise firewall where the access engine takes control of management of the data. An access engine may for example take data from a connector broker service or the like and encrypt the data as it is brought through an enterprise firewall. The access engine may tag data add metadata and otherwise provide security for such data including managing access permission to access the data outside the firewall in the various repositories.

Sharing between members of the federated access facility may be from inside the federated sharing facility where the federated access facility appears to be a single content system with folders data streams and communication streams for different users groups. The federated access facility may provide translation facilities transparent to the user for translations of content extracted from moved between and loaded to different repository formats e.g. for repositories that employ different file types and different IRM protection schemes . Sharing a content item such as a document may then be handled as if it is merely a file management action enabling the user to move documents around within the federated access facility as if the heterogeneous repositories were one contiguous file management system such as for moving files duplicating copying pasting files allocating a file to a data stream attaching a file to a communication stream and the like. In one embodiment storing a file in an access repository may automatically implement security for the file such as using encryption or requiring access credentials accounting for the log on and storage environment of the storage environment. For example dropping a file into a commercial cloud storage environment might automatically trigger encryption of the file such that the file can be accessed only from the federated access facility by an authorized party including a third party participant in an exchange for example .

The functionality of the federated access facility may include a wide range of capabilities described throughout this disclosure including but not limited to document level IRM access control of shared documents remote wipe control of shared documents viewing and editing of non native application documents remote viewing of spreadsheet content document use tracking for compliance and visibility cross platform synchronization virtual window screen capture host client layered security environment cloud enabled virtual software applications application virtualization to client devices end point sharing security off line file access secure viewing of a document location based file access and the like.

The secure federated access facility may provide federated content access and management functionality across the various repositories such as collaborative document actions searching auditing access policy implementation security e discovery and the like. Collaborative document actions may include sharing and un sharing with a non member of the facility such as where inbound documents may be translated and incorporated into the system. Outbound documents may contain encapsulated metadata including document history configuration information and the like such as to be re incorporated when the document is shared again as an inbound document across different business entities and the like. Sharing activity history may be shared post sharing activity history may be shared sharing may be provided with intent functionality there may be the capability to un share e.g. a remote device wipe provide end point sharing control and the like.

The secure federated access facility may provide federated viewing functionality such as with the ability to securely view a document stored on a diverse collection of repository types and from different computing devices including as stored on a secure repository on a limited security repository from a secure mobile device e.g. an enterprise configured mobile computing device A B from an unsecure mobile device A e.g. personal device a device connected through an unsecure network when a user is viewing off line when a user is viewing through a spreadsheet viewer and the like. View permissions may be shared and un shared provided through a secure viewing facility viewed through a DRM sharing facility e.g. without plugins and the like.

Sharing may comprise permissioning such as for access control e.g. read write copy print user credential permissioning location based credential permissioning e.g. file location file repository location time based credential permissioning and the like. Auditing functionality may enable tracking what content was viewed e.g. including sub parts of files by whom when for what duration and the like. Auditing may comprise auditing metadata such as without access to data e.g. by an orchestration layer . Access restrictions may be provided to improve security such as with geo location based access restrictions network type access restrictions personnel classification access restrictions and the like e.g. implemented through IRM controls .

The secure federated access facility may provide policies for access to federated repositories such as for specifying who is allowed to store or view documents on different types of repositories. For instance a Chief Information Officer CIO of an enterprise may want marketing personnel to have access to files stored in a commercial repository but not be able to share or store enterprise content in the commercial repository. In another instance engineering personnel may be able to store content in a commercial repository but the content may be IRM protected. Policy may also specify how personal files are handled within the secure federated access facility. For instance the system may allow employees to access their personal files from the workplace but inform them that their actions are auditable and that they may not put company information at risk. In another instance employees may be able to share documents with outside parties that use commercial repositories but these actions may be auditable and include protection of files that are shared from the company to the partner.

Various types of content repositories may be accommodated within the construct of the secure federated access facility including enterprise storage inside and outside the firewall of the enterprise. Enterprise storage outside the enterprise firewall may include company content stored on a third party secure facility a third party unsecure facility an employee personal device e.g. device B inside enterprise firewall and device A outside the enterprise firewall and outside firewall and the like. Content types may include enterprise finance database financial data repository human resources database supply chain management database analytic databases e.g. for marketing sales and inventory database CRM database general enterprise databases and the like.

Different repositories may have different formats and processes associated with storage and access. The secure federated access facility may provide translation functionality for movement of content between repositories such as for moving content between different secure repositories between an unsecure repository and a secure repository as the result of content inbound from outside user outbound to outside user and the like. Translation methodologies and topologies between heterogeneous repositories may be provided as direct connectors between repositories e.g. using various extraction transformation and loading ETL systems using brokers translators using bridges or other intermediate connections and translation services including in service oriented architectures such as using SOAP protocols or WSDL as metadata based connectors using light data interchange formats e.g. JSON and the like.

Sharing content beyond the firewall may include both inbound and outbound sharing. For instance outbound sharing may be directly to a second enterprise such as to locations inside a second enterprise firewall to a second enterprise computing device outside either firewall e.g. in the field from one computing device to another across an unsecure network to a portable data storage device to a third party secure facility to a third party unsecure facility and the like. Inbound sharing of content may be sharing directly from a second enterprise such as from inside a second enterprise firewall from a second enterprise computing device outside second enterprise firewall and or outside enterprise firewall e.g. in the field from one computing device to another across an unsecure network from a third party secure facility from a third party unsecure facility and the like. Sharing content may be provided to from different types of computer storage including server based e.g. inside the enterprise cloud based desktop computer laptop computer tablet smartphone portable data storage device storage disk and the like.

The secure federated access facility may provide a unified environment where diverse content repositories with varying levels of security protocols and process may be accessible to a user without the user needing to consider the security implications formats protocols or processes of the different repositories. In addition as different content repositories typically have their own login the secure federated access facility may provide a single sign on process for all systems and repositories associated with the system. In this way the secure federated access facility may provide a single secure access environment for all of the user s needs.
