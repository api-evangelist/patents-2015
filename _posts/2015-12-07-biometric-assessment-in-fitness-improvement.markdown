This patent document contains material subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the photocopy reproduction of the patent document or the patent disclosure in exactly the form it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights to its original work. To the extent that any material herein may legitimately fall within the scope of any copyright protection previously claimed by another party including material presented herein potentially subject to the Fair Use doctrine Applicant disclaims any intellectual property ownership thereof or copyright protection therefore.

The present disclosure relates to an electronic fitness improvement system that utilizes biometric information from and about users to generate personalized exercise workout information.

Biometric sensor systems are known in the art. A prior Internet publication regarding a Tanita MC 980 Multi Frequency Segmental Body Composition Meter the Tanita reference describes a biosensor information collection system having a automated stand station with a scale at the base of the stand and a digital display at the top of the stand. The publication further explains that a height measurement accessory is optional.

Prior art biometric sensors are generally configured to determine the body fat of a user via the imposition of a low voltage alternating current AC between electrodes in contact with at least two points of said user s body. The complex impedance of the user s body between said points of contact comprising a real resistive component and an imaginary reactive component determines the current flow between said points. Expressed in alternative language a small current is imposed at one electrode said current flows through the user s body to another electrode and the voltage between the two electrodes is measured. In accordance with the inherent definition of impedance a user s bioimpedance is defined as the ratio of the analog voltage applied between any two of the two or more sensors in communication with a user s body to the analog current measured to flow between said sensors. Accordingly two sensors are required for any measurement and the use of more than two biosensors permits the measurement of bioimpedance between each pair of two sensors. Where a measured scalar value is acceptable for the use at hand only the magnitude of the current and voltage need be obtained. Whenever the true nature of the complex impedance is required to permit analysis of both resistivity and reactance which in turn enables determination of other characteristics such as relative permittivity the phase relationship between the measured current and voltage must also be known. Raw data from this measurement is then correlated with other data including but limited to an estimate of the volume of the user s body and calibration information specific to the hardware to estimate the body fat content of the user. Whenever used herein the term bioimpedance refers to the analog ratio of an AC voltage at one or more frequencies between a particular pair of biosensors in communication with a user s body to the current flowing through said body between the same two sensors. This is an analog quantity whether in scalar or complex form and it should be understood that its measurement requires the use of one or more specialized analog machines. Said specialized analog machines include but are not limited to an AC generator capable of producing at least a sinusoidal output but in some embodiments the AC generator may also be configured to produce waveforms of other types such as square waves triangular waves ramp waves sawtooth waves and frequency domain comb waves comprising simultaneous components of specified frequencies and amplitudes. Other specialized machines required for bioimpedance measurements include analog voltage measurement devices and analog current measurement devices. These are known in the art to comprise the analog components necessary to measure the analog quantities of voltage and current which may subsequently be converted to digital form via known analog to digital A2D conversion. This subsequent conversion does not alter the fact that the voltage and current components and the bioimpedance represented by their ratio are unquestionable analog quantities and that their measurement and determination cannot correctly be deemed to be any form of computer based process or method.

Whenever used herein the term biodata typically refers to the combination of the user s measure bioimpedance data in conjunction with the user s measured weight both of which are data obtained from measurement of at least one biological characteristic of a user s body. However in some contexts the terms biodata and bioimpedance used with reference to data may pertain to either the bioimpedance data or the weight data separately since both may be characterized as elements of a user s biodata.

A method known in the art to estimate the user s volume is to scale the impedance measurement with the square of the user s height. However this method fails to account for the cross sectional area of the user s body that is equally important in any calculation of body volume. While this electrical determination method is generally not as accurate as other methods such as hydrostatic weighing methods it is often preferred because it is fast non intrusive and requires a minimum of external equipment. While the prior art teaches the use of this hardware for simple body fat determination it fails to disclose the use of this hardware for more extensive assessment and characterization of users bodies thereby leaving any number of needs unmet for which such assessment and characterization may be highly beneficial.

The system disclosed in the Tanita reference is not an exercise development system. For example the system as disclosed in the Tanita reference does not provide any exercise recommendations much less do so by identifying specific exercises to be performed on identified exercise equipment. The system of the Tanita reference also does not connect with a mobile application that may be utilized to collect data about specific exercise apparatus or specific exercise facilities. There are many other aspects of the present disclosure not disclosed in the Tanita reference.

Mobile exercise development applications have also been disclosed in the prior art. One such reference U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20130196821 the 821 reference discloses a mobile exercise development application that collects biometric information about a user collects data about available exercise machines such as with a scanner on the mobile device and with both of these types of information generates customized exercise routines for the user.

The 821 reference does not disclose an automated biometric information collection station much less use of such a stand to provide the biometric data to a mobile exercise development application. The 821 reference also does not disclose use of information generated by the application such as exercise apparatus identification data for apparatus in particular locations to provide a database of exercise apparatus at differing such locations.

Further to applicants knowledge the prior art does not include any such database compilation of exercise facilities by location much less one accessible by a mobile application. Although Google maps and other mobile applications have long tracked and reported a mobile device user s location and directions to differing identified locations to applicants knowledge such prior art applications have not provided an identification of differing exercise facility locations along with identification of exercise resources such as particular machines available at the locations respectively. Similarly they have not provided automatic identification of the subset of locations available locally to a mobile application device user. And mapping features have not been provided with any such features to applicants knowledge.

The applicants believe they have discovered problems and deficiencies in the prior art such as those set forth above and others solved by one or more embodiments disclosed in this specification.

The automated system disclosed herein comprises stand alone exercise workout generation apparatus systems and methods designed to meet the specific needs of each user based on information provided by the user newly collected and previously stored data obtained from direct measurement of the user exercise resource information compiled via other methods described herein and a workout generation engine configured to apply best practices in the art and science of physical conditioning. It is envisioned that the preferred embodiment s of this invention will provide all of the benefits of a human personal trainer via a relatively inexpensive automated system entirely separate from and not in communication with any other apparatus device or machine used to actually perform specific exercises. This is a substantial advantage over known system which require communication with one or more other devices in order to obtain data from users for the purpose of generating exercise workout recommendations often in real time as exercises are actually being performed. Such systems are both complex and expensive rendering them unsuitable for use in small facilities such as limited fitness facilities often afforded by hotels and larger companies for the benefit of their employees. Due to its comparatively lower cost small footprint and extreme versatility and extensibility the present invention is well suited for such applications and provides equivalent functionality in most regards as will be described in greater detail below. As such it solves a problem known in the art and fills a need in the burgeoning field of personal fitness services.

A further advantage of Applicant s apparatus and systems is that it is compatible with any type of exercise equipment including exercise machines lacking the capability to communicate electronically with more sophisticated devices and systems that monitor user performance in real time and incidentally provide workout recommendations. A simple fitness facility that offers only free weights a pull up or chin up bar and floor mats has absolutely no use for a system that requires integration with a complex elliptical trainer electronic stationary bicycle or a comparable device that requires sensors and other monitoring paraphernalia attached to the user while the user is performing exercises. Applicant s invention is perfectly suited for such facilities and by virtue of its novel methods of exercise generation will provide essentially equivalent results at a mere fraction of the cost. In other words one of the novel aspects of Applicant s invention is its lack of reliance on any other equipment or data source. It is a self sufficient stand alone system that provides no actual physical exercise performance for the user and operates independently of any form of exercise apparatus or machine.

The apparatus and systems disclosed herein are principally directed toward individual users and patrons of a wide variety of public and private facilities including but not limited to health clubs gyms hotels motels municipal recreational locations and private apartment complexes that offer exercise facilities to guests and residents. Many such facilities provide exercise equipment with little or no guidance for users the system described herein will advantageously provide much needed support for those users. Further the apparatus and systems are not necessarily directed exclusively to commercial entities. Some embodiments of Applicant s invention are suitable for purchase and by individuals particularly those who represent the higher end of the retail exercise machine market.

Although the systems and methods herein are suitable for one time exercise generation an important advantage over known systems is that the present invention is configured to retain historical data for each user and generate exercise workout recommendations on an on demand basis for an open ended period as long as the user wishes to continue using the system based in part on a user s present preferences as well as prior activity. In some embodiments the system is operative to receive a set of preferences and goals from a user and prospectively generate workouts on demand that direct the user toward achieving said goals via the user s preferences. Each new exercise workout may draw upon the user s exercise history and other relevant data so that the optimal updated workout is always available to each user. For the purpose of the instant disclosure the terms prospective and prospectively are used to refer to exercise workouts based on assessment of a user s past and present data with results of the prescribed exercises being extrapolated forward prospectively toward any goals established by the system or supplied by the user without any previous confirmation of efficacy other than best practices in the art of exercise generation. For example a certain exercise that burns sufficient calories would be expected by best practice assessments to produce a weight loss in a particular user if included in exercise workouts. When it is prescribed as a part of an exercise workout for an overweight user based on the user s past and present data and reliance on that best practice assessment said exercise workout is deemed to be prospectively generated because the anticipated future results are extrapolated from present and past data only. No confirming data exists that the anticipated results will actually be achieved is available in methods of prospective workout generation.

Another novel feature of the disclosed system and methods is the anonymous association and aggregation of users data exercise workouts generated by the system and the results achieved by the community of users. Applicant is not aware of any present resource that provides a compilation of such data permitting correlation of the effectiveness or lack thereof of certain exercise practices based on characteristics of users including weight bioimpedance age sex present physical condition body type and the like. Over time as exercise workouts are provided by the system and are performed by users while biometric data user preference data and user goal data are obtained and anonymously aggregated extensive information will be available to assess the efficacy of particular exercises and combinations thereof for different types and characteristics of users. This historical data may therefore be used to further refine and improve the exercise workouts provided by the system in conjunction with as a supplement to or in lieu of the prospective exercise workout methods disclosed herein. When aggregated historical results of other users are incorporated in the generation of exercise workouts as described elsewhere herein said workouts are no longer simply prospectively based but now also comprise at least some degree of anticipated success or failure based on historically demonstrated actions and results. In this sense use of historical data permits a degree of interpolation between a user s past and previous exercises and results and the exercises and results obtained by similar users so that the former may be adjusted as desired to conform to the latter.

In one embodiment the system is configured in a manner that permits users to register and interact anonymously with the automated system without any link to their real identity. In this embodiment providing a user s real name is not required for participation a pseudonym may be provided to the system by the user in lieu of their real identity and any fee payments may be completed via means that do not establish a traceable link between the source of payment and the user s system profile. This additional measure of security provides additional protection for users who may prefer to enhance the privacy of their personal information and biodata.

In one aspect the present specification is directed to an automated system having one or more biometric sensors an interactive screen and an exercise routine generation application. In some systems the automated system comprises an automated station including a support arm extending from a weighing scale to the interactive screen supported by the support arm.

In some embodiments the automated system further comprises a mobile application provided to system users that is communicable with various components of the system for the purpose of receiving data from the automated system and displaying exercise routines or other exercise information to a user for example. In some embodiments the mobile application can include a scanner to scan labels other indicia or physical or other features of an exercise machine or other exercise apparatus to identify the machine or apparatus. Such identification may then be communicated to a networked database in association with the location of the machine or apparatus so that its existence and location may become known to other system users. In this manner a large database of exercise machines and apparatus may be compiled from crowd sourced contributions of the vast body of users thereby forming a more comprehensive aggregation of exercise resources than could be compiled by any other means.

In this and other embodiments a mobile application also communicates with one or more local or remote databases to identify differing exercise facility locations within a geographic area and identify exercise apparatus available in each of the differing facilities within that geographic area or locale. In some systems the mobile application device can include a scanner such as identified above to identify exercise resources available a given facility and place that information into the one or more databases. The mobile application may access any location service data available from the host device such as without limitation GPS data cellular site information WiFi access point SSID and its associated location and the like. Said location service data may be associated with the identification of exercise resources transmitted to the one or more databases so that the location of said resources is generally known. As location service data is often not highly accurate in one embodiment the mobile application user is presented with a list of known facilities in the general area corresponding to the location service data of the device and afforded an opportunity to select the correct facility. Such facilities may include but are not limited to health clubs and gyms publicly accessible facilities hotels and motels apartment complexes municipal facilities and the like. In one embodiment a user may be prompted to enter a ZIP code or other location specific information and system resources will be used to retrieve proximate locations of exercise equipment specific exercise resources such as equipment at said locations a list of exercises that may be performed on said resources or any combination of the above.

In one embodiment the one or more databases comprising exercise resources are primarily compiled from information provided by owners or administrators of said resources. In one embodiment said databases are primarily compiled from information provided by users of the mobile application. In one embodiment said databases are primarily compiled from information provided by any interested person.

In one embodiment the mobile application may be configured to present to a user a list of all exercise resources known to the one or more databases in an identified facility for the purpose of verification. As resources are replaced or removed previously submitted information may no longer accurately reflect the resources available at a facility. Providing one or more means within the system to maintain accurate information in said databases via update mechanism s is preferred. In this manner the crowd sourced advantages of the user generated database of exercise resources and their locations may be continuously updated with the same degree of attention from the entire base of system users rather than relying on just a handful of administrators.

In embodiments where information may be provided by mobile application users said users may be incentivized to obtain submit or update information regarding available exercise resources. For example users who discover and submit resource and location information not previously known to the system or who verify the resources available at any given facility may receive consideration in return including but not limited to cash compensation merchandise or merchandise credit promotional credit or credit toward any subscription or participation fees associated with their use of the system.

In certain embodiments the one or more databases comprising exercise resource information may further comprise data pertaining to the specific exercises for which said resources are suitable. These associated exercises are preferably obtained from the manufacturers or suppliers of the hardware most familiar with the capability of said equipment stored in the one or more databases and used to populate fields in the relevant database s whenever a particular resource and its location are reported and added. Alternatively if it is desirable to store the resource data in a first database and the applicable exercises for each resource in a second database said first and second databases may be linked in any of the known ways to associate the data in each one with the appropriate data of the other. In another embodiment users owners or administrators of said resources may provide such associated exercise information when the resource is first reported and added to the one or more databases. For example exercise resources belonging to the family of treadmill type machines are suitable for the exercises of walking jogging or running. Certain machines in that family if configurable to provide a sufficient incline may be suitable for use where stair climbing exercises are prescribed in a generated exercise workout. Both free weights and exercise machines offering controllable resistance are generally suitable for arm chest and shoulder muscle development but only the controllable resistance machine may be deemed suitable for exercises performed by older or injured users where the use of free weights would be dangerous and impractical for those users. In short the system is configured to receive store and provide a list of exercise resources within a certain geographical area along with a list of exercises associated with each such resource for the purpose of exercise workout generation described in detail elsewhere herein.

In certain embodiments users can access exercise facility information through their mobile devices. For example a mobile application can procure the user s location via the device s location service data to procure and display local exercise facilities and their respective exercise resources.

In certain embodiments the automated system or an automated station is communicable with the mobile application that reports differing exercise facilities within a defined geographic area and exercise apparatus available in said facilities. The mobile application device can include a scanning feature such as set forth above. In some embodiments the mobile application or web or other portal can provide the user with locations of exercise facilities that have certain equipment such as the automated station disclosed herein compatible with the user s mobile application or other equipment that the user can use to otherwise access the user s information provided earlier such as for example for storage in one or more databases. Some systems can include all the features identified above. Additional features of the automated system automated station or mobile application include information or instructions for how to perform an exercise and or graphic or video demonstrations of exercises with identified apparatus.

In some embodiments the automated station can act as a personal trainer that generates workout recommendations video tutorials and specific body group exercises. For example the automated station can provide the ability to help patrons of small unmanaged gymnasiums and unsupervised fitness rooms by providing a step by step guide for fitness instruction.

In some embodiments the automated station can report damaged equipment to managers etc. The automated station also can communicate with an optional mobile phone application that offers a handheld guide to user. The station can further provide a complete resource for small to large gymnasium complex utilization.

In some embodiments the automated station mobile application such as those compatible with an iPhone iPad iPod or other smartphone or mobile device or both may include at least one of any of a login to keep track of body stat information weight body fat percentage muscle mass other physical characteristics etc a nutrition guide a customized periodic workout regimen for a user with adaptation when needed for a user using differing types of equipment either in the same facility or in varying types of exercise facilities user workout tracking data collection and reporting video or graphical tutorials on equipment use and GPS capabilities to locate an apartment or other exercise facility in a particular geographic local in some embodiments with a map layout of the facility and identification of exercise resources in the gym.

With an integrated system including the automated station and the mobile application device having user location tracking mapping and exercise resource identification features a user can travel and yet easily locate and follow mapping instructions to find a suitable exercise facility if available in the user s geographic locale.

In some embodiments the mobile application device may also include at least one of any of a QR code bar code or other code scanner function for scanning and identifying exercise or other resources in the exercise facility safety information means to submit damage reports to complex manager means to communicate with or find partners in the same facility means to chat in linked forums about workouts and health matters and means contact a facility manager about concerns.

In one embodiment data representing an exercise workout generated by one or more resources in the automated system may be communicated to an electronic device in the possession of or accessible to either a user or a third party designated by a user on said user s behalf. The exercise workout data may be communicated to and be available for presentation by the electronic device to the user or his designee via the mobile application running on any suitable electronic device.

The exercise workout data may comprise at least one or any combination of different formats. A first exemplary format may comprise any or all of a written list of specific exercises their order of performance durations intensity and the length of intervening rest periods. This first format provides a concise listing of the exercises for quick user reference. In lieu of or in addition to said written list one or more icons representing each exercise and related information may be provided. The exercises and related information may be conveyed to the user via the use of different images colors sizes or other visual distinctions between the various data.

A second exemplary format may comprise one or more video presentations depicting a trained professional properly performing each exercise. Preferably said exercises are depicted in the order prescribed in the exercise workout each with the number of repetitions corresponding to the exercise workout and performed at the correct rate for said workout. The video presentation may be comprised of short segments each with one or more repetitions combined into the larger presentation in the order and quantity necessary to conform to the prescribed exercise workout along with the proper periods of rest added between each exercise or exercise set. This video presentation will permit the user to perform the exercise workout at the correct pace by following along with said presentation while simultaneously observing the proper exercise methods and form.

A third exemplary format may comprise a video display other than that of an exercise professional such as an animated display of any type with abstract or quasi realistic images with appropriate audio cues including but not limited to sounds tones music or voice instructions provided at the correct pace tempo to accompany the user s exercise workout. In this manner the user would not be constrained to watch the video display while exercising but may receive video audio or video and audio clues or guidance as desired to assist the completion of their exercise workout.

Data pertaining to an exercise workout may be communicated to and stored by the electronic device by any known means including but not limited to a wired connection method known in the art via a USB Firewire optical or any other type of direct wired connection by a wireless connection method known in the art via a WiFi BlueTooth ZigBee NFC infrared or any other manner of free space propagation by transfer of data via a memory chip card or other device upon which data is stored when connected to a component of the system and retrieved by the electronic device when later connected thereto or by any other known or later developed means of data transfer. Any communication protocol compatible with the chosen means of communication may be utilized. In this embodiment the exercise workout data is stored within the memory of said electronic device and may be accessed and displayed by the user or his designee on demand.

In one embodiment the data pertaining to an exercise workout may be streamed in real time to an electronic device at the position of or a position proximate to a user. Such streaming may be sent to a mobile device such as a smartphone tablet or any similar or compatible device via one or more wireless connections as described above. Alternatively or additionally said exercise workout data may be streamed via any wired or wireless connection to any compatible display mounted in a visible location such as a wall proximate to the user s exercise location. Alternatively or additionally any audio portion of said exercise workout data may be communicated to a wireless audio receiving device such as BlueTooth enabled headphones or similar devices communicated to a BlueTooth enabled device operatively connected to wired or wireless headphones or similar devices or communicated to a user in any manner that provides equivalent results. Whenever exercise workout data is streamed to any device the requirement for said device to store such data is removed. This embodiment is particularly useful when the exercise workout data is too large to be conveniently stored on said device.

In one embodiment any portion of the data and information in a user s profile resident within the automated system and any of its component devices and resources may be communicated to said user upon request. Such user profile data includes data provided by the user all measured data obtained by the system the content of all exercise workouts generated by the system and all other data associated with the user s interaction with the system with corresponding dates and times. Such data may be provided by the automated system to the mobile application disclosed elsewhere herein or provided to the user via any other preferred means. In this manner the user or his designee will be assured of having full access to his own data for any desired purpose beyond the functions provided by the automated system.

Systems disclosed herein can provide novel methods of using the systems including novel business methods. Any conceivable combination of fees or associated privileges are envisioned by this disclosure illustrated by the following non limiting examples.

Use of the automated system by a user will necessitate the establishment of a business relationship between said user and the operator of the automated system. Such relationship may involve in some embodiments the payment of fees by the user for services provided by the automated system as disclosed below thereby establishing a direct financial relationship. In other embodiments use of the automated system may be provided to users without charge. In those cases some other non financial form of business relationship will necessarily exist between the automated system operator and the user. Even when no direct financial transaction occurs between the user and the automated system operator the exchange of information between the user and the automated system still creates a fundamental business relationship between said parties wherein services are offered by the automated system operator and the user and the user accepts any conditions of participation and receives such services. However any number of other business relationships between the user automated system operator and third parties are possible. As the automated system and its components comprising among other resources automated station s mobile application s and network infrastructure obtain information from many sources and provide such information and useful services to other parties interacting with the system any number of commercial activities and business models are enabled by this invention and will be immediately obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art and are envisioned by this disclosure.

One novel business method may involve charging users a fee to subscribe to the services provided by the automated system automated station s and mobile application s including but not limited to using the mobile application to generate database s identifying the types of exercise apparatus available in each of differing exercise facilities using the automated station s to input user data measure biodata and generate exercise workouts and benefit from any or all of the system features. Some services of the automated system may be provided to users without charge and others may be classified as premium services subject to a fee.

Purchase of a use license for the mobile application may entitle the user to visit one or more exercise facilities also subscribing to the service at no additional charge on a limited or continuing basis. In another embodiment the use license for the mobile application is provided free to users but exercise facilities located and selected by said application remit a fee to the system operator for every mobile application user who patronizes said exercise facility.

Facilities offering access to exercise equipment including the automated station disclosed herein may provide compensation to or receive compensation from the system operator for the privilege of being included in the one or more databases particularly with preferential placement or recognition. Users who learn of particular facilities and incorporate them into the system may receive a discount applied toward any fees required to participate.

In one embodiment use of the mobile application and other components of the automated system are provided free to users who consent to share their contact information for the purpose of receiving targeted advertising material. In one embodiment exercise equipment manufacturers may remit a fee to the system operator for the privilege of providing product information on consumer grade exercise equipment products to users whose exercise history or user preferences are compatible with said manufacturer s product offerings. Further advertising in conjunction with any or all the services provided by the automated system exercise facilities and exercise resource equipment may also provide a source of remuneration for any of the parties associated with operation of or participation in the automated system. All are envisioned herein and included within the scope of this disclosure.

One additional example of a business model enabled by the system involves the participation of third party personal trainers and other professionals via the oversight of exercise workout programs of users. A primary advantage of the automated system disclosed herein is that the system provides users with an equivalent level of guidance and expertise in exercise workout generation as do personal trainers or fitness consultants. Just as the human trainers and consultants do the automated system considers all of the pertinent factors necessary to generate a safe and effective exercise workout for a user but at a significantly lower cost to the user in many embodiments. However under certain circumstances automated system users may desire to include participation of a human trainer in their activities related to the automated system. For example and without any limitation on the applicability of other examples or embodiments a trainer s client may wish to perform a certain portion of his exercise workouts in a facility distant from his normal location due to travel requirements and seeks to allow remote supervision by his trainer. A client with special requirements such as those of a professional athlete under the supervision of team medical personnel may be required to maintain close coordination with said personnel to ensure that appropriate activities are being prescribed and performed. Lay persons under medical supervision perhaps following surgery or a heart attack may prefer to include their physician s supervision of all exercise activities. Some users may simply prefer that the totality of their exercise activities be prescribed supervised or monitored by a human trainer or other exercise specialist. Any number of other possibilities exist that may warrant human guidance of a user s exercise activities by a third party all of which are envisioned herein. The automated system of this invention provides novel opportunities to incorporate the remote participation of a trainer into the user s exercise activities thereby leading to additional business opportunities.

As described above a user s exercise workouts and all other data obtained or stored by the automated system are preferably available to said user or designee upon demand. When a user desires to share such information with a third party trainer or other professional the system may be configured to permit the user to authorize direct access to said user s data by the third party professional on his behalf as his designee using one or more networked communications resources of the automated system described elsewhere herein. Said third party designee may then review the user s data and advise the user as to the efficacy of the exercise workouts generated by the system provide guidance to the user regarding the imposition of limits or other modifications to the generation of future workouts or simply confirm that the user s activities are consistent with said third party professional s recommendations. When the third party professional deems that modification of the exercise workouts are warranted said modifications are preferably communicated to the automated system via one or more user preferences disclosed in great detail elsewhere herein. Said user preferences are always evaluated by the system and accommodated whenever possible as a component of the one or more of the system s methods implemented by the workout generation engine. When the third party professional s recommendations rise to a higher level of concern such as increasing the potential for injury the user may provide information to the system categorized as potential injury limitations also disclosed in great detail elsewhere herein. As the automated system is configured to observe any and all constraints based on potential user injury any such limitations imposed by third party professionals will always be incorporated in generated exercise workouts.

In one embodiment recommendations of third party professionals are preferably supplied to the automated system by the user. In one embodiment the third party professional may access the automated system using one or more networked communications resources described elsewhere herein and directly supply any and all exercise workout recommendations or limitations as user preferences or injury limitations on behalf of the user.

Third party professionals may utilize the features and advantages of the system in service of their existing clients and for recruitment of new clients thereby providing a business model complementary to the relationship between the automated system operator and its users. In one embodiment the automated system further comprises a database of fitness professionals available for hire by system users. If and when desired by a user said database may be queried to obtain a list of professionals available based on availability cost experience client evaluations ratings geographic location particular fitness specialty or any other criteria deemed useful or desirable. In one embodiment they automated system is configured to permit the user to contact and potentially retain the services of one or more third party professionals using system resources described herein. In one embodiment the user is provided with contact information and may contact and retain any third party professionals via communication means independent of the automated system.

When third party professionals are involved a business relationship may be established between said professionals and the automated system operator. Depending on the business model established by the automated system operator third party professionals may be included in said database upon request at no charge. In some embodiments remuneration may be provided by professionals to the automated system operator for the privilege of being included in the database based on clients obtained consultation services provided or revenue derived from the automated system all of the above or any of the above in combination with or in lieu of any other desired criteria. In one embodiment the automated system operator may charge a fee to a user for consultation with a third party professional and remit a portion of that fee to the professional as compensation for his participation. In that case the automated system operator will establish business relationships with both the user and the third party professional.

In another embodiment a business relationship may be established between the user and the professional and the automated system configured to provide a payment mechanism to facilitate that relationship. For example payment for services rendered by the professional to a user may be collected by the automated system which retains a processing fee and remits the balance to the professional.

In another embodiment a first additional business relationship may be established between third party professionals and the automated system operator and a second additional business relationship established between the users and professionals. In some embodiments all compensation from users to third party professionals is handled independently from the automated system. However as disclosed elsewhere these relationships are distinct from the relationship between the user and the system operator by virtue of the services provided by the various resources of the automated system and its components.

In some instances the user directly interacts with on screen elements through the Unity layer. This layer will receive messages from the Android application and then display the contents of the messages. When the user wants to perform an action that would result in data being updated deleted or created the Unity layer collects the information for the change and sends it to the Android application which then relays it to the site specific slave server . In certain instances the system can be integrated with off the shelf hardware and software services such as obtaining for example weight and body fat percentages detected by a Fitbit Aria scale via a web services API accessing hosted Fitbit content.

A load balancing router such as for example a Peplink Multi Wan Router can distribute traffic inside a firewall to and from distributed web servers .

The site specific slave servers may store complete copies partial copies or both of database tables thus reducing the amount of inbound and outbound data traffic. In some instances some or all local database table copies are read only and are updated using a replication scheme such as snapshot replication. Any changes originating at the site specific slave servers or the automated stations are either redirected to the centralized master servers with the site specific local servers re synced or alternatively are stored on the site specific local server and later synced through a synchronization mechanism capable of resolving conflicts such as database integrity conflicts.

Referring now to through in some embodiments the automated station includes a weighing scale or at the base of station a support arm or extending upwardly from the base and an interactive touchscreen or at an upper portion of the support arm. In some instances the automated station also includes two electrical bioimpedance sensors and sometimes referred to collectively as sensors extending from the stand or touchscreen . In certain implementations the sensors are mounted in opposed handles extending laterally outwardly from opposed sides of the touchscreen . In certain embodiments not shown additional bioimpedance sensors may be provided on the lower portion of the automated station to permit contact with the a portion of a user s leg s or feet. When more than two sensors are provided the system may be configured to use any combination of two or more of the sensors to obtain as many bioimpedance measurements as may be desired. In some embodiments a voltage may be created between each pair of sensors one pair at time with such voltage applied to each individual pair of sensors and the current flowing therebetween measured in a sequential manner. In other embodiments a signal may be activated at a first sensor and the voltage difference and current flowing between said first sensor and all of the remaining sensors measured during the period when the signal at said first sensor is activate. This embodiment may provide for a more rapid measurement process but requires that the system apparatus performing the measurement such as the automated station either comprise more than one set of voltage and current measurement devices for simultaneous measurement at each sensor or that said device be configured to automatically switch at least one set of voltage and current measurement devices to measure those electrical parameters between each desired pair of sensors. For the reasons discussed elsewhere herein it may be advantageous to measure the bioimpedance of a user s limbs independently in addition to the whole body bioimpedance of the user so that the pronounced contribution of limb bioimpedance may be used to adjust the whole body bioimpedance to more accurately characterize the muscle and fat content of the user s trunk where the preponderance of body fat is stored. Bioimpedance measurements of different portions of a user s body may be accomplished by choosing the locations at which the two or more biosensors are placed.

The automated station may include an internal computer having a microprocessor digital memory and storage resources the touchscreen display and communications facilities such as an Ethernet port a USB port other ports if desired and wireless Wi Fi connectivity. These features may be used to provide any useful system function including but not limited to receiving processing and communicating analog data from weighing scale or analog data from biosensors or any sensor devices providing equivalent functionality or analog or digital data from any other source to other resources in the system or to the user.

As previously disclosed use of the weighing scale or and biosensors for data collection is preparatory to the generation of an exercise workout recommendation for a user. The automated station does not comprise any functionality for providing actual physical exercise to a user. Depending upon the specific embodiment the automated station is merely an apparatus for the input of user data including measurements the output of system generated information communication with other system components and in some cases the performance of all or any portion of the exercise workout generation process. As such the weighing scale and the biosensors are not deployed and active concurrently with the user s performance of the generated exercise workout. Such activities occur independently form the automated system without the communication of any data between the automated station its sensors and any other exercise related apparatus.

In order for the automated system to generate a personalized workout the user will provide certain initial information to the automated system and additional information will be collected from specialized custom hardware present in the system. Data preferably supplied by the user may include but is not necessarily limited to a username system password e mail address name age height measurement waist measurement chest measurement hip measurement and sex. The user will also preferably input their body type ectomorph mesomorph or endomorph often referred to as a somatotype by selecting one of the three images that most closely matches their own body shape based on self assessment. The user s body type may be correlated with a relatively high degree of efficacy to certain types of exercises known in the art to effectively address the physical fitness needs of that classification of users. Further as described elsewhere herein an accurate self assessment of a user s somatotype enables a more accurate determination of whole body bioimpedance than has been previously known in the art.

In one embodiment users will be prompted to provide information describing their present exercise workout activities including but not limited to a self assessment of their present physical condition the number of times they exercise per month and the extent of any other physical activity in which they engage on a regular or semi regular basis. This information is important in the process of generating exercise workouts so that an appropriate regimen neither too lax nor too rigorous may be prescribed for the user particularly at the beginning of their program.

In one embodiment users will be prompted to provide information regarding any preferences positive or negative on the type s of exercise s or exercise resources machines or devices which the exercise workout generation method should favor or avoid whenever possible. When a user has voluntarily and repeatedly engaged in certain activities such as using a stationary bicycle providing identical or similar exercises as component s of a system generated exercise workout may be more familiar and enjoyable to that user. To the contrary if a user has previously engaged in certain unenjoyable exercise activities such as running because it has been the only means of exercise know or available to that user selecting treadmill exercises for that user would generally decrease the user s interest and make the exercise workouts less enjoyable than they might otherwise be. While each user s preferences are envisioned to be only one of many exercise workout generation input components for one or more embodiments of the present invention incorporating exercise preferences of individual users can only serve to favorably customize the overall workout experience for each user.

In one embodiment users will be prompted to provide information regarding any past or present injuries that may be relevant to certain type s of exercises to be preferred or avoided when an exercise workout is generated for said user. For example a user with a history of shoulder injuries particularly those requiring surgical repair may not be a good candidate to perform exercise workouts comprising free weights due to the instability of free weights and the risk of potentially incurring sudden shear forces. For that particular user a machine that imparts a stable resistance to the user would be less likely to aggravate or re injure vulnerable areas of that user s body. Likewise a user with a replaced hip or knee joint may not be a good candidate for treadmill activities where one or more lower impact exercise activities may be prescribed instead.

In one embodiment the user may enter his or her specific goals including but not limited to general fitness a desired degree of weight loss overall muscle building development of a particular body region over another or any hybrid combination of these or any other goals. As with the selection of individual exercises based on a user s preferences positive or negative as disclosed above generating an exercise workout program for each user specifically directed toward said user s principal goal is preferable. Of course there is a certain degree of unavoidable overlap between several of the exemplary goals presented above increasing physical activity to build muscle is also very likely to lead to a certain degree of weight loss. However a user primarily interested in losing weight may better achieve that goal by performing aerobic exercises that expend maximum energy and increase the user s heart rate than performing other exercises that repeatedly strengthen a limited muscle group. In other words when a certain goal is preferred by a user the combination of component exercises in a generated workout may be tailored to the greatest degree possible to direct the anticipated results toward the user s stated goals. In one embodiment this focus may be particularly beneficial to certain users pursuing rehabilitation after injury or illness where overall fitness and lower impact is greatly preferred over a more rigorous regimen of exercises better suited to an athlete in training.

With respect to information provided by each user all such information will be stored in the user s profile and at least a portion of said information may be used to assess the physical condition of the user to generate an exercise workout in one or more embodiments of this invention or both. While providing certain information may be optional in certain embodiments users will generally be encouraged to provide as much input as they are comfortable sharing in order to enable any particular embodiment of an exercise workout generation method to provide the most effective and enjoyable workout possible for each user.

The automated system may preferably collect certain biological parameters from the user including but not limited to heart rate body fat percentage weight and the like via at least one of weighing scale device and biometric sensor . For example and without limitation the user s weight may be collected by weighing scale device and biometric sensor may comprise two or more analog electrical impedance sensors or any sensor devices providing equivalent functionality that may be used to determine body fat percentage and obtain any other relevant biological data within the extent of their measurement capability as discussed in greater detail below. These measured parameters will be stored as a part of the user s profile and be available to the automated system applications for use in generating a workout recommendation for the user.

In an embodiment where a user s goal s comprise reducing their weight or body fat to a certain level measuring and persistently storing values of the user s weight and body fat over a period of weeks or months during which prescribed exercises are being performed are essential steps in ascertaining the user s progress toward their body fat or weight loss goals and for determining when those goals are ultimately realized. Lacking access to the user s history of biological parameters the system will have no means of analyzing the user s progress or improving his results. As exercise workouts are generated by the system and then performed by a user on one or more separate machines or using other exercise resources repeated measurement of a user s weight and body fat will provide indispensible feedback for future workout generation. Results of certain combinations of exercise components in an overall workout may be compared to the results of other combinations subsequently compared to the trajectory of a user s measured weight and body fat and when a particular combination of exercise components is found to have the greatest positive effect on either or both of the user s goals said combination may be preferred for use in the generation of all future workouts.

This invention provides a significant advancement over the known art of bioimpedance measurements to facilitate attainment of fitness goals. Present art analog electrical bioimpedance measurement systems are directed toward determining an accurate value of body fat according to conventional understandings and definitions. That is their focus is to provide a measurement result that may be directly compared with measurements obtained via other methods such as hydrostatic weighing. The measurements obtained by systems and methods described herein may also be correlated to those known in the art but their primary utility is to permit the system to monitor report to the user and conform its generation of exercise workouts based on changes in said measurements over time. The specific value s of measurement data collected by the system and presented to the user are far less useful than the relative changes in said data over time as the changes will reveal how the user s body is reacting to the exercise workouts being generated. When the sum total of the data available to the system over time reveals a lack of adequate positive response by the user meaning that the user s physiology is not progressing toward the desired goals the system is configured to modify the exercise workouts generated for the user to improve said response. Likewise when available data reveals that certain exercise workouts yield the desired results the system is configured to maintain the elements of said workout so that the user continues to progress toward his goals.

The measured analog bioimpedance data is one component of the sum total of all data available to the system but comprises a unique and novel role in this invention. Unlike with known systems and methods correlating the data obtained via analog electrical devices to standards known in the industry via one or more approximation methods such as curve fitting and the like is unnecessary. The system is configured to compare the raw data obtained over the course of a user s participation determine the nature of the user s progress and adjust the exercise workouts it generates for maximum benefit to the user as described below. In this sense the measured bioimpedance referred to herein may comprise any one or a series of more than one measurement s most useful for any particular user s purpose and does not refer to any standard that would conform to or that may be correlated with the same standards and results as obtained by hydrostatic weighing. For example a user seeking rehabilitation from an upper body injury may only require bioimpedance measurements in the torso area while a user seeking to lose weight may be primarily concerned with bioimpedance measurements in the waist and hip regions. Only those measurements pertinent to each user s goals are preferably collected and retained by the system.

In some users and depending on the state of their physical conditioning and general health a certain trend in measured bioimpedance coincident with improving conditioning or health may occur in other users where their health and conditioning are declining rather than improving. Due to the wide disparity in physiologies among the human population one person s positive bioimpedance trend may be another s negative trend. However simpler assessment criteria such as the user s weight strength and endurance may be easily determined and instantly interpreted to be good or bad. For example a user seeking to lose weight and gain strength will immediately appreciate that a loss of three pounds and his ability to do ten more pushups over the past week is a positive result. However that same user will not intuitively know whether an increase in the capacitive reactance component of his bioimpedance is good news or bad news. In some embodiments the system may utilize the sum total of any progress criteria available to determine whether changes in a user s measured bioimpedance reflect a positive trend or a negative trend. By correlating the trend of the user s bioimpedance measurements all of the other data supplied to or collected by the system the system will correlate the measured bioimpedance trend with said other data and thereby determine the preferred course for that user s bioimpedance measurements. This feature will be particularly useful when users reach the well known plateaus in their weight loss or conditioning programs and their intuitively apparent rate of progress slows or stalls. If the system determines that the user s measured bioimpedance trend is still progressing in the desired direction the exercise workouts it generates may generally maintain the same general characteristics. However if the measured bioimpedance trend also indicates a change from the preciously established positive track the system will be configured to adjust the exercise workouts in a manner intended to place the user back on course to meet his stated goals. Likewise a change in the measured bioimpedance trend while the user is continuing to progress according to the other intuitive metrics may portend a change in the user s physiology indicating the advisability for some modification to the forthcoming exercise workouts perhaps thereby avoiding a plateau in the user s progress. In short the collection logging and availability of a user s measured bioimpedance data during the course of said user s participation within the system when correlated with all of the other system measured and user provided data comprises yet another objective means for the system to track a user s progress and guide him to the most efficient attainment of his goals.

In some embodiments scaling certain data to account for geometrical characteristics of a user s body may improve accuracy and provide a means to obtain certain targeted data measurements for one or more useful purposes. This form of data refinement should be distinguished from those intended only to provide a standardized result for comparison to the types of measurements obtained from different measurement apparatuses.

In some embodiments biometric sensor may be in data transfer communication with one or more of the computing devices of the automated system and data there from be utilized by an application of the automated system to generate exercise recommendations for the user see . Again the digitization of bioimpedance data and its subsequent use in a computerized system does not diminish the fact that the original data was inherently analog at its inception and required specialized analog machines for its collection as previously disclosed.

In one or more embodiments a user s body fat percentage is used to determine specific exercises along with factors including but not limited to their duration intensity and number of repetitions. Unlike the methods known in the prior art the system of this invention is capable of performing comprehensive assessments of users body composition by analyzing the measured bioimpedance in combination with the user s self assessed somatotype to more accurately determine the user s body volume. Volume calculations are particularly important when a bioimpedance measurement is to be directed toward a specific region of a user s body. Proper volume determinations yield data most applicable to generating exercise workouts optimally directed to achieving the user s goals. In one embodiment at least one of any of the user s height hip measurement waist measurement or chest measurement may be used in any combination with the user s somatotype to further improve the accuracy of the volume calculation. With or without the added enhancements attributable to the use of somatotypes or other user data in certain embodiments a bioimpedance measurement may be supplied to an exercise workout generation method as input for said method. For example a user with a specified goal of building thoracic muscles but initially presenting a high body fat content will be better served by reducing his body fat content to a certain point before beginning a workout routine primarily directed toward his specified goal. In this case the bioimpedance measurement will provide input to the exercise workout method not otherwise known to the system. As the bioimpedance measurements indicate that the user s measured body fat is declining in response to the workouts at least partially directed toward that system determined goal a greater portion of each generated workout may be directed to the user specified goal s .

In one embodiment biometric sensor comprising sensors or any sensor devices providing equivalent functionality may be configured to perform a measurement of a user s bioimpedance using a single frequency. Typical bioimpedance measurement frequencies range from approximately 10 kHz to 1 MHz. The system may select a single frequency at which to measure the users bioimpedance and persistently measure and store said data throughout the period of the user s association with the system.

As the human body is predominantly resistive and capacitive the bioimpedance measurement will comprise components of resistance and capacitive reactance. The resistance of a bioimpedance measurement is known to be relatively constant when measured within the typical frequency range. However the value of any reactive component of bioimpedance is known to vary as a function of the measurement frequency for a constant value of capacitance the measured capacitive reactance will decrease with increasing frequency of measurement as expected as would occur with any capacitance. However the variety of tissues and their density water content and other composition will not necessarily present the same value of capacitance at all frequencies. Cellular structure and water content in particular exhibit frequency dependent characteristics. In one embodiment a measurement frequency at the lower end of this range may be selected where the capacitive reactance is generally higher. In one embodiment a measurement frequency at the higher end of this range may be selected where the capacitive reactance is lower. The system may be configured to select a single frequency anywhere within the typical range provided above at which the users bioimpedance will be consistently measured and stored in the user s profile throughout the user s association with the system. As the user s physical condition changes as a result of the exercise workouts generated by the system and performed by the user so do the measured resistance and reactance values of his bioimpedance and those measured changes may be used to monitor the user s progress and as input for the exercise workout generation process.

In one embodiment the system may be configured to determine the single frequency at which the users bioimpedance comprises a certain measured value of resistance or reactance and said values of measured resistance measured reactance and frequency of measurement may be stored in the user s profile throughout the user s association with the system. In this manner the frequency of measurement will vary as the user s physical condition changes as the user performs exercise workouts generated by the system. As the measured resistance and reactance are only generally related but partially independent either one may be used to determine the measurement frequency but not both simultaneously. Values for all three parameters are preferably stored for each measurement and remain available for future reference. In this embodiment the change in frequency in lieu of a measured reactance and resistance may be correlated to the change in the user s physical condition including but not limited to weight body fat content hydration level and the like.

In one embodiment biometric sensor comprising electrical impedance sensors or any sensor devices providing equivalent functionality may be configured to perform measurements of a user s body fat using more than one frequency. Although measured capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to the frequency of measurement for any constant value of capacitance and as introduced above the cellular nature of the human body does not present the same capacitance to be measured at different frequencies. At the lower end of the typical frequency range measurement current flows is generally unable to penetrate the capacitive cellular walls and therefore flows primarily in the extracellular spaces. At higher frequencies where the cellular capacitive reactance is lower measurement current flows through both intracellular and extracellular paths. For this reason obtaining bioimpedance data at more than one frequency will provide additional data useful to track the physiological response by a user s body to the exercise workouts generated by the system and performed by the user.

In one embodiment such measurement at more than one frequency may be performed iteratively one discrete frequency at a time for as many discrete frequencies as may be desired. In one embodiment measurements may be performed using a continuous frequency sweep beginning and ending at discrete frequencies with the frequency of measurement resistive ad reactive components sampled as frequently as desired during said sweep. The duration of the sweep measurement is dependent upon the total frequency range to be sampled the desired or achievable frequency slew rate the rate at which the voltage and current measurement machines are capable of sampling each parameter and the total number of samples desired within the sweep duration among other factors.

In one embodiment an AC signal comprising one or more frequency components may be impressed between the two or more sensors. Observed in the frequency domain amplitude vs. frequency such signal would comprise a comb signal with each discrete frequency component appearing as a separate contribution to the total signal. Viewed in the time domain amplitude vs. time said signal may appear as a non sinusoidal waveform such as but not limited to a ramp waveform a triangle waveform a square waveform a sawtooth waveform or any other non sinusoidal periodic waveform. Each of such non sinusoidal waveforms comprise more than one frequency component that when all such components are combined results in the non sinusoidal waveform described by any periodic form such as the geometrically similar shapes described above. The equivalence of time and frequency domain depictions of electronic signals via Fourier series construction and decomposition is a fundamental principle of electrical engineering and is extensively developed in the prior art. Such equivalence alone is not a novel feature of this disclosure however Applicant believes that its application of non sinusoidal waveforms comprising multiple frequency measurement of bioimpedance again the ratio of voltage to current measured across at least a portion of a bioorganism is novel in the known art.

In one embodiment bioimpedance measurements may be obtained using a non sinusoidal waveform as described above with a swept fundamental frequency thereby providing a combination of multiple simultaneous frequencies each varying as function of time throughout the duration of the frequency sweep. For example a square wave at a fundamental frequency is comprised of multiple components harmonically related to said fundamental frequency. As the fundamental frequency of the square wave is varied during a swept frequency measurement the frequencies of each of the harmonics are varied by the same ration. That is when the fundamental frequency is swept across a 10 1 range say from 1 MHz to 10 MHz the frequency of each harmonic component is also swept across the identical 10 1 range so that the original square waveform is maintained.

In one embodiment the voltage and current measurement devices are configured to obtain a broadband measurement such that the voltage and current measured between sensors simultaneously comprises contributions from every frequency component present in the original signal at each of their respective amplitudes. In one embodiment the voltage and current measurement devices comprise frequency selective filters and are thereby configured to measure the bioimpedance at only a subset of any multiple frequencies present in the AC signal generated by the system measurement apparatus and subsequently imposed between the sensors. Such filters may comprise high pass low pass band pass or band reject filters as desired. The use of frequency selective filters in bioimpedance measurements may be preferred with methods for user authentication via biodata measurement are employed as the selection and measurement of a particular user s bioimpedance at a specific frequency particularly one with a unique excessively high or excessively low value such as those occurring at or near either series or parallel resonance may be easily distinguishable for authentication purposes.

With respect to this invention it would be preferred that the bioimpedance measurement apparatus such as the automated station comprise a single AC generator configured to provide a non sinusoidal waveform of the desired shape and amplitude comprising the multiple desired frequency components than for said apparatus to comprise a separate AC generator for each desired frequency component. However both embodiments are envisioned by this disclosure.

In general a total bioimpedance measurement duration time of between 3 seconds and 25 seconds is envisioned with the preferred range lying between 5 and 15 seconds for any of the aforementioned embodiments.

In one embodiment the bioimpedance measurement apparatus may further comprise one or more RLC resistive inductive capacitive network s in series in parallel or series parallel connection with the sensors in communication with the user s body. Such networks may be used to transform the measured bioimpedance value the ratio of voltage to current measured across at least a portion of a bioorganism of the combined network of the user s body and RLC network s to a different range of measured bioimpedance values typically by moving said value away from a point of resonance or toward a value where moderate changes in frequency yield a measurably significant change in measured impedance. If consistently deployed with identical RLC network configurations this technique will still provide the same degree of observable change in the measured bioimpedance values necessary to provide the desired degree of monitoring capability disclosed above.

In one embodiment the RLC networks may comprise components with controllable values of resistance inductance and capacitance variable either physically or electronically and said components may be adjusted to yield a certain measured value of bioresistance bioreactance or both when measured in combination with the user s body. As with the variable frequency embodiment described above in this case the values of the components may be recorded and logged and used as the basis for determining the trend of the user s measured bioimpedance data. Components suitable for this purpose include but are not limited to the electronically variable inductor described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 889 026 to Parsche MEMS electronically variable capacitors such as those offered and sold by Cavendish Kinetics digitally tunable capacitors offered and sold by Peregrine Semiconductor segments of transmission line with open short circuited or restively terminated ends that simulate RLC circuits or any other known or later developed technologies suitable for the intended purpose.

In one embodiment a system comprising two or more biosensors configured to measure users bioimpedance at more than one frequency may also provide secure biometric authentication in lieu of requiring a password PIN or other challenge response method s requiring users to remember the required response. Similar to other authentication methods employing physical biometric data such as fingerprints hand profiles facial recognition or retinal scans the specific resistance and reactance of each user s body measured at multiple frequencies will provide data comprising a physical signature unique to that individual. However unlike the aforementioned physical data which never changes often referred to as hard biometric data which is generally described as something you are measured impedance data obtained from users is generally persistent but somewhat temporal meaning that the data will be expected to change somewhat over time but is sufficiently stable over the short term. Rather than comprising hard data the impedance data is better characterized as firm data. While some users decline to provide hard physical biometric data due to its everlasting persistence and their inability to recapture any lost privacy measured bioimpedance data will become less and less useful over time unless the user continues to update the measured data known to the system by periodically authenticating using the previous measured data and permitting the system to replace the previous data with newer measured data. With respect to this system where users measured data is expected to change at a greater rate than that of the general population due to their exercise regimen sufficient persistence of the previous measured data will permit successful authentication over periods of several weeks but possibly not longer than that. However as the system re measures and stores new bioimpedance each time the user is authenticated replacement of the prior data with new data will provide more a sufficient period for subsequent authentication in the future before the most recent measured data becomes too outdated to identify the user.

In one embodiment bioimpedance data may be augmented by the use of the user s weight as an additional identifying component for purposes of biometric authentication.

User authentication via biometric identification will provide improved security and convenience for users. Most importantly as with hard biometric methods it is impossible for all practical purposes for one user to impersonate another. Unlike with soft authentication methods based on something you know users will not be able be able to share their authentication characteristics with other users as they can with a password or a PIN. In fact users will not even know the raw bioimpedance data measured by the system making it impossible for them to disclose it for the purpose of intentional replication. Rather than being required to remember and input a response to an authentication challenge most commonly Password under this embodiment users will be able to simply position themselves properly with respect to the two or more biosensors and the system will measure their bioimpedance and possibly their weight authenticate the user using said measurement data and then update the bioimpedance data in that user s profile to reflect the newly measured values. While particularly useful for the exercise generation systems and methods disclosed herein this feature is believed to be novel in the art and useful for any number of other authentication purposes as well.

Referring now to an automated station application comprising a workout generation engine displays one or more workout selection items such as for example a one time workout selection item. Once the user selects a workout item the automated station application sends the workout selection and a validation request to the workout generation engine requesting workout validation data for the current gym. Once the server receives the request validation data is generated and returned to the station application . The automated station application uses this data at least in part to generate one or more appropriate workout options . The user then sets one or more of the parameters represented by the workout options to be submitted for the generation of a workout. These parameters can include for example the duration a list of muscles to work out and the workout intensity key. The automated station application then determines that there no erroneous parameters entered and that they are valid for example by using the duration to check the number of muscles that can be used for the duration against the number of muscles in the list and by checking to make sure the value for the Workout Intensity Key is one of the three possible values . In the case of an invalid parameter the user is prompted to make changes . Once all parameters are determined to be valid the automated station application marshals the parameters into a JSON object where the key is the parameter name and the value is the selected value. The automated station application then sends a request to the server to generate a workout passing the JSON object as data . Upon receiving the request the server executes a generate workout routine generating the workout . The generated workout is then returned to the requesting automated station application as an array of JSON objects . Each JSON object in this array corresponds to a record in the Exercise Database with the data from the intensity table for the intensity key chosen appended. Once received the automated station application then displays the workout .

In some embodiments a JSON table indexed by the workout duration for example 30 45 or 60 minutes is returned as a table containing at least two values. These values can include an ExerciseCount such as the maximum number of exercise that can be generated for the selected duration and the MuscleCount such as the maximum number of muscles that can be exercised for the selected duration. The following is an example of a portion of the JSON object content for multiple durations 

In some instances a JSON object is provided including enumerated data types including for example Strength MuscleMass and Endurance . These values can be used to access data from a workout intensity table stored and communicating in for example a JSON object. This object can include for example the number of repetitions per exercise set the number exercise sets per workout the rest periods between sets and the like. The following is an example of a portion of the JSON object content for workout intensity JSON object 

In some instances a JSON object is provided including for example data for use by the workout generator for the creation of one or more workouts. The following is an example of a portion of the JSON object content for a workout JSON object 

Referring now to a workout generation algorithm generates a workout based on parameters from the user. Once the workout generation engine comprising the workout generation algorithm receives the workout parameters it will generate an equipment list via said algorithm. In some instances the generation of this list involves identification of equipment associated with a particular location using at least one of the one or more databases comprising information on available exercise resources and their location. The location of the user either at an automated station or using a mobile device is obtained by the workout generation engine and used to query said one or more databases for exercise resources within a defined radius from the query location. Exercises associated with the exercise resources retrieved from the equipment list are also obtained from the one or more database s and an exercise list is created . Based on the desired duration of the exercise workout and other parameters supplied by the user an appropriate number of exercise slots are created to be filled with specific exercises according to one of several embodiments including those described below.

In one embodiment two compound exercises are randomly selected added to the workout for each muscle identified in the workout data . Compound exercises are those which simultaneously utilize more than one major muscle group and therefore burn more calories than do isolation exercises which utilize only a single muscle group. Once successfully added to the workout the exercise is removed from the exercise list . If a muscle does not have two compound exercises assigned the workout generation engine comprising the workout generation algorithm randomly selects either one or two isolation exercise s for the missing compound exercise s for that muscle and assign the exercises to the workout . Once successfully added to the workout the exercise is removed from the exercise list . If there are still exercise slots open for each open slot the workout generation engine comprising the workout generation algorithm randomly selects a muscle and then randomly selects an isolation exercise for that muscle from the list of available exercises . The exercise is assigned to the workout and once successfully added the exercise is removed from the exercise list .

In one embodiment two exercises are selected for each muscle based on information obtained from the user s profile such information including but not limited to the user s age weight height measured bioimpedance data somatotype self assessment of physical condition history of physical activity most or least preferred exercises or exercise resources and the like. When such information may be used to distinguish one of the exercises from list of available exercises from another the preferred exercise will be selected added to the workout and removed from the exercise list . As above muscles without two compound exercises assigned are assigned either one or two isolation exercise for the missing compound exercise s based on information from the user s profile and those exercises are also assigned to the workout.

In some instances one or more exercises may be deemed suitable for more than one muscle. An important feature of the system and methods described herein is that the same exercise will not inadvertently prescribed more than once in a given workout for the purpose of exercising more than one muscle. By removing the exercise from the exercise list once it has been selected for a particular workout it will not be selected again for that same workout.

Another highly desirable feature in exercise workout generation is that individual muscles are exercised in an order that provides complementary exercise and rest periods. An important component of proper exercise procedure is that sufficient time is afforded for muscles to sufficiently recover between periods of intense workout. For this reason the workout generation engine arranges the order of exercises within each exercise workout to afford sufficient time for recovery of each significant muscle before that particular muscle is targeted for a subsequent exercise. Not doing so risks excessive fatigue and even injury to the user. However an additional component of a maximally beneficial exercise workout that the user s heart rate and respiration be maintained at a properly elevated rate so excessive rest between individual exercise components may reduce the effectiveness of the workout. The workout generation engine is configured to provide the optimal balance of sustained activity while simultaneously providing proper recovery time between exercise activity focused on a particular muscle.

An additional consideration is that most users have limited time in which to complete their workouts so each workout should be composed in a manner that simultaneously provides the proper amount of targeted physical activity within the allotted time allows appropriate rest for individual muscles between focused activity and permits constant physical activity to maintain heart rate and respiration at the desired level. The exercise workout generation methods of this system are configured to provide exercise workouts consistent with all of these criteria.

Once all exercise slots are filled in the previous embodiments the workout generation engine comprising the workout generation algorithm then calculates and appends the number of sets repetitions and rest between sets to each of the exercises in the workout based upon the intensity table and the intensity key selected by the user. In another embodiment data from the user s profile relating to present physical condition prior physical activity injury and the like may be used in combination with the user s selected intensity in determining the number of sets repetitions and rest between sets. For example a user may select a more rigorous workout intensity than would be most beneficial given certain information in his user profile. In that instance the system may provide an exercise workout that is at or near the higher limit of the appropriate range determined by the profile information but not beyond that. Similarly a user may select a lower intensity than usual so the system will consider his previous workouts and provide a workout on that day that is closer to the lower end of an acceptable intensity. An important advantage of the invention described herein lies in its ability to provide appropriate guidance based on best practices in exercise generation similar to that available from a human personal trainer. As taught in the present art system that permit users to prescribe their own workouts introduce the probability of both exercise imbalance and injury to users not sufficiently knowledgeable in the science of physiology and fitness. Providing less than sufficient exercise in every workout would be a disservice to users. However preventing a user from overexertion and injury is arguably the most important aspect of professional exercise workout generation and the methods disclosed herein are specifically directed toward providing that same level of professional guidance in determining an appropriate level of intensity based on all available factors. A self prescribed workout based on the work till it hurts is a recipe for disaster.

Referring now to in some embodiments a goal based workout generation process implemented by the workout generation engine comprising the workout generation algorithm generates a workout based on goals set by the user. Initial intensity determining questions are displayed on the station application . Once responses to the intensity questions are received one or more goal determining questions are displayed . Responses are received by the station application and one or more intensity values goal values or both are determined . In some instances these questions are presented in a different order or simultaneously. The current user routine is then set to past user workout routine and a new goal based workout is generated . This workout once generated is saved as the current user workout routine .

This goal based workout generation process can in some implementations initiate at the creation of a profile or editing of user goals. In some instances the automated station application displays a set of questions designed to determine the correct intensity for a user. These questions can be from a fixed set of questions stored in the client app retrieved from a server or both and result in determination of an intensity key the duration for each workout and how many days in a 7 day work week will be regarded as workout days. The automated station application may then guide the user though a set of question to determine the user s goals.

In some embodiments the goal questions are arranged in a tree like data structure in which the leaf nodes contain the list of muscles to work out and two flags indicating if cardio exercises are to be added and if cardio exercises are added every workout or consolidated into one day. This tree is traversed using a depth first search that terminates on at the first leaf node encountered. The answers to the questions can dictate which child branch is executed. The goal and intensity data are saved in the user s profile resulting in the current routine being saved as a past routine and replaced with a new routine. The goal based workout generation process is then executed for the new routine using at least the goal and intensity data as inputs.

Referring now to and the workout generation engine comprising the workout generation algorithm generates a workout based on a set of goals. The workout generation engine comprising the workout generation algorithm first determines the number of workout days then creates an indexed workout parameter buffer to hold the workout data . The size of the buffer will correspond to the number of days to workout. Each index corresponds to one workout day. The data in each index of this buffer can include the resistance duration cardio duration and a list of muscles to workout . The list of target muscles can be determined at least in part from the user goal data . The target muscles from the goal data are split out over the set of days based at least in part on the resistance duration and the muscles per duration parameter of the workout validation data . As an example if the resistance duration is 30 minutes and the validation data says that the total number of muscles for a 30 minute workout is three then three muscles are added to each day.

The workout generation engine comprising the workout generation algorithm creates a target muscle queue then populates the queue by copying the target muscle items in the target muscle list to the queue. A determination is made as to whether each index in the buffer has the correct number of muscle assignments per index . If the determination returns false the muscle queue is checked to ensure it has contains at least one muscle item and the muscle item at the head of the queue is dequeued and appended to the list of muscles for the index . In the event the queue is empty it is repopulated prior to initiating a dequeue event.

Once all index positions are properly assigned target muscles each index is looped through in order to correctly populate the indexes with exercises. A workout is generated in accordance with the method of . For each index a determination is made whether a cardio duration is set . If so the workout generation engine comprising the workout generation algorithm will select a random cardio exercise . The random selection process can involve the creation of a cardio exercise array populated with the cardio exercises and a counter corresponding to the number array positions through which the number of positions is calculated at least in part by assessing the cardio duration and the cardio exercises per duration parameter . So long as the counter is not empty the random cardio exercise is selected and the cardio exercise value for the index is appended with the selected cardio exercise . Once the appending is successful the cardio exercise is removed from the array and the counter is decremented by one . In some embodiments duplicate cardio exercises are not appended to a single day index position. After exercise assignments are complete for all days the workout routine is saved and associated with the user profile .

Referring now to an introductory view is displayed on the station display where a user can create an account by selecting the create account button login to an existing account by selecting the user login button or generate a one time workout without creating or accessing a user account or user profile by selecting the workout generator button .

Referring now to selecting the workout generator button displays the one time workout view . This view can include a back button in the upper left corner that will direct the application to display the introductory view. There is also a strength button for generating a resistance workout and a cardio button for generating cardio workout.

Referring now to a workout parameters view receives different settings for use in workout generation algorithms. This can include setting the total duration of the workout setting the intensity of the workout and setting the muscle groups for the workout. In some embodiment an anatomical graphic is displayed animating the different muscles and highlighting muscles to be exercised in this workout.

Referring now to a user profile view displays the values and controls associated with the user profile. In some embodiments the hexagon buttons to the left will animate in a circle as the user scrolls though the different options. Selecting a hexagon button populates the data display area on the right with stored data associated with the button selection event.

Any number of other methods of exercise workout generation may be implemented using the resources provided and data collected and accumulated by the automated system. Whenever used herein with respect to the invention being disclosed use of the term system is intended to apply to any or all of the various hardware software firmware database communication networking and other resources elements and devices described in this invention disclosure without limitation. Certain elements of the system may be integral to any one of the various aspects of the embodiments others may be tangentially or optionally to such aspects and certain elements may not be relevant to more than one of said aspects. The fact that a particular element resource or device may not be explicitly disclosed with respect to a particular embodiment is not intended to imply that it may not be applicable thereto as it may well be.

Preferably the system will be configured with more than one exercise workout generation method available to the workout generation engine. It should be appreciated that the system as a whole comprises many resources elements and devices that may be utilized in a particular embodiment in any combination without disparaging the usefulness of those or any other elements in another embodiment. Explicit disclosure of all possible embodiments of various combinations envisioned by this disclosure would be excessively burdensome due to the sheer number of possibilities. Having read and understood Applicant s disclosure a person of ordinary skill in the art would immediately appreciate any number of embodiments envisioned but not specifically disclosed herein given the nature of the system and the obvious interdependence of the many resources. Any method comprising any or all of the system resources disclosed herein represents an embodiment contemplated by this disclosure but exemplary methods are described in detail for purposes of illustration and not limitation.

Selection of one particular method embodiment of exercise workout generation over other method embodiments for which the system may be configured may be made based on any number of criteria. By way of example and not limitation the combination of a user s input data and measured biodata may be particularly well suited for one embodiment and not another based on success indicated by aggregated anonymous data of similar users collected by the system over time. Consideration of user s history of injury enabled in a particular embodiment would not be applicable to a user with no history of injury enabling the use of an embodiment not comprising such consideration. A final non limiting example of how one method embodiment may be selected over another involves the user s willingness to provide input to the system containing his preferences and goals. While the best results of the system will be obtained for users agreeing to provide all requested information to the system some users may decline to do so. A new or one time user may prefer to obtain a simple workout not based on any prior history user preferences or goals. In that circumstance a simple method embodiment may be used that bypasses all consideration of such factors that would play an important role in other embodiments. While selection of one specific method embodiment over others is preferably made by the system the method embodiment may be selected in concert with the user by providing several choices from which the user may select. Alternatively the method embodiment may be selected directly by the user overriding the determination of the system.

In addition to the methods disclosed elsewhere herein and with reference to one exemplary embodiment of an exercise workout generation method a new user may enroll in the system by providing the initial information disclosed above including a username system password e mail address name age height measurement waist measurement chest measurement sex somatotype ectomorph mesomorph or endomorph any history of illness or injury that may affect their ability to perform certain exercises a self assessment of their present general physical condition and the approximate number of times they exercise or perform strenuous physical activity per month. If the system hardware available to the user is configured to provide location information said location is retrieved by the system and associated with the initial information provided by the user. For example a fixed location hardware station device may have its geographic coordinates or other location data stored in local memory a hardware device may be able to retrieve its location via one or more networked services or a hardware device may be able to determine its location via GPS or any other location service application active or available in said device. If a hardware device is not configured to provide or obtain location data or if said data is not available to the device for any reason the user may be prompted to provide his location via direct entry or menu selection. Such location data may comprise a street address a telephone area code and three digit local exchange a ZIP code or any other location information suitable for the system to locate exercise resources proximate to the user. All data provided by the user and that obtained by the hardware device and system is stored by the system in the user s profile for future use in a manner identical to that of previously disclosed embodiments.

Also in the manner described above the user may optionally be prompted to provide one or more user preferences including but not limited to the type s of exercise s or exercise resources machines or devices the user may enjoy more or less than others. When the user indicates a preference for one exercise resource machine over another the system may be configured to prompt the user to indicate whether the preference is based on direct experience with that machine or is based on some other criteria. If a user has routinely used a similar or identical machine permitting the user to select the familiar equipment when prompted will improve his exercise experience. It may also permit the system to prescribe a longer or more intensive workout due to the user s familiarity with the resource where no learning is required. If the user indicates a preference for a machine which he has never used before for the purpose of determining a preference to be selected for future workouts the system may be configured to allow additional time for the user to become familiar with the equipment for the first time.

Additionally the user may optionally be asked to provide one or more goals to which the exercise workout routines may be preferably directed including but not limited to losing weight gaining muscle reducing body fat improving overall fitness rehabilitation from injury or illness or the like. Preference and goal data obtained from the user is stored in the user s profile for later use in generating an optimal exercise workout routine optimized for that particular user.

The system obtains biodata from the user including the weight of the user via the weighing scale and one or more bioimpedance measurements via the two or more sensors or any sensor devices providing equivalent functionality and stores said data in the user s profile for the dual purpose of determining an historical record of said biodata and using both the current data and historical trends in the method of generating an exercise workout routine.

Also in the manner described elsewhere herein the system uses the location data provided or obtained as above to determine which specific exercise resources are available at all of the known facilities within a certain radius proximate to the user and to create a list of said facilities and resources. Further as above a list of exercises associated with and particularly well suited for said exercise resources is obtained. The lists of resources and exercises are temporarily stored by the system for use in the exercise workout generation process to follow.

In this exemplary embodiment exercises are not randomly selected as in other embodiments but are selected based on an assessment of the myriad of each user s input data and biodata in conjunction with the available exercise resources and associated exercises obtained by the system. By analyzing said data and providing certain criteria to link the applicability of certain data to other data the system can provide maximally beneficial exercise workout recommendations to a user. Understanding how each of the various data may be used will enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to appreciate how the system may be configured to generate said exercise workouts. Each of the data employed in any given embodiment may be used to include or exclude certain activities require or limit physical activity of a certain level enable or disable consideration of other elements and the like.

The order of consideration of each of the various data values is presented in accordance with the exemplary embodiment being described. However in other embodiments consideration of the data in a different order may be preferred. In general the order in which data is acquired is not relevant to the process of exercise workout generation as all data will generally be acquired in advance of such generation. One exception would be when the workout generation engine prompts a user to select one or more exercise options available to a user when a substitution is required following initiation of the workout generation process. This optional selection is described in greater detail below. Similar to the use of system elements in any of a myriad of potential combinations some or all of the data may be used in different embodiments.

The user s age is preferably a primary consideration for any exercise workout generated by the system. Above all else the system must be configured to provide safe exercise workout recommendations for the user without risking the user s health or presenting an appreciable risk of injury. Users will preferably be required to acknowledge that any physical activity includes some degree of personal risk due such as accidental injury or unintended consequences beyond the control of any third party but the system disclosed herein will be configured to reduce said risk as much as practicable. Younger adult users are generally less prone to injury or strain from exercise than are older users so the system preferably establishes demarcations in age as one of its initial determinations. For example one such demarcation may occur at age 30 another at age 50 and another at age 70. Demarcations at other ages may be implemented in lieu of or in addition to those listed. Certain exercises particularly suitable for users under 30 may be acceptable for users between 30 and 70 but may pose an unacceptable risk for users over 70. When such youth directed exercises are available based on the exercise resources proximate to a user the system s workout generation engine may preferably select them for younger users select them for middle age users only when preferred alternatives are not available and bar them from being selected for older users. In addition to selecting exercises based in part on the user s age prescription of other factors such as exercise intensity and duration are also selected by the workout generation engine consistent with the user s age and other factors discussed below.

Another consideration pertinent to a user s age is the selection of particular exercise resources. Certain exercise resources machines may require a greater degree of balance core stability or coordination than others. Exercises on those machines may not be well suited for older users unless such users have prior experience those machines this is a particular illustration of how a user s preferences may modify the exercise workout to their advantage. While the system may not normally select one or more exercises on a certain machine for a particular user if the user has indicated a preference for that machine based on prior experience the system may be configured to consider the user s preference over its otherwise unguided selection and select exercises to be performed on that machine.

For certain users their age and biodata may be used in combination by the system to select exercise resource machines that either use or do not use the user s weight as a component of the exercise. For example a particularly heavy user at a relatively advanced age may not be well suited to perform exercises that require him to lift all or even a portion of his body weight. Instead a machine that affords the opportunity to provide a less strenuous exercise with a lower resistive force would be better suited until the user s biodata indicates that his weight and physical condition is consistent with exercises relying on all or part of his body weight. While evaluation of body weight resistance exercises in view of weight and physical condition may be utilized for users of any age it is particularly important for older users more susceptible to injury especially at the beginning of their exercise regimen.

Other factors for which age plays an important role include the maximum heart rate of the user the duration of the exercise workout the number of repetitions performed in each set the rate at which those repetitions are performed the amount of rest permitted between sets of repetitions and the total number of sets comprising each exercise workout. Biosensors or other means may be utilized between sets between groupings of different exercises during periods of rest or as a specifically prescribed non exercise measurement activity within an exercise workout to measure the heart rate of a user for the purpose of adjusting the present exercise workout or for use in generating future exercise workouts. By obtaining and storing this data in the user s profile an historical record is established to permit the system to provide the optimal safe workout for the user.

Particularly in the early stages of an exercise workout regimen it is important to establish a proper balance between the intensity and duration of exercise needed to progress toward the user s goals at an appropriately safe level. An exercise workout that is insufficient for a particular user may be merely ineffective but an excessive workout may be harmful to the user and introduce an unnecessary and undesirable risk of physical injury. For this reason it is highly preferable that a user s self assessment of their physical condition recent history of exercise workouts or comparable physical activity and potentially relevant injury history be known to and considered by the system. Users with no recent exercise experience or significant physical activity will preferably be matched to less strenuous exercises initially with the intensity increasing as does their experience. Certain machines and associated exercises may be less suitable for new users than others so use of those machines may be deferred until later whenever practicable. Factors such as the number of repetitions per set the number of sets the amount of rest between sets and the amount of weight or other restive force applied against the user s efforts to name several but not all criteria will be considered in view of the user s experience by the workout generation engine during exercise workout generation. As disclosed above none of the criteria are considered independently of the others all criteria used to generate an exercise workout are evaluated in concert with each other.

Users who have experienced a prior injury that may limit their ability to perform certain exercises and who have preferably disclosed such injury to the system may receive additional options in the exercise workouts generated by the system. Not only will such injuries be considered when specific exercise are selected for the user but the system may be configured to provide one or more alternative exercises in lieu of the system s preferred selection. In this manner the user may elect an alternative option that may be less effective than the recommended exercise but more comfortable to perform. Users may be presented with the opportunity to select one or more substitute exercise during the workout generation process. A reduction in intensity may be achieved in some cases by prescribing reduced weight. In some cases additional repetitions may be recommended to compensate for any diminution in intensity from the system s preferred exercise. The user may be instructed to perform the required repetitions at a slower pace or to stop performing the exercise in the event of pain or discomfort beyond that attributable to normal muscle fatigue. In some cases certain exercises may be barred for users with certain injuries deemed likely to risk re injury from said exercise s . Any means available to the system may be employed to accommodate a user with an increased risk of harm due to prior injury.

Some injuries may be classified as structural particularly those involving bones joints or ligaments. Effective treatment of these injuries is generally beyond the scope of the present invention and the principal focus of the workout generation engine with regard to these injuries is to avoid any substantial risk of further harm to the user. However in some instances users reporting certain injuries properly classified as muscular discomfort may benefit from exercises directed to strengthen certain parts of their body or to alleviate pain via other means. In this manner the workout generation engine may select certain exercises deemed both safe and effective for such users including exercises for muscle development stretching and the like. Typical muscular related problems include but are not limited to neck pain lower back pain certain types of repetitive stress injury and the like. In some embodiments the workout generation engine is configured to recognize these problems and offer the user as an additional user goal or preference the opportunity to include exercises considered to be therapeutic for such problems within an exercise workout. Such exercises are preferably optional prescribed only with the prior approval of the user and initially performed with low intensity until the user provides a positive indication to the system that the therapeutic exercises are achieving the desired effect. Until such time as the muscular discomfort is resolved the workout generation would not prescribe any exercise likely to exacerbate the user s discomfort or any exercise during which the user s form may be affected by the discomfort. For example a user with non structural lower back pain may not be subjected to exercises where proper form requires a certain posture difficult for the user to achieve and where improper form would therefore be likely.

Proper form is critical to the performance of any effective exercise activity and not just those associated with previously injured users. Improper position or movement during an exercise may fail to provide the intended benefit while risking injury to the user. The objective is not to perform the prescribed activity by any means but by the proper means execute the proper motion while remaining in the correct position so as to exercise the intended muscles with the intended intensity. In this regard the user s experience level will guide the system in selecting the optimal exercises for users without much experience said exercises comprising a lower level of difficulty than those suitable for more experienced users. Users already accustomed to machines or activities requiring greater skill balance or coordination may be prescribed exercises deemed too complex for users at a lower experience level. As the inexperienced users acquire greater skills and familiarity the system will recognize this fact and begin to migrate them to exercises both suitable for their goals and more complex in their execution. Further proper form is encouraged by maintaining an appropriate weight or other resistive force presented to the user. Requiring excessive force from a user during an exercise often encourages bad form as the user struggles to provide that force. As users gain both experience and strength as a result of their continued exercise the weight or resistive force presented to the user may increase while allowing them to exhibit proper form. At the same time the overall intensity of the workout will generally increase to maintain the appropriate level of exercise and development sought by each user.

A user s experience may also be indicative of his level of fitness. Users who routinely participate in exercise or activities that provide the same level of exertion are much more likely to be physically fit than users who do not. Users who provide an acceptable self assessment of their present general physical condition and a recent history of exercise or physical activity may be identified as candidates for more advanced or rigorous exercise workouts than those who do not. A user who has not exercised recently may be considered to be inactive two to three exercise sessions is generally considered to be moderately active and more than three exercise sessions per week indicates that the user is active and likely in good physical condition. This data is preferably considered by the workout generation engine in selecting exercises along with their duration and intensity. As disclosed elsewhere herein it is a significant advantage of the present system that it is configured to generate exercise workouts for users that are neither too rigorous nor insufficiently rigorous properly matching the generated exercise workout to the user s capability and goals without a disproportionate risk of injury.

Numerous considerations affect the selection of the duration and intensity of prescribed exercises. Repetitive exercises comprise a number of repetitions that are preferably selected based on such factors as a user s goals somatotype experience and safety as discussed previously. A high number of repetitions are beneficial for weight loss and body fat reduction particularly for beginning users where proper form and injury prevention are paramount. Usually high repetitions are prescribed with lower weights or comparable resistive force. This combination may also be particularly well suited for a user seeking muscle development and endurance. It also produces a sustained cardio workout with an elevated heart rate deemed most effective for burning body fat. In contrast very experienced users with relatively low body fat content striving for significant muscle development will receive exercise workouts with fewer repetitions sometimes fewer than 10 per set against a very high resistance. Here a lower heart rate will generally be maintained but muscle tissue development will be accelerated. As a general rule developing greater muscle endurance requires an increased number of repetitions with less weight while developing greater muscle strength requires the use of more weight with significantly fewer repetitions.

With respect to rest users seeking weight loss will generally receive less rest between exercise sets so as to keep their heart rate and glycogen level within the optimal range for burning calories. Users performing high intensity exercises with limited repetitions will generally receive greater periods of rest between sets to allow muscle recovery maintaining an elevated heart rate is not conducive to achieving their goals of muscle development. As explained elsewhere users of an advanced age may receive additional rest for safety reasons. As previously disclosed the exercise workout generation engine is configured to consider all relevant factors presented by the user and measured by the automated station when determining and prescribing a series of individual activities that comprise exercise workouts.

Measured biodata obtained from the user via one or more system hardware devices is essential to several aspects of the system including the method embodiment now being described. The weight of a user is a fundamental physical characteristic useful alone or in combination with other data. Obtaining and storing a user s weight over a period of time is obviously useful by itself in tracking the weight loss of a user seeking that goal. In combination with the user s height preferably supplied by the user or in certain embodiments measured by system hardware the user s weight permits calculation of his body mass index BMI . This figure permits assessment of the user s overall body profile and permits accurate tracking of a user s overall progress in an exercise regimen. Users with high BMIs are very likely to have a high percentage of body fat and will require a certain degree of weight loss before exercises directed to other goals such as development of particular muscle s will be effective. However certain other users may have a high BMI as a result of significant muscle development where muscles instead of fat comprise a larger than average portion of their body weight. The system includes other means to distinguish between the two types of high BMI users. For example a high BMI user that reports extensive exercise experience is likely to have more muscle than fat while the inexperienced user is much more likely to have more fat than muscle. Additionally the biosensors discussed elsewhere in this disclosure are operative to measure the conductive characteristics of the users body wherein fat and muscle tissue present very different results permitting the system to distinguish between muscular users and fat users. When recommending exercises as a component of a larger workout the difference between the two types of users is essential to provide a sufficient and safe exercise workout for both.

A user s weight is also an important consideration in the selection of exercises to include in an exercise workout. Certain exercises will not be appropriate for heavy users with high BMIs particularly those where their weight provides a resistive force acting against their efforts. In particular high BMI users may be unable to perform any chin ups or pull ups until their weight decreases to a reasonable level. In this extreme case an exercise machine that permits the user to develop the same muscles with a lower resistive force may be selected by the system in conjunction with aerobic exercises directed to weight loss until the user is capable of beginning pull ups with an increasing number of repetitions. In the other extreme case a very thin user with a very low BMI may also lack sufficient muscle mass to complete any pull ups at all and would benefit from the same machine. Another thin user with low BMI and sufficient arm strength to perform many pull ups of his own lower weight may require many additional repetitions beyond those required for a user with an average BMI and body weight to achieve a workout of the same intensity. Prescribing exercises of the proper intensity for all users is an important characteristic of the system and knowing the users weight and therefore his BMI is essential to this exemplary method embodiment and many other embodiments as well.

As disclosed elsewhere herein the system may preferably comprise specialized analog electrical hardware machines for the purpose of measuring other characteristics of the users bodies. In particular these machines measure the bioimpedance of the user s body by passing a small alternating current at a known voltage to determine the impedance thereof said impedance comprising both a resistive component and a reactive component as described elsewhere herein. While these machines comprising one or more biosensors may be used to obtain any useful data pertaining to a user s body including but not limited to an estimate of the user s body fat as defined by the trend of measured bioimpedance data over time. As described above muscle tissue and body fat exhibit greatly different electrical properties that are easily discerned by the biosensors or any sensor devices providing equivalent functionality enabling the system to evaluate each user prior to prescribing specific exercises best suited to their individual needs and goals. In order to achieve the best results possible different exercises are required for users with different bioimpedances and therefore different proportions of body fat and the system therefore requires machines and components to determine this important characteristic. Also as with weight obtaining and storing a user s bioimpedance over time permits the system to track said user s progress and determine how effective the system generated exercise workouts are in achieving the user s goals and to determine when those goals have been met.

Separating a user s exercise into the general classifications of cardiovascular exercise generally fat burning exercises requiring an elevated heart rate and hypertrophic exercise generally muscle development may be based to a significant degree on a user s bioimpedance measurement. As described elsewhere any required fat loss will generally precede any significant muscle building. As the loss of fat by a user may occur simultaneously with the development of muscle measuring and recording only the user s weight will generally provide insufficient information for the system to include the proper balance of cardiovascular and hypertrophic exercise. However considering the user s measured weight in concert with the user s measured bioimpedance provides the complete picture of said user s progress with respect to both fat loss and muscle development. A first user presenting a consistently low body fat percentage with increasing weight is clearly adding muscle such results being consistent for some users undergoing a proper exercise regimen. However a second user exhibiting a similar gain in weight with an increasing body fat percentage is gaining fat not muscle and a change in the exercises being prescribed by the system is clearly warranted. Without the machines and devices configured to measure body fat an automated system would be unable to detect the difference between the first and second users and would fail to provide the optimal exercise workout for either or both users. Therefore the machines and methods of deploying those machines for the measurement of users body fat and other bioimpedance data are essential elements of the invention described herein.

Certain data provided by the user may be employed in combination with the weight and bioimpedance measurements obtained by system hardware machines and devices to determine other useful characterizations of the user s physiology. As discussed above the user s height is a necessary parameter for the calculation of BMI. Preferably users will be prompted to enter their height as a component of the input data provided to the system. However one or more system components may be configured to comprise additional hardware machines or devices to determine users height. For example automated system may further comprise a rigid or flexible extendable and retractable measurement element such as a bar or a tape measure not shown disposed within support arm or that the user may extend to the top of his head. The system may then determine the degree of extension of the measurement element and record the user s height as a component of the user s profile whereupon the measurement element is then retracted to its original position within support arm or . Other mechanical or electromechanical means configured to obtain the user s height are also envisioned by this disclosure.

Height and weight data permits useful determination of certain physiological characteristics but additional useful correlation to tendencies involving exercise and weight loss may be determined via the user s structure and build usually referred to as one of three common somatotypes. depicts the three basic somatotype body structure taxonomies of ectomorph mesomorph and endomorph . A methodology is known in the art by which specific user measurements may be employed to calculate with precision the proper classification for any user. However even an approximate self assessment of a user s somatotype is very useful in the generation of exercise workouts by providing general insight into the physiological response to exercise diet and the like. While the characterizations that follow are very general in nature and are certainly not representative of every individual who may conform to the general profiles presented in they provide a good starting point for a user s exercise workout program at least until some degree of weight loss and muscle gain history has been established in response to the previous exercise workouts generated for provided to and performed by the user. Where examples of typical exercises are provided below it should be recognized that they are exemplary and not limiting in any way.

Ectomorphs are naturally lean with slighter bone structures longer limbs and are the slowest of the three somatotypes to gain weight either in the form of fat or muscle. Muscular strength may be low due to the presence of decreased muscle tissue. Aerobic cardiovascular exercise may be useful for ectomorphs to improve general fitness including heart and lung functioning but they may be less important than for other somatotype where weight loss in the form of fat may be desired. Ectomorphs generally benefit most from a focus on shorter workouts of mostly hypertrophic exercises increasing to a fairly high intensity to build tissue in the larger muscle groups. Muscle tissue development may well result in an increase in the user s weight but such increase can be differentiated from weight gain in the form of body fat via system determinations of bioimpedance as discussed elsewhere herein.

Mesomorphs exhibit larger frames and are generally much more sensitive to factors that cause weight gain and weight loss. They generally possess greater dense muscle mass thereby limiting their ability to lose weight below a certain point due to said muscle mass. Cardiovascular exercises with elevated heart rates may be more beneficial for most mesomorphs to control body fat than for ectomorphs. Mesomorphs also respond well to weight training for muscle development. When specified as a user goal exercises directed toward muscle gain must be properly balanced with cardiovascular activities to achieve the best overall results within the time available for exercise workouts.

With a larger build and proportionately shorter limbs than the other somatotypes endomorphs tend to retain fat more than the other types and generally require significant cardiovascular exercise to reduce weight and maintain good muscle tone. Exercises that lead to increased metabolism are particularly beneficial for endomorphs. In addition higher intensity hypertrophic exercises are beneficial for strength development as endomorphs typically gain muscle more easily than the other somatotypes. An exercise workout comprising both hypertrophic exercises such as weight training and cardiovascular exercises is necessary.

From the general overviews above it can be appreciated that the distribution of exercises between hypertrophic and cardiovascular to be provided in the most effective exercise workouts should be determined in part by each user s somatotype. While other factors must certainly be considered as well incorporating the user s self assessment of somatotype as one means of determining the nature and focus of specific exercises incorporated into exercise workouts will provide a measure of general guidance. The workout generation engine will consider a user s somatotype in combination with all of the other factors in selecting exercises their intensity and their duration to be incorporated in generated exercise workouts.

User selection of a somatotype from three available choices is both simple and accurate to a degree but further refinement of the user s physical structure will provide additional information useful in some embodiments to perfect exercise workouts for the user. In particular bioimpedance measurement may be highly sensitive to certain dimensional characteristics of the human body. Most prior art bioimpedance measurements presume for ease of calculation that the body is essentially cylindrical with a uniform cross sectional area of equal resistivity. This simplistic representation is useful in many applications but not as accurate as it may otherwise be. When combined with and correlated to measurements of a user s chest waist and hips for example a more accurate estimate of the user s actual bioimpedance may be obtained.

The tissue composition of a user s arms and legs collectively and commonly referred to as limbs are the principal factor in measured whole body bioimpedance determination but represent only a small volume of the user s body. For example literature reports that the human trunk contributes about 9 of the total resistance of a typical bioimpedance measurement while it comprises more than 50 of the user s fat free mass and body weight. In contrast the forearms contribute about 28 to whole body resistance measurements but only contribute up to 2 of the fat free mass and up to 3 of the body weight. Since the trunk comprises the largest store of body fat and comprises most of the major muscle groups effective use of bioimpedance data in exercise workout generation sometimes requires scaling of said data using one or more physical characteristics including the user s height and preferably his girth measured at one or more cross sectional points along the trunk such as the chest waist and hips for best applicability to the characteristics of the user s trunk where most fat is stored. In this manner obtaining an index of body geometry permits appropriate correction of the raw whole body bioimpedance measurement to reveal factors otherwise masked by disproportionate contributions such as those of the user s limbs. For example whole body bioimpedance measurement data may be scaled by the square of the body height the effective cross sectional ratio of the circumferential trunk measurements or any combination thereof necessary to accurately correlate said measure data with the actual physiological characteristics of the user s body. Further said scaled data may be correlated to other available data including but not limited to the user s weight. In addition to scaling for whole body measurements measurement of only certain section of the user s body is possible via appropriate placement of the biosensors.

In certain embodiments including the ones now being presented certain preferences of users may be considered by the workout generation engine in a manner similar but not identical to the way a user s injury history may be considered. Preferably other system input parameters form the primary basis for selection of specific exercises their intensity duration and order of performance. These parameters are considered and applied as described elsewhere herein so as to provide the optimal exercise workout for the user. However in embodiments where the user has expressed either a positive preference for one or more specific equipment resources exercises or the manner in which those exercises are performed or a negative preference for any of the same the workout generation engine may alter the intended exercise workout in accordance with the user s preferences. For example if a user has a preference for one particular exercise resource machine over another or any reason the system will accommodate the user s request by prescribing that any compatible exercise be performed on the preferred and available machine. Likewise if a user specifically expresses disinterest in a particular machine the workout generation engine will strive to prescribe a different machine when available for any compatible exercise. A user s like or dislike for a specific machine may be based on any criteria including but not limited to factors such as prior experience with said machine the machine s location within the exercise facility the degree to which the machine provides an agreeable fit and feel for the user and the like. Certain users may prefer to use free weights for upper body strength exercises while others may prefer to use machines that provide comparable resistive force in lieu of free weights. Some users may prefer to use an appropriate machine in lieu of doing pull ups on a bar because the bar is uncomfortable to their hands. To the extent that the workout generation engine determines that the same results may be achieved with either exercise apparatus the system may be configured to prescribe exercises consistent with the user s preference.

Other preferences expressed by a user may include the order in which prescribed exercises are performed. For example one user may prefer that a certain exercise be performed earlier in the workout than has been provided in previous workouts. The workout generation engine selects and orders exercises particularly compound exercises in a manner to provide balance and sufficient periods of rest for certain muscles while others are being exercised among other considerations. In this regard the order in which exercises are performed is carefully selected for maximum benefit to the user in a manner consistent with best fitness practices. However when a user provides input indicating a preference for a certain order or arrangement of exercises the workout generation engine may be configured to accommodate said preference whenever re arrangement is consistent with said best practices.

Any other manner of user preferences may be similarly accommodated such as a user s desire for a longer workout in lieu of a shorter but more intense workout or vice versa if the workout generation engine determines that said preferences are an acceptable alternative.

When a conflict arises between proper exercise recommendations as determined by the workout generation engine and user preferences the proper exercise recommendations will generally prevail. In this regard user preferences may be regarded as a tweak or minor adjustment to an exercise workout determined and provided by the workout generation engine and not as a factor capable of countermanding such determination. In most instances as long as the preferred adjustment provides essentially equivalent value to the user the preference may be accommodated by the workout generation engine. This is an important distinction between the manner in which user preferences and injury histories are accommodated. When a user provides input that indicates a potential for injury no exercise activity that presents any substantial risk of said injury will be prescribed by the workout generation engine. In other words a potential injury risk is sufficient to preclude any specific exercise or performance of a specific exercise for a prescribed duration or above a certain level of intensity. The workout generation engine is preferably configured in these circumstances to provide alternate exercise options whenever available but is always configured to ensure the safety of the user in every exercise workout provided to said user. On the other hand a user preference is generally insufficient to preclude an exercise from being selected by the workout generation engine. As described elsewhere herein the system is configured to provide a workout with an appropriate selection of exercises and intensity. Permitting a user to diminish the value of workout via preference selection would defeat the value of said workout. However when essentially equivalent results may be obtained consistent with preferences expressed by a user the workout generation engine is preferably configured to provide an exercise workout according to said preferences. As disclosed elsewhere permitting users to specify user preferences provides a useful secondary purpose that provides additional commercial opportunities.

In some embodiments the system is configured to receive post workout evaluations from users. These evaluations may be principally directed to the level of difficulty experienced by the users but additional input may be obtained from the user as well. For example providing an opportunity for users to indicate that the just completed workout was too rigorous or not rigorous enough will enable the workout generation engine to adjust the subsequent workout accordingly. Although the system is configured to select exercises and prescribe an appropriate duration and intensity according to the same best practices observed by human trainers the system is limited in its ability to obtain feedback from users comparable to that which a trainer would receive or observe since the system does not exchange data in real time or at any time with non system exercise resources such as exercise machines. The system may be configured to record the time that the workout was provided to a user and the time when the user reports that the workout has been completed thereby determining if the user required more or less than the anticipated time to complete the workout. Excessive elapsed time to completion may indicate that the user required or simply elected to take additional rest between exercises while faster completion than required may indicate either that the workout was not rigorous enough for the user or that the user failed to complete all of the prescribed exercises. In either event providing an opportunity for the user to advise the system of any such discrepancies will enhance the effectiveness of the exercise workouts generation process by permitting appropriate adjustments if and when needed. Further a user s preferences for subsequent workout generation will be freshest in his mind immediately following completion of a present workout. The system may also be configured to weigh the user measure bioimpedance determine the user s heart rate or collect and store any other useful information in any combination at the conclusion of an exercise workout for use in future exercise workout generation.

As described elsewhere herein the workout generation engine selects and prescribes exercises based in part on the availability of exercise resources at the specific location selected by the user from the list of all facilities proximate to the user s geographic locale provided by the system from its database. In some instances the user s injury history or preferences may be incompatible with the exercise resources available at the user s chosen location. Preferred equipment may not be available the only equipment resources available at a particular location may be of the type not suitable because of risk of injury or the like. In these circumstances the system will advise the user of these limitations and whenever possible provide alternative exercises with the greatest possible level of equivalence. In some embodiments the system may recommend another nearby exercise location where resources necessary for an optimal workout are available. In some embodiments the generation of an exercise workout may be completed and provided to a user prior to his selection of a resource location so that the user may choose his preferred location from those within the same general area as a prelude to his exercise activity. In some embodiments the user may request and receive a newly generated exercise workout at the conclusion of a previous exercise workout along with a location chosen by the user or recommended by the system that offers the requested or preferred exercise resource equipment.

With respect to goals supplied by a user the workout generation engine is configured to accommodate said goals to the greatest degree possible. For example users primarily interested in weight loss may receive a preponderance of cardiovascular exercise to increase metabolism and burn fat. Other users may prefer to build muscle either generally or with respect to specific muscles and exercise workouts directed to that goal will be provided whenever possible. However as when user preferences are considered the workout generation engine maintains a proper balance of exercises and exercise intensity for the optimal benefit of the user when user goals are provided. In some cases certain objectives such as a degree of weight loss may be required before appreciable development of any specific muscles can be realized. In these cases a portion of the exercise workouts may initially be dedicated toward the user s stated goals but the primary focus of the workouts will be determined by the workout generation engine as indicated by the primary input and measured data. The selection of specific exercises their intensity and their duration are all subject to adjustment by the workout generation engine as deemed appropriate to accommodate the user s goals.

Having now presented the manner in which the various user data may be utilized by the workout generation engine several examples of exercise workout generation will now be presented.

New user A age 59 6 1 tall 230 lbs. and a self identified endomorph reports that he exercises approximately 4 times per week and is therefore considered active and in generally good shape. User A establishes a goal to lose 15 lbs. as may be expected by someone who recognizes his profile as being that of an endomorph. His unscaled measured whole body fat content of 23 affirms his goal of losing weight. As such significant cardiovascular exercise will be included in his workouts. From this data the system determines that high repetitions of hypertrophic exercises with moderate weight will be preferred in order to maintain an elevated heart rate. The user also reports a degree of lower back pain that increases his present risk of injury if not properly accommodated so the workout generation engine will avoid selection of inappropriate exercises and with the consent of the user select core stability exercises intended to strengthen the user s back muscles. The user indicates a preference that the entire workout be completed within 30 minutes indicating that a faster pace is required than if additional time were available. The workout generation engine recognizes that the same exercises performed in a shorter period will achieve the same results. The system determines the user s location and obtains a list of all proximate facilities the exercise resources located at those facilities and the exercises that may be performed using those resources. In this case the user s location is a hotel with a moderately well equipped fitness center. The user is required to warm up sufficiently so that he is sufficiently limber and his muscles are prepared for the exertion to follow but this time is preferably not included in the time allotted for the actual workout.

In this example the workout generation engine selects exercises for the main groups of chest abdominal and leg muscles along with secondary groups of bicep tricep and calf muscles in part because the user reported no prior injuries to any of these muscles in part because they are large muscle groups capable of burning fat at a rapid rate and in part due to other considerations including user A s preferences. The exercise workout provided to this user by the workout generation engine comprises as the first component the compound exercise of squats with bicep curls in this case with 12 lb. hand weights for three sets of 15 repetitions each with 30 seconds rest between sets. An older or less fit user may have been prescribed fewer repetitions fewer sets or lesser weights. No special exercise resources are necessary for this exercise hand weights are ubiquitous and available at practically all exercise facilities so there are no limitations based on location no injury considerations and no adverse user preferences.

The exercise workout comprises as the second exercise in the workout an alternating series of bicycle crunches a combination of bicycle like legs pumps combined with trunk rotations performed on the user s back and push ups specifically 30 repetitions of the crunch followed by 10 pushups in quick succession without rest for four cycles. The workout generation engine is configured to select this particular combination because muscles active in the crunch are not active in the pushups allowing them to recover while the other are exercised. The lack of rest periods between the crunches and push ups ensures that a high cardiovascular level is maintained throughout as desired to achieve this user s weight loss goal. The use of separate major muscle groups in each of the component exercises allow one to rest while the other is being exercised. No specialized resources are required for this component of the exercise workout.

The third exercise selected by the workout generation engine is another combination of a bench press combined with a pull down tricep focus and calf raises in this case three sets of 18 repetitions each with 20 seconds of rest between sets to allow partial recovery. At the conclusion of these sets the user should be at or near the 21 minute mark of the 30 minute workout. These exercises may be performed using free weights or a suitable exercise machine based on the availability of the equipment and any user preferences that may be pertinent.

For the fourth and final component of the exercise workout the workout generation engine selects sit ups alternating with flutter kicks 20 repetitions of each for three cycles with no rest between sets. Following completion of these four components the final five minutes of the workout is dedicated to a static stretch as a cool down activity.

User A is then provided an opportunity to provide feedback to the system via one or more of the devices available for that purposes such as the automated station or a portable electronic device in data communication with another component of the system. The user may indicate any difficulties experienced during the workout including his inability to complete any of the prescribed exercises extreme or insufficient exertion or any discomfort beyond that expected from a comprehensive physical workout. Any of the factors above may be cause to modify future workouts to better suit the user and his stated goals. The user may have also developed a preference for future workouts that may also be entered into the system as a part of this post workout evaluation.

The method of generating exercise workouts based on a user s input data biodata goals and preferences seeks to determine the results of a particular series of exercise workouts prospectively in advance of the actual performance of said workouts. An important advantage of the disclosed system is its ability to prospectively generate workouts specifically directed to the particular user s physiology and goals using information provided by and obtained from the user. This is a significant advancement from the current practice where many users haphazardly select exercises to perform without any guidance or underlying rationale. However during the course of the user s participation with the system a user s physiology goals or both may change over time. A novel feature of the system disclosed herein is its retention of user supplied data and measured data including the user s weight bioimpedance and other characteristics obtained via the biosensors which is subject to constant updating each time the user engages the system and requests that a new workout be generated. By continually obtaining new measured biodata and providing the user with an opportunity to update the user supplied information such as goals and preferences the system is assured of generating the optimal exercise workout using latest data and information each time a new workout is requested. In this sense the system adapts to the changing physiology and potentially changing goals of the user. Further by maintaining a record of all historical biodata for each user along with the specific exercises performed by each user over that same period the adaptive exercise workout generation system is configured to correlate results such as weight loss and biodata with specific exercises previously performed to determine which exercises produced the best results for that user and is further configured to prescribe them to the user prospectively anticipating that the desired results will be achieved. However in certain cases the results of prospectively determined exercise workouts may not provide the anticipated results and the disclosed invention provides means by which to improve upon that said known limitation.

When the system detects that a user is no longer progressing toward his goals the workout generation is configured to modify the exercise workouts generated for the user to comprise different exercises or exercises of increased intensity or duration in an attempt to advance the user toward his goals. Different muscle groups or exercises may be selected progress toward the desired goals compared to previous results and further adjustments to the exercise workouts be performed as indicated until the user resumes a sufficient level of progress. In some embodiments the system may inquire of the user whether all of the prescribed exercises are being performed. Users must preferably be enabled to provide post workout feedback where failure to complete the entire exercise workout for any reason may be reported. Absent such opportunity the system should preferably inquire of users at the time an exercise workout is requested whether any exercises prescribed in the previous workout were not completed. The system will be unable to accurately correlate prescribed exercises with results for the purpose of improving subsequent exercise workouts if only a portion of the prescribed exercises are actually performed. However when a user does report that his entire workouts are not being completed the system is configured to modify subsequent workouts in such a way that the user is able to complete said workouts. Completing a less rigorous workout while building strength and endurance will enable the user to eventually complete more rigorous workouts that will advance them toward their goals. The system is accordingly configured to modify a user s goals when necessary to provide more reasonable short term goals on the path to attainment of their ultimate goals. Users not achieving the desired results should also be reminded that attempting to deceive the system will adversely affect their exercise experience prolonging attainment of their goals and requiring extra time and effort. In some embodiments a user may be reminded that factors such as diet have an effect on fitness goals and encouraged to be diligent in maintaining proper caloric intake between exercise workouts.

While the system is adaptive to the changing physiology of individual users via the means described above it is also adaptive on a much larger scale with respect to the cumulative body of users. In one embodiment a user s biodata general physical information present in said user s profile such as somatotype age height and the like exercise workout specifics provided to each said user and an assessment factor as described below indicating how effective previous exercise workouts of a similar nature have been for said user in the past collectively referred to herein as metadata may be associated with each other in any manner anonymously aggregated with the metadata from other users via the networked infrastructure described elsewhere herein and stored in one or more system databases in a repository comprising the metadata of said other users. No data that may possibly be used to identify the identity of the user such as name contact information e mail address or the like would be useful to this embodiment and all such information would therefore be excluded from collection and aggregation. Preferably users would be required to consent for their metadata to be anonymized and aggregated in this manner. Also preferably but not necessarily users would be required to permit the aggregation of their own anonymous metadata as an incentive to benefit from the aggregated anonymous metadata of other users.

As previously disclosed the system provides adaptive exercise workout generation. By examining the user s supplied goals his prior history of measured biological characteristics and the exercises performed the system is configured to adjust the parameters of each exercise workout provided to the user for maximum benefit. For example as the user loses weight the focus of exercise workouts may shift to muscle development if desired. When a user seeks to lose weight but the exercise workouts generated by the workout generation engine are not producing acceptable results the workout generation will alter the exercise workouts provided to the user until the optimal results are being achieved. Sequential alterations will generally be provided in small increments unless the user suddenly presents information to the indication a major change in direction such as dramatically altered goals the occurrence of a new injury or the like. In this manner the system will always be aware of the users goals the steps that have been taken toward attainment of those goals the present state of progress toward attainment of those goals and therefore the effectiveness of said steps in attaining the user s goals.

In a preferred embodiment the system will determine an assessment factor for each workout generated based at least in part on the similarity of the present exercise workout to those previously generated and performed by the user and also based at least in part on the degree of success experienced by the user in the performance of those previous exercise workouts. As one non limiting example for purposes of illustration only the similarity factor and the success factor may each comprise a number in the range between zero 0 and fifty 50 . An exercise workout identical to a previously generated workout may be assigned a similarity factor of 50 an exercise workout with several identical components but several modified components may receive a similarity assessment of 35 while an entirely different exercise workout may receive a similarity assessment of 0. Likewise when one or more previously generated exercise workouts have produced good results a success factor close to 50 may be assigned to the present workout when generated. Lesser results would merit a lower success factor. Adding the similarity and success factors will produce an assessment factor between zero and 100 with the higher scores indicating that the workout generation engine has found the most effective workout possible for the particular user and has been consistently prescribing similar workouts in the recent past. Exercise workouts generated with varying content and success rates as the workout generation engine attempts to find the optimal combination will receive lower assessment factors. Any method of providing an assessment of an exercise workout based at least on a measure of demonstrated success is envisioned by the scope of this disclosure.

Over time a large repository of metadata would accumulate in one or more system databases and provide a statistically large sample of exercises and their effect on users. Some exercise workouts will prove to be more effective with certain types of users than will others thereby receiving higher assessment factors and differentiating on that basis will be highly beneficial in providing optimal exercise workouts to users. For example when the aggregated metadata is evaluated on the whole a particular combination of exercises may be historically proven to be highly effective in rapidly building muscle in younger female ectomorphs while another exercise combination may be much less effective than others in weight reduction for middle age male endomorphs. Accessing and analyzing the aggregated metadata by age somatotype biodata or any other index or combination of indices corresponding to individual components of the metadata would yield an accurate historical determination of which particular exercises associated durations and intensities provided the best particular results for users whose with similar metadata and which did not. In this context best results may be expressed as an optimal progress toward any goal determined by the system or provided by a user. For a weight loss goal best results may be expressed in terms of any of total weight loss rate of weight loss maintenance of a consistent rate of weight loss or the like. When reduction in body fat is a relevant goal any of the amount of total body fat loss the rate at which body fat is reduced or maintenance of a steady rate of body fat reduction may be selected as the best or preferred result. For muscle development best results may be determined by a combination of body fat reduction and weight gain attributable to increased muscle the increased amount of weight or resistance prescribed in an exercise workout necessary because of increased user strength or the like. Any available criteria may be established to determine best historical results and the metadata evaluated to determine which of the aggregated metadata is most pertinent. The workout generation engine may be further configured in this embodiment to either validate modify or replace any exercise workout generated via its prospective analytical methods to better conform to one or more historically effective exercise workouts obtained from the aggregated metadata. Here historically effective exercise workouts are those that have achieved best results for previous users where said best results are those determined as defined above with respect to goals determined by the system or supplied by the user. For example exercise workout components or parameters shown to be particularly effective may be used to replace less effective components selected via analytical evaluation. In one embodiment the aggregated metadata would be used only to permit disambiguation between multiple exercise options available to the workout generation engine and to select a preferred option from several possibilities. Major modification of a workout generated by the prospective analytical methods is not envisioned in this embodiment. However in another embodiment the aggregated metadata may be used to modify the workout generated by the prospective analytical method to any greater degree provided that said modification did not cause the resulting workout to contravene any of certain parameters supplied to the workout generation engine such as those pertaining to a user s injury history goals or the like.

As the amount of anonymous metadata in the aggregated repository grows and exercise workouts generated by prospective analytical methods are correlated conformed to the best historical result and subsequently added to the aggregated repository the workouts generated by the workout generation engine will inevitably gravitate toward said best historical results thereby providing maximum benefit to users. Likewise ineffective workouts not providing acceptable results will be identified as such and will represent a decreasing portion of those being generated. Exercise workouts provided to users via this embodiment will be based on best practices known in the art of prospective analysis based workout generation with the additional insight of results obtained by actual historical performance of users with similar characteristics. Since all of the exercise workouts generated by this embodiment will have originated via best practices in prospective analytical exercise workout generation the superset of aggregated anonymous metadata and associated exercise workouts will be similarly compliant with best prospective analytical practices.

Correlating a user s metadata with that of similar user metadata in the aggregated repository provides guidance regarding which of several potential exercise and intensity options available to the workout generation engine should be selected to achieve best results for said user. In this manner the disclosed system ensures that exercise workouts generated for users are both prospectively analytical and historically proven. Generating exercise workouts solely based on historical results would ignore many of the important prospective analytical factors such as prior injuries individual user goals and the availability of necessary exercise resources proximate to the users. The preferred method of analytical generation of exercise workouts with subsequent validation and possible modification of said workouts based on historically effective results is novel in the known art and represents a substantial improvement thereto while solving the problem of limitations on the effectiveness of prospective only workout generation. In common parlance consideration of the efficacy of exercise workouts closes the loop on open ended workout generation methods using analytical methods where results are not applied to the perfection of said analytical methods.

In one embodiment the workout generation engine may refer a user s metadata to the repository comprising one or more databases of aggregated metadata as an initial step thereby obtaining one or more historically effective exercise workouts that correspond to other users with metadata similar to that of the user. Subsequently the workout generation engine in this embodiment may evaluate each of said historically effective exercise workouts analytically based on all of the information in said user s profile including data not present in the metadata of the user or in the metadata associated with the historically effective exercise workouts. For example without creating limitation on this embodiment users metadata will typically not include information about their injury history. If the workout generation engine detects one or more exercises in a particular historically effective exercise workout to be incompatible with the present user s injury history the workout generation engine would either discard that particular historically effective exercise workout from further consideration or modify said workout by substituting a compatible exercise for any exercise s incompatible with the user s injury. As with the prior embodiment the exercise workouts generated in this latter embodiment and all associated metadata may also be aggregated in the repository for the further benefit of other users. As the final exercise workouts generated via this embodiment has also been subjected to analytical review by the workout generation engine to assure compliance with best practices such workouts provide the same degree of dual standard validation both analytical and historical .

The principal difference between the prior and the latter embodiments of adaptive exercise workout generation is the order in which the prospective analytical factors and the historically effective factors are applied. In the prior embodiment a prospective analytical exercise workout is first generated based on all of the user s information available to the workout generation engine and said workout is subject to some degree of adjustment by comparison to historically effective exercise workouts retrieved from the repository for users with similar metadata. In the latter embodiment a user s metadata is first compared to the metadata of other users and historically effective exercise workouts associated with said metadata are retrieved. Said historically effective exercise workouts are then analytically evaluated against all of the user s information and said historically effective exercise workouts are modified as necessary to conform the final exercise workout provided to the user to any analytical requirements. Both embodiments and believed to be novel in the art and offer significant advantages over said art.

When one or more historically effective exercise workouts are retrieved from the repository of aggregated metadata in any embodiment described or envisioned herein the workout generation engine incorporate and assimilate the data therein into a new exercise workout any preferred manner. For example without creating limitation the workout generation engine may select the historically effective exercise workout with the best results may randomly select one of any of the historically effective exercise workouts within the top tier of available historically effective exercise workouts may select a subset of all of the historically effective exercise workouts determined by any preferred selection criteria and calculate an average mean median or mode set of criteria to apply toward the exercise workout being generated or may generally incorporate any or all of the individual components from one or more historically effective exercise workouts for inclusion in a newly generated exercise workout.

An additional advantage of one embodiment of this invention permits evaluation of exercise resources and locations. When user preferences are also anonymized and aggregated as components of users metadata their positive and negative preferences may be analyzed to determine which particular exercise resources are preferred. To some degree the availability of machines at different facilities within a user s geographic locale will preclude a highly accurate determination of which exercise machines are favored over those of a competitor. However user preferences may be scaled according to availability within a particular region and a general indication of which machines are more popular than others may be obtained. This data may be provided to equipment manufacturers and distributors for marketing purposes as an additional component of the various business models enabled by the system describe herein.

As a non limiting example new system User B primarily interested in losing weight will almost certainly do so provided that the user performs the workouts generated by the system and maintains a reasonably consistent diet. Increased physical activity with a constant caloric input is well known to produce weight loss in all but the most unusual circumstances or physiologies. Generally users who provide a sufficient quantity of sufficiently accurate input data will achieve weight loss results at an acceptable rate from the prospective exercise workout generation methods taught herein. However different users will generally experience different rates of weight loss governed by their metabolism and other factors associated with their particular somatotype. An acceptable rate for one user may not be deemed acceptable to another. As long as the user maintains satisfactory progress in his view and is considered to be on track according to the system s predetermined standards and does not modify his stated weight loss goals or workout preferences the workout generation engine may continue to generate workouts for User B generally consistent with those that have proven to be effective for him. If the user modifies his goals to specify a greater degree of weight loss midway through his program the workout generation engine may select new exercises or provide new durations or intensities for previously prescribed exercises. Should the user express a preference to avoid a familiar exercise or add a new exercise the workout generation engine may substitute something new for something known provided the preference is consistent with its own determination. However at some point short of the user s desired weight loss goal the user may exhibit a plateau where the rate of weight loss slows or stops altogether. As said user s weight is repeatedly measured and stored by the system the exercise workout engine will detect the fact that the user is failing to make progress toward his stated goal. In one embodiment the system will modify the user s subsequent exercise workouts in an attempt to jump start the user s previous rate of weight loss as described above. In an embodiment comprising one or more databases of aggregated metadata the workout generation engine may access said aggregated metadata to search for users with similar metadata examine the results of exercises prescribed for said users and modify the exercise workouts prescribed for user B according to some or all of the most successful user metadata previously aggregated for reference. At the same time User B s metadata will be added to the aggregated data for the benefit of future users. This process will repeat iteratively to maintain acceptable progress toward the user s goals until they are reached via the adaptive process of exercise workout generation.
