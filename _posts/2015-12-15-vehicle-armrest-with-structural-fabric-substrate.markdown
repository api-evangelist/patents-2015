The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 108 619 filed Dec. 17 2013 entitled VEHICLE ARMREST WITH STRUCTURAL FABRIC SUBSTRATE.

The present invention generally relates to vehicle armrests and more specifically a vehicle armrest where at least a portion of the vertical support is provided by a fabric substrate.

Vehicles contain various styles of armrests within door assemblies and also within side panels where no door is present. Various armrests can include additional cushioning and handles as well as other features such as storage compartments and cup holders. Because armrests project into the cabin space of the vehicle they can present a potential hazard during a side impact condition placed upon the vehicle. In such an impact the armrest can be forced further into the cabin area as a result of the impact.

According to at least one aspect of the present invention a vehicle armrest includes an inner armrest substrate having at least one buckling member extending to an outer armrest substrate. A gap is defined by the inner and outer armrest substrates and the at least one buckling member. A fabric member extends across the gap and is attached to the inner and outer armrest substrates. A cover member extends over and is vertically supported by the fabric member.

In at least another aspect of the present invention a vehicle armrest includes an armrest substrate having an inner structure and an outer structure with a gap defined therebetween. A fabric member extends across the gap. A cushion member is disposed on the armrest substrate and is at least partially supported from below by the fabric member.

In at least another aspect a vehicular armrest includes an armrest substrate having a plurality of buckling members that define a gap within the armrest substrate. A cover member is attached to the armrest substrate. A fabric member is attached to the armrest substrate and positioned under the cover member. The fabric member spans the gap and provides vertical support to portions of the cover member proximate the gap.

These and other aspects objects and features of the present invention will be understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art upon studying the following specification claims and appended drawings.

For purposes of description herein the terms upper lower right left rear front vertical horizontal and derivatives thereof shall relate to the invention as oriented in . However it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative orientations except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings and described in the following specification are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting unless the claims expressly state otherwise.

As shown in reference numeral generally refers to a vehicular fabric substrate armrest including an inner armrest substrate and having at least one buckling member that extends to an outer armrest substrate . A gap is defined by the inner and outer armrest substrates and the at least one buckling member . A fabric member extends across the gap and is attached to the inner and outer armrest substrates . A cover member extends over and is vertically supported by the fabric member .

Referring again to the embodiment of the fabric substrate armrest is installed within a door of a vehicle proximate the location of the occupant s elbow and arm to provide vertical support to the occupant s arm while in the vehicle . It is contemplated that the fabric substrate armrest can also be disposed at the interior side panels of a vehicle to provide arm support for occupants in seating locations that do not have a door adjacent thereto. Such locations can include but are not limited to a rear seat in a two door vehicle a third row seat in a four door vehicle a center console and other similar locations.

Referring again to the embodiment of the inner armrest substrate is attached to a lower portion of the door frame and the outer armrest substrate is attached to an upper portion of the door frame . A first buckling member extends along a front edge of the armrest substrate between the inner and outer armrest substrates wherein the first buckling member defines a front boundary of the gap extending between the inner and outer armrest substrates . A second buckling member extends along a rear edge of the armrest substrate between the inner and outer armrest substrates . The second buckling member defines a rear boundary of the gap extending between the inner and outer armrest substrates . The gap is configured to extend substantially the length of the inner and outer armrest substrates . The fabric member attaches to the inner and outer armrest substrates and spans the gap such that the fabric member provides the primary vertical support for those portions of the fabric substrate armrest disposed within the outer extent of the gap .

Referring now to the embodiment of a first edge of the fabric member is coupled to the inner armrest substrate wherein the inner armrest substrate includes at least one slot . The first edge of the fabric member includes a fastening member that is configured to engage the slot of the inner armrest substrate . A second edge of the fabric member is configured to attach to the outer armrest substrate such that the fabric member is tensioned across the gap to vertically support the arm of an occupant at those portions defined within the outer extent of the gap .

As illustrated in the embodiment of the first edge of the fabric member can include a plurality of fastening members that engage a corresponding plurality of slots defined within the inner armrest substrate . The fastening member can include a hook that engages a corresponding slot . The fastening member can also include an interference tab that engages a cooperative tab proximate the slot to substantially couple the first edge of the fabric member to the inner armrest substrate . In various embodiments the inner armrest substrate can include a single slot that is configured to receive a plurality of fastening members from the first edge of the fabric member . Alternatively the fabric member can include a single fastening member that couples with a single slot of the inner armrest substrate . It is also contemplated that the corresponding slots and fastening members described above can be disposed on the outer armrest substrate and the second edge of the fabric member . It is further contemplated that the first and second edges of the fabric member can each include fastening members that engage cooperating slots defined within each of the inner and outer armrest substrates .

In various embodiments the fabric member can be made of various flexible fabric materials that can include but are not limited to cotton fabric plastic vinyl metallic fabric wire mesh and other substantially fabric type materials that can be disposed upon and formed around the inner and outer armrest substrates . Additionally in various embodiments the fabric member can be a Class A flame retardant fabric. It is contemplated that in various embodiments the fabric member can be at least partially elastic so that the fabric member when tensioned across the gap can at least partially stretch to afford the user of the vehicle comfort when resting an arm upon the fabric substrate armrest . In the embodiments described above the tensioning force placed upon the fabric member that extends between the inner and outer armrest substrates is configured to provide a location on which the occupant can rest their arm for comfort while within the vehicle . The combination of the cover member and the fabric member is configured to provide at least some vertical displacement when the occupant places their arm upon the fabric substrate armrest . In such an embodiment the cover member and the fabric member provide a cushioned surface to the occupant. In other embodiments as will be described more fully below various cushioning members can be added to the armrest substrate to provide additional padding for the occupant using the fabric substrate armrest .

In the various embodiments the cover member can be made of a variety of materials that can include but are not limited to leather PVC TPO plastic vinyl combinations thereof or other similar materials. The cover member is configured to extend over the inner and outer armrest substrates the buckling members and the fabric member . It is contemplated that the cover member can be tensioned over the fabric substrate armrest or can be fastened or adhered thereto.

As illustrated in the embodiment of the first and second buckling members can define portions of the fabric substrate armrest wherein the fabric substrate armrest includes the inner and outer armrest substrates and the buckling members that extend therebetween. Alternatively first and second buckling members can be separate members that are attached to either the inner armrest substrate the outer armrest substrate or both. It is contemplated that in various embodiments the buckling members can be part of a fabric member frame that extends around and receives at least a portion of the fabric member . In such an embodiment the fabric member frame is coupled to the inner and outer armrest substrates .

As illustrated in the embodiment of the first and second buckling members define weakened portions of the fabric substrate armrest such that lateral forces disposed upon the fabric substrate armrest such as in a side collision event cause the first and second buckling members to bend or deflect to absorb at least a portion of the lateral force applied to the fabric substrate armrest . The fabric member being substantially flexible provides minimal lateral support if any to the fabric substrate armrest in the area of the gap between the first and second buckling members . In this manner the fabric member can provide vertical support at those portions of the armrest used by the occupant while also providing little if any lateral structure to the fabric substrate armrest such that the first and second buckling members can deflect in a collision situation. The deflection of the first and second buckling members serves to minimize the distance that the fabric substrate armrest projects into the cabin of the vehicle as a result of the lateral force . In various embodiments to allow the buckling members to deflect when lateral forces are applied the first and second buckling members are configured to be weaker than the inner and outer armrest substrates in at least the lateral direction. This weakened condition can be accomplished by making the first and second buckling members from a separate and weaker material than the inner and outer armrest substrates . The weakened condition can also be achieved by making the first and second buckling members to have a thinner cross sectional area. Other configurations can include but are not limited by weakening notches or cutouts defined within the first and second buckling members scoring or thinned portions that define weaker areas of the first and second buckling members and other configurations.

In various embodiments the armrest substrate including the inner and outer armrest substrates and the buckling members can be made of various materials that can include but are not limited to metal plastic composite combinations thereof as well as other substantially rigid materials. As discussed above the inner and outer armrest substrates and the various buckling members can be made of different materials such that the buckling members are configured to bend or deflect as a result of lateral forces before bending or deflection occurs within the inner and outer armrest substrates . It is also contemplated that the various buckling members can include a plurality of buckling members that extend between the inner and outer armrest substrates to define a plurality of gaps extending between the inner and outer armrest substrates .

Referring now to the embodiments illustrated in the first edge of the fabric member can include one or more looped features or similar apertures that can be disposed through the one or more slots of the inner armrest substrate . Once inserted through the slot a retaining bar can be slidably engaged through the looped features such that the combination of the retaining bar and looped features are prevented from being pulled back through the slot of the inner armrest substrate . This retention configuration creates the tension upon the fabric member across the gap . It is contemplated that as with the embodiments discussed above the inner armrest substrate can include a single slot that is configured to receive a plurality of looped features that receive a sliding member and couple the first edge of the fabric member to the inner armrest substrate . Alternatively the first edge of the fabric member can include a single elongated loop feature that extends substantially the length of the first edge of the fabric member wherein the single looped feature is disposed through a single slot defined within the inner armrest substrate . As with the embodiments discussed above the second edge of the fabric member can include one or more looped features as discussed above that engage corresponding slots that are defined within the outer armrest substrate . It is further contemplated that the first and second edges of the fabric member can each include the looped features and both the inner and the outer armrest substrates can include the slots that cooperate with the looped features of the fabric member .

In various embodiments the fabric member can be attached to the inner and outer armrest substrates through methods apart from and or in addition to those methods described above. Such methods can include but are not limited to mechanical type fasteners interference type fasteners adhesives welding staples tensioning mechanisms and other similar attachment methods. Additionally these attachment methods may be used to couple the fabric member to a fabric frame that surrounds the fabric member . In such an embodiment when the fabric member is attached to the fabric frame the fabric member is tensioned within the frame and the frame is attached to the inner and outer armrest substrates .

Referring now to the embodiment shown in the fabric substrate armrest can include a cushion member that is disposed upon and is vertically supported by the tensioned fabric member . The cushion member and the fabric member can be covered by the cover member . The inner and outer armrest substrates can include a recessed portion that is configured to receive at least a portion of the cushion member such that the fabric substrate armrest has a substantially level top surface for supporting the occupant s arm. It is contemplated that the cushion member can be partially supported by the inner and outer armrest substrates and the buckling members at the perimeter of the cushion member . In the various embodiments it is contemplated that the primary vertical support for the cushion member at the gap is from the fabric member that is tensioned across the gap .

Referring now to the embodiment of embodiments of the fabric substrate armrest that include a cushion member operate substantially similar to those embodiments that have no cushion member as described above. Where a lateral force is applied to the fabric substrate armrest such as from a side impact the first and second buckling members being weakened portions of the fabric substrate armrest are configured to buckle before the inner and outer armrest substrates such that the outer armrest substrate can move toward the inner armrest substrate to absorb the lateral forces from the impact. In this manner the inner armrest substrate experiences a lesser lateral displacement toward the inner portions of the cabin as a result of the deflection of the first and second buckling members and the movement of the outer armrest substrate toward the inner armrest substrate . This configuration also can slow the velocity that the inner armrest substrate can move inward toward the cabin area due to the first and second buckling members absorbing a portion of the lateral force . This configuration allows the outer armrest substrate to experience a greater lateral displacement than the inner armrest substrate . The cushion member in the above described embodiment provides minimal if any lateral structure that might serve to bolster the first and second buckling members that span the gap between the inner and outer armrest substrates . In this manner the cushion member experiences substantially the same amount of deflection or compression as the first and second buckling members without adding lateral structural support at the gap of the fabric substrate armrest .

Referring now to the embodiment illustrated in one or more lateral bars can be disposed across the gap between the first and second buckling members to provide additional vertical support to the cushion member and the occupant s arm. The lateral bars are configured to be free of engagement with either of the inner or outer armrest substrates such that the lateral bars provide an under cushion vertical support but do not provide additional lateral support across the gap between the inner and outer armrest substrates . The lateral bars are shown a being oriented perpendicular with the first and second buckling members . It is contemplated that in various embodiments the lateral bars can be oriented in other non perpendicular configurations so long as the lateral bars do not inhibit the deflection of the first and second buckling members . The lateral bars can be made of various substantially rigid materials that include but are not limited to plastic metal composite PVC and other rigid type materials.

In various embodiments the lateral bars can be placed upon the buckling members or can be placed upon tabs or notches of the first and second buckling members such that the lateral bars do not provide additional lateral structure along the length of the first and second buckling members that might inhibit the deflection of the first and second buckling members when the lateral forces are applied to the fabric substrate armrest . In this manner the lateral bars are configured to move and be displaced by the deflective movement of the first and second buckling members when lateral forces are applied to the fabric substrate armrest . Accordingly the lateral bars and the fabric member provide vertical support to the cushion member without substantially adding to the lateral strength of the fabric substrate armrest at the gap and the first and second buckling members . In various embodiments the fabric member can be placed over the lateral bars or the fabric member can be placed through apertures in the lateral bars wherein the tensioning force of the fabric member being stretched across the gap substantially holds the lateral bars in place. In this manner the lateral bars can be minimally engaged with the first and second buckling members . The lateral bars can also be attached to the fabric frame member as described above where the fabric frame member includes the buckling members and is attached to the inner and outer armrest substrates .

In various embodiments it is contemplated that the cover member can include a cushioned portion such that the cushioned portion of the cover member is disposed at the gap of the fabric substrate armrest wherein the cushioned portion of the cover is supported by the first and second buckling members . Additionally in various embodiments the fabric substrate armrest can include a handle that can be used to open and close the door to which the fabric substrate armrest is attached. The fabric substrate armrest can also include various cup holders containers and other storage areas. It is contemplated that the handle and storage areas included in the fabric substrate armrest do not substantially add lateral support to the first and second buckling members .
