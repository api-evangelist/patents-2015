title: Real time threat detection system using integrated passive sensors
abstract: A real-time threat detection system incorporating a plurality of sensors adapted to detect radiation across the majority of the electromagnetic spectrum. The system also includes an aided or automatic target recognition module which compares the data from the sensors against known radiation signatures and issues an alert when an anomalous signature is detected. The system further includes an operator station which displays sensor information allowing the operator to intervene. The sensors detect radiation which is normally emitted by persons or other bodies and display areas to the operator where normal emissions are blocked.

This system relates generally to surveillance. More particularly it relates to the detection of concealed person borne objects including but not limited to Improvised Explosive Devices IEDs .

A wide variety of security systems are employed for consumer commercial industrial government and military applications. Security systems can utilize a variety of technologies including mechanical electrical electromechanical optical laser and other techniques. Additionally security systems can generally be separated into two classes active and passive.

Active security systems detect disturbances in the absorption and or reflection of a transmitted signal. Thus active security systems require a transmitter and a receiver to function. Some active security systems utilize a transceiver to accomplish both functions while others use a possibly disparate illuminator separate from the receiver. A common example of an active security system is one based on radar which uses transmitted energy or sound to illuminate an area or subject and then detect disturbances in the reflected energy or sound. In this example sound has been explicitly mentioned since sound is debatably not a form of radiated energy but is a vibration of molecules in surrounding medium such as water or atmosphere. Hence sound does not propagate in a vacuum whereas typical transmitted energy does.

Passive security systems do not emit radiation or signals but simply observe image the existing energy contained within a scene. Since there is no transmitter involved passive security systems are particularly adept at long stand off surveillance where the sensor and operator can be located a safe distance away from danger or at a distance amenable to interdiction. In the presently described invention the infrared sensor element of the concealed object detection system can detect the presence of a concealed suicide bomb vest at distances exceeding 100 meters.

Typical passive security systems include visual infrared millimeter wave and or terahertz imaging systems. These passive systems image different frequencies of energy in the electromagnetic spectrum.

Infrared millimeter wave and terahertz based security systems have the benefit of being able to image concealed objects under the clothing of subjects if properly designed. Imaging and detection of concealed objects is essential for detecting terrorist threats as well as enabling less lethal applications such as detecting contraband or stolen objects. These systems image the contrast between the human body and the concealed object that may block or otherwise attenuate the body s natural energy.

While the human body emits absorbs and reflects infrared millimeter wave and terahertz energy in a sensor observable fashion concealed objects such as explosives weapons contraband and the like block absorb reflect or otherwise attenuate the body s energy providing the imaging system with a contrasting signal or image. When considering an imaging system these contrasts may appear as areas either darker or lighter than the body.

Most clothing is transparent to radiation in the millimeter wave and terahertz spectra and conductive of body heat in the infrared spectrum. Objects weapons or bomb devices that are worn beneath one s apparel will block or attenuate the body s natural radiation and results in a signature that can be detected much as a lamp shade blocks the light from a light bulb. Under most circumstances large objects such as bomb devices or protective vests worn under clothing present a detectable thermal signature which can be additionally detected using infrared or thermal sensors.

The aforementioned capability is effective for imaging suicide bombers smugglers and persons with concealed objects such as firearms contraband currency hazardous liquids and gels and the like. This is especially significant since some threats like plastic explosives powders liquids and gels cannot be detected using other forms of security devices such as metal detectors.

Contemporary sensor technology provides individual solutions for imaging in the spectra most favorable for concealed object detection. Infrared sensors produced by FLIR Systems Inc. millimeter wave sensors produced by Brijot Imaging Systems Inc. and terahertz sensors produced by Thruvision Ltd. are available for imaging their respective spectra. Occasionally these classes of sensors offer a degree of concealed object detection capability within their disparate spectra.

One disadvantage of these passive security systems and security systems in general is they typically image using a select subset of the electromagnetic Spectrum as defined by their respective sensor receiver. Many such passive systems employ a single sensor imaging in the infrared millimeter wave terahertz or x ray band resulting in a reduction the effectiveness of the detection. Detection capability is reduced since a concealed object may be less observable in one spectrum versus another. Passive infrared systems may offer significant standoff distances but image thermal conduction through the clothes instead of penetrating the clothing. Passive millimeter wave systems excel at detecting metal objects but perform worse detecting liquids. Passive terahertz sensors image through clothing more readily than millimeter wave but suffer greater effects of solar loading outdoors. Here the use of a plurality of sensors imaging disparate spectra is desirable.

A second disadvantage of typical passive security systems is the lack of computer assisted or automated detection capability. Prior art concealed object imaging and detection systems typically lack computer assisted or automated detection or confine such computer assisted or automated detection to a single frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum.

A third disadvantage of typical passive security systems is they are typically engineered for a particular environment location or use case making these systems costly in terms of application specific engineering training and support. These systems typically require support infrastructure such as inspection areas lanes backdrops and the like to improve the limited visibility nature of imaging a singular spectrum thereby limiting or eliminating their ad hoc or on demand responsiveness and capabilities.

A fourth disadvantage of typical passive concealed object detection security systems is the fixed range imaging capability of typical infrared millimeter wave and terahertz sensors deployed in those systems. The infrared imagers typically do not include zoom optics and millimeter wave and terahertz imagers must be custom designed for a particular narrow operating range by virtue of the aperture feed horn and antenna design selected during their design and construction phases.

Therefore a need exists in the art for a concealed object detection security system that employs a plurality of disparate sensors imaging a scene using complimentary spectra. Such a system would leverage the spectral resolving power of each sensor cumulatively offering a best of all worlds solution to concealed object detection by reinforcing the benefits and capability of each sensor while minimizing any one sensor s deficiencies. For example the outdoor deployment deficiencies inherent in terahertz sensors can be offset by the presence of the infrared and millimeter wave sensors.

Another need exists in the art for a concealed object detection security system for concealed object detection that includes computer assisted or automated detection capability applied in a holistic system of systems methodology. While this capability exists within the spectrum of some individual sensors true multi spectral computer assisted or automated detection capability does not currently exist.

Another need exists in the art for automated sensor fusion capability reducing the level of effort required by the operator in assessing the imagery of a plurality of disparate sensors. As an example the imagery of an infrared sensor may depict brighter pixels as areas of greater thermal content while the imagery of a millimeter wave sensor may depict brighter pixels as areas of lower millimeter wave content and the imagery of a terahertz sensor may eschew bright or dark pixels in favor of a false color image. Thus requiring an operator to assess these disparate images in real time and continually is disadvantageous versus employment of automated sensor fusion.

Another need exists in the art for a concealed object detection security system that can be deployed ad hoc into multiple situations by virtue of the magnification of capability provided by a plurality of disparate spectrum sensors. This reduces or eliminates the potential incompatibility of a single sensor system operating in an environment where its efficacy is ill suited to that environment e.g. a terahertz imager operating under a sunny sky .

Another need exists in the art for a concealed object detection security system of maximized Probability of Detection Pd and minimized Probability of False Alarm Pfa as can be achieved by imaging multiple disparate spectra and then algorithmically and holistically evaluating the results.

Another need exists in the art for a concealed object detection security system utilizing a plurality of disparate spectrum sensors to include a voting or weighting algorithm maximizing Pd and minimizing Pfa. Such a voting or weighting algorithm would empathize detection presence when a majority of sensors detect a concealed object and de empathize detection presence when an isolated or no sensor detects a concealed object.

Another need exists in the art for a concealed object detection security system that leverages multi spectral sensor fusion and multi sensor voting or weighting algorithms where results from one or more sensors can provide negative feedback to the voting or weighting algorithms on detection of an innocuous concealed object thusly minimizing Pfa.

Another need exists in the art for a concealed object detection security system that leverages multi spectral sensor fusion and multi sensor voting or weighting algorithms to simplify operation for the operator test and support staff thereby reducing operator fatigue training and operator sustaining costs.

Another need exists in the art for a concealed object detection security system that has a deep range imaging capability exceeding the imaging ranges of its individual sensors. The combination of short range millimeter wave imaging medium range terahertz imaging and long range infrared imaging described in the current system provides maximal coverage of a variety of ranges heretofore not obtainable from a single sensor solution.

Another need exists in the at for a concealed object detection security system that cohesively combines multi spectral detection in a single system providing holistic procurement deployment operation training and support of the homogeneous system versus a multitude of separate systems each with their own requirements for procurement setup environment operation training and support.

Another need exists in the art for a concealed object detection security system that is flexible enough to be employed in a wide variety of applications locations and environments without additional engineering site preparation operator training or unit modifications. The system would be quickly deployable for indoor or outdoor conditions daytime or nighttime conditions humid or arid conditions and the like and exhibit a large advantage over systems that are custom tailored for a particular deployment location or use case and thereby reduce or eliminate the costs involved in engineering and personnel training for each specific deployment.

However in view of the prior art at the time the present system was made it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art how the identified needs could be fulfilled.

While certain aspects of conventional technologies have been discussed to facilitate disclosure of the system Applicants in no way disclaim these technical aspects and it is contemplated that the claimed system may encompass one or more of the conventional technical aspects discussed herein.

The present invention may address one or more of the problems and deficiencies of the related art discussed above. However it is contemplated that the system may prove useful in addressing other problems and deficiencies in a number of technical areas. Therefore the claimed system should not necessarily be construed as limited to addressing any of the particular problems or deficiencies discussed herein.

In this specification where a document act or item of knowledge is referred to or discussed this reference or discussion is not an admission that the document act or item of knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date publicly available known to the public part of common general knowledge or otherwise constitutes prior art under the applicable statutory provisions or is known to be relevant to an attempt to solve any problem with which this specification is concerned.

The long standing but heretofore unfulfilled need for an improved more effective and more accurate system function method and or software for surveillance or detection of concealed person borne objects is now met by a new useful and nonobvious real time threat detection system.

The system provides enhanced detection capabilities of concealed objects by incorporating multiple sensors imaging multiple complimentary and disparate spectra including thermal imaging devices millimeter wave sensors and terahertz sensors in a comprehensive holistic architecture capable of detecting a wide array of concealed articles such as improvised explosive devices. The architecture provides maximized Probability of Detection Pd minimized Probability of False Alarm Pfa and increased breath of detectable concealed objects due to the disparate spectra and capabilities of the sensors utilized in the system. Computer assisted or automated algorithms holistically evaluate detection results for increased Pd decreased Pfa and reduce operator work load through sensor fusion providing a cohesive homogeneous interface.

The threat detection system integrates multiple sensors that target different spectral bands in the electromagnetic spectrum. Where previous threat detection systems rely on sensors or approaches focusing on one spectral band the present system covers a majority of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each sensor detects emissions within a specific spectral band and has its own capabilities based on the characteristics of that portion of the spectrum. By integrating the sensors into a cohesive whole the system mitigates the limitation of any individual sensor by harnessing the capabilities of other sensors.

The system is designed to provide soldiers law enforcement and other security personnel and first responders with a rapidly deployable and reconfigurable tool to enhance security.

These and other important objects advantages and features of the system will become clear as this disclosure proceeds.

The real time threat detection system accordingly comprises the features of construction combination of elements and arrangement of parts that will be exemplified in the disclosure set forth hereinafter and the scope of the system will be indicated in the claims.

In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part thereof and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the system may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the system.

In a particular embodiment a system and method for passive multi spectral imaging is disclosed. The method and system includes provision for imaging analyzing and displaying imagery from a plurality of passive sensors imaging disparate spectrum conducive to detection of concealed objects.

In one embodiment the threat detection system is adapted to detect threats posed by pedestrian suicide bombers and the like. In one embodiment the threat detection system includes a suite of passive sensors adapted to detect radiation spanning the majority of the electromagnetic spectrum.

In one embodiment the system provides standoff threat detection allowing a threat to be recognized from a safe distance. As the sensors employed in the currently described embodiment are passive in nature and no transmitters are utilized the system is particularly adept at long stand off surveillance where the sensor and operator can be located a safe distance away from danger or at a distance amenable to interdiction. In the preferred embodiment the infrared sensor element of the concealed object detection system can detect the presence of a concealed suicide bomb vest at distances exceeding 100 meters. Moreover the system provides security forces the ability to detect at standoff ranges and with a high degree of certainty concealed explosive devices and weapons worn under a person s apparel.

In the preferred embodiment the plurality of sensors are selected such that their operational imaging ranges are disparate and as complementary to concealed object detection as their disparate imaging spectra. This characteristic extends the imaging range of the multi sensor system beyond the imaging range of any of its individual sensors allowing for example the millimeter wave sensor to be most effective at close range the terahertz sensor to be most effective at medium range and the infrared sensor to be most effective at long range with range overlap between the sensors as permitted by the imagers providing a net result of an imaging range 2 or 3 times that of any single sensor.

In another embodiment the plurality of sensors is selected such that their operational imaging ranges are highly similar allowing concealed object detection at a predetermined range. This characteristic may tend to narrow the range of the multi sensor system beyond the range of any of its individual sensors to the range of the tightest range sensor and or maximum degree of range overlap between sensors. This configuration allows the system to operate at maximum detection effectiveness throughout the narrower imaging range since the majority or entirety of spectral ranges are used simultaneously to perform the concealed object detection function.

The use of sensors whose imaging spectra span across the electromagnetic spectrum of allows the system to non invasively detect whether or not a person poses a possible threat at distances exceeding 100 meters due to the presence of an object concealed under the clothing. The system operates over several spectra and all sensors are passive in nature and conform to all related safety regulations as well as avoid detection from electromagnetic detection snooping devices.

The real time threat detection system includes a plurality of sensors since no existing sensor can perform the task of detecting explosive devices and weapons under all environmental conditions. The system of systems approach integrates sensors and increases each technology s capabilities exponentially though use of the Automated Assisted Target Recognition module. Automatic Target Recognition is the machine function e.g. algorithm of detecting classifying recognizing and identifying an object without human interaction. Aided Target Recognition is a subset of Automatic Target Recognition in which a human operator interacts with the system and makes some of the decisions. In the preferred embodiment the invention presently described will include Automatic Target Recognition maximally and Aided Target Recognition as a minimum and the term ATR shall refer to this preferred embodiment.

The ATR module combines the individual detection results of each sensor into a homogeneous detection result providing amongst other benefits a voting mechanism where a single sensor detection is weighed less significantly than a multiple sensor cross spectrum detection which is weighed more significantly. The multiple sensor detection thusly provides increased Pd and reduced Pfa through algorithmic confirmation and collaboration of the results amongst disparate sensors.

Additionally the ATR module may include algorithms to detect innocuous concealed objects using the imaging results of one or more spectra to cancel or negatively influence the detection results of other spectra sensor results providing for reduced Pfa.

Additionally through the inclusion of the ATR module the system may employ a voting mechanism to further increase Pd and reduce Pfa by evaluating the presence or absence magnitude size shape and or location of multiple collaborating detection results across the multiple sensor spectra.

The system may also include an operator station adapted to display alerts in response to threats detected by the ATR module. The operator station adds a heightened capability in detecting anomalies explosives and weapons.

A preferred embodiment shown in includes a plurality of sensors preferably mounted on a mobile platform capable of providing electric power and mobility. As shown in threat detection system includes a terahertz sensor millimeter wave sensor infrared sensor and visible spectrum camera i.e. CCTV communicatively coupled to a processing unit via signal converters and respectively. The signal converters and convert the signals from the sensors and respectively into digital form for processing unit . If a particular sensor outputs analog video signals such as RS 170 its respective signal converter would take the form of an Analog to Digital Converter ADC image capture device. If a particular sensor outputs Ethernet digital video signals such as Gig E its respective signal converter would take the form of an Ethernet channel. Other sensor output formats will require corresponding signal converters.

Signal converters may be external to processing unit or internal to processing unit . Additionally some or all signal converters may be embodied in a single device such as an Ethernet switch or router multi channel video capture card or multi channel video server.

This embodiment represents only an illustrative configuration. For example the system can be concealed for covert observation and detection in target areas. In contrast it can be openly displayed as a deterrent while being used for overt observation and threat detection. The millimeter wave and terahertz sensors used with the system are preferably capable of penetrating imaging through drywall and can be easily incorporated into architectural features without compromising effectiveness.

In one embodiment the system utilizes a terahertz sensor adapted to detect radiation in the 5 30 meter range. In the preferred embodiment the terahertz sensor is included into the system as a pre assembled component acquired from a terahertz sensor manufacturer. The selected sensor is chosen such that its output is updated in real time 15 Hz or more and formatted using an x y matrix of image pixels providing maximal compatibility with the ATR module software. Typically the magnitude of the terahertz radiation imaged by each pixel within the x y image matrix is resolved to a value of 0 to 255 where 0 represents a minimal or no terahertz reading for that pixel and 255 represents a maximal or full reading for that pixel.

In one embodiment the system utilizes a millimeter wave sensor operating in the 80 100 gigahertz band of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the preferred embodiment the millimeter wave sensor is included into the system as a pre assembled component acquired from a millimeter wave sensor manufacturer. The selected sensor is chosen such that its output is updated in real time 15 Hz or more and formatted using an x y matrix of image pixels providing maximal compatibility with the ATR module software. Typically the magnitude of the millimeter wave radiation imaged by each pixel within the x y image matrix is resolved to a value of 0 to 255 where 0 represents a minimal or no millimeter wave reading for that pixel and 255 represents a maximal or full reading for that pixel.

In one embodiment the invention utilizes an infrared sensor operating in the 3 5 m band the 8 12 m band or both. In the preferred embodiment the infrared sensor is included into the system as a pre assembled component acquired from an infrared sensor manufacturer. The selected sensor is chosen such that its output is updated in real time 15 Hz or more and formatted using an x y matrix of image pixels providing maximal compatibility with the ATR module software. Typically the magnitude of the infrared radiation imaged by each pixel within the x y image matrix is resolved to a value of 0 to 255 where 0 represents a minimal or no infrared reading for that pixel and 255 represents a maximal or full reading for that pixel.

Contrasting with terahertz and millimeter wave imagers described above which image the body s natural terahertz and millimeter wave energy emissions through the clothing infrared sensors detect temperature and temperature differential on the clothing surface.

In the preferred embodiment the sensor data received from the plurality of sensors is resolved into an x y image matrix for each sensor each image matrix consisting of pixel values typically ranging in value from 0 to 255 where 0 represents a minimal or no sensor reading for that pixel and 255 represents a maximal or full sensor reading for that pixel. The pixel values then represent the measure of emitted and or reflected energy in the scene as viewed by each sensor. In the case of viewing a person with an object concealed underneath their clothing the pixel values may indicate the contrast difference between one or more pixels viewing portions of the person where no concealed object exists and portions of the person where a concealed object exists.

Referring now to a block diagram of a particular embodiment of the system is disclosed and generally designated . The system includes a computing device having at least one processor and a memory that is accessible to the processor . The memory includes media that is readable by the processor and that stores data and program instructions of software modules that are executable by the processor .

Additionally the computing device having at least one means of user input either keyboard mouse light pen track ball track pad joystick graphics tablet touch screen or other GUI input device or any combination thereof that is accessible to the processor .

Additionally the computing device having at least one means of user display either a cathode ray tube CRT display liquid crystal display LCD light emitting diode LED display plasma display or other GUI display device that is accessible to the processor .

Additionally the computing device can have a plurality of means of sensor input either frame capture hardware Ethernet video data transmission or other sensor input means that is accessible to the processor .

Additionally the processor executes software residing in memory which monitors processes and reacts to user input from the input device using a user input software module displays operator output and GUI elements to the output device using a display output software module synchronizes the video reception analysis and display using a synchronization software module and processing the image acquisition target tracking target orientation detection and progressive analysis of occluded areas using a processing software module .

Referring now to the signal received from one of the plurality of sensors is resolved into an x y image matrix storing the information as pixel values. The x y image matrix can then be displayed as pixel data on a display device allowing visualization of the data. Pixels representing non occluded areas no concealed object are indicated with pixel values towards the mid to light range of the gray scale. Pixels representing occluded areas concealed object are indicated with pixel values towards the dark range of the gray scale. The pixel value contrast between occluded and non occluded areas is indicative of the presence of a concealed object which blocks or otherwise attenuates the natural energy emission or reflection of the human body . This pixel value contrast can be presented in visual form or as numerical data to a computer algorithm ATR module described herein for subsequent automated analysis or both.

Referring now to an illustration of disparate sensor fields of view characteristic of one embodiment of the threat detection system is described. A plurality of sensors generally designated may include terahertz millimeter wave infrared and visible sensors or a combination thereof viewing a subject along a generalized centerline . Due to the disparate nature of the sensors imaging subject differences in view angle and focal distance may be exhibited. This property may be capitalized by threat detection system to increase the surveillance range of the system beyond the range of any individual component sensor .

As example the millimeter wave sensor component within the plurality of sensors may exhibit an active imaging area positioned at the shortest distance from the sensors . Imaging beyond the millimeter wave sensor s active imaging area is degraded or not effective limiting the performance of the threat detection system . Leveraging the disparate active imaging area of the terahertz sensor and the active imaging area of the infrared sensor increases the range of the threat detection system beyond the capability of any individual sensor.

In a preferred embodiment one or more of the active imaging areas of sensors may overlap as shown in . This provides an enhanced surveillance zone between the sensors providing the overlapped active imaging area . In a non preferred embodiment one or more of the active imaging areas of sensors do not overlap as illustrated in . This would provide a void in the surveillance zone between sensors.

In addition to an increase in range of threat detection system afforded by disparate active imaging areas a preferred embodiment would leverage differences in viewing angles for sensors . As illustrated in active imaging area for the terahertz sensor and active imaging area for the infrared sensor exhibit contrasting view angles allowing the threat detection system a wider combined field of view than afforded by any single sensor.

Threat detection efficacy is at a maximum where two or more active imaging areas overlap . In these regions the subject can be imaged for concealed threats using a plurality of spectra. This second look capability increases Pd and lowers Pfa by evaluating the combined detection results of multiple sensors using the ATR module.

In another embodiment of the presently disclosed invention the sensor exhibiting the largest field of view and or depth of field can be utilized as a spotter sensor allowing the remaining sensors to automatically slew to movement within the spotter sensor s field of view under control of the ATR Module. This functionality can be implemented physically through addition of electro mechanical pan tilt stages attached to the non spotter sensors or algorithmically by directing the ATR evaluation module software described herein to evaluate the region of interest as directed by the target location determined by the ATR software using the spotter sensor or both.

Table 1 lists the resultant joint probability Pd and Pfa of the overlapping active imaging area independent probabilities for 1 2 and 3 sensors using joint probability formula 1 and 1 

Referring now to the ATR module is disclosed. The ATR module is implemented in software or firmware as part of the threat detection system operating software generally denoted as . In the preferred embodiment sensor image data in the form of an x y image consisting of pixels is received and stored in image data buffers each servicing one spectrum being viewed by a corresponding sensor. For example image data buffer may store image data from a terahertz sensor image buffer may store image data from a millimeter wave sensor image buffer may store image data from an infrared sensor and image buffer may store image data from a visible spectrum closed circuit television CCTV sensor.

Each of the plurality of image data buffers is analyzed for contrast differences by their respective Evaluate Sensor Data Modules respectively. The Evaluate Sensor Data Modules detect image contrast changes using a variety of computer algorithms examples of which are described below. For objects concealed beneath clothing the visible spectrum sensor with associated image buffer and Evaluate Sensor Data Module may not yield appreciable detection results.

The individual evaluation results from the Evaluate Sensor Data Modules for each sensor are evaluated in combination by the ATR Module . In the preferred embodiment Synchronization Module insures that the plurality of sensor data represents a time synchronized representation of the current scene. In this fashion Synchronization Module guards against disparate imaging instances of time which may affect the precision of the detection results.

Significantly the ATR Module is responsible for evaluating and weighing the real time sensor results over disparate spectra. In a preferred embodiment the ATR Module employs a voting mechanism to reinforce or weaken an overall detection decision based on analysis of collaboration between individual sensor detections including but not limited to presence absence quantity magnitude location size and shape. This provides significantly increased Pd and reduced Pfa as well as processing the data as an aid to automated target tracking.

Combination of the imaging data and detection results is performed by the Display Output Module which displays the image displays from the plurality of sensors side by side on a display screen optionally including color or otherwise distinctive computer generated highlights indicative of the threat detected and maximally combining the image displays from the plurality of sensors using bilinear scaling and warping alpha blending and or other established image processing algorithms.

In a preferred embodiment the Output Module displays a fused interface whereby a plurality of sensor imagery is fused onto one image by the ATR Module . For example the Output Module may use a visible spectrum camera such as a CCTV video image camera to create a wide angle field of view image of the scene of interest.

Onto that image the Output Module overlays the bore sighted narrow field of view terahertz sensor millimeter wave sensor and or infrared sensor images in any combination. In this embodiment the operator views only one image and sees the results of the suite of sensors. Detections of threats can be shown as color icons or areas portrayed directly on the image of the person who poses the threat. The sensors are preferably deployed on pan and tilt units so that the operator or an automatic tracking program controlled by the ATR Module and Synchronization Module can control so as to continue to track the person of interest as the person moves throughout and beyond the current field of view.

The Output Module of the invention shows the images of the suite of sensors. In one embodiment the Output Module displays data from one to eight sensors on dual 19 screen monitors. As the operator moves the mouse cursor over an image that image may instantaneously expand e.g. by a factor of four in size and the controls for that sensor may be transferred to the operator s joystick and keyboard. The operator would be able to control the brightness contrast pan tilt and zoom of the chosen sensor.

In another embodiment the Output Module may create a new artificial image based on the analysis of the current multi spectral imagery. The artificial image would represent a significance selected compilation of imagery from the plurality of sensors combining the highest significance portions of each sensor imagery into a new artificially created image. For example terahertz imagery of a subject s upper torso triggered by a positive threat detection assessment from a terahertz sensor for a subject s upper torso would be combined with millimeter wave imagery of a subject s lower torso triggered by a positive threat detection assessment from a millimeter wave sensor for the subject s lower torso.

Optimally operators are trained to identify individuals who possess weapons or explosive devices. Alerts and threat levels generated by the ATR Module via the Display Output Module may be shown on the images and incorporated into the display which is always in the field of view of the operator.

Operator control of the ATR Module including but not limited to sensitivity adjustments and assessment of threat indications is performed by the User Input Module which communicates commands from the operator via keyboard mouse light pen track pad track ball or other input device.

In normal operation of the preferred embodiment the ATR Module and Synchronization Module cause the Display Output Module to display the combined imaging and threat detection information. For automatic target recognition operation the ATR Module activates an alarm output to signal the presence of a concealed threat. For aided target recognition operation the Display Output Module displays the imagery and or detection information to a trained operator who uses his or her judgment in combination with the inventive system to detect hidden threats.

Referring now to a flow chart of the ATR Module for one particular embodiment is disclosed and generally designated . Image capture algorithms capture imagery from the plurality of disparate sensors. In the illustrated example image capture algorithms capture and store the imagery from terahertz millimeter wave and infrared sensors respectively. Imagery is stored in an x y memory buffer of pixels.

Once the images are captured by image capture algorithms the imagery is evaluated by ATR algorithms respectively. The three separate algorithms allow for differing algorithms should they be required for the disparate image data. For instance an algorithm to detect threats using infrared imagery may be different than an algorithm to detect threats using terahertz imagery. The separate algorithms also accommodate differing image sizes aspect ratios zoom scaling ratios translation and or rotation and format differences amongst the sensor data.

Once the ATR algorithms evaluate the captured image data the Synchronization algorithms synchronize the imagery and ATR algorithm evaluation results allowing for possibly differing frame rates and integration times for the plurality of sensors. In one embodiment the Synchronization algorithms emulate sample and hold circuitry common in the field of analog circuitry design.

Once the imagery and ATR evaluation results have been synchronized by the Synchronization algorithms the results are evaluated in combination by the ATR post process algorithms . The ATR post process algorithms evaluate the combination of individual ATR results compiled by individual sensor ATR algorithms .

In one embodiment where the sensor ranges overlap the ATR post process algorithms utilize the simple polling scheme . Polling scheme adds the number of threat detections from the individual ATR algorithms . If the sum is 0 no threat is detected on any sensor and the person is deemed safe of threats. If the sum is 1 only a single sensor of the three sensors has detected a threat and the result is deemed a nuisance alarm increasing Pfa. If the sum is 2 two disparate sensors agree to the presence of a threat and an alarm is generated. If the sum is 3 all sensors agree to the presence of a threat generating a high alarm condition increasing Pd.

In another embodiment the Polling scheme is improved by comparing not just the presence of an alarm condition but additionally other germane factors such as alarm location on the body alarm size alarm intensity or any combination thereof.

In another embodiment the Polling scheme is improved by grouping similar sensor results. For example the imagery from both terahertz and millimeter wave sensors can penetrate clothing whilst infrared sensors cannot. Therefore agreement between terahertz and millimeter wave sensors is a significant event and cause for alarm concealed objects under clothing.

In yet another embodiment the Polling scheme is improved through recognition by one or more of the individual ATR algorithms of an innocuous object. Should this be observed the effected individual ATR algorithms would impart a negative effect on the holistic Polling scheme eliminating or reducing the significance of any positive detection results from the remaining ATR algorithm results.

Referring now to several examples of concealed threat detection algorithms are disclosed implemented in C . For example a first algorithm discloses counting the instances of image pixels outlying an acceptable gray scale range. A count exceeding a threshold setting causes the objectDetected flag to be set.

A second algorithm discloses summing the gray scale magnitudes of pixels outlying an acceptable gray scale range. A sum exceeding a threshold setting causes the objectDetected flag to be set.

A third algorithm discloses counting the instances of image pixels outlying an acceptable gradient limit. A count exceeding a threshold setting causes the objectDetected flag to be set.

Referring now to an example of concealed threat detection voting weighing algorithms are disclosed as implemented in C . The algorithms involve counting the instances of individual detection events as reported by the separate concealed threat detection algorithms for each spectrum s sensor namely terahertz millimeter wave and infrared. The sum of the algorithms detecting a concealed object indicates the detection alarm level on a scale of 0 none to 3 high alarm .

Also referring to an example of an alpha blending algorithm is disclosed as implemented in C . This algorithm may in one embodiment be used by the Display Module for combining the video outputs from the terahertz millimeter wave infrared and visible sensors into a single video display output.

Referring now to an example of slewing the sensors of a concealed threat detection system to a target of interest under surveillance of a spotter sensor is disclosed and generally designated . In another embodiment of the presently disclosed invention the sensor exhibiting the largest field of view and or depth of field can be utilized as a spotter sensor allowing the remaining sensors to automatically slew to movement within the spotter sensor s field of view under control of the ATR Module. Step determines if a target of interest is within the field of view of the spotter sensor. Once a target of interest is algorithmically detected step calculates the quadrant of the spotter sensor field of view occupied by the target. For remaining sensors equipped with electro mechanical pan Lilt stages in step the sensor is slewed to the relative direction indicated by the calculated quadrant of step . For remaining sensors that are fixed no pan tilt stage in step the quadrant occupied by the target calculated in is communicated to subsequent analysis algorithm s as the region of interest for the analysis.

This functionality can be implemented physically through addition of electro mechanical pan tilt stages attached to the non spotter sensors or algorithmically by directing the ATR evaluation module software described herein to evaluate the region of interest as directed by the target location determined by the ATR software using the spotter sensor or both.

Thus if a probability of detection is high the probability of false alarm is low and there is a high likelihood that an object e.g. concealed threat has been detected on a target.

Probability of false alarm This term is used herein to refer to the likelihood that an object has not been discovered identified or determined but an operator may be alerted of a contrast discrepancy anyway. Thus if a probability of false alarm is high the probability of detection is low and there is a low likelihood that an actual object e.g. concealed threat has been detected on a target.

Relative differences in contrast This term is used herein to refer to the discrepancy between a target image s overall contrast and contrast of any portion of the target s image. Thus relative differences in contrast can define image contrast changes if for example a sufficient discrepancy exists between a target image s overall contrast and the contrast of that target image s abdominal portion. If the contrast color gradient pixel values etc. of the abdominal portion are sufficiently different from the remainder of the target s body then an image contrast change may exist.

Slew This term is used herein to refer to rotate turn pivot or otherwise manipulate a device about its axis. Thus a sensor may be manually or automatically slewed to identify and or isolate a portion of a target s body to further analyze or ascertain the presence of a concealed threat.

Spotter sensor. This term is used herein to refer to a sensor of the plurality of sensors that exhibits that largest field of view and or depth. Thus a spotter sensor can provide a broader surveillance of the target and surroundings and if any image contrast change is detected the remainder of the plurality of sensors can be automatically or manually tilted to focus on that image contrast change.

Status This term is used herein to refer to a rank category or significance of a detected contrast change. Thus a contrast change can be given a status according to the number of sensors that detected that contrast change. The fewer the number and or types of sensors that detected the contrast change the lower status the contrast change may receive and vice versa.

Sum of pixels This term is used herein to refer to the number and type of pixels that may appear on a target s image or a portion thereof. The sum of pixels of a portion of a target s image may differ from the remainder of the target s image to the extent of indicating the presence of a concealed threat.

Threat level This term is used herein to refer to a ranking of danger of a target based on an automated or human analysis of any contrast changes detected on a target. Thus where a target is detected to have significant contrast changes the target may appear on a display with a relatively high threat level .

Concealed threat This term is used herein to refer to an anomalous signature underneath the clothing of or otherwise obscured within a target. Examples of concealed threats include but are not limited to hidden weapons bombs IEDs protective vests drugs and other objects that are terroristic illegal or otherwise indicate potential danger.

Threshold value This term is used herein to refer to a predetermined degree by which the contrast of a portion of a target s image may differ from the contrast of the remainder of the target s image. Thus for example if the gray scale pixel values of the abdominal region of a target s image differ from the acceptable range of gray scale pixel values of the remainder of the target s image by more than the threshold value the presence of a concealed threat may be indicated.

Time synchronized representation This term is used herein to refer to a single display or representation depicting a series of data that were produced at the same time at the same rate or in a time coordinated manner. Thus if three sensors each record a contrast change at the same time each recordation can be overlaid or harmonized into a time synchronized representation .

Variable This term is used herein to refer to anything that is subject to changing or marked by diversity or differences. For example an environment can be variable because it is subject to changes in that environment and that environment may differ from other environments suitable for embodiments of the current invention. In another example the distances at which sensors are disposed within an environment or target area may also be variable since each sensor can be disposed at a different distance.
