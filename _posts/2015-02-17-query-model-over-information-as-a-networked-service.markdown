This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 781 957 filed May 18 2010 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 313 184 filed on Mar. 12 2010 entitled QUERY MODEL OVER INFORMATION AS A NETWORKED SERVICE the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The subject disclosure relates to flexibly defining different queries over set s of data published by publishers to networked storage services for a variety of consumption options.

By way of background concerning some conventional systems computing devices have traditionally executed applications and data services locally to the device. Yet with the evolution of on line and cloud services applications and data services are increasingly being moved to network providers who perform some or all of a given service on behalf of devices. The evolution of network storage farms capable of storing terabytes of data with potential for petabytes exabytes etc. of data in the future has created an opportunity to mimic the local scenario in a cloud with separation of the primary device and the external storage.

The separation of the storage of the data from the data owners and publishers and as further separated from application developers and consumers of the data however creates issues that are not present where the data is represented unrestricted on a consumer s local device as in the past a situation that has concerned content owners due to potential compromise re distribution and unrestricted use of the data. However no cloud service or network storage provider has been able to effectively provide information as a service on any platform with publishers developers and consumers able to easily publish specialize apps for and consume any kind of data in a way that can be tracked and audited for all involved and such that publishers can be guaranteed restrictions on their content can be enforced. Moreover for content owners or publishers who have especially valuable data the concerns over controlling access to the data becomes even more important. Once relinquishing such valuable data to a networked storage service questions such as who gains access what kinds of queries are exposed to the consumers or developers are difficult to answer without proprietary custom solutions designed for the particular kind of data.

The above described deficiencies of today s networked storage services are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.

A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary non limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended however as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.

In certain embodiments a method for hosting data or connecting to hosted data can include receiving by a first computing device in a first region of control from a second computing device in a second region of control via a communication network a data set and analyzing the received data set to determine structural information associated with at least a subset of data of the received data set. The determined structural information includes one or more structural features associated with the received data set.

The method can also include transmitting the determined structural information to the second computing device in the second region of control via the communication network and in response to the transmission receiving input from the second computing device in the second region of control regarding a query capability to enforce over the received data set. The method can further include enforcing by the first computing device in the first region of control the query capability over the received data set based on the received input from the second computing device in the second region of control.

Other embodiments and various non limiting examples scenarios and implementations are described in more detail below.

As discussed in the background for content owners or publishers who have valuable data concerns over controlling access to the data abound for today s networked storage services. Today once relinquishing such valuable data to a networked storage service questions such as who gains access what kinds of queries are exposed to the consumers or developers etc. are difficult to answer without proprietary custom solutions designed for the particular kind of data.

In this regard for multi million dollar data sets such as Dun and Bradstreet s corporate information Lexis Nexis s online case law and news services etc. there is not a lot of flexibility in terms of giving users access to different stock keeping units SKUs for accessing the data or parts of the data by different users or classes of users. For this reason various subscription models have evolved which effectively either overbill consumers for underuse or under bill heavy consumers.

Accordingly in various embodiments publishers easily choose different SKUs for querying over the data published by the publishers and to automatically have query interfaces such as application programming interfaces APIs generated that correspond to the different SKUs. By controlling what structural information of the data is part of the search parameters and or search results of the query interfaces the publishers can control what data can be searched and what results are returned. As one of myriad examples and scenarios this makes possible an avid Sports reader consumer can view and pay for Sports content only of the Newspaper by the publisher creating a SKU for the Sports content only as part of a result set. Or alternatively a publisher can control which columns can be searched on for a given data set rather than allowing free and unrestricted reign over access to the underlying data e.g. preventing reconstruction of a valuable data set piece by piece on a consuming computer by denying searching over or return of results respecting a certain subset of the data . By enabling the creation of different SKUs for querying the data published in the context of information as a service pricing can be set variably and rather than constantly changing pricing models new SKUs can be created or old SKUs deleted in a flexible and straightforward manner. In this regard SKUs can also be aggregated where similarity of query exists. In addition based on the search criteria specified by publishers data can be automatically optimized on the back end for such searching e.g. creating indices over the search columns implicated by given search query SKUs.

Further details of these and other various exemplary non limiting embodiments and scenarios are provided below.

As mentioned in the context of information as a service in various embodiments a query model is provided for publishers to pick different columns of data to search on to create different search SKUs. For example for a table that has columns Name latitude longitude Credit an example of use of one or more embodiments described herein includes automatically creating a query API that takes business Name Credit as input and returns a latitude and longitude associated with the Name of the business e.g. Dun Bradstreet data . The results of such a SKU could be used to create a heat map of creditworthy businesses. An exemplary non limiting sequence for achieving this is illustrated in .

For instance as shown in the table of suppose a publisher wished to publish a valuable data set including columns for business name latitude longitude and credit but nonetheless retain control over how that data can be searched and which result sets can be returned based on search in order to maintain control rather than simply relinquishing the data set to the cloud for access by anyone. This problem is illustrated by the block diagram of wherein publishers wish to publish data set s to an infrastructure for providing information as a service but also wish to control the dissemination or search entry points into their data to developers or consumers .

In accordance with various embodiments as shown in publishers publishing data set s publish to information as a service but then also have access to a query definition model and interface component where by the publisher s can define different queries over the published data set s via interaction .

In one embodiment shown in the information as a service presents a query definition user interface based on an analysis of the published data set s to expose various structural bits of information about the data set. For instance in the present example of a table with name latitude longitude and credit a publisher can select the column names such as name and credit which can be used as part of a search predicate of a query for returning results. Similarly a publisher can specify return results information via the interface as shown in . For instance a publisher might specify that name latitude and longitude can be returned as part of query results from a search but not credit if all the information could be returned a user could recreate the table and cut out the publisher .

Then in accordance with a query generator based on the searchable information specified for a query and based on the query results return information a query API is automatically generated. For instance in the present example a query API or SKU could be defined as follows as also shown in 

In this regard a publisher can define any number of SKUs and define pricing for use of such SKUs accordingly e.g. consistent with the scope and value of the information being accessed. Pricing can also be made to depend on which entity is searching e.g. student or non profit entity v. profit entity . As shown in API of is shown as being used by developers on the one hand and consumers . As indicated different pricing can be implemented for use of the query API based on the auditing and transaction tracking capabilities e.g. as described in more detail below.

As mentioned the ability to let publishers easily choose different SKUs for querying over data and automatically create corresponding APIs that are optimized for the given storage of underlying data enables publishers to flexibly define how data is consumed. For instance an avid Sports reader who does not normally read the world news need only search for and pay for Sports content only of the Newspaper assuming such a SKU is made available. In addition SKUs can be aggregated and pricing can be set variably based on amount of use of queries or amount of data returned. In addition based on the search criteria specified by publishers data can be automatically optimized on the back end for such searching e.g. creating indices over the search columns.

In one embodiment a system for hosting data or connecting to hosted data published by publishers and consumed by consumers via queries includes an information service configured to receive at least one data set published by a publishing device and a query definition component configured to present structural information associated with at least one subset of data of the at least one data set determined by the information service and configured to receive at least one selection of input from the structural information to define at least one query capability for enforcement over the at least one data set by the information service.

The system can further include a query generator configured to generate a query interface in response to receiving the at least one selection of the input for querying over the at least one data set by at least one consuming device. The system can further include a query aggregator configured to combine the query interface with at least one other query interface. The query aggregator can be configured to combine the query interface with the at least one other query interface according to same or similar query definition based on a comparison of the query interface with the at least one other query interface.

The system can further include a query optimizer configured to optimize at least one data store storing the at least one data set in response to receiving the at least one selection of the input for optimization of querying over the at least one data set. The query definition component can be configured to present column information of the at least one data set determined by the information service from an analysis of the at least one data set.

At search parameter input is received from the computing device s in the second region of control defining first structural information of the structural information over which at least one authorized consuming device is authorized to search the data set s . At search result input is received from the computing device s in the second region of control defining second structural information of the structural information for which at least one authorized consuming device is authorized to receive results from the data set s . The method can be repeated to define any number of arbitrary queries over the data set s .

A query interface can be automatically generated based on the search parameter input and the search result input for at least one authorized consuming device to use to search the data set s according to query constraints defined by the search parameter input and the search result input. In addition the query interface can be combined with at least one other query interface according to same or similar search parameter input based on comparing the query interface with the at least one other query interface e.g. according to same or similar search results input based on comparing the query interface with the at least one other query interface.

Referring next to an exemplary API request over published data set s is illustrated according to an embodiment. As shown API request may include a header portion and a body portion . In an aspect header portion can include a developer key field a unique identifier field and a partner identifier field . For this embodiment it can be appreciated that unique identifier field may facilitate tracking multi seat API usage by including a unique identifier for multiple users. Furthermore with respect to partner identifier it can be appreciated that a null value can be specified indicating that no partner is affiliated with a particular API request.

In this regard as described with respect to above various data storage metadata can be stored and automatically updated as part of the publishing of data set s to optimize the execution of queries. In addition at publishing time the metadata associated with the data set s can be automatically updated to include a partner identifier field which can be used to match with queries respecting a given partner identifier applying to a given partner for purposes of tracking access to auditing etc. usage of the given partner s data set s . In this way if multiple partner s data set s are consumed by an API request from a developer consumer subscriber etc. all partner s can be given credit for applicable data access.

In additional embodiments a method for publishing data can comprise publishing by publishing computing device s in a first region of control to receiving computing device s in a second region of control data set s and interfacing to an interface generated by the receiving computing device s in the second region of control including information relating to structured information associated with the data set s based on an analysis of the data set s by the receiving computing device s . The method can further include selecting search result option s from the structured information for receiving results by the consuming device s in response to the searching with search parameter s . The interfacing can include interfacing to the interface including information relating to columns associated with the data set s .

The method can include transmitting the search result option s to the receiving device s for automatic generation of a query interface that returns search results based on the search result option s . The method can include selecting the search parameter s from the structured information for searching by consuming device s over the data set s based on the search parameter s . The method can include transmitting the search parameter s to the receiving device s for automatic generation of a query interface for querying over the data set s .

In other embodiments a method for hosting data or connecting to hosted data can include receiving by computing device s in a first region of control from computing device s in a second region of control via network s data set s published by the computing device s in the second region of control and analyzing the data set s to determine structural information associated with subset s of data of the data set s . The method can include rendering the structural information to the computing device s in the second region of control receiving input from the structural information regarding query capability ies to enforce over the data set s by the computing device s in the first region of control and in response to the receiving of the input automatically augmenting data storage metadata associated with the data set s .

The augmenting can include generating or augmenting index information associated with the data set s based on the input from the structural information. The augmenting can also include updating the data storage metadata to include partner identifier s associated with the data set s . The analyzing can include determining column information associated with the data set s .

The following description contains supplemental context regarding potential non limiting infrastructure architectures and or associated services to further aid in understanding one or more of the above embodiments. Any one or more of any additional features described in this section can be accommodated in any one or more of the embodiments described above with respect to flexibly defining different queries over set s of data published by publishers to networked storage services for a variety of consumption options. While such combinations of embodiments or features are possible for the avoidance of doubt no embodiments set forth in the subject disclosure are to be considered limiting on any other embodiments described herein.

By way of some additional background today while information can be obtained over networks such as the Internet today s offerings tend to the proprietary in terms of access and framework and are thus limited in terms of third party provider participation. For instance currently there is no adequate business model for commercial content providers to publish their data in a way that does not relinquish at least some of the value of such commercial content and thus historically owners of valuable content have tended to expose that content through limited proprietary means. Or in instances where storage of such content is provided by secure cloud storage providers there is little value in storage alone when a consumer must wade through thousands of tables to potentially find an item of interest. In addition even where cloud storage providers attempt to collect data from various providers at best such providers can boast a modest small or incomplete catalog of data.

Much of the stunting of potential growth in this area has been the result of mistrust over handling and IP e.g. copyrights . In short big players don t trust cloud providers with crown jewels because a single compromise can end the value of the data. In addition such cloud providers to date have had a weak position with respect to information workers who wish to extract value from such data for their informational needs and in addition due to the proprietary nature of such systems developers have thus far had limited ability to expand tools for developing informational capabilities.

Accordingly as described for one or more embodiments an infrastructure for information as a service is provided that accommodates all classes of individuals publishers developers information workers and consumers. The infrastructure enables information discovery e.g. the ability to discover acquire and consume structured and blob datasets to power any application on any platform and any form factor e.g. any screen size . The infrastructure further enables brokerage business e.g. a partner driven ecosystem and global reach to deliver data and functionality to developers and information workers. The infrastructure also allows analytics and reporting e.g. a single click analysis to augment private data with public data. In this regard due to the open nature of various implementations of the infrastructure any application developer can develop mobile cloud and or desktop applications to facilitate the publishing processing querying and or retrieval of data.

To write applications one can register for account information e.g. sign in with Live ID and be provided with an account key by which to access the blob via structured and real time web services enabled for the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein. In one aspect developers can explore the APIs visually before coding begins. For instance a service explorer module or set of modules can be used by developers to visually construct representational state transfer REST API queries and preview the content according to a variety of packages such as but not limited to extensible markup language XML ATOM RAW for blob and real time content or in a table view e.g. for structured data . For example a developer merely provides his or her account key and selects to preview the content.

Accordingly developers can build mobile desktop or service applications on any platform. While resulting REST queries can be copied into a new developer application the infrastructure for information as a service also enables the ability to consume automatically generated C proxy classes to eliminate any need to create a local object model or generate and understand the details of XML or web service code. In this regard in another non limiting beneficial aspect a developer can download the proxy classes and include them in the developer s applications to consume service data with as few as a couple lines of code.

In this regard the various embodiments of an infrastructure for information as a service allow developers and information workers to find acquire and consume data in their applications and analytics scenarios instantly periodically or over some other function of time specified by the application developer. As mentioned a developer obtains an account key which then accompanies web services calls to the network services enabling information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein for content requests and subscribing to the content of interest.

Thus in one aspect the account key provided by the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein is the developer s private key. This key enables billing and reporting on content used in connection with the developer s applications. As such this private developer key is not to be shared without purpose and precautions in securing the key can be taken where developing native applications running on mobile or desktop solutions and planning to integrate the key as part of the deployment. For example cryptographic storage can be used to ensure the key is not cracked.

In addition to the account key which is used to track the application consuming the content the unique user ID is a globally unique identifier GUID that represents the developer s individual users. This field allows billing for content that is priced on a per user basis programmatically. For example if a developer is developing a mobile application with an individual user consuming the application the developer can return the same GUID each time requests are made on behalf of that individual user. However if the developer is developing a web portal and issuing web service requests on behalf of a variety of users it is up to the developer to assign a new GUID for each unique user visiting the portal. For example each registered user can be assigned a GUID or each IP address port combination assigned a unique user ID GUID etc.

While REST APIs can be constructed on any platform to consume content from the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein in one embodiment proxy classes can be dynamically generated for services in C . Achieving this is a matter of downloading the object models adding them to the current developer project and updating the account and unique user values.

If a developer would like to issue requests manually an example is provided below but for any service the preview function can be used or the URLs created from the Service Explorer can be invoked as well. An exemplary non limiting REST query to a sample dataset is illustrated below. It is noted that some or all calls can be secure socket layer SSL secured.

The accountKey and uniqueUserId elements are also placed in the header of the request which appears as follows for example 

The value in accountKey represents the developer s account key found in the Accounts Tab and the value in uniqueUserID represents the GUID for the unique user accessing the service.

Accordingly the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein is a new service or framework allowing developers and information workers to easily discover purchase and manage premium data subscriptions in any platform. The infrastructure is an information marketplace that brings data imagery and real time web services from leading commercial data providers and authoritative public data sources as well as non authoritative publishers together into a single or multiple locations that are unified under a common provisioning and billing framework. Additionally developers and information workers can consume this premium content with virtually any platform application or business workflow.

Some exemplary non limiting scenarios for using the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein include a finding premium content to next generation killer apps for consumer and business scenarios b discovering and licensing valuable data to improve existing applications or reports c bringing disparate data sets together in innovative ways to gain new insight into business performance and processes e.g. aggregation algorithms d instantly and visually exploring APIs across all content providers for blob structured and real time web services and e consuming third party data inside existing applications and data base systems such as existing word processing spreadsheet database query systems etc. for rich reporting and analytics.

Benefits for developers include a trial subscriptions allow content to be investigated and applications to be developed without paying data royalties b simple transaction and subscription models allow pay as you go or grow access to multi million dollar datasets c consistent REST based APIs across datasets facilitate development on any platform d visually building and exploring APIs previewing results and e automatic C proxy classes provide instant object models and eliminate the need to write tedious XML and web service code.

Benefits for Information Workers include a integration with PowerPivot to easily work with data in existing spreadsheet software such as but not limited to Excel b simple predictable licensing models for acquiring content and c the ability to consume data from SQL Server SQL Azure Database and other pre existing assets.

Benefits for Content Partners include a easy publication and onboarding process regardless of blob data structured data or dynamic web services b developer tooling on the selected platform to ease development e.g. via Visual Studio and .NET or other runtime system development c exposing developer content to global developer and information worker community d content discovery and integration inside pre existing content consumption applications and e a scalable cloud computing platform handles storage delivery billing and reporting on behalf of all parties.

In a non limiting implementation of the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein some features for Rich Web Services include a secure REST based model for consuming services across the entire content catalog b dynamic pagination built into the APIs to simplify access c Standard ATOM 1.0 feeds are available for most of the services and d consistent billing provisioning and usage reporting across all services.

In a non limiting implementation of the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein some features for a Service Explorer component include a C proxy classes generated to simplify development b preview of data in tabular form and as a feed such as an ATOM 1.0 feed if supported c invocation of the service to understand the results that the compiled service call returns d discovery of documentation and sample values for each of the parameters and e instant copying of the visually built URL for a service call into clipboard to ease development.

In a non limiting implementation of the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein some features for a Marketplace Integration and Discovery Portal component include a discovery of new data across domains including consumers and businesses b management of service subscriptions and usage limits c management of account keys to access the services and d detailed access reporting containing the services datasets that were accessed grouped by date and by account key.

The infrastructure provides a variety of value propositions for content owners application developers ISVs and for information workers and other consumers subscribers. For content owners the infrastructure enables monetization from data for data providers who charge for the data in addition to social benefits for data providers who do not charge for data but derive benefit from the publication of such data in other ways. Due to the openness of the infrastructure content owners enjoy greater availability and reach of data to ISVs and consumers information workers and all of this comes at a lower cost particularly over developing a proprietary model as in the past.

For application developers ISVs the infrastructure enables access to data in a consistent format variable and low cost pricing model for data access. predictable pricing profit potential from consumers IWs using the applications built using the data broader reach to consumers through any platform and a single billing and data source

For information workers consumers the infrastructure enables added value from applications consumption of data in current large object LOB or IW software a variable and low cost pricing model for data access in addition to a single billing and data source.

Accordingly the infrastructure solves a current customer and developer pain point with a potentially significant revenue upside creates unique business intelligence opportunities attached with instant data for modeling reporting analysis and trending and creates adoption and stickiness for any platform by encouraging data owners to store their data via the infrastructure thereby differentiating the infrastructure s value proposition when compared with conventional cloud storage environments.

As shown in the flow diagram of at described herein are various ways for content owners or publishers to publish data via the infrastructure. At there are a variety of tools that allow developers to developer applications for consuming the data via the infrastructure. At consumers or information workers use the applications or can directly query over the data to consume the data. Lastly the infrastructure provides a rich variety of tools at that enable automatic administration auditing billing etc. on behalf of all parties in the content chain enabled by the transaction model.

In this regard some key parties in the infrastructure include data owners the application developers ISVs and the consumers information workers. In general data owners are entities who want to charge for data or who want to provide data for free for other reasons or enforce other conditions over the data. In turn application developers ISVs are entities who want to monetize their application e.g. through advertising direct payments indirect payments etc. or provide their application for free for some beneficial reason to such entities. Information workers and consumers are those who can use the raw data or those who want to use an application provided by the application developers.

In this regard various embodiments for the user friendly data platform for enabling information as a service from any platform is an infrastructure to enable consumers of data IWs developers ISVs and consumers of data to transact in a simple cost effective and convenient manner. The infrastructure democratizes premium private and community public data in an affordable way to allow IWs to draw insights rapidly allows developers to build innovative apps using multiple sources of data in a creative manner and enables developers to monetize their efforts on any platform. For instance the infrastructure supports Pay Per Use as well as Subscription Pricing for Content Pay for Content retail price set by content owner Pay Data Fee Shipping and Handling and BW and further supports Data fees as a brokerage fee on a per logical transaction basis per report per API per download etc. .

For Information Workers e.g. Office SQL Server Dynamics users the infrastructure supports subscriptions to allow for future EA integration as well as predictable spend characteristics as well as caching to support on and off premise BI as well as HPC workloads . Thus alternatives include content priced per user per month which may or may not bundle to deliver content packs or per transaction pricing e.g. allowing cloud reporting business intelligence on demand pricing to eliminate the need to move large amounts of data while allowing per usage pricing or vertical apps via report galleries.

For content providers any data type any cloud using any platform the infrastructure becomes a value proposition to incent sales within any particular desired platform auto scaling higher level SLA possibilities at no additional cost. For some non limiting examples data can be secure and associated data in the following domains Location aware services data Commercial and residential real estate Financial data and services etc. A non limiting scenario may include delivery of data to top non governmental organization NGO datasets. In addition the infrastructure may include the ability to showcase BI visualization through Bing for information as a service HPC etc. Vertical application opportunities exist as well.

In one non limiting embodiment the data brokerage can be analogized to conventional brick and mortar strategies For instance capacity can be represented as shelf space e.g. a mix of structured and unstructured blob data cost of goods COGS can be represented as square footage SA platform dependency bandwidth and content can be represented as merchandise e.g. optimize content providers to cover COGS maximize profits from IWs and developers . In various embodiments an onboarding process can be implemented with quality bars for data and services as well as accommodation of service level agreements SLAs .

As supplemental services to the data billing and discovery services can include online billing e.g. MOCP or discovery services e.g. pinpoint and authentication services can include credentials management e.g. Live ID or content authentication e.g. authenticated content services ACS . Accounts services can include logging audit services or account management . Management and operations services can include an operations dashboard service and network operations service e.g. Gomez.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that network interactions and information services may be practiced with a variety of computer system configurations and protocols. In this regard one non limiting implementation for querying and updating data that can be used in one or more embodiments described herein is the Open Data Protocol OData .

OData is a web protocol for querying and updating data. OData applies web technologies such as HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Atom Publishing Protocol AtomPub and JavaScript Object Notation JSON to provide access to information from a variety of applications services and stores. For some general background OData emerged organically based on the experiences implementing AtomPub clients and servers in a variety of products over the past several years. OData can be used to expose and access information from a variety of sources including but not limited to relational databases file systems content management systems and traditional web sites. OData has been released under the Open Specification Promise OSP to allow anyone to freely interoperate with OData implementations in order to encourage growth of the ecosystem. Features of OData can be incorporated into other protocols as well to form hybrid protocols with similar functionality for querying and updating network data.

OData is consistent with the way the web works. In one aspect OData uses universal resource identifiers URIs as a way to identify resources and uses an HTTP centric protocol with a uniform interface for interacting with those resources e.g. similar to the way that the Internet works. In one non limiting aspect OData builds on the conventions over HTTP popularized by AtomPub which have simplified the process of sharing data content and information across independently developed systems. OData defines additional conventions that implementations may optionally implement to support basic query and schema information to be exchanged. To simplify integration with HTML and JavaScript clients OData defines an optional JSON representation of the protocol that complements the XML based AtomPub format. As one can appreciate additional implementation specific or other details regarding the OData protocol can be found at www.odata.org.

One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that the various embodiments of methods and devices for an infrastructure for information as a service from any platform and related embodiments described herein can be implemented in connection with any computer or other client or server device which can be deployed as part of a computer network or in a distributed computing environment and can be connected to any kind of data store. In this regard the various embodiments described herein can be implemented in any computer system or environment having any number of memory or storage units and any number of applications and processes occurring across any number of storage units. This includes but is not limited to an environment with server computers and client computers deployed in a network environment or a distributed computing environment having remote or local storage.

Each object etc. and computing objects or devices etc. can communicate with one or more other computing objects or devices etc. and computing objects or devices etc. by way of the communications network either directly or indirectly. Even though illustrated as a single element in network may comprise other computing objects and computing devices that provide services to the system of and or may represent multiple interconnected networks which are not shown. Each computing object or device etc. or etc. can also contain an application such as applications that might make use of an API or other object software firmware and or hardware suitable for communication with or implementation of an infrastructure for information as a service from any platform as provided in accordance with various embodiments.

There are a variety of systems components and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example computing systems can be connected together by wired or wireless systems by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently many networks are coupled to the Internet which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks though any network infrastructure can be used for exemplary communications made incident to the techniques as described in various embodiments.

Thus a host of network topologies and network infrastructures such as client server peer to peer or hybrid architectures can be utilized. In a client server architecture particularly a networked system a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer e.g. a server. In the illustration of as a non limiting example computing objects or devices etc. can be thought of as clients and computing objects or devices etc. can be thought of as servers where computing objects or devices etc. provide data services such as receiving data from computing objects or devices etc. storing of data processing of data transmitting data to computing objects or devices etc. although any computer can be considered a client a server or both depending on the circumstances. Any of these computing devices may be processing data or requesting services or tasks that may implicate an infrastructure for information as a service from any platform and related techniques as described herein for one or more embodiments.

A server is typically a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network such as the Internet or wireless network infrastructures.
