The following description was made in the performance of official duties by employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the claimed invention may be manufactured used licensed by or for the United States Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The following description relates generally to a lightweight armor with a slide region and a receiving region and in particular the lightweight armor is designed so that the slide region slidably redirects projectiles towards the receiving region where the projectiles are stopped.

Military vehicles are subject to attack from high velocity projectiles including sharply pointed bullets and fragments. The projectiles can penetrate vehicles and cause serious injury or death to the occupants thereof. Thus these vehicles require armor to protect against these types of attacks. In addition to military vehicles other vehicles which require armor protection include for example limousines commercial armored cars and other non military vehicles used for transporting people or high value cargo.

Over the years various forms of armor have been developed to provide protection to both the vehicles and the occupants. When developing a specific armor consideration must be given to the type or types of projectile and energetic force against which the armor must provide protection. Consideration must also be given to the effectiveness of the overall armor system in protecting against multiple threats. Further consideration must be given to the weight of the armor system and to the practicality of use of the armor in view of its weight. To this end consideration must also be given to the material that is used for the armor.

Currently armor piercing and other high velocity rounds are defeated by thick high strength steel armor with or without angled perforations ceramics high strength fabrics or combinations of the same. A new component has been added more recently i.e. highly rate sensitive polymers. This material has been of interest in resisting penetration by fragments but is not very effective against sharply pointed bullets that tend to pierce through it. It is desired to have an armor system that is lightweight that protects against multiple threats such as fragments and sharply pointed bullets.

In one aspect the invention is a lightweight armor assembly for resisting penetration by both fragments and high velocity sharply pointed projectiles. In this aspect the lightweight armor assembly includes a structure having a substantially sinusoidal profile in an X Y coordinate reference system. The substantially sinusoidal profile has a plurality of slide regions for slidably redirecting high velocity projectiles. Each slide region has a substantially V shaped protrusion elongated in the Y direction having an apex and a base. According to the invention each substantially V shaped protrusion includes a backing material having a thickness t and a polyurea coating over the light weight material. The polyurea coating has a thickness t with the polyurea coating being converted to a lubricated slide surface when contacted by said high velocity projectiles. The substantially sinusoidal profile also has a plurality of receiving regions for receiving and stopping high velocity projectiles either redirected from the sliding region or emanating from another source. Each receiving region has a substantially flat lateral section having a thickness T thicker than the backing material thickness t the substantially flat lateral section extending in the X direction between the substantially V Shaped protrusions and contacting each substantially V shaped protrusion at a respective base.

The substantially V shaped protrusions are the structures that make up the slide regions and the substantially flat lateral sections are the structures that make up the receiving regions . Each substantially V shaped protrusion has a backing material . This backing material may be cast armor high hard steel aluminum Ti 6Al 4V titanium alloy a composite or any other known material used as armor or combinations thereof. As outlined below this backing material is relatively thin as compared to other portions of the assembly and therefore contributes to an overall reduction in the weight of the armor assembly . The backing material is known to be used to resist penetration by fragments but not as effective against high velocity projectiles such as sharply pointed bullets.

Each substantially V shaped protrusion also includes a polyurea coating over the backing material . When bombarded with high impact and high velocity projectiles polyurea converts to a transient liquid phase. This physical characteristic is used to provide the sliding feature of the slide region . Thus when the protrusions are impacted by high velocity projectiles instead of penetrating into the surface the projectiles tend to slide off as facilitated by the lubricated effect of the transient liquid polyurea.

As stated above in addition to the substantially V shaped protrusions the substantially sinusoidal profile of the lightweight armor assembly also includes substantially flat lateral sections which is the structure of the plurality of receiving regions for receiving and stopping high velocity projectiles. In operation the receiving region sees projectiles either slidably redirected from the slide region or projectiles making contact without first striking the slide region . The substantially flat lateral section may be made from high strength thickened steel Ti 6Al 4V titanium alloy 7075 T6 Aluminum or other metals or composites known to be used for armor or combinations thereof. It should be noted that the substantially flat lateral section may be made from the same material as the backing material although not as thin as the backing material .

As outlined above each slide region includes a substantially V shaped protrusion having a lightweight backing material and a polyurea coating . When the high velocity sharply pointed projectile strikes the protrusion instead of penetrating into the surface the projectile slides downwards. Under the impact of the high velocity projectile the polyurea coating converts to a transient liquid phase which essentially lubricates the surface thereby causing the projectile to slide downwards. Without the coating the high velocity sharply pointed projectile would probably penetrate into the backing material but the coating in combination with the backing material slidably redirects the projectile .

As shown in at position in the projectile is slidably redirected off axis i.e. rotated to a new angle with respect to its original angular orientation after contacting the protrusion with the polyurea coating liquefying and having a lubricating effect. The projectile is redirected towards the receiving region . As shown the high velocity sharply pointed projectile at position impacts the substantially flat lateral section of the receiving region . Now that the high velocity sharply pointed projectile is off axis it is more likely to be stopped by the high strength material of the substantially flat lateral section . Although only shows the path of a single high velocity sharply pointed projectile the operation of the lightweight armor assembly is consistent with the illustration of even though the angle of initial impact with the coating may vary. Essentially the projectiles slide upon impact with coating and are redirected off axis towards the receiving area where the projectiles are stopped.

It should also be noted that the lightweight armor assembly resists penetration by both high velocity sharply pointed projectiles and fragments. The illustration of shows how the assembly resists high velocity sharply pointed projectiles. Both the slide region with the lightweight backing material and the receiving region with the high strength material of the substantially flat lateral section are also know for resisting fragments. Thus the assembly is effective at protecting against both fragments and high velocity sharply pointed projectiles.

As outlined above each substantially V shaped protrusion includes the polyurea coating over the backing material which may be steel aluminum composite or any other material known for being used as lightweight armor. Each substantially flat lateral section may be made from high strength steel or the like. It should be noted that the specific thicknesses T t and t as well as apex angle and matching base angles as outlined above are also applicable to the embodiment of . Thus for example the backing material thickness t may be about inches to about inches and the polyurea coating thickness tmay be about 1 16 inches

In operation the corrugated plate armor assembly works as outlined above with respect to . Thus the substantially V shaped protrusions of the slide region includes the lightweight backing material as well as the polyurea coating . When the high velocity sharply pointed projectile strikes the protrusion instead of penetrating into the surface the projectile slides downwards and is redirected in an off axis orientation towards the receiving region at which point the projectile is stopped. As noted above with respect to the profile of the corrugated plate armor assembly includes backing material and high strength material of section which are known for resisting fragments. Thus the assembly is effective at protecting against both fragments and high velocity sharply pointed projectiles.

As outlined above each substantially V shaped protrusion i.e. each right circular cone includes the polyurea coating over the backing material which may be steel aluminum composite or any other material known for being used as lightweight armor. Each substantially flat lateral section may be made from high strength steel or the like. Again it should be noted that the specific thicknesses T t and t as outlined above are also applicable to lightweight 3 dimensional armor assembly . Thus for example the backing material thickness t may be about inches to about inches and the polyurea coating thickness tmay be about 1 16 inches to about inches. Regarding the angles the apex angle is the angle at the vertex of the cone and the base angle is the angle a slanted side S makes with the base. As stated above may be about 30 degrees to about 60 degrees. According to a specific embodiment is about 45 degrees or less.

In operation the lightweight 3 dimensional armor assembly works as outlined above with respect to . Thus when a high velocity sharply pointed projectile strikes the cone instead of penetrating into the surface the projectile slides downwards and is redirected in an off axis orientation towards the receiving region at which point the projectile is stopped. As noted above with respect to the profile of the lightweight 3 dimensional armor assembly includes backing material and high strength material of section which are known for resisting fragments. Thus the assembly is effective at protecting against both fragments and high velocity sharply pointed projectiles.

As shown shows the substantially V shaped protrusions having holes . At the area surrounding these holes ridges are formed. Because of the close similarities between the assembly of and assembly of both assemblies act similarly to protect against projectiles. Thus in the lightweight armor assembly when a high velocity sharply pointed projectile strikes the surface in the slide region the polyurea coating converts to a transient liquid phase thereby causing the projectile to slide off the surface redirecting it downwards towards the receiving region . When projectiles both high velocity sharply pointed and fragments strike the ridges the impact may fragment the projectiles. The impact may also redirect fragments turning them off axis in a more dramatic way as compared to when striking the surface as outlined with respect to . The redirected projectiles fragments are directed towards the receiving region were they stopped at the thickened section .

The embodiment of is essentially the lightweight corrugated plate armor assembly with the inclusion of the holes and ridges . Like elements are labelled accordingly and operate similarly. Thus in addition to operating to stop projectiles as described above in reference to the holes and ridges shown in also fragment and redirect projectiles towards the receiving region were they stopped at the substantially flat lateral section .
