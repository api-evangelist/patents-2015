The present invention relates generally to quantum and classical digital superconducting circuits and specifically to Josephson current source systems and method.

Superconducting digital technology has provided computing and or communications resources that benefit from unprecedented high speed low power dissipation and low operating temperature. Superconducting digital technology has been developed as an alternative to CMOS technology and typically comprises superconductor based single flux quantum superconducting circuitry utilizing superconducting Josephson junctions and can exhibit typical power dissipation of less than 1 nW nanowatt per active device at a typical data rate of 20 Gb s gigabits second or greater and can operate at temperatures of around 4 Kelvin. Certain superconducting circuits in which Josephson junctions are the active devices can require a DC current bias of the Josephson junctions. Typical systems can provide the DC bias current directly using a bias resistor network which can result in spurious magnetic fields and heat resulting from high power dissipation. The power budget in such circuits can be dominated by static power consumption which can be dissipated in the bias resistor network whether or not the active device is switching.

One embodiment describes a Josephson current source system. The system includes a flux shuttle loop comprising a plurality of stages arranged in a series loop. Each of the plurality of stages includes at least one Josephson junction. The flux shuttle loop can be configured when activated to sequentially trigger the Josephson junctions in each of the plurality of stages about the flux shuttle loop in response to an inductively coupled AC clock signal to generate a DC output current provided through an output inductor. The system also includes a flux injector system that is configured to activate the flux shuttle loop. The flux injector system is further configured to automatically deactivate the flux shuttle loop in response to an amplitude of the DC output current increasing to a predetermined deactivation threshold.

Another embodiment includes a method for generating a DC output current. The method includes providing an AC clock signal through a primary inductor of a clock transformer. The clock transformer includes a secondary inductor arranged in a loop with at least two of a plurality of stages of a flux shuttle loop. The plurality of stages can be arranged in a series sequential loop. The method further includes providing a DC injection signal to a flux injector system to generate a single flux quantum SFQ pulse at one of the plurality of stages. The SFQ pulse can be propagated through the plurality of stages to generate current steps in an output inductor to generate a DC output current based on a sequential triggering of a Josephson junction in each of the plurality of stages. The flux injector system can be configured to automatically deactivate and reactivate the flux shuttle loop based on an amplitude of the DC output current relative to an amplitude of the DC injection signal.

Another embodiment describes a flux shuttle loop comprising a first stage a second stage a third stage and a fourth stage arranged in a series loop. Each of the first second third and fourth stages includes at least one Josephson junction. The flux shuttle loop can be configured when activated to sequentially trigger the Josephson junction in each of the first second third and fourth stages about the flux shuttle loop in response to an inductively coupled AC clock signal comprising an in phase component and a quadrature phase component that are out of phase by approximately 90 . The system also includes a first storage inductor that is associated with the first and third stages and is configured to receive a current step associated with the sequential triggering of the Josephson junction in each of the first and third stages. The system also includes a second storage inductor that is associated with the second and fourth stages and is configured to receive a current step associated with the sequential triggering of the Josephson junction in each of the second and fourth stages. The system also includes an output inductor coupled to each of the first and second storage inductors and being configured to provide a DC output current in response to the current step provided via each of the first and second storage inductors. The system further includes a flux injector system that is configured to activate the flux shuttle loop and is further configured to automatically deactivate and reactivate the flux shuttle loop based on an amplitude of the DC output current.

The present invention relates generally to quantum and classical digital superconducting circuits and specifically to Josephson current source systems and method. The Josephson current source includes a flux shuttle loop comprising a plurality of stages that are arranged in a series loop. Each of the stages can be arranged as a superconducting quantum interference device SQUID and thus includes at least one Josephson junction. The Josephson current source also includes a set of clock transformers and bias transformers a set of storage inductors that are each associated with at least one of the stages and an output inductor configured to provide a DC output current. The clock transformers are configured to inductively couple an AC clock signal to the flux shuttle loop such that the AC clock signal provides a bias current in the flux shuttle loop. The Josephson current source also includes a flux injector system. For example at initialization the flux injector system can be configured to inject a single flux quantum SFQ pulse to activate the flux shuttle loop based on the SFQ pulse propagating through each of the stages about the flux shuttle loop. Thus when the flux shuttle is activated the Josephson junction s in each of the stages triggers to sequentially propagate the SFQ pulse around the flux shuttle loop based on the frequency of the AC clock signal. As an example the SFQ pulse can propagate through a given stage at a positive or at a negative cycle of the AC clock signal. The SFQ pulse is provided to the storage inductor associated with the respective stage to provide a current step to the output inductor in response to a voltage pulse generated at the respective stage such that the output inductor provides the DC output current based on the voltage pulses provided from each stage at each positive and negative cycles of the AC clock signal.

As an example the AC clock signal can be a quadrature clock signal including an in phase portion and a quadrature phase portion and the flux shuttle loop can include four stages. A primary inductor of a first clock transformer can propagate the in phase portion of the AC clock signal and a secondary inductor of the first clock transformer can be arranged in series with the first and third stages. Similarly a primary inductor of a second clock transformer can propagate the quadrature portion of the AC clock signal and a secondary inductor of the second clock transformer can be arranged in series with the second and fourth stages. Therefore the first stage and the second stage are set from a first flux state to a second flux state via the first clock transformer and the second clock transformer respectively in response to an SFQ pulse that is propagated in each of a first cycle e.g. positive cycle of the in phase component and the quadrature phase component respectively of the AC clock signal and are reset from the second flux state to the first flux state in response to the SFQ pulse propagated in each of a second cycle e.g. negative cycle of the in phase component and the quadrature phase component respectively of the AC clock signal. Similarly the third stage and the fourth stage are set from the second flux state to the first flux state via the first and second clock transformers respectively in response to the SFQ pulse propagated in each of the second cycle of the in phase component and the quadrature phase component respectively of the AC clock signal and are reset from the first flux state to the second flux state in response to the SFQ pulse propagated in each of the first cycle of the in phase component and the quadrature phase component respectively of the AC clock signal.

In addition the flux injector system is configured to automatically deactivate and reactivate the flux shuttle loop based on the amplitude of the DC output current. As an example the flux injector system can form a portion of the first stage and can receive a DC injection signal that is inductively coupled to the flux injector system. Thus the DC injection signal can generate an injection current in the flux injector system having an amplitude that can set an activation threshold and a deactivation threshold for the DC output signal. For example the DC output signal can be inductively coupled to the flux injector system to provide a feedback current having a current direction that is opposite the injection current. Therefore in response to the feedback current and thus the DC output current increasing greater than the deactivation threshold the first stage has a flux that is less than sufficient to trigger the respective Josephson junction to maintain propagation of the SFQ pulse through the flux shuttle loop thus automatically deactivating the flux shuttle loop. Accordingly the flux shuttle loop maintains a deactivated quiescent state that consumes approximately zero power. Upon the DC output current decreasing less than an activation threshold such as in response to being consumed by an associated circuit device the flux in the first stage increases sufficiently to trigger the respective Josephson junction thus automatically reactivating the flux shuttle loop to begin increasing the DC output current. Accordingly the Josephson current source can activate and deactivate autonomously to meet current consumption demands in a more efficient manner.

The superconducting circuit system also includes a Josephson current source that is configured to generate the DC output current Iin response to an AC clock signal CLK that can correspond to a clock signal associated with the Josephson current source . As an example the clock signal CLK can be a sinusoidal waveform having a substantially constant frequency e.g. approximately 5 GHz or 10 GHz and an AC current magnitude such as applicable to reciprocal quantum logic RQL superconducting circuits e.g. approximately 2 mA RMS . The Josephson current source is demonstrated as receiving a DC injection signal INJ that can be provided to the Josephson current source to activate the Josephson current source to generate the DC output current I. Additionally as described in greater detail herein the DC injection signal INJ can set a magnitude for at least one threshold for automatic deactivation and reactivation of the Josephson current source .

In the example of the Josephson current source includes a flux shuttle loop . The flux shuttle loop can include a plurality of stages that are configured to propagate a single flux quantum SFQ pulse i.e. fluxon around the flux shuttle loop based on the frequency of the clock signal CLK. As described herein the term propagate with respect to an SFQ pulse describes an SFQ pulse being generated via the triggering of a Josephson junction in a given stage of the flux shuttle loop such that the voltage of the SFQ pulse combined with a bias voltage e.g. via the clock signal CLK causes a Josephson junction of the next stage in the flux shuttle loop to generate another SFQ pulse and so on. As described herein the term loop with respect to the flux shuttle loop describes a substantially continuous series loop e.g. circular arrangement of the stages of the flux shuttle loop such that a last stage can be coupled to a first stage. Therefore the SFQ pulse can substantially continuously propagate around the flux shuttle loop upon activation of the flux shuttle loop . Additionally as described herein the term propagate around the flux shuttle loop with respect to an SFQ pulse describes an SFQ pulse being separately generated in each stage of the flux shuttle loop such that an SFQ pulse generated in one stage propagates to the next stage to generate another SFQ pulse such that at a given phase of the AC clock signal CLK an SFQ pulse propagates from one stage to the next in a sequential manner in each of the stages of the flux shuttle loop .

As an example the Josephson current source also includes a set of clock transformers and bias transformers a set of storage inductors that are each associated with at least one of the stages of the flux shuttle loop and an output inductor configured to provide the DC output current I. The clock transformers are configured to inductively couple the AC clock signal CLK to the flux shuttle loop such that the AC clock signal CLK provides a bias current in the flux shuttle loop . The Josephson current source also includes a flux injector system . For example at initialization the flux injector system can be configured to inject an SFQ pulse to activate the flux shuttle loop based on the SFQ pulse propagating through each of the stages about the flux shuttle loop . Thus when the flux shuttle loop is activated the Josephson junction s in each of the stages triggers to propagate the SFQ pulse around the flux shuttle loop based on the frequency of the AC clock signal CLK. As an example the SFQ pulse can propagate through a given stage at each positive or at each negative cycle of the AC clock signal CLK. The SFQ pulse is provided to the storage inductor associated with the respective stage to provide a current step to the output inductor such that the output inductor provides the DC output current based on the voltage pulses provided from each stage at each positive and negative cycles of the AC clock signal. Therefore the DC output current Ican flow through the output inductor based on the current steps being sequentially provided to the output inductor based on the frequency of the clock signal CLK. For example the current steps can be generated based on the SFQ pulses providing a small voltage e.g. approximately 2 V GHz to each of the storage inductors such that the resulting voltage pulses can be integrated in the output inductor to provide the DC output current I.

In addition the flux injector system includes a feedback control mechanism that is configured to automatically deactivate and reactivate the flux shuttle loop based on an amplitude of the DC output current I. For example the flux injector system can form a portion of the first stage of the flux shuttle loop . As an example the flux injector system can include inductive coupling of each of the DC output current Iand the DC injection signal INJ to provide a feedback current and an injection current respectively having opposite current directions in the flux injector system . Therefore in response to the feedback current and thus the DC output current I increasing greater than a deactivation threshold the first stage of the flux shuttle loop has a flux that is less than sufficient to trigger the respective Josephson junction to maintain propagation of the SFQ pulse through the flux shuttle loop thus automatically deactivating the flux shuttle loop . Accordingly the flux shuttle loop maintains a deactivated quiescent state that consumes approximately zero power. Upon the DC output current Idecreasing less than an activation threshold such as in response to being consumed by the circuit device the flux in the first stage of the flux shuttle loop increases sufficiently to trigger the respective Josephson junction thus automatically reactivating the flux shuttle loop to begin increasing the DC output current I. The Josephson current source can therefore operate to generate the DC output current Iin a power efficient manner. As an example the Josephson current source can generate substantially no heat from static power dissipation as opposed to typical resistance based DC current sources. Accordingly the Josephson current source can operate more efficiently and effectively than typical current sources particularly in a quantum computing and energy efficient high performance computing environments based on the automatic deactivation of the flux injector system in response to the DC output current Ibeing sufficiently high to meet the current bias demands of the circuit device . In addition as described in greater detail herein the amplitude of the DC injection signal INJ can set at least one of the activation and deactivation thresholds for automatic deactivation and reactivation the flux shuttle loop .

Each of the stages and are each substantially configured in a SQUID arrangement with the stages and being substantially similarly with respect to each other. In the example of the first stage includes a first Josephson junction J a second Josephson junction J an inductor L and an inductor L. The second stage includes a first Josephson junction J a second Josephson junction J an inductor L and an inductor L. The third stage includes a first Josephson junction J a second Josephson junction J an inductor L and an inductor L. The fourth stage includes a first Josephson junction J a second Josephson junction J an inductor L and an inductor L. Additionally the Josephson current source includes a flux injector system that forms part of the first stage and is configured during initialization to inject an SFQ pulse into the flux shuttle loop . As an example the flux injector system can have a self series inductance that is different from the other stages and . The first stage is separated from the second stage by an inductor L and the second stage and the third stage are separated by an inductor L. The third stage and the fourth stage are separated by an inductor L and the fourth stage is separated from the first stage by an inductor L. Therefore the SFQ pulse that is generated by the flux injector system can circulate through the flux shuttle loop in the loop formed by the stages and .

The Josephson current source also includes a pair of clock transformers that are each associated with a pair of the stages and . In the example of the clock transformers include a first clock transformer Tthat is associated with the first stage and the third stage and a second clock transformer Tthat is associated with the second stage and the fourth stage . Additionally the Josephson current source includes a first bias transformer Tthat is likewise associated with the first and third stages and and second bias transformer Tthat is likewise associated with the second and fourth stages and .

The clock transformer Tincludes a primary inductor Lthrough which the in phase component CLKflows and the clock transformer Tincludes a primary inductor Lthrough which the quadrature phase component CLKflows. In addition the bias transformers Tand Tinclude respective primary inductors Land Lthrough which a DC bias signal BIAS flows. The clock transformer Tprovides inductive coupling of the in phase component CLKto the first stage e.g. via the flux injector system as described in greater detail herein and the third stage via a secondary inductor Lthat is arranged in series with a secondary inductor Lof the first bias transformer T e.g. coupled between the inductors Land Land the inductors Land L . Similarly the clock transformer Tprovides inductive coupling of the quadrature phase component CLKto the second stage and the fourth stage via a secondary inductor Lthat is arranged in series with a secondary inductor Lof the second bias transformer T e.g. coupled between the inductors Land Land the inductors Land L . Therefore the secondary inductors Land Lof the respective transformers Tand Tform a first loop between the first and third stages and . In a similar manner the secondary inductors Land Lof the respective transformers Tand Tform a second loop between the second and fourth stages and .

As an example each of the in phase component CLKand the quadrature phase component CLKcan include a positive portion e.g. in a first half of a respective period and a negative portion e.g. in a second half of a respective period . Based on the arrangement of the clock transformers Tand Trelative to the respective stages and a flux state of the stages and can be sequentially switched at each phase and each opposite phase of the in phase and quadrature phase components CLKand CLKand in response to an SFQ propagating around the flux shuttle loop. As an example each of the in phase component CLKand the quadrature phase component CLKcan include a first phase corresponding to a positive peak e.g. in a first half of a respective period and a second phase that is opposite the first phase and thus corresponding to a negative peak e.g. in a second half of a respective period . Thus the flux shuttle loop can track the flux state of the secondary inductors Land Lof the bias transformers Tand T and thus the flux state of the stages and through each alternating first and second phase of the in phase and quadrature phase components CLKand CLKto propagate an SFQ pulse through the flux shuttle loop .

Furthermore the Josephson current source includes a first storage inductor Lthat interconnects the flux injector system and the first loop and a second storage inductor Lthat interconnects the flux injector system and the second loop . The output inductor Lconducts the output current Ifrom each of the storage inductors Land Lthrough the injector system . In response to the SFQ pulse that is sequentially propagated through each of the stages and a current step is generated in the respective storage inductors Land L. Thus in response to the respective Josephson junctions triggering in the first and third stages and in response to the switching of the flux states of the respective first and third stages and the SFQ pulse generates a resulting current step in the storage inductor L. Similarly in response to the respective Josephson junctions triggering in the second and fourth stages and in response to the switching of the flux states of the respective second and fourth stages and the SFQ pulse generates a resulting current step in the storage inductor L. As a result the output inductor Lintegrates each of the current steps provided through the storage inductors Land Lto provide the output current I such that the Josephson current source acts as a DC signal source. As a result the output current Ican be provided as a DC signal converted from the in phase component CLKand the quadrature phase component CLK such as to a circuit device e.g. the circuit device in the example of .

The flux shuttle loop can be activated via the flux injector system as described in greater detail herein. Upon activation at a time t a positive portion of the in phase component CLKbegins with a positive peak of the in phase component CLKoccurring at a time t. Therefore the in phase component CLKbegins to induce a current via the secondary inductor Lbased on the inductive coupling with the primary inductor L. At a time just prior to the time t e.g. based on the inductance of the transformer T the magnitude of the current is combined with an SFQ pulse provided by the Josephson junction J e.g. from the fourth stage via the inductor L or from the flux injector system at activation and a bias current provided via the secondary inductor Lbased on the inductive coupling with the primary inductor L. Therefore the critical current of the Josephson junctions Jand Jis exceeded thus triggering the Josephson junctions Jand J or just the Josephson junction Jat initialization . As a result the Josephson junctions Jand Jpropagate the SFQ pulse which provides a voltage pulse to the first storage inductor Lthat is integrated by the output inductor Lto increase the amplitude of the DC output current I. The SFQ pulse then propagates to the second stage .

Also at the time t a positive portion of the quadrature phase component CLKbegins with a positive peak of the quadrature phase component CLKoccurring at a time t. Therefore the quadrature phase component CLKbegins to induce a current via the secondary inductor Lbased on the inductive coupling with the primary inductor L. At a time just prior to the time t e.g. based on the inductance of the transformer T the magnitude of the current is combined with the SFQ pulse provided by the Josephson junction Jand a bias current provided via the secondary inductor Lbased on the inductive coupling with the primary inductor L. Therefore the critical current of the Josephson junctions Jand Jis exceeded thus triggering the Josephson junction J. As a result the Josephson junctions Jand Jpropagate the SFQ pulse which generates a current step in the storage inductor Lthat is integrated by the output inductor Lto increase the amplitude of the DC output current I. The SFQ pulse then propagates to the third stage .

Also at the time t a negative portion of the in phase component CLKbegins with a negative peak of the in phase component CLKoccurring at a time t. Therefore the in phase component CLKbegins to induce a current via the secondary inductor Lbased on the inductive coupling with the primary inductor L. At a time just prior to the time t the magnitude of the current is combined with the SFQ pulse propagated by the Josephson junction Jand the bias current provided via the secondary inductor L. Therefore the critical current of the Josephson junctions Jand Jis exceeded thus triggering the Josephson junctions Jand J. As a result the Josephson junctions Jand Jpropagate the SFQ pulse which generates a current step in the storage inductor Lthat is integrated by the output inductor Lto increase the amplitude of the DC output current I. The SFQ pulse then propagates to the fourth stage .

Also at the time t a negative portion of the quadrature phase component CLKbegins with a negative peak of the quadrature phase component CLKoccurring at a time t. Therefore the quadrature phase component CLKbegins to induce a current via the secondary inductor Lbased on the inductive coupling with the primary inductor L. At a time just prior to the time t the magnitude of the current is combined with the SFQ pulse propagated by the Josephson junction Jand the bias current provided via the secondary inductor L. Therefore the critical current of the Josephson junctions Jand Jis exceeded thus triggering the Josephson junctions JJ. As a result the Josephson junctions JJpropagate the SFQ pulse which generates a current step in the storage inductor Lthat is integrated by the output inductor Lto increase the amplitude of the DC output current I. The SFQ pulse then propagates back to the first stage to trigger the Josephson junction J.

Also at the time t a positive portion of the in phase component CLKbegins. Therefore the process of converting the in phase component CLKand the quadrature phase component CLKrepeats such that the time tis equivalent to the time t as described previously. Accordingly the Josephson junctions J J J J J J J and Jcan sequentially trigger based on changes to the flux states of the first and second loops and and thus the corresponding stages and while the flux shuttle loop is activated via the flux injector system . Thus the SFQ pulse propagates around the flux shuttle loop to continuously provide voltage pulses in response to the triggering of the Josephson junctions J J J and J respectively to the output inductor Lbased on the frequency of the in phase component CLKand the quadrature phase component CLK. As a result the output inductor Lcan integrate the voltage pulses to increase the amplitude of the DC output current I.

The flux injector system is demonstrated as forming part of the first stage between the inductors Land L. The flux injector system includes a first transformer having a primary inductor Lthat receives the DC injection signal INJ and a secondary inductor Lthat provides an induced injection current I. The flux injector system also includes a second transformer having a primary inductor Lthat receives the DC output current Iand a secondary inductor Lthat provides an induced feedback current I. The secondary inductors Land Lare interconnected by a node that is coupled to the secondary inductor Lof the first bias transformer T and are arranged in a loop with a Josephson junction Jthat is arranged between the inductors Land L. In the example of the feedback current Iand the injection current Ihave opposite current directions and thus the activation and deactivation of the Josephson current source can be controlled based on a relative amplitude of the feedback current Iand the injection current I.

At initialization e.g. approximately zero amplitude of the DC output current I the DC injection signal INJ can be provided through the primary inductor Lof the transformer to provide the induced injection current I. Because the amplitude of the DC output current Iis approximately zero at initialization the net current flow in the loop is defined entirely by the injection current I which can provide a flux of the loop that is sufficient to trigger the Josephson junction Jto inject an SFQ pulse into the flux shuttle loop . Therefore the SFQ pulse can circulate through the flux shuttle loop in the manner described previously in the examples of . As the SFQ pulse continues to propagate around the flux shuttle loop the DC output current Iincreases thus likewise increasing the amplitude of the feedback current I. As a result the amplitude of the feedback current Iis subtracted from the injection current Iwith respect to the flux of the loop thus decreasing the flux of the loop . Upon the DC output current Iincreasing to a predetermined deactivation threshold that can be defined by the amplitude of the DC injection signal INJ and thus the injection current I the flux of the loop can decrease to an amount that is sufficient to provide an anti triggering the Josephson junction Jby generating a negative SFQ pulse i.e. anti fluxon at the first phase of the in phase component CLK. As a result the junction Jun triggers to cancel the SFQ pulse such that the SFQ pulse ceases to propagate around the flux shuttle loop thus maintaining the amplitude of the DC output current Iat a substantially constant amplitude in a quiescent state. Therefore the flux injector system can automatically deactivate the Josephson current source based on an amplitude of the DC output current I.

In response to a decrease in the amplitude of the DC output current I such as in response to the DC output current Ibeing consumed by the circuit device the flux of the loop begins to increase as the net current flow in the loop increases. Upon the DC output current Idecreasing to a predetermined activation threshold such as likewise defined by the amplitude of the DC injection signal INJ and thus the injection current I the flux of the loop can increase to an amount that is sufficient to trigger the Josephson junction J thus re injecting the SFQ pulse into the flux shuttle loop . Accordingly the SFQ pulse can again circulate through the flux shuttle loop to increase the DC output current I. Therefore the flux injector system can automatically reactivate the Josephson current source based on an amplitude of the DC output current I.

The flux diagram demonstrates a first point corresponding to the state of the system at the completion of initialization of the Josephson current source in response to the applied current I and therefore approximately zero amplitude of the DC output current I. At the first point the DC injection signal INJ can be provided through the primary inductor Lof the transformer to provide the induced injection current I. Because the amplitude of the DC output current Iis approximately zero at initialization the net current flow in the loop is defined entirely by the injection current I which can provide a flux of to the loop which can be sufficient to trigger the Josephson junction Jto inject an SFQ pulse into the flux shuttle loop . Therefore the flux shuttle loop can be activated to circulate the SFQ pulse through the flux shuttle loop in the manner described previously in the examples of .

As the SFQ pulse continues to propagate around the flux shuttle loop the DC output current Iincreases thus likewise increasing the amplitude of the feedback current I. As a result the amplitude of the feedback current Iis subtracted from the injection current Iwith respect to the flux of the loop thus decreasing the flux of the loop as demonstrated by the arrow . Upon the DC output current Iincreasing to a predetermined deactivation threshold that can be defined by the amplitude of the DC injection signal INJ and thus the injection current I the flux of the loop can decrease to a point corresponding to a flux . The flux can correspond to a flux of the loop that is sufficient to provide an anti trigger of the Josephson junction J and thus a negative SFQ pulse to cancel the SFQ pulse that is provided from the Josephson junction Jat the first phase of the in phase component CLK and thus failing to trigger the Josephson junction J. Therefore the anti triggering of the Josephson junction Jresults in a decrease of phase as indicated by the arrow from the point to a point . Accordingly the flux shuttle loop is automatically deactivated resulting in the SFQ pulse ceasing to propagate around the flux shuttle loop thus maintaining the amplitude of the DC output current Iat a substantially constant amplitude in a quiescent state.

In response to a decrease in the amplitude of the DC output current I such as in response to the DC output current Ibeing consumed by the circuit device the flux of the loop begins to increase as demonstrated by an arrow as the net current flow in the loop increases. In response to the flux increasing to a point corresponding to a flux the flux of the loop can achieve a predetermined activation threshold such as likewise defined by the amplitude of the DC injection signal INJ and thus the injection current I. Therefore the flux can correspond to a flux of the loop that is sufficient to trigger the Josephson junction J thus increasing the phase of the Josephson junction J as indicated by an arrow from the point to a point . As a result the SFQ pulse is re injected into the flux shuttle loop . Therefore the SFQ pulse can again circulate through the flux shuttle loop to increase the DC output current I. Accordingly the flux diagram demonstrates a circular pattern of the flux of the loop as it relates to the phase of the Josephson junction J and thus activation and deactivation of the flux shuttle loop based on the amplitude of the DC output current I.

In the example of the fluxes and are dependent on the ratio of the inductance of the Josephson Junction Jand the loop and are therefore substantially fixed. The flux is dependent on a relative amplitude of the injection current Iand the feedback current I and thus on the amplitude of the DC injection signal INJ and the amplitude of the DC output current I respectively. The feedback current Iaffects the total flux of the loop and depends on the DC injection signal INJ relative to the fluxes and . Therefore the amplitude of the output current Iis controlled based on the amount of the feedback current Ithat is necessary to increase the total flux of the loop to the flux or to decrease the total flux of the loop to the flux . Accordingly the amplitude of the DC injection signal INJ defines the amplitude of the feedback current Ithat is necessary to achieve the total loop flux of or for the loop . Therefore the amplitude of the DC injection signal INJ can be set to define at least one of the predetermined activation and deactivation thresholds for the Josephson current source .
