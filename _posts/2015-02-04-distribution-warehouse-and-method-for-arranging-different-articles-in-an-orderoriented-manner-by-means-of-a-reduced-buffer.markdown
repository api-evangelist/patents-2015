This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 14 105 319 filed Dec. 13 2013 which is a continuation of international patent application PCT EP2012 060562 filed on Jun. 5 2012 which claims the priority of the German patent application DE 10 2011 104 511.6 filed on Jun. 15 2011 all of which are herewith incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to a method for arranging different articles in an order oriented manner from a long term warehouse in accordance with a plurality of orders in particular picking orders and also relates to a distribution system and a computer program.

Many processes within a distribution warehouse require buffering of to be picked articles in particular picking process i.e. when articles are arranged in accordance with orders. However in general buffering is a no value added process and additionally requires space and corresponding equipment.

DE 10 2009 019 511 B3 discloses a storage and picking system. DE 10 2008 036 564 A1 discloses a scalable shipping buffer. DE 10 2008 046 325 A1 discloses a system and method for automatically picking articles into order containers. DE 20 2010 005 643 U1 discloses a system for managing material flow in a warehouse by means of computers.

Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide an enhanced distribution system and an enhanced method for arranging in an order oriented manner different articles from a long term warehouse in accordance with a plurality of orders.

According to a first aspect of the invention it is disclosed a method for arranging different articles in an order oriented manner from a long term warehouse in accordance with a plurality of orders in particular picking orders which comprises the following steps a defining an analysis quantity comprising a quantity of n orders wherein each of the orders of the analysis quantity comprises at least one order line wherein each of the order lines respectively specifies one ordered article with regard to an article type thereof and with regard to number of pieces b quasi continuously transferring in an article pure manner stored articles from a long term warehouse to a short term warehouse comprising the following steps i selecting one arbitrary article type contained in the analysis quantity ii analyzing each of the orders of the analysis quantity in dependence on the selected article type iii determining total requirements for the selected article type iv transferring the total requirements of the selected article type from the long term warehouse to the short term warehouse v repeating the steps i to iv for one other article type which is contained in the analysis quantity and which has not yet been selected until each article type which is contained in the analysis quantity is selected analyzed and transferred c determining at least one complete order preferably by repeatedly scanning and checking the transferred articles with regard to complete orders wherein a complete order is one of the orders of the analysis quantity the associated articles of which are already in the short term warehouse d discharging a subset of transferred articles from the short term warehouse wherein the subset includes at least all of the ordered articles of the at least one complete order and e repeating the steps c and d until each of the orders of the analysis quantity has become complete.

According to a second aspect it is disclosed in a distribution system which comprises a long term warehouse and a short term warehouse a method for arranging articles of different article types in an order oriented manner from the long term warehouse in accordance with a plurality of orders comprising the following steps a defining an analysis quantity which comprises a quantity of several orders wherein each of the orders of the analysis quantity comprises at least one order line wherein each of the order lines respectively specifies an ordered article with regard to the respective article type and with regard to a respectively ordered number of pieces b transferring stored articles in an article oriented manner from the long term warehouse to the short term warehouse comprising the steps of i selecting an arbitrary one of the article types contained in the analysis quantity ii analyzing each of the orders of the analysis quantity in dependence on the selected article type iii determining total requirements of the selected article type iv transferring the total requirements of the selected article type from the long term warehouse to the short term warehouse v repeating the steps i to iv for another one of the article types con tained in the analysis quantity which has not yet been selected until each one of the article types contained in the analysis quantity is selected analyzed and transferred c determining at least one complete order wherein a complete order is one of the orders of the analysis quantity the associated articles of which are all already located in the short term warehouse d discharging a subset of the transferred articles from the short term warehouse wherein the subset comprises at least each of the ordered articles of the at least one complete order and e repeating the steps c and d until each of the orders of the analysis quantity is completed.

In addition a third aspect of the invention relates to a distribution system having a long term warehouse a short term warehouse a conveyor and a control wherein the conveyor connects the long term warehouse in a conveying manner to the short term warehouse and wherein the control is adapted to execute the method of the present invention.

According to a fourth aspect of the invention it is disclosed a distribution system comprising a long term warehouse a short term warehouse a conveyor and a control wherein the conveyor connects the long term warehouse in a conveying manner to the short term warehouse and wherein the control is adapted to execute the following steps a defining an analysis quantity which comprises a quantity of several orders wherein each of the orders of the analysis quantity comprises at least one order line wherein each of the order lines respectively specifies an ordered article with regard to the respective article type and with regard to a respectively ordered number of pieces b transferring stored articles in an article oriented manner from the long term warehouse to the short term warehouse comprising the steps of i selecting an arbitrary one of the article types contained in the analysis quantity ii analyzing each of the orders of the analysis quantity in dependence on the selected article type iii determining total requirements of the selected article type iv transferring the total requirements of the selected article type from the long term warehouse to the short term warehouse and v repeating the steps i to iv for another one of the article types contained in the analysis quantity which has not yet been selected until each one of the article types contained in the analysis quantity is selected analyzed and transferred c determining at least one complete order wherein a complete order is one of the orders of the analysis quantity the associated articles of which are all already located in the short term warehouse d discharging a subset of the transferred articles from the short term warehouse wherein the subset comprises at least each of the ordered articles of the at least one complete order and e repeating the steps c and d until each of the orders of the analysis quantity is completed

A huge advantage of the invention is that the size number of buffer locations of the short term warehouse or of the buffer can be reduced significantly. The size and capacity of the buffer of the present invention is significantly smaller than the capacity of a conventional buffer. As a result less parts e.g. conveyors are required for installing the buffer. The investment costs are reduced. The required space is reduced. Nevertheless the throughput completely processed orders per unit of time is increased. The method of the invention is extremely flexible with regard to the determination of temporal limits of order windows. Rush orders can be inserted into the processing of a group of orders without problems at any time and can be processed in particular with a higher priority.

In accordance with a preferred embodiment a first article type is selected during a first run of the step i which belongs to a first order and only during a subsequent run of the step i such article types are selected next which also belong to the first order before an article type is selected which belongs to another order.

Hence the articles are not only transferred from the long term warehouse into the short term warehouse in an article oriented manner but are also processed in an order oriented manner. The article oriented transfer happens simultaneously to the article oriented processing of the ordered articles.

This means amongst other things that the article types are selected in particular in an order oriented manner in the step i .

With another advantageous embodiment the short term warehouse is sized such that one or more of the complete orders are collected in the short term warehouse before the short term warehouse is full.

The short term warehouse is to be sized such that at least one order can be collected completely. However the short term warehouse is significantly smaller than a conventional buffer which can receive all articles of all of the orders of the analysis quantity.

In particular this means that a capacity of the short term warehouse is smaller than a total number of all of the ordered articles of all of the orders of the analysis quantity.

Further it is preferred that the step of discharging happens while further article types which are selected newly are transferred article purely.

This expresses the concurrence of the article oriented and order oriented processes which are utilized with the method of the invention

It is ideal if the ordered articles are distributed in accordance with the Pareto principle. In particular one or more different C type articles can be transferred article purely to the short term warehouse on a speculative basis e.g. based on average values so that the article oriented transfer of the article type s which belong to the corresponding C type articles only happens once.

In this case storage machine only needs to be moved once for putting all of the C type articles of this type from the long term warehouse into the buffer which occur in the orders over a longer unit of time e.g. distributed over an entire day. The storage machine in the long term warehouse is relieved. Conventionally an analysis period which defines the analysis quantity as a rule is shorter than one day. This results in particular for C type articles in a bad picking pattern i.e. the C type articles are frequently retrieved by the storage machines namely often in very small quantities. The invention avoids this drawback.

Additionally it is advantageous that the analysis quantity is analyzed with regard to existing article types before the step of article pure transferring happens in order to generate an overview of the different article types from which respectively one article type is selected in the step i .

This analysis can be useful for the retrieval of articles from the long term warehouse. Instead of analyzing the orders in an order oriented manner the orders can be analyzed in a storage location oriented manner. In this way for example such articles can be analyzed in a preferred manner which have a relatively short way from the long term storage location to the short term warehouse.

Then the distribution system is operated fully automatically. All commands which are required for controlling the different components of the distribution system in terms of material flow are generated and output by the control so that a human interaction is not necessary. Of course picking and or packing can be done manually.

Further it is an advantage if the step of checking for complete orders comprises scanning the article types and the associated numbers of pieces of the transferred articles which are currently located in the short term warehouse and determining for each of the orders of the analysis quantity by comparison whether all associated ordered articles are detected in accordance with their article types and their respective numbers of pieces.

The determination of complete orders can already happen before one single article is put from the long term warehouse to the short term warehouse. In this case the control has knowledge of the sequence of the article pure transfer and can reserve based on this knowledge e.g. specific areas buffer locations in the buffer for specific orders. Additionally the control can then have knowledge of which of the subsets can be discharged from the buffer at a specific point in time.

Further it is advantageous if a rush order having high processing priority is added preferably afterwards to the analysis quantity and analyzed with regard to the article types contained therein wherein the article types of the rush order are processed in accordance with the processing priority temporarily before such article types which have not yet been selected and which have a lower processing priority.

Rush orders can be added to the analysis quantity at any time even if the analysis quantity is already determined. Due to the consideration of processing priorities the article type appearing in the rush order can be processed in a preferred manner even if the article type of the rush order has already been processed analyzed in a conventional cycle during the processing of the analysis quantity. Thus the invention allows to react fast and flexible with regard to rush orders without affecting the remaining processes in the system in a disadvantageous manner.

With another preferred embodiment the subset discharged in the step d is transferred to a sorting device wherein such articles which belong to the complete orders are sorted out and remaining articles which do not belong to any of the complete orders are buffered in the sorting device until missing articles can be discharged to the sorting device which are defining together with the remaining articles new complete orders.

In particular the method of the invention additionally comprises the steps of collecting a first group of orders comprising more than n orders which lie within a first temporal window wherein the analysis quantity corresponds to a second group of orders which lies within a second temporal window being smaller than the first temporal window and repeatedly returning to the step a if each of the orders of the analysis quantity has become one of the complete orders in order to define a new analysis quantity based on such orders of the first group which lie outside of the second temporal window and within the first temporal window until each of the orders of the first group has become one of the complete orders and has been discharged.

In accordance with still another aspect of the invention a computer program is proposed which is adapted to execute a method comprising the steps of a defining an analysis quantity which comprises a quantity of several orders wherein each of the orders of the analysis quantity comprises at least one order line wherein each of the order lines respectively specifies an ordered article with regard to the respective article type and with regard to a respectively ordered number of pieces b transferring stored articles in an article oriented manner from a long term warehouse to a short term warehouse comprising the steps of i selecting an arbitrary one of the article types contained in the analysis quantity ii analyzing each of the orders of the analysis quantity in dependence on the selected article type iii determining total requirements of the selected article type iv transferring the total requirements of the selected article type from the long term warehouse to the short term warehouse and v repeating the steps i to iv for another one of the article types contained in the analysis quantity which has not yet been selected until each one of the article types contained in the analysis quantity is selected analyzed and transferred c determining at least one complete order wherein a complete order is one of the orders of the analysis quantity the associated articles of which are all already located in the short term warehouse d discharging a subset of the transferred articles from the short term warehouse wherein the subset comprises at least each of the ordered articles of the at least one complete order and e repeating the steps c and d until each of the orders of the analysis quantity is completed.

The distribution system can comprise a goods receipt WE a long term warehouse a short term warehouse hereinafter also designated as buffer a sorting device a goods issue WA and or a control device . The elements can be connected to each other by means of a conveyor in a mutual manner . shows some exemplary material flow connections in terms of one or more of the conveyors . In this sense the goods receipt is connected to the long term warehouse . The long term warehouse is respectively connected to the short term warehouse or the buffer the sorting device and the goods issue . The short term warehouse or the buffer is connected to the sorting device . The sorting device is connected to the goods issue . The conveyor is a technical system which can have different complexities where conveying devices of same or different types can fulfill conveying tasks. There are different conveyor types such as roller conveyors belt conveyors chain conveyors overhead conveyors and the like which can be utilized. The present invention is compatible with all of the conveyor types. Preferably overhead conveyors are used.

The control can be connected in terms of control either wirelessly cf. arrow or via fixed lines to the components . The control can be responsible amongst other things for the material flow within the distribution system . The control is responsible for preparations of orders and processings of orders.

Articles which are not shown in more detail are supplied in greater quantities via the goods receipt to the distribution system . The articles are conveyed from the goods receipt to the long term warehouse . There the articles serve as supply for processing picking orders.

One order consists of one or more order positions which are also designated as order lines. One order line indicates a respective quantity number of pieces of one article type which has been ordered by a customer. The structure of an exemplary order will be explained in more details with reference to . An order batch is to be understood in the following as the concatenation of a number of orders to form a processing lot.

In the following an article is to be understood as a piece good. One article is a smallest unit of an article range which can be distinguished by article types. The piece goods are individually distinguishable goods which can be handled individually and stock of which is listed piecewise or in terms of a bundle. The bundle is a common term for one handable unit which can be moved manually or by means of technical devices conveyors . Bundles can also be represented by a subset of one load unit such as a box of beverages on a pallet loaded completely with boxes of beverages. In the following the terms article bundle and piece good are used equivalently. If one article is transported via the conveyor this is also called a conveying good.

Returning to the articles are transferred temporarily from the long term warehouse which comprises a very huge storage capacity typically several 100.000 articles to the short term warehouse or the buffer . The buffer comprises a much smaller capacity e.g. 5.000 articles than the warehouse . The transfer of articles from the long term warehouse to the buffer happens for the purpose of order picking i.e. for the purpose of arranging different articles in accordance with different orders. As soon as all articles of one order are in the buffer the order is complete and can be discharged either to the sorting device or directly to the goods issue . If the buffer does not have a sorting functionality the articles can be discharged to the sorting device for the purpose of sorting. Otherwise i.e. if the buffer has a sorting functionality or sorting is not required the articles of the complete order can be supplied directly to the goods issue . It is clear that article pure orders i.e. orders comprising articles of one single article type only can be transferred directly from the long term warehouse to the goods issue .

In diagram is shown. The diagram serves for explaining processes within the distribution system with reference to orders Ai i is an integer which are received for example over an entire day and are processed. In the left half of a vertically oriented time beam is shown for visualizing one day 0 00 a.m. 12 00 p.m. . One day can be divided temporarily into different order slots BS . In three order slots BS1 BS3 are shown. A first order slot can comprise for example such orders Ai which are received between 6 00 a.m. and 10 00 a.m. wherein the order receipt does not need to happen physically within the distribution system . The orders Ai can be put at traders for example via the Internet who in turn send the so collected orders electronically or via mail to the distribution system . A second order slot BS2 can last from 10 00 a.m. 4 00 p.m. A third order slot can last from 4 00 p.m. 6 00 a.m. of the next day. After that the cycle begins from the start. It is clear that temporal limits of the order slots BS can be set variably as will be explained hereinafter in more detail.

In order to facilitate the explanation of the present invention the first order slot BS1 is exemplarily viewed hereinafter. For this purpose the time beam is shown at the right hand side in a zoomed manner. In total m n 10 orders Ai i 1 . . . n 10 are received in the order slot BS1 between 6 00 a.m. and 10 00 a.m. The orders Ai can be numbered continuously dependent on the respective temporal receipt. In order to avoid waiting to 10 00 a.m. so that the processing of the orders Ai can be started a first subset of the n 10 orders Ai can be selected for further processing exemplarily at 9 15 a.m. In this manner a first analysis quantity AM is defined including all the orders Ai i 1 . . . n wherein the last order received before 9 15 a.m. is the order An. Hence the analysis quantity AM is defined by AM A1 . . . An.

It is clear that a temporal division of an individual order slot BS into a number of analysis quantities is of an exemplary nature only. Typically one order slot BS is converted to one single analysis quantity. A big advantage of the invention is to be seen in that under a pre given search depth i.e. including pre given temporal limits of the analysis quantity the physical size capacity of the short term warehouse or the buffer is reduced in comparison to conventional approaches. This is achieved by a quasi continuous partial emptying of the buffer . For the purpose of performing the partial emptying as fast and reasonable in terms of the picking orders as possible the buffer is filled in accordance with the invention. The buffer is filled in such a manner that a reasonable partial emptying can happen as fast as and as frequent as possible. In this case all the articles required for the partial emptying subset group of orders are in the buffer . Thus the analysis quantity is normally not restricted as will be explained hereinafter.

Thus as it will be explained exemplarily hereinafter in more detail the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM are analyzed with regard to the article types preferably in an order oriented manner contained in the analysis quantity AM for determining how many piece goods or articles of a jarticle type Sj are required in total in all of the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM. In for example 43 articles S1 of the first article type 27 articles S2 of the second article type articles S3 of the third article type and so on are required. Each of the article types Sj is retrieved article purely from the long term warehouse and stored in the buffer . The article types Sj are transferred subsequently i.e. quasi continuously from the long term warehouse to the buffer as soon as it is respectively clear how many articles of the article type Sj are required total requirements . The article pure movement has the advantage that a storage machine not shown in the long term warehouse is operated for each article type Sj in best case only one single time for processing all of the orders Ai of the order slot BS. The retrieval from the long term warehouse thus happens in an article oriented manner. As soon as the first article type S1 is analyzed it is transferred and the analysis quantity AM is analyzed in dependence on a second article type S2. As soon as the first article type S1 has been transferred and the analysis with regard to the second article type S2 is finished the second article type S2 can be transferred. This is repeated until all of the article types of all of the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM are analyzed and transferred. Thus the buffer is filled continuously over time.

While the buffer is filled with growing time it can be checked repeatedly whether all of the articles of any arbitrary order Ai are present in the buffer . It is clear that the control can already determine in advance at which time all of the articles of one of the orders Ai are completely present in the buffer . In this case it is only detected whether a required article type Sj has been transferred to the buffer e.g. by means of a sensor at the entry of the buffer .

As soon as at least one of the orders Ai is completely present in the buffer i.e. all of the articles of this order are present a subset which is also designated hereinafter as a fragment of articles located in the buffer can be discharged. The discharging can happen optionally to the sorting device capacity e.g. 500 articles if the buffer itself is not provided with a sorting functionality. Thus the buffer is continuously filled and emptied so that the buffer needs to have a small capacity only.

The fact that subsets or fragments Fk are discharged again and again is indicated in by means of a broken line which is formed like a loop.

If all of the orders Ai are complete and have been discharged and if the analysis quantity AM has not included all of the orders Ai of the order slop BS as it is the case e.g. for the order slot BS1 in the method of the invention can be applied to one or more remaining analysis quantities AM containing such orders Ai which came in for example in a temporal window reaching from 9 15 a.m. 10 00 a.m. This is the quantity A . . . A AMin .

With reference to one of the orders is exemplarily shown which typically is provided and processed in terms of a data set. The order can comprise a header a priority field and or an article field . The header can comprise amongst other things information on the customer who has put the order to customer s addresses or to customer s identification number as well as an order number. The priority field contains information on whether the order is normal or a rush order. Rush orders are orders with high processing priorities which are typically handled in a preferred manner compared to the normal orders and can be added to the analysis quantity AM afterwards.

The article field comprises order lines to . Each of the order lines comprises at least information on a number of pieces of an ordered article or on an article type . The first order line at the first position pos.1 represents an order of 13 units of cough mixture. The order line at the second position represents an order of 45 units of nose drops. It is clear that the example selected from the field of pharmaceuticals can also be applied to other fields such as food retail online book trade or similar. Typically each of the lines represents a different article type Sj. The same article type Sj however can also be present several times within one order Ai.

In a flow chart of a method in accordance with the invention is shown. The method serves for arranging stored articles in accordance with one order as shown exemplarily in .

In a first step S the analysis quantity AM is defined cf. . The analysis quantity AM comprises n orders Ai. Each of the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM comprises at least one order line . Each of the order lines specifies one ordered article dependent on its article type and its ordered number of pieces. The sum of all of the articles of the analysis quantity AM can be expressed by the following equation 

The index i represents the order number. The index j represents the order line of each of the orders. The factor j represents the number of pieces of the associated order line 

In a second step S stored articles are transferred from the long term warehouse quasi continuously i.e. articlewise in an article pure manner and continuously into the buffer . The step S is explained in more detail in .

In the next step S complete orders are determined. A complete order is one of the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM the associated articles of which have all already been transferred to the buffer .

The feeding of new articles from the long term warehouse to the buffer can be detected. Thus the control has information on that the new article has arrived in the buffer and thus is available for further processing. Also the article type once again can be detected additionally e.g. by means of RFID tags .

In a step S one subset of articles present in the buffer is discharged from the buffer . The subset includes all of the articles which belong to at least one of the complete orders. The subset can also include more articles than comprised in the at least one complete order. Such additional articles do not need to form an individual complete order again.

In a step S it is checked whether new articles have been fed to the buffer . If new articles have been fed to the buffer new complete orders can be discharged in terms of a new subset from the buffer .

If no new articles have been added to the buffer it is inquired in a step S whether all of the articles of all of the orders of the analysis quantity AM have been discharged. If not all of the articles have been discharged it is returned to the step S while new complete orders are determined. If all of the articles of all of the orders have been discharged the method as a rule ends except that the analysis quantity AM does not include all of the orders Ai of a respective one of the order slots BS. If there are remaining residual orders cf. the orders An 1 through An 10 in it is returned to the step S.

In the method step S of is explained in more detail in terms of a flow chart. The method step S comprises the following steps selecting one article type Sj which has not been selected before from all of the orders of the analysis quantity AM step S analyzing the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM step with regard to the selected article type Sj determining the total requirements of the selected article type step S transferring the total requirements from the long term warehouse to the buffer step S and inquiring step S whether additional article types which have not been selected are present wherein it is returned to the step S if not all of the selected article types are present. Preferably all of the article types of one order are selected at first before article types of another order are selected. The deeper one enters into the orders during the selection of the article types the more orders are automatically finished before it is actually their turn for being analyzed.

In order to allow conduction of the steps S through S in in an easier manner it can be wise to integrate an intermediate step S between the steps S and S in the flow chart of . This intermediate step S is indicated in by means of broken lines. In the step S an article type analysis can be conducted with regard to all of the orders Ai after successful definition of the analysis quantity AM. During the article type analysis it determined which different article types Sj in all of the n orders Ai of the analysis quantity are present.

Returning to a first article type S1 of a first order A1 is typically selected in step S by means of the first order line . Then all of the remaining orders Ai i 1 of the analysis quantity AM are checked in step S with regard to the article type S1 step S . In this manner a total number of pieces or the total requirements of the selected article type S1 can be determined in the step S. All of the numbers of pieces from all of the orders An are summed up which concern the article type S1. As soon as the total requirements overall number of pieces is determined the control cf. causes the retrieval of a corresponding number of pieces of articles of the article type S1 from the long term warehouse for transferring same to the buffer step S . Subsequently it is returned to the step and preferably the second article type S2 is selected which is defined by the second order line of the first order A1 if the second order line is present. This course of action is repeated until all of the article types S1j which are contained in the first order A1 have been transferred by their respective total requirements to the buffer for the entire analysis quantity AM. If all of the articles of the first order A1 have been transferred to the buffer one continues preferably with the first article type S21 of the first order line of the second order A2 in the step S provided that this article type is not already identical to one of the article type S1 j of the first order A1. If one of the article types S2j of the second order A2 has already been finished by way of processing one of the article types S1j of the first order A1 the corresponding order line of the second order A2 is skipped. This is repeated until an article type Sj is reached which up to now has not been selected and transferred.

The deeper the orders Ai are processed during the method in accordance with the more often article types Sj have already been analyzed. Thus the advantages of an article oriented retrieval from the long term warehouse batch picking are utilized.

In an example for explaining the method steps of is shown. In the left part of an analysis quantity AM having n orders Ai is shown wherein only the first three orders A1 through A3 are shown in more detail. The first order A1 represents one order of five articles a three articles b and one article z . The second order A2 represents one order of three articles a and two articles b . The third order A3 represents one order of five articles b two articles c and three articles x .

In accordance with the step S of the first article a of the first order A1 is selected for the purpose of analysis. It is clear that each of the other orders of the analysis quantity AM could have been selected as the starting order. For example if the order A3 would have been analyzed first the article type b would have been selected first.

Returning to the first order A1 as a starting order having the first selected article type a the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM are all analyzed with regard to the article type a . This is indicated in by means of an arrow being oriented vertically downwards which indicates the direction of analysis.

In accordance with the step S of in total eight articles a are obtained as the total requirements after a first analysis run. These articles are transferred in accordance with the step S.

After the first analysis run no articles are discharged in accordance with the step S of since merely eight articles a are located in the buffer . None of the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM of is complete due to the eight articles a . For the purpose of a simplified explanation hereinafter only the first three orders A1 through A3 of are considered.

In accordance with the step S of it is then inquired whether additional non selected article types Sj are present after all of the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM have been analyzed with regard to the article type a . Since the first order A1 comprises the article type b which has not yet been selected the article type b is subsequently selected in accordance with the step S. Then the analysis quantity AM is analyzed with regard to the article type b step S . In this way total requirements of ten articles b step S is obtained. The total requirements is transferred again to the buffer in accordance with the step S.

After the analysis quantity AM has been analyzed in dependence on the article types a and b which is indicated in in that the articles a and b have been crossed out in the orders A1 through A3 at least the order A2 is complete. All of the articles three articles a and two articles b of the second order A2 have been transferred to the buffer . After each of the transfers in accordance with the step S of the control can check whether within the buffer all of the articles of at least one complete order are present except that the control has not determined in advance that after the second analysis run with regard to the article type b at least the second order A2 is complete. In the first case a sensor cf. can be positioned for example at the entrance of the buffer the sensor detecting the transfer of the articles or the total requirements from the long term warehouse . In addition an additional sensor cf. can be provided at the exit of the buffer for detecting such articles which are discharged from the buffer . Since all of the articles of the second order A2 are located within the buffer in the example of a first subset can be discharged from the buffer which at least includes the articles of the second order A2.

Provided that the buffer does not have any sorting functionality at all the subsets are typically discharged to a sorting device . In the described example of the first subset can comprise for example the eight articles a and the ten articles b which have been transferred to the buffer after the first two analysis steps. Thus this first subset comprises the three articles a and the two articles b of the second order A2. Then the first subset comprises more articles as required for processing the second order A2. These unnecessary articles 5 times a and 8 times b can remain in the sorting device and be used for processing other orders requiring the article types a and b as soon as they are complete.

In a third analysis run the analysis quantity AM is analyzed with regard to the article type z existing in the third order line of the first order A1 of . Since no other order of the orders A2 and A3 comprises the article type z the total requirements comprises one single article z . After the article z has been transferred to the buffer the control knows or determines that the first order A1 is complete as well . The one article z can be discharged from the buffer in terms of a second subset since the remaining articles of the first order A1 have already been discharged by means of the first subset. It is clear that one can wait longer until more of the orders are complete so that the second subset does not only include the one article z during the discharge from the buffer .

Due to the example of it is simply visible that the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM do not necessarily need to be processed and finished according to the temporal sequence of an order receipt. For example the second order A2 is processed and finished before the first order A1. The deeper the analysis quantity AM is analyzed the more of the orders Ai are already complete before they are actually analyzed with regard to their article types. Since complete orders are to be discharged as fast as possible from the buffer the size or capacity of the buffer can be chosen very small. Thus the investment costs are reduced. The arrangement of the articles with regard to the orders is accelerated. The arrangement of the orders Ai occurs extremely flexible. Rush orders can be incorporated at any time without problems into the already defined analysis quantity AM and if desired can be processed in a preferred manner. This will be explained in more detail below.

The flow chart of serves for explaining the exemplary case that the control does not have knowledge in advance when and whether one of the orders Ai is complete. In the control determines again and again whether one of the orders Ai is complete. This check can happen periodically or discretely in dependence on transfer of new articles in accordance with the step S cf. .

After a new article pure group total requirements of articles has been transferred from the long term warehouse to the buffer cf. step S in in accordance with in step S it can be inquired in a cyclic or discrete manner whether new articles have arrived in the short term warehouse or the buffer . For this purpose a sensor can be provided at an entrance of the buffer . This sensor detects the entry of new articles. Optionally the sensor can also be adapted to detect the article type Sj. In this case for example an RFID reading device can be utilized which communicates with RFID chips attached to an preferably each article and carrying the information with regard to the article type Sj. If the inquiry in the step S results in the entry of a new article total requirements in the buffer article stock in the buffer is updated in step S. The article stock in the buffer is comparable to an inventory data set. The article stock represents the number of article types Sj present in the buffer .

Then in step S it can be inquired whether one of the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM is now complete since in the step S the entry of one new article total requirements has been registered. If none of the orders Ai is complete it is returned to the step S. If at least one of the orders Ai is complete a subset can be determined from the article stock in the step S which comprises at least the articles of the at least one complete order. Optionally it can be inquired in step S whether the articles of the subset determined in the step S need to be sorted. Sorting can be necessary if the subset determined in the step S comprises articles belonging to different complete orders Ai. In this case it can be desirable to sort the articles with regard to the complete orders. Thus the sorting can happen in an order oriented manner.

If it is determined in the step S that sorting is required then in step S the stock within the buffer can be pre sorted. It is clear that the buffer in this case is provided with a sorting functionality. If the buffer is not provided with any sorting functionality the subset determined in the step S is discharged in step S as indicated in by means of an arrow illustrated by means of broken lines between the steps S and S. In this case the sorting can also happen later in a separate sorting device cf. e.g. sorting device in . If it is determined in the step S that no sorting is necessary the subset can be discharged in the step S.

In a first step S it is detected that the rush order is coming in. The entry of the rush order can happen afterwards i.e. after the analysis quantity AM has been defined cf. step S in . Of course rush orders can also be received regularly i.e. before the analysis quantity AM is defined namely within one of the order slots BS.

In step S the rush order is analyzed with regard to the article types Sj contained therein and is added to the analysis quantity AM.

In step S the article types Sj of the rush order can be processed in a prioritized manner and thus can be transferred in a prioritized manner cf. step S in . In terms of the example of the rush order can be added to the analysis quantity AM of for example after the second analysis run is finished i.e. after the analysis quantity AM has already been analyzed with regard to the article types a and b . If the rush order comprises for example one order of two articles a and four articles t the article type a can be processed once again in a third analysis run and subsequently the article type t can be processed in a fourth analysis run. Only then the analysis with regard to the article types z c and x follows. As soon as the article types a and t have been transferred the rush order is complete and can be discharged cf. step S in .

It is clear that upon the processing of the rush order of the example of the third analysis with regard to the article type a can be omitted for the time being since the first discharged subset comprises a surplus of five articles a after the second order is completely processed. Since the rush order requires two of the articles a only which are already present in the buffer or in the sorting device the analysis with regard to the article type a can also be shifted temporarily backwards. The repeated analysis with regard to the article a needs to happen at the latest when the articles a are no longer sufficiently present in the buffer or in the sorting device so that one of the orders Ai can no longer be served which actually should have received its articles a from the total requirements of the first analysis run.

Two embodiments and of the buffer are schematically illustrated in . Feeding lines and discharging lines are shown. The first buffer comprises a plurality of accumulation lines which are preferably oriented substantially straight. The second buffer comprises one or more storing circles . The elements can be implemented by conveyor components. Material flow direction is indicated by means of dark arrows.

The first buffer of will be explained hereinafter. The first buffer can be provided with a limited sorting functionality. The accumulation lines are preferably operated in one direction. Each of the accumulation lines comprises a known capacity for receiving a predetermined number of articles.

Provided that the control has already knowledge of the time when one of the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM is complete the accumulation lines can be assigned to areas dedicated to the complete orders Ai. In the example of for example the orders A1 and A13 of the example of can be assigned to the accumulation line arranged the farest downstream. A next i.e. second accumulation line arranged downstream can be assigned for example to the order A1 of . Ideally this assignment can be continued for all of the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM before a first article from the long term warehouse is transferred to the buffer . Whether all of the orders Ai can be assigned to one of the accumulation lines depends on the number of accumulation lines and their respective capacities.

In accordance with the example of without a rush order eight articles a and ten articles b are transferred from the long term warehouse to the buffer as a first subset. Three articles a of the first subset can be transferred to the first accumulation line and five articles a of the first subset can be transferred to the second accumulation line . It is clear that the first buffer is operated with a corresponding sensor adapted to monitor and coordinate the transfer of the individual articles to the accumulation lines assigned thereto. Further two articles b are transferred to the first accumulation line so that the second order A2 is completely present in the first accumulation line . Three articles b are transferred to the second accumulation line and five articles b of the remaining eight articles b are transferred to the third accumulation line . For illustrating the assignment of accumulation positions of the accumulation lines to the orders Ai areas of the orders A2 and A13 are delimited against each other in the first accumulation line by means of horizontal lines. Similar applies to the orders A1 and A3 which are assigned to the accumulation lines and . It is clear that based on the way described above all of the orders Ai can already be sorted in the area of the buffer so that a downstream sorting device cf. is not required. As soon as one of the orders Ai is completely present in the accumulation line thereof this complete order Ai can be discharged. Thus complete orders Ai leave the buffer . If a sorting process is required within one of the orders Ai in accordance with a predetermined sequence the orders Ai can be transferred to a subsequently arranged sorting device .

The sorting process for achieving the right sequence can be achieved amongst other things by means of the second buffer . The second buffer comprises one or more storage circles . In two circles are shown exemplarily. Buffered articles can be moved in a circulating manner within the circles . Within the circles areas can be assigned to the respective total requirements of one of the articles. The circle depicted at the left hand side of serves for buffering the articles a b z etc. wherein the analysis and transfer sequence of the example of is referred to. In accordance with the predetermined analysis and transfer sequence first the articles a and then the articles b etc. are fed to the circle . As soon as one of the orders Ai of the analysis quantity AM is complete the articles buffered in the circles can be rotated and discharged such that complete orders arrive at the exit of the buffer .

The above described method is particularly suitable for orders which are structured in accordance with the Pareto principle. The Pareto principle defines that in many application cases 80 of the events are caused by 20 of the actors. This is also designated as the 80 20 rule. In logistics the principle is applied with the ABC analysis and describes the situation which occurs frequently wherein 20 of the articles A type articles generate 80 of the throughput. The throughput is a process by which goods of one logistic system are transferred to another logistic system. For example order picking is such a process. The ABC analysis is an analysis of an article range with regard to the distribution of the articles dependent on a certain criterion. Typical criterions are for example turnover quantity or access frequency. The ABC articles are generated by classifying all of the articles of the article range with regard to the criterion such as the access frequency. The A type articles have a high access frequency. C type articles have a low access frequency. The access frequency is to be understood as the number of requirements of one article per time unit.

The above described method can be altered upon knowledge of an ABC distribution of the articles such that for example on a speculative basis the C type articles are retrieved in higher quantities than actually required due to the total requirements of the analysis quantity which is just processed. This means for example that if in total three articles of a specific C type article are present in an analysis quantity ten articles of this C type article are transferred to the buffer based on average values gained due to experience. During the processing of the current analysis quantity then three C type articles are discharged. The remaining seven C type articles stay in the buffer which are however consumed based on experience within the course of the subsequent analysis quantities e.g. within one day . The number of the C type articles is small in comparison to the capacity of the buffer so this preliminary reduction of the capacity of the buffer is acceptable because the storage machine in the long term warehouse needs to be moved only once for this C type article during this day. In this manner the performance of the entire system can be increased.
