For the purposes of the present invention the term accelerometer refers to an electromechanical device for measuring acceleration forces including static or dynamic forces. An accelerometer measures proper acceleration which is the acceleration it experiences relative to free fall and is the acceleration felt by people and objects. Put another way at any point in space time the equivalence principle guarantees the existence of a local inertial frame and an accelerometer measures the acceleration relative to that frame. 1 Such accelerations are popularly measured in terms of g force. Single and multi axis models of accelerometer are available to detect magnitude and direction of the proper acceleration or g force as a vector quantity and can be used to sense orientation because direction of weight changes coordinate acceleration so long as it produces g force or a change in g force vibration shock and falling in a resistive medium a case where the proper acceleration changes since it starts at zero then increases . Micro machined accelerometers are increasingly present in portable electronic devices and video game controllers to detect the position of the device or provide for game input. Pairs of accelerometers extended over a region of space can be used to detect differences gradients in the proper accelerations of frames of references associated with those points. These devices are called gravity gradiometers as they measure gradients in the gravitational field. Such pairs of accelerometers in theory may also be able to detect gravitational waves.

For the purposes of the present invention the term cloud computing is synonymous with computing performed by computers that are located remotely and accessed via the Internet the Cloud . It is a style of computing where the computing resources are provided as a service allowing users to access technology enabled services in the cloud without knowledge of expertise with or control over the technology infrastructure that supports them. According to the IEEE Computer Society it is a paradigm in which information is permanently stored in servers on the Internet and cached temporarily on clients that include desktops entertainment centers table computers notebooks wall computers handhelds etc. Cloud computing is a general concept that incorporates virtualized storage computing and web services and often software as a service SaaS where the common theme is reliance on the Internet for satisfying the computing needs of the users. For example Google Apps provides common business applications online that are accessed from a web browser while the software and data are stored on the servers. Some successful cloud architectures may have little or no established infrastructure or billing systems whatsoever including Peer to peer networks like BitTorrent and Skype and volunteer computing like SETI home. The majority of cloud computing infrastructure currently consists of reliable services delivered through next generation data centers that are built on computer and storage virtualization technologies. The services may be accessible anywhere in the world with the Cloud appearing as a single point of access for all the computing needs of data consumers. Commercial offerings may need to meet the quality of service requirements of customers and may offer service level agreements. Open standards and open source software are also critical to the growth of cloud computing. As customers generally do not own the infrastructure they are merely accessing or renting they may forego capital expenditure and consume resources as a service paying instead for what they use. Many cloud computing offerings have adopted the utility computing model which is analogous to how traditional utilities like electricity are consumed while others are billed on a subscription basis. By sharing perishable and intangible computing power between multiple tenants utilization rates may be improved as servers are not left idle which can reduce costs significantly while increasing the speed of application development. A side effect of this approach is that computer capacity rises dramatically as customers may not have to engineer for peak loads. Adoption has been enabled by increased high speed bandwidth which makes it possible to receive the same response times from centralized infrastructure at other sites.

A computer database relies upon software to organize the storage of data. This software is known as a database management system DBMS . Database management systems are categorized according to the database model that they support. The model tends to determine the query languages that are available to access the database. A great deal of the internal engineering of a DBMS however is independent of the data model and is concerned with managing factors such as performance concurrency integrity and recovery from hardware failures. In these areas there are large differences between products.

Other types of dosimeters are sound dosimeters ultraviolet dosimeters and electromagnetic field dosimeters. Ionizing radiation such as X rays alpha rays beta rays and gamma rays are undetectable by the human senses therefore a measuring device such as a dosimeter is used to detect measure and record this and in some cases give an alarm when a preset level is exceeded. Ionizing radiation damage to the body is cumulative and is related to the total dose received for which the SI unit is the sievert. Therefore workers exposed to radiation such as radiographers nuclear power plant workers doctors physicists and radiation therapists employing radiotherapy machines those in laboratories using radionuclides and some HAZMAT teams are required to wear dosimeters so their employers can keep a record of their exposure to verify that it is below legally prescribed limits Such devices may be recognized as legal dosimeters meaning that they have been approved for use in recording personnel dose for regulatory purposes.

If connected to the Internet the intranet is normally protected from being accessed from the Internet without proper authorization. The Internet is not considered to be a part of the intranet.

For the purposes of the present invention the term ionizing radiation refers to any particulate or electromagnetic radiation that is capable of dissociating atoms into a positively and negatively charged ion pair. The present invention may be used to determine doses of both directly ionizing radiation and indirectly ionizing radiation. Ionizing or ionising radiation is radiation composed of particles that individually carry enough kinetic energy to liberate an electron from an atom or molecule ionizing it. Ionizing radiation is generated through nuclear reactions either artificial or natural by very high temperature e.g. plasma discharge or the corona of the Sun via production of high energy particles in particle accelerators or due to acceleration of charged particles by the electromagnetic fields produced by natural processes from lightning to supernova explosions. When ionizing radiation is emitted by or absorbed by an atom it can liberate an atomic particle typically an electron proton or neutron but sometimes an entire nucleus from the atom. Such an event can alter chemical bonds and produce ions usually in ion pairs that are especially chemically reactive. This greatly magnifies the chemical and biological damage per unit energy of radiation because chemical bonds will be broken in this process. If the atom was inside a crystal lattice in a solid phase then a hole will exist where the original atom was. Ionizing radiation includes cosmic rays Alpha particles Beta particles Gamma rays X rays and in general any charged particle moving at relativistic speeds. Neutrons are considered ionizing radiation at any speed. Ionizing radiation includes some portion of the ultraviolet spectrum depending on context. Radio waves microwaves infrared light and visible light are normally considered non ionizing radiation although very high intensity beams of these radiations can produce sufficient heat to exhibit some similar properties to ionizing radiation by altering chemical bonds and removing electrons from atoms. Ionizing radiation is ubiquitous in the environment and comes from naturally occurring radioactive materials and cosmic rays. Common artificial sources are artificially produced radioisotopes X ray tubes and particle accelerators. Ionizing radiation is invisible and not directly detectable by human senses so instruments such as Geiger counters are usually required to detect its presence. In some cases it may lead to secondary emission of visible light upon interaction with matter such as in Cherenkov radiation and radioluminescence. It has many practical uses in medicine research construction and other areas but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to ionizing radiation causes damage to living tissue and can result in mutation radiation sickness cancer and death.

For the purposes of the present invention the term ionizing radiation sensor refers to a device that measures the presence or activity of a material or substance that emits or generates ionizing radiation.

For the purposes of the present invention the term irradiation refers to the conventional meaning of the term irradiation i.e. exposure to high energy charge particles e.g. electrons protons alpha particles etc. or electromagnetic radiation of wave lengths shorter than those of visible light e.g. gamma rays x rays ultraviolet etc.

For purposes of the present invention the term linked type of motion refers to one type of motion causing a second type of motion. For example a walking motion by an individual is one type of motion and may cause a linked second type of motion i.e. a pendulum motion of any individual s wrist. A running motion by an individual is also one type of motion and may cause a second linked type of motion i.e. a cyclic motion at the individual s wrist later to a direction detected by a motion sensor.

For the purposes of the present invention the term local area network LAN refers to a network covering a small geographic area like a home office or building. Current LANs are most likely to be based on Ethernet technology. The cables to the servers are typically on Cat 5e enhanced cable which will support IEEE 802.3 at 1 Gbit s. A wireless LAN may exist using a different IEEE protocol 802.11b 802.11g or possibly 802.11n. The defining characteristics of LANs in contrast to WANs wide area networks include their higher data transfer rates smaller geographic range and lack of a need for leased telecommunication lines.

Specific examples of machine readable media include non volatile memory including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. EPROM EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks. The term machine readable medium may include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more instructions or data structures. A machine readable medium may be part of a computer.

For the purposes of the present invention the term MEMS refers to Micro Electro Mechanical Systems. MEMS is a technology that in its most general form may be defined as miniaturized mechanical and electro mechanical elements i.e. devices and structures that are made using the techniques of microfabrication. The critical physical dimensions of MEMS devices can vary from well below one micron on the lower end of the dimensional spectrum all the way to several millimeters. Likewise the types of MEMS devices can vary from relatively simple structures having no moving elements to extremely complex electromechanical systems with multiple moving elements under the control of integrated microelectronics. A main criterion of MEMS may include that there are at least some elements having some sort of mechanical functionality whether or not these elements can move. The term used to define MEMS varies in different parts of the world. In the United States they are predominantly called MEMS while in some other parts of the world they are called Microsystems Technology or micromachined devices. While the functional elements of MEMS are miniaturized structures sensors actuators and microelectronics most notable elements may include microsensors and microactuators. Microsensors and microactuators may be appropriately categorized as transducers which are defined as devices that convert energy from one form to another. In the case of microsensors the device typically converts a measured mechanical signal into an electrical signal.

For the purposes of the present invention the term mesh networking refers to a type of networking where each node must not only capture and disseminate its own data but also serve as a relay for other nodes that is it must collaborate to propagate the data in the network. A mesh network can be designed using a flooding technique or a routing technique. When using a routing technique the message is propagated along a path by hopping from node to node until the destination is reached. To ensure all its paths availability a routing network must allow for continuous connections and reconfiguration around broken or blocked paths using self healing algorithms. A mesh network whose nodes are all connected to each other is a fully connected network. Mesh networks can be seen as one type of ad hoc network. Mobile ad hoc networks and mesh networks are therefore closely related but mobile ad hoc networks also have to deal with the problems introduced by the mobility of the nodes. The self healing capability enables a routing based network to operate when one node breaks down or a connection goes bad. As a result the network is typically quite reliable as there is often more than one path between a source and a destination in the network. Although mostly used in wireless situations this concept is also applicable to wired networks and software interaction.

For the purposes of the present invention the term microfluidics refers to a branch micro fabrication which is concerned with developing means of handling small volumes of liquids. An aspect of the present invention is to utilize fluidic structures consisting of a large number of microscopic volumes of liquids e.g. volumes from picoliters to microliters as a working element in a mechanical to electrical energy conversion system. The large number of these microscopic elements on the order of hundreds or even thousands yields a realistic amount of electrical energy that can be generated from a relatively small volume of mechanical motion.

For the purposes of the present invention the term mobile ad hoc network is a self configuring infrastructureless network of mobile devices connected by wireless. Ad hoc is Latin and means for this purpose . Each device in a mobile ad hoc network is free to move independently in any direction and will therefore change its links to other devices frequently. Each must forward traffic unrelated to its own use and therefore be a router. The primary challenge in building a mobile ad hoc network is equipping each device to continuously maintain the information required to properly route traffic. Such networks may operate by themselves or may be connected to the larger Internet. Mobile ad hoc networks are a kind of wireless ad hoc networks that usually has a routable networking environment on top of a Link Layer ad hoc network. The growths of laptops and wireless networks have made mobile ad hoc networks a popular research topic since the mid 1990s. Many academic papers evaluate protocols and their abilities assuming varying degrees of mobility within a bounded space usually with all nodes within a few hops of each other. Different protocols are then evaluated based on measure such as the packet drop rate the overhead introduced by the routing protocol end to end packet delays network throughput etc.

For purposes of the present invention the term motion data and the term motion activity data refer to data relating to the motion of an individual an object or a device and to the motion of any part of an individual an object or a device. Motion data may have associated time data relating to when motion started when motion stopped the duration of motion etc.

For the purposes of the present invention the term network hub refers to an electronic device that contains multiple ports. When a packet arrives at one port it is copied to all the ports of the hub for transmission. When the packets are copied the destination address in the frame does not change to a broadcast address. It does this in a rudimentary way it simply copies the data to all of the Nodes connected to the hub. This term is also known as hub. The term Ethernet hub active hub network hub repeater hub multiport repeater or hub may also refer to a device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment. It has multiple input output I O ports in which a signal introduced at the input of any port appears at the output of every port except the original incoming.

For the purposes of the present invention the term random access memory RAM refers to a type of computer data storage. Today it takes the form of integrated circuits that allow the stored data to be accessed in any order i.e. at random. The word random thus refers to the fact that any piece of data can be returned in a constant time regardless of its physical location and whether or not it is related to the previous piece of data. This contrasts with storage mechanisms such as tapes magnetic discs and optical discs which rely on the physical movement of the recording medium or a reading head. In these devices the movement takes longer than the data transfer and the retrieval time varies depending on the physical location of the next item. The word RAM is mostly associated with volatile types of memory such as DRAM memory modules where the information is lost after the power is switched off. However many other types of memory are RAM as well including most types of ROM and a kind of flash memory called NOR Flash.

For the purposes of the present invention the term read only memory ROM refers to a class of storage media used in computers and other electronic devices. Because data stored in ROM cannot be modified at least not very quickly or easily it is mainly used to distribute firmware software that is very closely tied to specific hardware and unlikely to require frequent updates . In its strictest sense ROM refers only to mask ROM the oldest type of solid state ROM which is fabricated with the desired data permanently stored in it and thus can never be modified. However more modern types such as EPROM and flash EEPROM can be erased and re programmed multiple times they are still described as read only memory because the reprogramming process is generally infrequent comparatively slow and often does not permit random access writes to individual memory locations.

For the purposes of the present invention the term real time processing refers to a processing system designed to handle workloads whose state is constantly changing.

Servers may operate within a client server architecture and may comprise computer programs running to serve the requests of other programs the clients. Thus the server may perform some task on behalf of clients. The clients typically connect to the server through the network but may run on the same computer. In the context of Internet Protocol IP networking a server is a program that operates as a socket listener. Servers often provide essential services across a network either to private users inside a large organization or to public users via the Internet. Typical computing servers are database server file server mail server print server web server gaming server application server or some other kind of server.

While solid state can include crystalline polycrystalline and amorphous solids and refer to electrical conductors insulators and semiconductors the building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor. Common solid state devices include transistors microprocessor chips and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in flash drives and more recently solid state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard drives.

Among its management tasks TCP controls message size the rate at which messages are exchanged and network traffic congestion.

For the purposes of the present invention the term time refers to a component of a measuring system used to sequence events to compare the durations of events and the intervals between them and to quantify the motions of objects. Time is considered one of the few fundamental quantities and is used to define quantities such as velocity. An operational definition of time wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event such as the passage of a free swinging pendulum constitutes one standard unit such as the second has a high utility value in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky the phases of the moon the swing of a pendulum and the beat of a heart.

For the purposes of the present invention the term timestamp refers to a sequence of characters denoting the date and or time at which a certain event occurred. This data is usually presented in a consistent format allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called timestamping. Timestamps are typically used for logging events in which case each event in a log is marked with a timestamp. In file systems timestamp may mean the stored date time of creation or modification of a file. The International Organization for Standardization ISO has defined ISO 8601 which standardizes timestamps.

For purposes of the present invention the term type of motion refers to a type of motion by all or part of the body of an individual. For example a walking motion by an individual is one type of motion and may cause a second type of motion i.e. a pendulum motion of any individual s wrist. A running motion by an individual is also one type of motion and may cause a second type of motion i.e. a cyclic motion at the individual s wrist later to a direction detected by one or more motion sensors. The motion of a motorized vehicle is another type of motion and may cause secondary and tertiary types of motion i.e. the forward motion of the vehicle the vibratory oscillation of the vehicle and the individual in the vehicle and the periodic motion of the individual s body during the normal course of operating the vehicle. A lack of motion is also considered as one type of motion and may be due for example to removing the dosimeter from the individual participant and placing it in a desk on a table top or on a fixed structure designed to act as a holder for the dosimeter.

For the purposes of the present invention the term web service refers to the term defined by the W3C as a software system designed to support interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network . Web services are frequently just web APIs that can be accessed over a network such as the Internet and executed on a remote system hosting the requested services. The W3C Web service definition encompasses many different systems but in common usage the term refers to clients and servers that communicate using XML messages that follow the SOAP standard. In such systems there is often machine readable description of the operations offered by the service written in the Web Services Description Language WSDL . The latter is not a requirement of a SOAP endpoint but it is a prerequisite for automated client side code generation in many Java and .NET SOAP frameworks. Some industry organizations such as the WS I mandate both SOAP and WSDL in their definition of a Web service. More recently RESTful Web services have been used to better integrate with HTTP compared to SOAP based services. They do not require XML messages or WSDL service API definitions.

For the purposes of the present invention the term wide area network WAN refers to a data communications network that covers a relatively broad geographic area i.e. one city to another and one country to another country and that often uses transmission facilities provided by common carriers such as telephone companies.

For the purposes of the present invention the term ZigBee refers a specification for a suite of high level communication protocols used to create personal area networks built from small low power digital radios. ZigBee is based on an IEEE 802 standard. Though low powered ZigBee devices often transmit data over longer distances by passing data through intermediate devices to reach more distant ones creating a mesh network i.e. a network with no centralized control or high power transmitter receiver able to reach all of the networked devices. The decentralized nature of such wireless ad hoc networks make them suitable for applications where a central node can t be relied upon. ZigBee may be used in applications that require a low data rate long battery life and secure networking. ZigBee has a defined rate of 250 kbit s best suited for periodic or intermittent data or a single signal transmission from a sensor or input device. Applications include wireless light switches electrical meters with in home displays traffic management systems and other consumer and industrial equipment that requires short range wireless transfer of data at relatively low rates. The technology defined by the ZigBee specification is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other WPANs such as Bluetooth or Wi Fi. Zigbee networks are secured by 128 bit encryption keys.

In existing passive integrating radiation monitoring devices such as film TLD or OSL sensors incident radiation is accumulated and stored within the molecular structure of the sensor without any need of electrical power. This characteristic makes passive sensors ideal for situations where the risk of a power interruption is unacceptable. Multiple radiation sensors are generally mounted in a holder containing one or more filters that alter the amounts energies and types of radiation able to reach the sensors. These filters typically sandwich the sensors to achieve correct assessments when the radiation enters the dosimeter from various angles of incidence. To analyze the sensors they must be removed from between the filters and the holder and physically presented to the processing system required to elicit the quantitative attribute exhibited by the sensor following exposure to radiation.

Radiation dosimeters based on optically stimulated luminescence OSL utilize an optical path whereby a stimulating beam of light can illuminate the OSL sensor s and the resultant radiation induced luminescence can be routed back through the same or alternate optical path to a light detector such as a photomultiplier tube that quantifies the amount of luminescent light. For more information on OSL materials and systems see U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 590 issued to Miller U.S. Pat. No. 6 846 434 issued to Akselrod U.S. Pat. No. 6 198 108 issued to Schweitzer et al. U.S. Pat.

Personnel dosimeters are expected to move relative to an exposure source during working hours the monitoring period as the individual wearing the dosimeter the participant moves during the normal course of performing the monitored activities. Dosimeters that remain stationary or static for extended periods of time cannot be in use and if the dosimeter should have been in use during a monitored period then the participant is out of compliance.

Furthermore if a dosimeter is exposed in the static state then that would be an abnormal occupational exposure that might occur for example if the participant was not. However if a dosimeter is exposed during normal motion then that would provide evidence of a routine as opposed to abnormal occupational exposure.

While ionizing radiation sensors encapsulated within filtration bubbles are shown for illustrative purposes those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the primary sensor array may consist of other suitable types of sensors e.g. for non ionizing radiation hazardous chemicals or other biochemical substances . Alternative embodiments of the disclosed invention may also include chemical or other sensors in addition and or as an alternative to ionizing radiation sensor . The present invention describes an integrated sensor module that provides unique information about the location and the motion of the sensor when a measurement is obtained. The modular nature of the described platform and device enables the use of other individual sensors or as variable combination of sensors chosen to meet the needs of potential end users. The modularity is achieved by developing the measurement devices as interchangeable modules that can be coupled to a central processing unit CPU that handles the collection of time motion position and temperature and the communication.

The primary sensor array may be integrated with a motion and global position sensor package The motion and global position sensor package will consist of a single 3 axis MEMS based accelerometer that will determine if a primary data exposure occurs while the device is stationary or in motion as measured on a continual basis. A primary data exposure is a radiological event recorded by the primary sensor array .

Radiation attenuating materials are used to modify the response of non tissue equivalent sensors to allow varying responses to a wide range of radiation qualities. The modified response can then be used by an algorithm to derive the tissue equivalent dose. Currently macro filters utilized in convention sensor devices have several shortcomings that limit the effectiveness of algorithms by introducing uncontrolled variances. The use of MEMS and nanotechnology manufacturing process to encapsulate the radiation sensors with filtration bubble provides several advantages over the traditional macro filters that will help eliminate the uncontrolled variances. The use of precise MEMS and nanotechnology manufacturing processes allows for the elimination of macro scale variances in the separation of the filter thickness of the filter and location of the filter. The filtration bubble will eliminate macro scale issues with angular dependence of the filtration. The filtration bubble will also provide a protective layer over the sensitive and possibly fragile sensor . The use of multiple attenuating materials around multiple sensors with the use of a software algorithm will allow increased levels of fine discrimination between types of ionizing radiation and radiation energy.

Detection occurs with the time motion and global position of the integrated sensor module wherein the integrated sensor module provides unique and valuable information on how the exposure occurred. The use of modular exposure sensors enables the detection and analysis of exposure to a wide range of phenomena including for example radiological chemical biological and electromagnetic sources of exposure. The use of time motion and position further enables the determination of whether the integrated sensor module was moving during an exposure event e.g. static versus dynamic exposures and when and where the exposure occurred. The present invention replaces the computationally intensive and time consuming post processing and analysis that is currently used by convention sensor devices to determine static versus dynamic exposures. The present invention also provides new time position and other information that may be used to accurately characterize the source and nature of the exposure. This capability may be particularly important useful in occupational dosimetry. The inclusion of a temperature sensor is disclosed embodiments enables correction of measurements for temperature based variance.

The wireless transmitter and receiver may be a low powered wireless network interface for the mobile communication device . The network interface allows the mobile communication device to communicate with SOC module to download collected data. The aforementioned communication facilitates the determination of whether mobile communication device is in range of integrated sensor module .

Mobile communication device may also be configured to include a data network interface . The data network interface allows mobile communication device to communicate to another wide area wireless network such as via data network transmission communication protocol . Examples of data network transmission communication protocol may include Wifi GSM EDGE CDMA UTMS HSPA LTE or other high speed wireless data communication network. Thus in an exemplary embodiment Bluetooth may be employed to communicate between the dosimetry badge and mobile communication device such as via wireless transmission communication protocol and the use of LTE to communicate between mobile communication device and wireless network such as via data network transmission communication protocol of a remote facility such as a hospital or laboratory. In this example the local network may be represented by wireless network and the public network may be indicated by as public data network . By communicating for example over the public data network the aforementioned remote facility such as a hospital or laboratory may reach access and or process information deposited on distributed data server .

GPS enables mobile communication device to determine the position of the radiological event. The GPS radio in the mobile communication device provides an alternative means of the determining the position of the integrated sensor module . If the integrated sensor module has been paired with a mobile communication device it will preferentially use GPS sensor to determine location to minimize its own power consumption.

Wireless network is configured to communicate with the public data network e.g. the Internet . A remote data server is configured to communicate with a public data network e.g. the Internet .

With an electronic data transmission link formed between mobile communication device and remote data server integrated sensor module is capable of transmitting measured data such as to an ultra low power wireless enabled mobile communication device e.g. a smartphone tablet or other mobile or non mobile network device to leverage the mobile device s existing data or cellular network to communicate collected information to a central web server and optionally to use the mobile communication device GPS or to process the collected data using the mobile communication device CPU. Currently standalone sensor devices have limited power capacity that must be conserved as much as possible in order to extend battery life. Ultra low power wireless communication minimizes the power consumption of device for regular updates. Furthermore typical data or cellular communication antennas can consume significant power so utilizing an external mobile communication device also limits the complexity of radiation sensor.

Thus the use of ultra low power wireless transmission capability of the present invention allows transmission of measured sensor readings from integrated sensor module to a wireless enabled mobile device e.g. a smartphone or tablet device etc. and the transmission of this information over a wireless data network to an Internet based server . This enables the analysis and reporting of measured doses for individual detectors employing integrated sensor module without having to physically send the detector itself to a central location for reading and analysis. The reduces costs and valuable time for receiving data and performing critical analysis. Embodiments of the present invention also allow for multiple systems to receive a plurality of measured doses from a plurality of detectors having integrated sensor module . The collection of sensor data from multiple systems enables the analysis and visualization and geographic based mapping of exposure sources and related population based trends over time. The connection to the Internet also enables the remote update and troubleshooting of the device.

Disclosed embodiments of the present invention may include mounting the integrated sensor module for example on multiple low cost semi autonomous unmanned airborne vehicles UAV s such as low power RF helicopters. A flocking algorithm may be employed to cause the flock of devices to track the position and distribution of airborne radiation chemicals or other phenomena while remaining in the flock and where the distribution of the flock would correlate with the distribution of the airborne material being tracked.

Thus in select embodiments the disclosed invention enables the integration of the integrated sensor module into a mobile platform that may consist of multiple semi autonomous UAV s to track the position and distribution of airborne materials radiation chemicals biological agents electromagnetic fields etc. . The UAV integrated sensors may utilize flocking algorithms to coordinate between multiple UAV s and track the position and distribution of airborne particles. Turning to an exemplary autonomous mobile sensor AMS network is illustrated. As shown in the airborne or waterborne particles will tend to cluster and then distribute depending for example upon prevailing weather patterns. Autonomous mobile sensors AMS are shown tracking respective distributed target particles . The flocking algorithm will update the position of all UAVs by using a Sensor Force Fs proportional to the measurement from the modular sensor array on the UAV and a Flocking Force Ff proportional to the distance to nearby UAV s to continually optimize the positions of the UAV sensors and to best track the position of the target particles . As a result the distribution of the flock will also correlate with the distribution of the airborne material being tracked.

In another embodiment the disclosed invention may include mounting integrated sensor module on multiple low cost semi autonomous and unmanned water based vehicles and tracking for example waterborne particles. Again the use of the previously described flocking algorithm may be employed to coordinate between multiple unmanned water based vehicles and to track the position and distribution of any water based radiation chemicals or other phenomena.

Advantages of the disclosed invention provide the first use of MEMS and nanotechnology to create a passive integrating electronic ionizing radiation detector with active readout capability and with motion sensing and position sensing capabilities and wireless transmission of the sensor readings. Current active dosimeters require continuous power in order to measure dose. Additionally current passive dosimeters do not provide immediate access to recorded dose measurements. Furthermore the active readout of a passive radiation sensor disclosed by the present invention provides immediate access to dose information while preserving dose information in the event of power loss. In addition the present invention describes an electronic platform for recording motion temperature and position with modular environmental sensors for comprehensive personal and environmental monitoring.

An exemplary integrated sensor module logic flow for integrated sensor module is represented in . A command for reading the sensor is executed. Command includes pre reading a high sensitivity sensor to determine if there is a new threshold dose on the sensor.

In determining whether there is a new threshold dose on the sensor the sensor is enabled to continuously accumulate dose values. When a read is performed on a specially designated high sensitivity sensor referred to hereinafter as a pre read of the dosimeter then a cumulative value is generated. The previous dose value is subtracted from the cumulative value generated from the pre read to generate a delta value. If the delta value above a prescribed dose threshold then a trigger measurement is taken in step . If the delta value is not above the prescribed dose threshold then a loopback function is performed to take continuous measurements at a timed interval to read the sensor . Described embodiments continuously loop back to pre read high sensitivity sensor until a delta dose value is detected to be higher than the prescribed dose threshold value. Once a delta dose value is detected to be higher than the prescribed dose threshold value a trigger measurement is enabled to simultaneously read a solid state sensor array also see and read out of the event data or position of exposure in time also see .

One disclosed embodiment of the sensor readout logic flow diagram is illustrated in . The solid state sensor array read out is the component of the disclosed invention that reads the entire sensor array. A reading from the high sensitivity sensor indicates that the minimum incremental dose threshold has been reached. The high sensitivity sensor is solely intended to indicate when the threshold dose has been exceeded. Once the threshold dose has been exceeded then all of the sensors will be read from a 1 D array a 2 D array or a 3 D matrix. A 1 D array may just be a row of sensors. A 2 D array may be a table of sensors or a matrix of sensors. A 3 D array would be if you stack up multiple 2 D arrays. There are multiple ways of reading the measurements from the sensors. We could either read each sensor individually or we might read out along an entire row or column of sensors or we might sum up the output from all of the sensors or we might readout a custom configuration e.g. four of the sensors in each quadrant if there was an array of multiple sensors e.g. sixteen sensors . Hence disclosed embodiments of the described invention provide multiple ways of reading a solid state sensor array.

One disclosed embodiment of the sensor readout logic flow diagram is illustrated in . The solid state sensor array read out is the component of the disclosed invention that reads the entire sensor array. In one example the high sensitivity sensor may be affixed to a badge. In an event where the badge is exposed to ionizing radiation the disclosed invention can read out all of the sensors required to calculate the exposed dose. Disclosed embodiments provide the ability to read individual a whole array of sensors and a custom configuration of sensors. Accordingly for various configurations of sensors the invention may generate readings for example for individual sensors such as a one dimensional array including for example a row of sensors. In addition to or alternatively dimensional arrays of sensors may be read by disclosed embodiments to include for example a table of sensors or a matrix of sensors. Such embodiments of sensor configurations may include a two dimensional array of sensors including for example one or more rows or one or more columns of sensors. Disclosed embodiments may also provide a three dimensional array for example including one or more two dimensional arrays stacked upon one another. Thus disclosed embodiments may either read sensors individually perform a two dimensional read out for example along an entire row or column of sensors or perform a sum of all of the output from all of the sensors or perform a readout for a custom configuration of sensors e.g. four of the sensors in each quadrant if there was an array of multiple sensors e.g. sixteen sensors . Hence disclosed embodiments of the described invention provide multiple ways of reading a solid state sensor array.

Disclosed embodiments provide electronic sensing circuitry to generate an analog measurement. The analog measurement is preferably converted to a digital measurement utilizing standard analog to digital conversion circuitry . From the digital data the dose is calculated by implementing an algorithm of the disclosed invention for calculating the dose on a system on a chip SOC e.g. via an arm processor . The calculated dose value is then recorded on a data record which may essentially generate a log of all of the readings on an ongoing basis.

In parallel with the solid state sensor array read out of the disclosed invention executes a read out of the event data or position of exposure in time . The position of exposure read out logic flow is illustrated in and may be executed via parallel circuitry. An on board MEMS accelerometer device is read to determine if the sensor is in motion. Next the location which can be considered the position in space with a specified level of granularity or spatial resolution of the sensor is estimated at step . This may be accomplished for example by reading the GPS sensor on the integrated sensor module or by using wireless communication to obtain the location from external location beacons or by using an on board algorithm to estimate the location e.g. using a dead reckoning algorithm or by communicating with a mobile device e.g. cell phone in which the GPS function of the mobile device is utilized to determine the geospatial position or by estimating the location by triangulation between external location beacons or other dosimeters.

In one embodiment of the present invention using GPS the GPS receiver of the mobile device determines position by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS satellites. Each satellite continually transmits messages that include the time the message was transmitted and the satellite position at the time of message transmission. The GPS receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite using the speed of light. Each of these distances and satellites locations define a sphere. The receiver is on the surface of each of these spheres when the distances and the satellites locations are correct. These distances and satellites locations are used to compute the location of the receiver using navigation equations. In another embodiment the position may be estimated by triangulating the position such as from a known wireless hub with which the sensor is communicating. Wireless triangulation is the process of determining a location of a point by measuring signal strength between several nodes of the wireless network. A time stamp is generated at step to record the time at which a measurement was taken. This measure correlates to the motion e.g. point at which on board MEMS accelerometer device is read and position e.g. the estimated position of the sensor at step at the time the sensor was read. The time stamp readings from step may then be exported or recorded to the data log. Thus the exposure event is captured in the data record .

Turning again to the above description outlines the generation of a dose value and a position of exposure in time in the log or recorded data records and respectively to generate a complete data record . The complete data record is saved or updated to the record log and the Send Timer is checked . The Send Timer determines when data should be uploaded to the base station or mobile communication device based on a programmable Time To Send value. For example if the dose exceeds a prescribed threshold value or if the prescribed time has elapsed then the dose value is transmitted and recorded . If the Time to Send value has not been reached then the device will return to reading .

The wireless transmission is started in order to initiate sending a signal from the sensor wireless SOC module of the integrated sensor module for example to wireless receiver of mobile communication device . The sensor s wireless SOC module looks for a handshake response from the wireless transmitter of the mobile communications device to determine if the device is in range for further communication. Wireless SOC module of the integrated sensor module can be configured to communicate with another electronic communications device such as base station to determine if it is within range of the electronic communications device. If a receiver is within range and a response is received then the operation continues . If a determination is made that the sensor is not in range then a determination of no is made and the operation returns to read the sensor again. When a determination is made that the sensor is in range a determination of yes is made and the data record is transmitted such that the log is updated to show that the data record has been transmitted and to record that the system has been updated. A continuous never ending number of readings may occur or as needed in the integrated sensor module logic flow .

Dosimetry badge is illustrated as a package containing for example the disclosed electronics packaging including integrated sensor module batteries and a cover of the present invention. Using the algorithm the integrated sensor module is configured to transmit data to a wireless communications device such as a wireless sensor base station . Dosimetry badge may communicate with wireless sensor base station via an unspecified wireless transmission communication protocol including for example Bluetooth Bluetooth Low Energy BLE ZigBee ANT ANT or other standard wireless communications protocols.

Wireless sensor base station includes a wireless transmitter and receiver . Wireless SOC module of integrated sensor module communicates with wireless transmitter and receiver to determine whether base station is in range of integrated sensor module as discussed for example in step of above. Wireless sensor base station may also include a data network interface . Data network interface allows wireless sensor base station to communicate to another wireless network such as via data network transmission communication protocol . Thus in an exemplary embodiment Bluetooth Low Energy BLE may be employed to communicate between the dosimetry badge and wireless sensor base station such as via wireless transmission communication protocol and Wi Fi may be employed to communicate between wireless sensor base station and wireless network such as via data network transmission communication protocol of a remote facility such as a hospital or laboratory. In this example the local network may be represented by wireless network and the public network may be indicated by as public data network . By communicating for example over the public data network the aforementioned remote facility such as a hospital or laboratory may reach access and or process information deposited on distributed data server .

In an optional configuration wireless sensor base station may include integrated sensor module . This configuration enables wireless sensor base station as an event sensing device as well acting for example as an environmental sensor.

As previously discussed disclosed embodiments of the invention may employ a unique numerically optimized dose calculation algorithm running in the embedded system software or optionally on the cloud based server to enable the discrimination between different types of ionizing radiation and different radiation energies. This enables a unique customization of the energy discrimination filtration scheme to improve the accuracy and energy resolution of ionizing radiation measurements using a passive radiation detector. Disclosed embodiments provide electronic sensing circuitry to generate an analog measurement. The analog measurement is preferably converted to a digital measure utilizing standard analog to digital conversion circuitry . From the digital data the dose is calculated by implementing the algorithm of the disclosed invention for calculating the dose on a system on a chip SOC e.g. via an arm processor . Select embodiments may employ for example a machine readable medium having stored thereon sequences of instructions which when executed by one or more processors cause one or more electronic devices to perform a set of operations to perform the aforementioned algorithm. The calculated dose value is then recorded on a data record which may essentially generate a log of all of the readings on a continuous basis.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention provides a numerically optimized dose calculation algorithm for accurate and reliable personal dosimetry. Disclosed embodiments provided a computational procedure to generate numerically optimized dose calculation algorithms for personal dosimeters using multiple dosimeter elements typically two to four elements . Current embodiments provide a description of how methods of the present invention transforms dosimeter signals to operational quantities for personal dose equivalents such as Hp 10 Hp 3 and Hp 0.07 . Some advantages of the computational procedure of the disclosed invention include the ability to automatically generate a numerically optimized algorithm the absence of branching or empirical decision points and fast computation speed.

The accurate and reliable measurement of a personal dose equivalent is a key component of radiation dosimetry programs. The personal dose equivalent is typically measured over a wide range of energies and from different radiation sources including for example x ray and gamma photons beta particles and neutrons. In order to accurately estimate the dose from different radiation sources some personal dosimeters incorporate multiple detector elements each with varying types of radiation filtration materials and use a dose calculation algorithm to calculate the personal dose equivalent from a numerical combination of the responses from each detector element.

One approach to calculate the dose is to use a simple linear combination of detector element responses. Such approaches are straight forward and easy to implement but may be highly sensitive to noise and often do not reliably provide an accurate estimate of the dose under realistic conditions. Another approach is to use empirically determined branching and decision points. According to exemplary embodiments this approach is relatively easy to implement and improves performance under some conditions but the empirical decisions are unique to specific conditions and often subject to systematic biases. Techniques for applying both linear combination and branching methods to radiation dosimetry have been developed for example by N. Stanford e.g. see N. Stanford Whole Body Dose Algorithm for the Landauer InLight Next Generation Dosimeter Algorithm Revision Next Gen IEC Sep. 13 2010 and N. Stanford Whole Body Dose Algorithm for the Landauer InLight Next Generation Dosimeter Algorithm Revision Next Gen NVLAP Sep. 27 2010 .

The present invention provides MATRIX i.e. a computational procedure to automatically generate a dose calculation algorithm that is numerically optimized for a particular dosimeter type i.e. a particular combination of dosimeter detector elements and filters . In order to minimize systematic bias the disclosed embodiment i.e. MATRIX calculates a weighted average from representative data such that no one irradiation field detector or ratio of detector signals dominates the resultant dose. The following describes the computational procedure used to generate a numerically optimized dose calculation algorithm for a personal dosimeter using a matrix of element responses obtained from measurements of that type of dosimeter.

Given a personal dosimeter consisting for example of multiple filtered detector elements the detected signal from each detector element is called the element response and the array of element responses from a given dosimeter is called the detector s element response pattern. For a given type of dosimeter the matrix resulting from multiple detector element responses at different but known irradiations is called the element response matrix.

The element response matrix is created by exposing a dosimeter to known irradiations at different angles and to mixtures of individual or multiple sources and then reading the element responses from each detector element. The element response pattern from an unknown irradiated dosimeter is then compared to the patterns in the element response matrix and a dose is calculated for each source in the response matrix. The final reported dose is the sum of all the individual source doses weighted by a Source Probability Factor. The Source Probability Factor is a measure of how closely the element response pattern of the unknown dosimeter matches the individual element response pattern of known sources.

The steps in the disclosed embodiment i.e. MATRIX computational procedure are summarized in Table 1 of and each computational procedure is described in the corresponding sections below.

In step the dosimeter element responses and the corresponding dosimeter response matrix for that type of dosimeter are input and then the converted values are calculated. For dosimeters employing optically simulated luminescence OSL such as LANDAUER s InLight dosimeters the dosimeter element responses correspond to the photomultiplier counts from the InLight Reader. The converted values are calculated from the PMT counts as shown in Equation 1 

The response matrix corresponding to the dosimeter type may be read from computer storage. In one disclosed example e.g. for LANDAUER InLight dosimeters the response matrix contains entries variables describing the source the individual element responses the deep dose equivalent DDE conversion factor and the standard deviations of the responses.

The response matrix selection may be based on empirically derived rules. In order to achieve optimal performance in a certain application the range of sources in the response matrix is restricted. This technique may cause a systematic error if radiation conditions occur outside the selected range. An implementation of the disclosed embodiment using selection cuts is described for example in Brahim Moreno LDR Europe Technical Report on a Hybrid MATRIX Branching dose calculation algorithm 2013.

Next a dose calculation may be performed. Given a set of measured converted values the first step is to calculate G1 4 for each field in the response matrix. Note that the values of G for a given field indicate what the SDE would be if the given field matched the actual incident field to the dosimeter.

The expected value of the SDE for a given field could be taken as the simple average of G over the detector elements. This however would be insufficient due to the fact that for some incident radiation fields several detectors may have signals with high levels of uncertainty. This turns out to be the case with 85Kr rays incident upon detectors with filtration over 0.1 g cc in density thickness. Because of this field is weakly penetrating the signals received from the filtered elements are too low relative to the noise level to use them to calculate dose.

A way to calculate dose using only detectors with a good signal is to weight the signal of each detector by a factor inversely proportional to the expected uncertainty and then perform a weighted average over the detectors. The first set is to define the expected uncertainty. Assume that each response matrix entry is determined from data for which the counting statistics were negligible high dose . This error is a combination of the uncertainties due to the irradiation reading handling and material variability. This combined error is computed as the standard deviation of the data used to generate the response matrix it is symbolized by .

The expected value of the SDE for field j is given by . The total uncertainty for the ith detector element and jth radiation field is by symbolized by .

Now that a weighting factor has been assigned to each field in the response matrix the reported SDE value Grep is calculated. This is done by taking the weighted sum of the expected values for each radiation field over the entire response matrix. This is given in Equation 5 where the sum is performed over a response matrix of N fields.

The quantification of similarity between the response pattern of a measured set of converted values and the fields in the response matrix can be derived using any optimization technique. Equations 3 4 are based on the 2 minimization. The source specific statistic and weighting factor are an empirical measure of how well the pattern of a set of measured converted values matches the patterns found in the response matrix.

In step a check for error conditions is performed. In this step common error conditions are checked and if detected the appropriate error conditions are set. The dose is not reported if a serious error condition is detected.

In step dose values are calculated for each source in the response matrix. In this step a weighted value for Hp 0.07 and Hp 10 are calculated for each element to form the response pattern for this dosimeter. Then a goodness of fit statistic is calculated and then a source weighting factor is determined.

In step disclosed embodiments calculate the total reportable doses. In this step the weighted values for Hp 0.07 and Hp 10 for each element are summed then the source weighting factors for each element are summed. The reportable Hp 0.07 and Hp 10 doses are calculated.

In step an estimate of the most likely source of radiation is performed. In this step the probable contribution of each source in the response matrix is estimated. In the currently disclosed algorithm the probable contribution of photons and beta particles is estimated.

In step the final net dose values are calculated. In this step the net dose is calculated by subtracting a control dose from the previously calculated dose. Only net doses greater than 1.0 mrem are reported.

In step the net dose values are outputted e.g. from memory to storage device. In this step the net dose is assigned to a specific dosimeter using the unique identification value stored in the dosimeter information database. The calculated Net Dose in computer memory is stored in the database or exported to an external data file if needed. The results can be formatted to allow the generation of dose of record customer dose reports as required by local national or international regulations.

A flowchart of the disclosed computational procedure for employing an algorithm to generate numerically optimized radiation dose calculations for personal dosimeters is illustrated in . Information data from the dosimeter readout background radiation dose and response matrix may be read and inputted from a computer storage such as a computer disk and stored to a machine readable medium such as memory . The machine readable medium or memory may have stored thereon sequences of instructions which when executed for example by one or more processors may cause one or more electronic devices to perform a set of operations to perform the disclosed computer algorithm. The disclosed computer algorithm processes the raw data e.g. dosimeter readout background radiation dose and response matrix and transforms it to useful information which may be further written to a computer storage such as a computer disk where the information may be configured to be displayed as needed.

After the raw data is received to memory disclosed embodiments check for error conditions . Common error conditions are checked and if detected the error may be flagged and all errors may be tracked tabulated on computer storage . If there is no error the raw data is processed by the disclosed computer algorithm . Computer algorithm begins by applying a mathematical algorithm using prescribed numerical procedures to optimize the response matrix. This may include calculating the expected source dose with a data fitting procedure. The inputs are the converted values and source responses. The response matrix weighting factor may be calculated using a goodness of fit statistic. The weighting factors tell you how much each source contributes to the final dose. An optimization technique may be selected based upon prescribed performance criteria. The Dose contribution may be calculated from the product of the weighting factor expected source does and dose conversion factor for personal dose equivalent e.g. Hp 10 mm Hp 0.07 mm and Hp 3 mm .

Once the optimal fit is found determined the reportable doses are calculated by summing the dose contributions for each source output dose. Radiation quality is assessed by performing a sum over the weighting factors multiplied by the source energy and particle identification. The radiation quality may be written to computer storage such as to computer storage . The net dose is calculated by subtracting the reportable doses and background dose. The net doses may be written to computer storage such as to computer storage .

There is a surge in interest in energy harvesting from human motion due to the rising demand for wearable electronics such as for patient monitoring in healthcare applications and wearable consumer products . However human vibration and motion energy is generally concentrated below 10 Hz which may cause difficulty because lower frequency sources are more difficult to design for due to the requirement of either a highly compliant spring or large mass.

The present invention uses energy harvesting through micro mechanical systems MEMS and photovoltaic systems to recharge the internal battery and extend the powered lifetime of the integrated sensor module . Embodiments of the disclosed invention also extend previous work using the MEMS devices of the integrated sensor module to convert resonant and vibrational mechanical motion into electrical energy and photovoltaic cells to convert ambient lighting into electrical energy. The present invention uses MEMS to convert the random mechanical energy of human motion into electrical energy and photovoltaics to convert ambient light into electrical energy both of which can be stored in a battery on the device and later used to power the above described sensors of the integrated sensor module . MEMS based energy harvesting can be accomplished with piezoelectric electrostatic or magneto static devices. Disclosed embodiments may detect vibration and motion energy at general concentrations below 10 Hz. Furthermore disclosed embodiments provide a power harvester wherein the power harvester converts mechanical vibration energy into electrical energy and wherein the resonant excitation of the power harvester has a frequency range of approximately 6 8 Hz.

Select embodiments may employ the ability to adjust the energy harvester to maximize the energy collected for a particular application. For example the aforementioned may include in a mechanical energy harvesting design using a magnet and coil wherein there exists the ability to adjust the size of the coil size and strength of the magnets etc. Piezoelectric energy harvesters convert mechanical strain of vibration in electrical energy. Electrostatic energy harvesters collect energy from the changing capacitance of vibrating separated charged parallel plate capacitors. Magneto static energy harvesters collect energy through the motion of a magnet near an electric coil such that the changing magnetic field of the moving magnet induces current flow in the electric coil. Photovoltaic energy harvesters are based on solar cells that convert solar or ambient indoor light into electric current.

It is well appreciated that other non limiting embodiments may be employed for example conversion of heat e.g. from a human or animal body or combustive device or other heat generating thermocouples into electrical energy suitable for use in a wireless sensor. Additional embodiments may include conversion of radiofrequency energy into electrical energy suitable for use in a wireless sensor. Other embodiments may employ a radiofrequency receiver coil to optimize the integration of RF receiver coils and sensors for example into fabric or clothing materials in order to maximize energy collection and sensing capabilities.

Disclosed embodiments address energy harvesting designs that may be employed as a power source for the disclosed sensor. Recently magnetically sprung or levitating electromagnetic energy harvesters have been studied by researchers . One key advantage of magnetic levitation is that the mechanical spring is replaced with a magnetic spring thus leading to an extended lifetime because the physical spring is the most likely component to fail. Additionally the removal of a physical spring allows the spring constant to be designed very low leading to a low resonant frequency. These characteristics make the levitating electromagnetic type energy harvester ideal for human motion energy harvesting.

Since on chip power is often not feasible the source of power may have to come from for example a magnetic field coupling. U.S. Pat. Application Pub. No. US 2010 0219494 A1 entitled Sub MM Wireless Ionizing Radiation Detector by Barnaby published Mar. 2 2010 and herein incorporated by reference discloses a standard approach implemented in many RFID products. In their 2008 paper Beyer et al. successfully demonstrated the use of RF energy harvesting to power a MOSFET dosimeter and a bidirectional communication interface.

Currently the majority of autonomous and mobile electronic systems are powered by electrochemical batteries. Although the battery quality has substantially improved over the last two decades their energy density has not greatly increased. At present factors such as cost weight. Limited service time and waste disposal problems intrinsic to batteries are impeding the advance in many areas of electronics. The problem is particularly acute in the portable electronics market where rapidly growing performance and sophistication of mobile electronic devices has led to ever increasing generating several watts power demands that traditional electrochemical batteries are unable to meet.

U.S. Pat. Application Pub. No. US 2012 0181901 A1 entitled Method and Apparatus for Mechanical Energy Harvesting Using Planar Microfluidic Device by Krupenkin et al. published Jul. 19 2012 and herein incorporated by reference discloses an energy harvester which illustrates a train of energy producing conductive droplets located along a microscopically thin channel where droplets are suspended within a liquid dielectric medium and are hydraulically actuated by applying a pressure differential between the ends of channel. Pluralities of separate electrodes and are disposed along either side of channel which engage with droplets as they move back and forth within channel during changes in pressure. As conductive droplets move along channel they create arrays of capacitors with electrodes and the capacitors changing in stored charge as the droplets move back and worth generating an electrical current flow. This type of hydraulic activation method provides an important advantage as it allows for efficient direct coupling with a wide range of high power environmental mechanical energy sources including human locomotion.

While the microfluidic based energy harvester of Krupenkin et al. exhibits a significant improvement over the state of the art this actuation method is not well suited for applications where the energy is being harvested from mechanical vibrations since the displacement amplitude of a vibration is often too small to initiate motion of droplets along a channel. Yet such vibrations constitute a readily available source of energy in many important environments including transportation e.g. automotive aerospace rail industrial machinery and the like. Thus any method that can provide effective actuation of microscopically small liquid droplets by environmental mechanical vibrations would be highly beneficial as it would allow for the extension of energy harvesting to a broader range of environments. power demands that traditional electrochemical batteries are unable to meet.

One of the technologies that holds great promise to substantially alleviate the current reliance on the electrochemical batteries is high power energy harvesting. The concept of energy harvesting works towards developing self powered devices that do not require replaceable power supplies. In cases where high mobility and high power output is required harvesters that convert mechanical energy into electrical energy are particularly promising inasmuch as they can tap into a variety of high power density energy sources that exhibit mechanical vibrations.

High power harvesting of mechanical energy is a long recognized concept yet it has not been able to be commercialized due at least in part to the lack of a viable energy harvesting technology. Existing methods of mechanical to electrical energy conversion such as electromagnetic piezoelectric or electrostatic do not allow for effective direct coupling to most of the high power environmental mechanical energy sources. Bulky and expensive mechanical or hydraulic transducers are required to convert a broad range of aperiodic forces and displacements typically encountered in nature into a form accessible for conversion using these methods.

Recently a new approach to energy harvesting has been proposed that substantially alleviates the above mentioned problems the new approach being the use of a microfluidics based energy harvester. In particular a high power microfluidics based energy harvester is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 898 096 entitled Method and Apparatus for Energy Harvesting Using Micro fluidics issued to T. N. Krupenkin on Mar. 2 2011 and herein incorporated by reference.

Krupenkin discloses an apparatus comprising a mechanical to electrical energy converting device having a plurality of electrodes and a fluidic body which comprises spatially separated conductive and dielectric liquid regions. The fluidic body is configured to reversibly move as a whole with respect to the plurality of electrodes under the influence of a mechanical force. Each cycle of the reversible motion of said fluidic body causes multiple alternations of the amount of electrical charge accumulated by the electrodes whereby generating electrical current flow between the electrodes.

The apparatus of Krupenkin comprises two substrates and disposed substantially co planar and separated by spacers and. Spacers and are disposed in such a way as to form a channel. A plurality of electrodes is disposed on substrate and a plurality of electrodes is disposed on substrate. Substrates and spacers can be made of any solid dielectric material such as glass textolite or a solid plastic including polycarbonate polypropylene or polytetrafluoroethylene. The electrodes can be made of any solid conductive material such as gold or tantalum or indium tin oxide glass. In some preferred embodiments comprise a tantalum film or a gold film.

A movable fluidic body is disposed in channel and configured to slide along channel past electrodes. Fluidic body consists of two immiscible liquids one being a dielectric liquid and the other one being an electrically conductive liquid. Examples of suitable electrically conductive liquids include aqueous salt solutions and molten salts. Exemplary aqueous salt solutions include 0.01 molar solutions of salts such as CuSO LiCl KNO or NaCl. Exemplary molten salts include 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate which are both commercially available. In other cases the conductive liquid can comprise liquid metals such as gallium indium or mercury. Examples of suitable dielectric liquids include silicone oils and alkanes. Exemplary silicone oils include polydimethylsiloxane and polydiphenylsiloxane and exemplary alkanes include nonane and heaxadecane.

Conductive and dielectric liquids are spatially separated in a plurality of distinct regions. Dielectric liquid regions and conductive liquid regions are arranged in a periodic alternating pattern such that conductive and dielectric regions regularly alternate. The boundaries between immiscible liquid regions are preserved by the surface tension forces giving fluidic body an ability to move as a whole e.g. slide along channel without disturbing the arrangement and volume of the above mentioned distinct liquid regions.

The needs remaining in the art are addressed by the present invention which relates to the harvesting of electrical energy from mechanical vibrational movement and more particularly to the utilization of a plurality of microfluidic elements to convert vibrational energy into useful electrical energy.

In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention an array of conductive liquid droplets is disposed on a base substrate and separated from a dielectric covered electrode by an elastic spacer forming a capacitive array structure. The elastic spacer is periodically compressed in response to external vibrations which in turn causes the droplets to be periodically squeezed between the electrode and base substrate.

Mechanical energy comprises a number of forms of energy including but not limited to kinetic energy. Mechanical energy is manifested in the bodies of humans and animals as a result of their physical processes. Such physical processes include voluntary body movements. Amongst voluntary body movements are gait processes. Gait activities include stepping walking running climbing jumping and similar activities. Other voluntary body movements include grasping reaching shaking swinging stretching etc. All voluntary body movements are manifested as motion of body members having mass so that all voluntary motor activities develop kinetic energy. Further voluntary motor activities may impart kinetic energy to peripheral masses engaged with a moving body.

It is often desirable to convert mechanical energy to electrical energy. An example is the conversion of kinetic energy into electrical energy as the kinetic energy of a mass moves a magnetic field relative to a conductive coil thereby converting the kinetic energy of the mass to electrical energy by action of electromagnetic induction.

Kinetic energy is manifested in the bodies of animals and humans as a result of different voluntary motor activities. Voluntary motor activities include for example gait processes leg movements arm movements head movements torso movements and the like. Kinetic energy is also manifested in the objects or masses that are moved by a human or animal in the course of transporting them. Some voluntary motor activities such as human walking gait are rhythmic activities which have a predictable frequency or periodicity. In the case of human walking gait the predictable frequency is approximately 2 Hz.

An electrical energy generator for harvesting kinetic energy and converting the harvested kinetic energy developed or imparted by voluntary motor activities into electrical energy is provided. The electrical energy generator may generally comprise a housing an induction coil an electromagnetically active mass movable in a reciprocating manner relative to the housing and at least one spring engaging the electromagnetically active mass to the housing.

By harvesting mechanical energy from the reciprocating mass and converting it into electrical energy the device acts as a linear electrical generator. The generated electrical energy may be used to power a wide variety of electronic devices including without limitation locators signaling equipment entertainment equipment energy storage equipment radio receivers radio transmitters wireless telephones cameras global positioning system GPS equipment and like electronic devices.

In the case of determining the identity of the individual the motion data from multiple sensors such as from the accelerometer from a gyroscope or from an energy harvester may be compared to motion data for a plurality of individuals in a database to find a best match. In the case of confirming the identity of an individual the motion data has identity data for the individual associated with the motion data and the motion data is compared against existing motion data for the individual in the data base.

In one embodiment of the present invention motion data may be analyzed and used to estimate the probability that the dosimeter was worn by an individual to whom it had been assigned versus the probability that it was worn by someone other than the participant to whom it had been assigned . Supervised machine learning techniques may be used to train a computer program to classify the data as indicating that a dosimeter has or has not been worn by an individual. Unsupervised machine learning techniques may be used to estimate the probabilities that an individual has worn a dosimeter.

In one embodiment of the present invention motion data may be generated by motion sensors based upon an individual s motion activity patterns throughout the course of the work day such as the individual s walking gait the individual s breathing pattern and any characteristic motion related habits that the individual may have. Previous work has demonstrated the ability to distinguish motion activity for static postures such as standing sitting or lying down and dynamic postures such as walking running climbing stairs bicycling and driving in a motorized vehicle.

Another example is that an individual might operate machinery that has a characteristic pattern of vibration or motion that can be used to identify deviations from normal use of the dosimeter.
