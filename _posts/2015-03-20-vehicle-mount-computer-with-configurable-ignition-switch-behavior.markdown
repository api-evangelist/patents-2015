No. 12 983 611 for a Vehicle Mount Computer with Configurable Ignition Switch Behavior filed Jan. 3 2011 and published Jul. 5 2012 as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012 0173038 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 996 194. Each of the foregoing patent application patent publication and patent is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The invention relates generally to vehicle mounted computer systems and more particularly to a vehicle mounted computer system having user configurable behavior controlled by the vehicle s ignition switch.

Computer terminals are often mounted on vehicles in warehouses manufacturing facilities and other workplaces to collect and display data. For example vehicle mount computers are commonly found on forklift trucks and other utility vehicles. Vehicle mount computers generally include one or more user interfaces such as a touch screen display and a keyboard or keypad. Many vehicle mount computers also include a wireless radio for communicating with a remote device such as another computer or server.

Vehicle mount computers are typically connected to the vehicle s battery to receive supply power. Conventional vehicle mount computers include a power switch or button that an operator can manipulate to turn the vehicle mount computer on and off. Often times operators leave the vehicle without turning the computer off. For example an operator may shut down the vehicle at the end of the day but forget to turn off the vehicle mount computer. This can drain the battery and render the vehicle unusable for the next operator or the next work shift. Furthermore operators often forget to log out of vehicle mount computers at the conclusion of their work shift. This can allow unauthorized users access to the vehicle mount computer and possibly to a network that the vehicle mount computer is connected to. In addition the vehicle mount computer s operating system may require an operator to log in again after a certain amount of idle time. This can prevent other operators from logging into the locked computer until an administrator can unlock the computer.

Some organizations computer administrators prefer that the computers they are responsible for are placed into a certain state when the computer is not in use. For example a computer administrator may request that users log off of their computers so that updates to applications and network security can be performed. However many computer users fail to abide by these preferences causing a nuisance to the administrators.

The present invention provides methods and systems for controlling a computer by way of a vehicle s ignition switch. The computer can be mounted to or otherwise installed on a vehicle such as a forklift truck or utility vehicle. The vehicle s ignition switch can be logically coupled as an input to the computer so that the computer can detect or receive an indication of the ignition switch s position. For example the ignition switch can be electrically coupled to the computer s power button such that the computer s operating system detects ignition switch position changes similar to detecting power button depressions.

The computer can be configured by a user such as an operator or computer administrator to perform an action switch to a different mode log off the current user execute a software application or transmit data to another computer or device in response to the ignition switch being pressed or the position of the ignition switch being adjusted. For example the computer can be configured to switch to a standby mode switch to a hibernation mode shutdown prompt the operator to select an action execute an application or do nothing in response to the ignition switch being placed in an off position or being depressed while the computer is in an active mode. The computer also may be configured to switch from a non active mode to the active mode in response to the ignition switch being turned on or pressed.

Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a vehicle mountable computer system. The vehicle mountable computer system can include a user interface for receiving a user input specifying an action for the vehicle mount computer system to perform automatically in response to an ignition switch of a vehicle switching from a first position to a second position. An input of the vehicle mountable computer can receive an electrical signal indicating that the ignition switch has switched from the first position to the second position. An application module logically coupled to the input can cause the vehicle mount computer to perform the specified action in response to receiving the electrical signal.

Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a system that includes a vehicle and a computer mounted thereon. The vehicle can include an ignition switch for selectively activating and deactivating the vehicle. The computer can include a user interface for receiving user input specifying an action for the computer to perform automatically in response to the ignition switch being switched to a certain position. The computer also can include an input electrically coupled to the ignition switch to receive an electrical signal indicating that the ignition switch has switched to the certain position. An application module of the computer can cause the computer to perform the specified action in response to receiving the electrical signal.

Application modules can include routines sub routines programs objects components data structures etc. which perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. For example the application module may be an inventory application for use in collecting and displaying inventory information in a warehouse.

As described in further detail below the operating system or another application module can be configured by a user to perform certain actions or tasks when the power button is pressed. For example the operating system can be configured to cause the vehicle mount computer to stand by hibernate shut down do nothing prompt the operator for what action to perform start an application module or to transmit data e.g. in a batch to another computer or device when the power button is pressed and the vehicle mount computer is turned on. The standby mode is a power saving mode where most or all components of the vehicle mount computer switches to a low power state. The hibernate mode includes storing an image of the vehicle mount computer s current state and shutting almost completely off. The vehicle mount computer can use the stored image to return to that state when returning from the hibernate mode. If configured to prompt the operator for what action to perform the operating system can present a dialog box including the possible actions for the operator to select from. In certain exemplary embodiments the operating system is Advanced Configuration and Power Interface ACPI compliant such as MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP.

The operating system is logically coupled to the power button for example via the system bus to receive a signal indicating whether the power button is pressed. In response to receiving this indication signal the operating system performs the user configured action. In certain exemplary embodiments the operating system includes default settings for responding to the power button being pressed. The user can retain the default settings or adjust the default settings as described below.

An operator can enter commands and information to the vehicle mount computer through the input devices such as the keypad and the user configurable keys . These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit through a serial port interface that is coupled to the system bus but can be connected by other interfaces such as a parallel port game port or the like.

The display also can be connected to the system bus via an interface such as a video adapter to receive content for display by the display . The exemplary display incorporates a touch sensitive screen coupled to the processing unit by way of a touch screen controller . For example the touch sensitive screen can include resistive capacitive surface acoustic wave SAW infrared IR strain gauge dispersive signal technology acoustic pulse recognition and optical touch sensing technology as would be readily understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the present disclosure. The touch screen controller can determine the location of a user s touch e.g. with a finger stylus pen or other object on or near the touch sensitive screen . In addition to the display the vehicle mount computer can include other peripheral output devices such as speakers not shown .

The vehicle mount computer is configured to operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers . The remote computer can be any network device such as a personal computer a server a client a router a network PC a peer device or other device. While the remote computer typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the vehicle mount computer only a memory storage device has been illustrated in for simplicity. The logical connection depicted in includes a wireless LAN WLAN that the vehicle mount computer communicates with via an antenna not shown . In a networked environment program modules depicted relative to the vehicle mount computer or portions thereof can be stored in the remote memory storage device .

It will be appreciated that the network connection shown in is exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers can be used. For example the vehicle mount computer can communicate via Bluetooth Zigbee induction wireless or any other suitable wireless or wired technology. Moreover those skilled in the art will appreciate that the vehicle mount computer illustrated in can have any of several other suitable computer system configurations. For example the vehicle mount computer may not include certain components in alternative exemplary embodiments.

As briefly discussed above an operator or other user can configure the operating system or another program module to switch modes or perform one or more actions in response to the power button being pressed. The vehicle mount computer also can be configured such that the operating system performs the one or more actions in response to the vehicle s ignition switch being switched from one position to another or being pressed. In such a configuration a user can configure the operating system to cause the vehicle mount computer to standby hibernate shut down do nothing log off the current user prompt the user for what action to perform start and or execute an application module or to transmit data to a remote computer in response to the ignition switch being switched from one position to another or being pressed.

The operating system can be configured to perform one or more of the actions based on the ignition switch position and the current state or mode of the vehicle mount computer . For example a user can configure the operating system to switch the vehicle mount computer to a power saving mode e.g. standby hibernate or shutdown in response to the ignition switch being switched to an off position or being pressed while the vehicle mount computer is in an active mode. In another example a user can configure the operating system to switch the vehicle mount computer to the active mode in response to the ignition switch being placed in an on position or being pressed while the vehicle mount computer is in an inactive mode. In yet another example the operating system can be configured to prompt the user for what action to perform or execute and application in response to the ignition switch being switched to an on position or being pressed while the vehicle mount computer is in the active mode. In yet another example the operating system can be configured to transmit data such as batch inventory data to a remote computer in response to the ignition switch being switched to an off position or being pressed while the vehicle is in an active mode. In yet another example the operating system can be configured to transmit data to a remote computer and then switch to an inactive or power saving mode in response to the ignition switch being switched to an off position or being pressed while the vehicle is in an active mode.

This unique ignition switch configurable behavior enables users or computer administrators to place the vehicle mount computer into a preferred state when the vehicle is turned off. For example the operating system may cause the vehicle mount computer to switch to a power saving mode e.g. hibernate standby or shutdown when the vehicle is turned off. Or the operating system may log off the current user so that another user can log in to the vehicle mount computer . This ignition switch control can obviate the need for a user to consciously place the vehicle mount computer into the preferred state for example at the end of a work shift.

The vehicle includes a battery that provides power to the vehicle and to the vehicle mount computer . The battery is electrically coupled to the computer s power supply via a power supply an on off switch a diode and one or more electrical conductors. In certain exemplary embodiments the power supply is a DC DC isolated power supply that converts the voltage level of the battery to a voltage level suitable for the power supply . For example the power supply may convert a 10 VDC 100 VDC supply provided by the battery to 13.2 VDC for the power supply .

An operator can selectively apply or remove power from the vehicle mount computer using the on off switch . The on off switch can be mounted on the vehicle and is typically mounted proximal to the vehicle mount computer . For example the on off switch may be mounted on a docking or mounting assembly that also supports the vehicle mount computer . In alternative exemplary embodiments the on off switch is mounted near the vehicle s ignition switch .

The vehicle mount computer also includes a backup battery connected to the computer s power supply via a diode and one or more electrical conductors. The backup battery can provide power to the power supply when external power is not available. For example if the vehicle s battery is drained the backup battery may power the vehicle mount computer .

The ignition switch is used to activate and deactivate the vehicle . In certain exemplary embodiments the ignition switch includes a first on position for activating the vehicle and a second off position for deactivating the vehicle . An operator can activate the vehicle by inserting a key into the ignition switch and placing the ignition switch in the on position. To deactivate the vehicle the operator can place the ignition switch in the off position. In certain exemplary embodiments the ignition switch may include additional positions such as a start position for gas powered vehicles and an accessory position. The operating system or other application module can be configured by a user to perform an action based on each position and optionally the current mode or state of the vehicle mount computer .

In certain alternative exemplary embodiments the switch can be embodied as another type of switch such as a pushbutton switch a slider switch or a rotary switch to name a few. If the switch is a pushbutton switch or other type of momentary switch the vehicle may be started and stopped in response to the switch being pressed.

In the illustrated embodiment the ignition switch is electrically coupled in series with the power button between the battery and the power button input of the vehicle mount computer . In such a configuration the ignition switch can control the power button input to the operating system . That is the operating system can detect the position of the ignition switch similar to detecting inputs from the power button . Accordingly the operating system responds to the position of the ignition switch based on the user configuration. In certain alternative embodiments the ignition switch is electrically coupled to another input of the vehicle mount computer rather than the power button input .

In certain alternative embodiments the ignition switch is electrically coupled to the power button input in parallel with the power button . In such embodiments an operator can use the ignition switch or the power button to control the vehicle mount computer .

In either implementation the operating system can detect the position or status of the ignition switch and in response cause the vehicle mount computer to perform an action switch between modes of operation execute an application do nothing log off the current user or prompt the user to select an action. The action performed by the operating system can be configured by a user and also can depend on the current mode or state of the vehicle mount computer . For example if the ignition switch is turned to the on position while the vehicle mount computer is turned off the operating system can detect the ignition switch s position and cause the vehicle mount computer to turn on. In another example if the vehicle mount computer is in an active mode and the ignition switch is moved to the off position the operating system can cause the vehicle mount computer to perform an action or switch to a certain mode of operation such as the standby mode or hibernation mode.

As shown in the power button and the power button input are electrically coupled in series to the negative terminal ground of the battery . In alternative embodiments the power button and the power button input can be electrically coupled in series to the positive terminal of the battery for example in parallel with an ignition input to the computer terminal that is coupled to the operating system . In this manner the negative terminal of the battery can always be connected to the vehicle mount computer without a switch. The power button and the ignition input can have always on logic if the power supply and the on off switch are on that can initiate the configured response of the vehicle mount computer either by the power button or the ignition switch .

Referring to in block a user configures the operating system of the vehicle mount computer to perform one or more actions or procedures switch to a mode of operation execute an application module or transmit data to a remote computer based on the position of the ignition switch . For example the operating system may be configured to switch to a standby mode a hibernation mode or shut down in response to the ignition switch being switched to the off position or pressed if a momentary switch while the vehicle mount computer is in an active state. In another example the operating system may be configured to prompt the user for what to do in response to the ignition switch being switched to the off position or pressed if a momentary switch while the vehicle mount computer is in an active state. In yet another example the operating system may be configured to do nothing start and execute an application module or log a current user off of the vehicle mount computer in response to the ignition switch being switched to the off position or pressed while the vehicle mount computer is in an active mode. In yet another example the operating system can be configured to transmit data such as batch inventory data to a remote computer in response to the ignition switch being switched to an off position or being pressed while the vehicle is in an active mode. In yet another example the operating system can be configured to transmit data to a remote computer and then switch to an inactive or power saving mode in response to the ignition switch being switched to an off position or being pressed while the vehicle is in an active mode.

In certain exemplary embodiments the user can configure the operating system via a control menu. For example the operating system may provide a menu having a list of possible actions to perform or modes of operation to switch to in response to the ignition switch being placed in a certain position or pressed. The user can select one or more preferred actions to be performed from the list. In certain exemplary embodiments the vehicle mount computer includes default actions that are performed based on the position of the ignition switch and optionally based on the current state of the vehicle mount computer . The user can customize the vehicle mount computer to perform desirable actions rather than the default actions.

In block the operating system stores the configuration in memory . In block the operating system monitors the ignition switch . For example the operating system may monitor the power button input or another input logically coupled to the ignition switch . In block the operating system conducts an inquiry to determine whether the position of the ignition switch . For example the operating system can store the current position of the ignition switch periodically. The operating system can compare the current position of the ignition switch to a previously stored position to determine whether the position has changed. If the ignition switch is a pushbutton switch the operating system can monitor for the ignition switch being pressed. If the operating system determines that the position of the ignition switch has changed or has been pressed then the method follows the YES branch to block . Otherwise the method follows the NO branch to return to block where the operating system continues to monitor the position of the ignition switch .

In block the operating system causes the vehicle mount computer to perform the configured action based on the position of the ignition switch and optionally the current mode of the vehicle mount computer . For example if the vehicle mount computer system is not in the active mode then the configured response may be to switch the vehicle mount computer to the active mode in response to the ignition switch being turned on or pressed. In another example if the vehicle mount computer is in the active mode then the configured action may be to switch to a power saving mode. The method returns to block from block to monitor the position of the ignition switch .

One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the present invention provides a vehicle mount computer having a configurable behavior controlled by a vehicle s ignition switch. A user can configure the computer to perform an action switch to a different mode or execute a software application in response to the ignition switch being pressed or the position of the ignition switch being adjusted. For example the computer can be configured to switch to a standby mode hibernation mode shutdown prompt the user to select an action or do nothing in response to the ignition switch being placed in an off position. The ignition switch can be electrically coupled to an input of the computer so that the computer s operating system or another application can monitor the status of the ignition switch. The operating system or application can cause the computer to perform the configured response upon detecting a change in the ignition switch s position or an actuation of the ignition switch.
