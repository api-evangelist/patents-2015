The present invention relates generally to the field of molecular biology. More particularly it concerns methods and compositions involving nucleic acid molecules that simulate microRNA miRNAs and that inhibit miRNAs. Methods and compositions involving synthetic miRNAs and miRNA inhibitor molecules are described. In addition methods and compositions for identifying miRNAs that contribute to cellular processes are also described. In addition the identification of miRNAs that contribute to cellular processes provides targets for therapeutic intervention as well as diagnostic and or prognostic analysis.

In 2001 several groups used a novel cloning method to isolate and identify a large group of microRNAs miRNAs from and humans Lagos Quintana et al. 2001 Lau et al. 2001 Lee and Ambros 2001 . Several hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in plants and animals including humans which do not appear to have endogenous siRNAs. Thus while similar to siRNAs miRNAs are nonetheless distinct.

miRNAs thus far observed have been approximately 21 22 nucleotides in length and they arise from longer precursors which are transcribed from non protein encoding genes. See review of Carrington et al. 2003 . The precursors form structures that fold back on each other in self complementary regions they are then processed by the nuclease Dicer in animals or DCL1 in plants. miRNA molecules interrupt translation through precise or imprecise base pairing with their targets.

miRNAs seem to be involved in gene regulation. Some miRNAs including lin 4 and let 7 inhibit protein synthesis by binding to partially complementary 3 untranslated regions 3 UTRs of target mRNAs. Others including the Scarecrow miRNA found in plants function like siRNA and bind to perfectly complementary mRNA sequences to destroy the target transcript Grishok et al. 2001 .

Research on microRNAs is increasing as scientists are beginning to appreciate the broad role that these molecules play in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. The two best understood miRNAs lin 4 and let 7 regulate developmental timing in by regulating the translation of a family of key mRNAs reviewed in Pasquinelli 2002 . Several hundred miRNAs have been identified in mouse and humans. As would be expected for molecules that regulate gene expression miRNA levels have been shown to vary between tissues and developmental states. In addition one study shows a strong correlation between reduced expression of two miRNAs and chronic lymphocytic leukemia providing a possible link between miRNAs and cancer Calin 2002 . Although the field is still young there is speculation that miRNAs could be as important as transcription factors in regulating gene expression in higher eukaryotes.

There are a few examples of miRNAs that play critical roles in cell differentiation early development and cellular processes like apoptosis and fat metabolism. lin 4 and let 7 both regulate passage from one larval state to another during development Ambros 2003 . mir 14 and bantam are miRNAs that regulate cell death apparently by regulating the expression of genes involved in apoptosis Brennecke et al. 2003 Xu et al. 2003 . MiR14 has also been implicated in fat metabolism Xu et al. 2003 . Lsy 6 and miR 273 are miRNAs that regulate asymmetry in chemosensory neurons Chang et al. 2004 . Another animal miRNA that regulates cell differentiation is miR 181 which guides hematopoietic cell differentiation Chen et al. 2004 . These molecules represent the full range of animal miRNAs with known functions. Enhanced understanding of the functions of miRNAs will undoubtedly reveal regulatory networks that contribute to normal development differentiation inter and intra cellular communication cell cycle angiogenesis apoptosis and many other cellular processes. Given their important roles in many biological functions it is likely that miRNAs will offer important points for therapeutic intervention or diagnostic analysis.

Characterizing the functions of biomolecules like miRNAs often involves introducing the molecules into cells or removing the molecules from cells and measuring the result. If introducing a miRNA into cells results in apoptosis then the miRNA undoubtedly participates in an apoptotic pathway. Methods for introducing and removing miRNAs from cells have been described. Two recent publications describe antisense molecules that can be used to inhibit the activity of specific miRNAs Meister et al. 2004 Hutvagner et al. 2004 . Another publication describes the use of plasmids that are transcribed by endogenous RNA polymerases and yield specific miRNAs when transfected into cells Zeng et al. 2002 . These two reagent sets have been used to evaluate single miRNAs.

A limitation of the plasmid based miRNA expression system is that the transfection efficiencies for plasmids tend to be very low with only approximately 50 of cells expressing RNA from the plasmid in cells that are easy to transfect. Transfection efficiencies for plasmids in primary cells are much lower with fewer than 10 of cells typically expressing the desired RNA. Therefore there is a need for alternative compositions and methods for introducing miRNA molecules into cells so that they can be characterized and studied.

The present invention is based on the inventors studies regarding the introduction into cells of one or more nucleic acids that function like miRNA or inhibit the activities of one or more miRNAs in cells to characterize their roles in various biological processes. The invention concerns nucleic acids that perform the activities of endogenous miRNAs when introduced into cells. These nucleic acids are synthetic miRNA in some embodiments. The invention further concerns a library of synthetic miRNAs specific to a variety of known miRNAs that can be used to introduce sequentially or in combination one or more miRNAs into cells in vitro or in vivo for the purpose of identifying miRNAs that participate in cellular processes. The invention further involves a library of sequence specific miRNA inhibitors that can be used to inhibit sequentially or in combination the activities of one or more miRNAs in cells. The two libraries of miRNA specific reagents are used to introduce or eliminate specific miRNAs or combinations of miRNAs to define the roles of miRNAs in cells.

The term miRNA is used according to its ordinary and plain meaning and refers to a microRNA molecule found in eukaryotes that is involved in RNA based gene regulation. See e.g. Carrington et al. 2003 which is hereby incorporated by reference. The term will be used to refer to the single stranded RNA molecule processed from a precursor. Individual miRNAs have been identified and sequenced in different organisms and they have been given names. Names of miRNAs and their sequences are provided herein. Additionally other miRNAs are known to those of skill in the art and can be readily implemented in embodiments of the invention. The methods and compositions should not be limited to miRNAs identified in the application as they are provided as examples not necessarily as limitations of the invention.

The present invention concerns in some embodiments of the invention short nucleic acid molecules that function as miRNAs or as inhibitors of miRNA in a cell. The term short refers to a length of a single polynucleotide that is 150 nucleotides or fewer. The nucleic acid molecules are synthetic. The term synthetic means the nucleic acid molecule is isolated and not identical in sequence the entire sequence and or chemical structure to a naturally occurring nucleic acid molecule such as an endogenous precursor miRNA molecule. While in some embodiments nucleic acids of the invention do not have an entire sequence that is identical to a sequence of a naturally occurring nucleic acid such molecules may encompass all or part of a naturally occurring sequence. It is contemplated however that a synthetic nucleic acid administered to a cell may subsequently be modified or altered in the cell such that its structure or sequence is the same as non synthetic or naturally occurring nucleic acid such as a mature miRNA sequence. For example a synthetic nucleic acid may have a sequence that differs from the sequence of a precursor miRNA but that sequence may be altered once in a cell to be the same as an endogenous processed miRNA. The term isolated means that the nucleic acid molecules of the invention are initially separated from different in terms of sequence or structure and unwanted nucleic acid molecules such that a population of isolated nucleic acids is at least about 90 homogenous and may be at least about 95 96 97 98 99 or 100 homogenous with respect to other polynucleotide molecules. In many embodiments of the invention a nucleic acid is isolated by virtue of it having been synthesized in vitro separate from endogenous nucleic acids in a cell. It will be understood however that isolated nucleic acids may be subsequently mixed or pooled together.

Of course it is understood that a synthetic nucleic acid of the invention means that the nucleic acid does not have a chemical structure or sequence of a naturally occurring nucleic acid. Consequently it will be understood that the term synthetic miRNA refers to a synthetic nucleic acid that functions in a cell or under physiological conditions as a naturally occurring miRNA.

While many of the embodiments of the invention involve synthetic miRNAs or synthetic nucleic acids in some embodiments of the invention the nucleic acid molecule s need not be synthetic. In certain embodiments a non synthetic miRNA employed in methods and compositions of the invention may have the entire sequence and structure of a naturally occurring miRNA precursor or the mature miRNA. For example non synthetic miRNAs used in methods and compositions of the invention may not have one or more modified nucleotides or nucleotide analogs. In these embodiments the non synthetic miRNA may or may not be recombinantly produced. In particular embodiments the nucleic acid in methods and or compositions of the invention is specifically a synthetic miRNA and not a non synthetic miRNA that is not an miRNA that qualifies as synthetic though in other embodiments the invention specifically involves a non synthetic miRNA and not a synthetic miRNA. Any embodiments discussed with respect to the use of synthetic miRNAs can be applied with respect to non synthetic miRNAs and vice versa.

It will be understood that the term naturally occurring refers to something found in an organism without any intervention by a person it could refer to a naturally occurring wildtype or mutant molecule. In some embodiments a synthetic miRNA molecule does not have the sequence of a naturally occurring miRNA molecule. In other embodiments a synthetic miRNA molecule may have the sequence of a naturally occurring miRNA molecule but the chemical structure of the molecule particularly in the part unrelated specifically to the precise sequence non sequence chemical structure differs from chemical structure of the naturally occurring miRNA molecule with that sequence. In some cases the synthetic miRNA has both a sequence and non sequence chemical structure that are not found in a naturally occurring miRNA. Moreover the sequence of the synthetic molecules will identify which miRNA is effectively being provided or inhibited the endogenous miRNA will be referred to as the corresponding miRNA. Corresponding miRNA sequences that can be used in the context of the invention include but are not limited to those sequences in SEQ ID NOs 1 593 and those miRNAs listed in the appendix. In addition synthetic nucleic acids of the invention may include SEQ ID NOs 594 703 as well as any other miRNA sequence miRNA precursor sequence or any sequence complementary thereof. In some embodiments the sequence is or is derived from a probe sequence identified in the appendix to target the particular miRNA or set of miRNAs that can be used with that probe sequence.

Synthetic miRNA of the invention are RNA or RNA analogs in some embodiments of the invention. MiRNA inhibitors may be DNA or RNA or analogs thereof. miRNA and miRNA inhibitors of the invention are collectively referred to as synthetic nucleic acids. 

In some embodiments there is a synthetic miRNA having a length of between 17 and 130 residues. The present invention concerns synthetic miRNA molecules that are are at least or are at most 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 or 130 residues in length or any range derivable therein.

In certain embodiments synthetic miRNA have a an miRNA region whose sequence from 5 to 3 is identical to a mature miRNA sequence and b a complementary region whose sequence from 5 to 3 is between 60 and 100 complementary to the miRNA sequence. In certain embodiments these synthetic miRNA are also isolated as defined above. The term miRNA region refers to a region on the synthetic miRNA that is at least 90 identical to the entire sequence of a mature naturally occurring miRNA sequence. In certain embodiments the miRNA region is or is at least 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 99.1 99.2 99.3 99.4 99.5 99.6 99.7 99.8 99.9 or 100 identical to the sequence of a naturally occurring miRNA.

The term complementary region refers to a region of a synthetic miRNA that is or is at least 60 complementary to the mature naturally occurring miRNA sequence that the miRNA region is identical to. The complementary region is or is at least 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 99.1 99.2 99.3 99.4 99.5 99.6 99.7 99.8 99.9 or 100 complementary or any range derivable therein. With single polynucleotide sequences there is a hairpin loop structure as a result of chemical bonding between the miRNA region and the complementary region. In other embodiments the complementary region is on a different nucleic acid molecule than the miRNA region in which case the complementary region is on the complementary strand and the miRNA region is on the active strand.

In other embodiments of the invention there are synthetic nucleic acids that are miRNA inhibitors. An miRNA inhibitor is between about 17 to 25 nucleotides in length and comprises a 5 to 3 sequence that is at least 90 complementary to the 5 to 3 sequence of a mature miRNA. In certain embodiments an miRNA inhibitor molecule is 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 or 25 nucleotides in length or any range derivable therein. Moreover an miRNA inhibitor has a sequence from 5 to 3 that is or is at least 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 99.1 99.2 99.3 99.4 99.5 99.6 99.7 99.8 99.9 or 100 complementary or any range derivable therein to the 5 to 3 sequence of a mature miRNA particularly a mature naturally occurring miRNA. Probe sequences for miRNAs are disclosed in the appendix. While they have more sequence than an miRNA inhibitor one of skill in the art could use that portion of the probe sequence that is complementary to the sequence of a mature miRNA as the sequence for an miRNA inhibitor. Table 1 indicates what the mature sequence of an miRNA is. Moreover that portion of the probe sequence can be altered so that it is still 90 complementary to the sequence of a mature miRNA.

In some embodiments of the invention a synthetic miRNA contains one or more design elements. These design elements include but are not limited to i a replacement group for the phosphate or hydroxyl of the nucleotide at the 5 terminus of the complementary region ii one or more sugar modifications in the first or last 1 to 6 residues of the complementary region or iii noncomplementarity between one or more nucleotides in the last 1 to 5 residues at the 3 end of the complementary region and the corresponding nucleotides of the miRNA region.

In certain embodiments a synthetic miRNA has a nucleotide at its 5 end of the complementary region in which the phosphate and or hydroxyl group has been replaced with another chemical group referred to as the replacement design . In some cases the phosphate group is replaced while in others the hydroxyl group has been replaced. In particular embodiments the replacement group is biotin an amine group a lower alkylamine group an acetyl group 2 O Me 2 oxygen methyl DMTO 4 4 dimethoxytrityl with oxygen fluoroscein a thiol or acridine though other replacement groups are well known to those of skill in the art and can be used as well. This design element can also be used with an miRNA inhibitor.

Additional embodiments concern a synthetic miRNA having one or more sugar modifications in the first or last 1 to 6 residues of the complementary region referred to as the sugar replacement design . In certain cases there is one or more sugar modifications in the first 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more residues of the complementary region or any range derivable therein. In additional cases there is one or more sugar modifications in the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 or more residues of the complementary region or any range derivable therein have a sugar modification. It will be understood that the terms first and last are with respect to the order of residues from the 5 end to the 3 end of the region. In particular embodiments the sugar modification is a 2 O Me modification. In further embodiments there is one or more sugar modifications in the first or last 2 to 4 residues of the complementary region or the first or last 4 to 6 residues of the complementary region. This design element can also be used with an miRNA inhibitor. Thus an miRNA inhibitor can have this design element and or a replacement group on the nucleotide at the 5 terminus as discussed above.

In other embodiments of the invention there is a synthetic miRNA in which one or more nucleotides in the last 1 to 5 residues at the 3 end of the complementary region are not complementary to the corresponding nucleotides of the miRNA region noncomplementarity referred to as the noncomplementarity design . The noncomplementarity may be in the last 1 2 3 4 and or 5 residues of the complementary miRNA. In certain embodiments there is noncomplementarity with at least 2 nucleotides in the complementary region.

It is contemplated that synthetic miRNA of the invention have one or more of the replacement sugar modification or noncomplementarity designs. In certain cases synthetic RNA molecules have two of them while in others these molecules have all three designs in place.

The miRNA region and the complementary region may be on the same or separate polynucleotides. In cases in which they are contained on or in the same polynucleotide the miRNA molecule will be considered a single polynucleotide. In embodiments in which the different regions are on separate polynucleotides the synthetic miRNA will be considered to be comprised of two polynucleotides.

When the RNA molecule is a single polynucleotide there is a linker region between the miRNA region and the complementary region. In some embodiments the single polynucleotide is capable of forming a hairpin loop structure as a result of bonding between the miRNA region and the complementary region. The linker constitutes the hairpin loop. It is contemplated that in some embodiments the linker region is is at least or is at most 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 or 40 residues in length or any range derivable therein. In certain embodiments the linker is between 3 and 30 residues inclusive in length.

In addition to having an miRNA region and a complementary region there may be flanking sequences as well at either the 5 or 3 end of the region. In some embodiments there is or is at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 nucleotides or more or any range derivable therein flanking one or both sides of these regions.

The present invention also concerns a collection of synthetic nucleic acid molecules referred to as a library. A collection may contain contain at least or contain at most 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 or more different types by structure and or sequence of nucleic acids. Libraries may contain synthetic miRNAs and or miRNA inhibitors.

Embodiments involving libraries and methods of using nucleic acids of the invention may be applied to miRNA and miRNA inhibitors. Thus any embodiment discussed with respect to nucleic acids of the invention may generally be applicable to miRNA and miRNA inhibitor molecules and vice versa. Moreover embodiments discussed with respect to miRNA may be applied to miRNA inhibitors and vice versa.

The present invention also concerns methods of characterizing an miRNA activity or function in a cell. In some embodiments a method comprises a introducing into one or more cells a synthetic miRNA molecule and b comparing one or more characteristics of cell s having the RNA molecule with cells in which the synthetic miRNA molecule has not been introduced. In certain embodiments the cells with the synthetic miRNA may be compared to cells in which a different molecule was introduced such as a negative control that does not include an miRNA region or has an miRNA region for a different miRNA . It is contemplated that the compared cells need not be evaluated at the same time. In fact the comparison cells need not have been cultured at the same time one may refer to a report or previous observation.

Other methods include reducing or eliminating activity of one or more miRNAs from a cell comprising a introducing into a cell an miRNA inhibitor. In certain embodiment methods also include comparing one or more characteristics of a cell having the miRNA inhibitor with a cell not having the miRNA inhibitor.

The synthetic nucleic acids discussed above and herein can be used in methods of the invention. Thus in certain embodiments the methods involve synthetic nucleic acids with the different designs in them.

Characteristics of cells that may be evaluated are not limited. They include the following characteristics and characteristics associated with the following cell proliferation mitotic index cell cycle apoptosis motility adhesion signal transduction protein localization gene expression RNA localization cell division DNA replication post translational modification differentiation de differentiation transcriptional activation protein activation angiogenesis metabolism energy production and or consumption protein degradation chromatin condensation microtubule production DNA replication recombination and DNA repair functions.

In some embodiments it may be useful to know whether a cell expresses a particular miRNA endogenously or whether such expression is affected under particular conditions or when it is in a particular disease state. Thus in some embodiments of the invention methods include assaying the cell for the presence of the miRNA that is effectively being introduced by the synthetic miRNA molecule or inhibited by an miRNA inhibitor. Consequently in some embodiments methods include a step of generating an miRNA profile for a sample. The term miRNA profile refers to a set of data regarding the expression pattern for a plurality of miRNAs in the sample it is contemplated that the miRNA profile can be obtained using an miRNA array. In some embodiments of the invention an miRNA profile is generated by steps that include a labeling miRNA in the sample b hybridizing the miRNA to an miRNA array and c determining miRNA hybridization to the array wherein an miRNA profile is generated. See U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60 575 743 and the U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60 649 584 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 141 707 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Additionally a cell that is introduced with a synthetic miRNA or an miRNA inhibitor may be subsequently evaluated or assayed for the amount of endogenous or exogenous miRNA or miRNA inhibitor. Any cell type is contemplated for use with the invention. The cell may be from or in a mammal such as a monkey horse cow pig sheep dog cat rabbit mouse rat or human.

In other methods of the invention a step of synthesizing or obtaining the synthetic RNA molecule is included.

In additional embodiments the synthetic nucleic acid is introduced into the cell by calcium phosphate transfection lipid transfection electroporation microinjection or injection. In addition a cell may be in a subject which may be a patient or an animal model. In this case synthetic nucleic acids can be administered to the subject or patient using modes of administration that are well known to those of skill in the art particularly for therapeutic applications. It is particularly contemplated that a patient is human or any other mammal or animal having miRNA.

The present invention also concerns inducing certain cellular characteristics by providing to a cell a particular nucleic acid such as a specific synthetic miRNA molecule or a synthetic miRNA inhibitor molecule. However in methods of the invention the miRNA molecule or miRNA inhibitor need not be synthetic. They may have a sequence that is identical to a naturally occurring miRNA or they may not have any design modifications. In certain embodiments the miRNA molecule and or an miRNA inhibitor are synthetic as discussed above.

The particular nucleic acid molecule provided to the cell is understood to correspond to a particular miRNA in the cell and thus the miRNA in the cell is referred to as the corresponding miRNA. In situations in which a named miRNA molecule is introduced into a cell the corresponding miRNA will be understood to be the induced miRNA. It is contemplated however that the miRNA molecule provided introduced into a cell is not a mature miRNA but is capable of becoming a mature miRNA under the appropriate physiological conditions. In cases in which a particular corresponding miRNA is being inhibited by a miRNA inhibitor the particular miRNA will be referred to as the targeted miRNA. It is contemplated that multiple corresponding miRNAs may be involved. In particular embodiments more than one miRNA molecule is introduced into a cell. Moreover in other embodiments more than one miRNA inhibitor is introduced into a cell. Furthermore a combination of miRNA molecule s and miRNA inhibitor s may be introduced into a cell.

Methods include identifying a cell or patient in need of inducing those cellular characteristics. Also it will be understood that an amount of a synthetic nucleic acid that is provided to a cell or organism is an effective amount which refers to an amount needed to achieve a desired goal such as inducing a particular cellular characteristic s .

In certain embodiments of the methods include providing or introducing to a cell a nucleic acid molecule corresponding to a mature miRNA in the cell in an amount effective to achieve a desired physiological result. Such methods are disclosed herein. Moreover methods of the invention involve diagnosing a patient based on an miRNA expression profile. In certain embodiments the elevation or reduction in the level of expression of a particular miRNA in a cell is correlated with a disease state compared to the expression level of that miRNA in a normal cell. This correlation allows for diagnostic methods to be carried out when that the expression level of an miRNA is measured in a biological sample being assessed and then compared to the expression level of a normal cell.

The present invention is directed to compositions and methods relating to preparation and characterization of miRNAs as well as use of miRNAs for therapeutic prognostic and diagnostic applications. To overcome the problem with previous inefficient plasmid based systems for introducing miRNA into cells the inventors developed small partially double stranded RNAs that can be delivered with high efficiency to both immortalized and primary cells. The small RNAs have the same functional activities as endogenously expressed miRNAs. Because the small RNAs can be delivered to cells with much higher efficiency than can plasmids they induce a much stronger phenotype that is easier to detect and quantify making it possible to identify many of the functions of miRNAs in cells.

The inventors have also created a library of the small double stranded RNA molecules that can be used to introduce miRNAs into cells as well as a library of antisense molecules that inhibit the activities of known miRNAs that are present in cells. These libraries have been used to sequentially up or down regulate one or more miRNAs in cells to identify those miRNAs that are critical for cellular processes like cell cycle apoptosis differentiation viability angiogenesis metabolism and other processes with therapeutic potential. miRNAs that regulate the expression of important genes like p53 MYC and RAS are also being identified and characterized to further pinpoint miRNAs that might provide important intervention points for treating disease. For example let 7 has been shown to be involved with RAS. See Johnson et al. 2005 which is hereby incorporated by reference. These processes of serially modulating miRNA activities and assaying for cellular phenotypes are collectively referred to as miRNA functional screening.

MicroRNA molecules miRNAs are generally 21 to 22 nucleotides in length though lengths of 17 and up to 25 nucleotides have been reported. The miRNAs are each processed from a longer precursor RNA molecule precursor miRNA . Precursor miRNAs are transcribed from non protein encoding genes. The precursor miRNAs have two regions of complementarity that enables them to form a stem loop or fold back like structure which is cleaved by an enzyme called Dicer in animals. Dicer is ribonuclease III like nuclease. The processed miRNA is typically a portion of the stem.

The processed miRNA also referred to as mature miRNA become part of a large complex to down regulate a particular target gene. Examples of animal miRNAs include those that imperfectly basepair with the target which halts translation Olsen et al. 1999 Seggerson et al. 2002 . SiRNA molecules also are processed by Dicer but from a long double stranded RNA molecule. SiRNAs are not naturally found in animal cells but they can function in such cells in a RNA induced silencing complex RISC to direct the sequence specific cleavage of an mRNA target Denli et al. 2003 .

The study of endogenous miRNA molecules is described in U.S. Patent Application 60 575 743 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

miRNAs are apparently active in the cell when the mature single stranded RNA is bound by a protein complex that regulates the translation of mRNAs that hybridize to the miRNA. Introducing exogenous RNA molecules that affect cells in the same way as endogenously expressed miRNAs requires that a single stranded RNA molecule of the same sequence as the endogenous mature miRNA be taken up by the protein complex that facilitates translational control. A variety of RNA molecule designs have been evaluated. Three general designs that maximize uptake of the desired single stranded miRNA by the miRNA pathway have been identified. An RNA molecule with an miRNA sequence having at least one of the three designs is referred to as a synthetic miRNA.

Synthetic miRNAs of the invention comprise in some embodiments two RNA molecules wherein one RNA is identical to a naturally occurring mature miRNA. The RNA molecule that is identical to a mature miRNA is referred to as the active strand. The second RNA molecule referred to as the complementary strand is at least partially complementary to the active strand. The active and complementary strands are hybridized to create a double stranded RNA called the synthetic miRNA that is similar to the naturally occurring miRNA precursor that is bound by the protein complex immediately prior to miRNA activation in the cell. Maximizing activity of the synthetic miRNA requires maximizing uptake of the active strand and minimizing uptake of the complementary strand by the miRNA protein complex that regulates gene expression at the level of translation. The molecular designs that provide optimal miRNA activity involve modifications to the complementary strand.

Two designs incorporate chemical modifications in the complementary strand. The first modification involves creating a complementary RNA with a chemical group other than a phosphate or hydroxyl at its 5 terminus. The presence of the 5 modification apparently eliminates uptake of the complementary strand and subsequently favors uptake of the active strand by the miRNA protein complex. The 5 modification can be any of a variety of molecules including NH NHCOCH biotin and others.

The second chemical modification strategy that significantly reduces uptake of the complementary strand by the miRNA pathway is incorporating nucleotides with sugar modifications in the first 2 6 nucleotides of the complementary strand. It should be noted that the sugar modifications consistent with the second design strategy can be coupled with 5 terminal modifications consistent with the first design strategy to further enhance synthetic miRNA activities.

The third synthetic miRNA design involves incorporating nucleotides in the 3 end of the complementary strand that are not complementary to the active strand. Hybrids of the resulting active and complementary RNAs are very stable at the 3 end of the active strand but relatively unstable at the 5 end of the active strand. Studies with siRNAs indicate that 5 hybrid stability is a key indicator of RNA uptake by the protein complex that supports RNA interference which is at least related to the miRNA pathway in cells. The inventors have found that the judicious use of mismatches in the complementary RNA strand significantly enhances the activity of the synthetic miRNA.

A key application for the synthetic miRNAs is the identification of cellular functions for individual or groups of miRNAs. The inventors have created a library of synthetic miRNAs that can be used to sequentially introduce each of the known miRNAs into cultured cells . Cell populations with each of the different synthetic miRNAs can then be assayed to identify miRNAs whose presence induces a cellular phenotype.

The inventors have created a library of antisense molecules that inhibit miRNA activity. The miRNA inhibitors are used to serially inhibit the activities of miRNAs in cells to identify miRNAs whose absence induces a cellular phenotype.

The number of different synthetic miRNAs or miRNA inhibitors in the libraries is variable. It is contemplated that there may be be at least or be at most 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 430 440 441 450 460 470 480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550 560 570 580 590 600 610 620 630 640 650 660 670 680 690 700 710 720 730 740 750 760 770 780 790 800 810 820 830 840 850 860 870 880 890 900 910 920 930 940 950 960 970 980 990 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500 1600 1700 1800 1900 2000 2100 2200 2300 2400 2500 2600 2700 2800 2900 3000 31 3200 3300 3400 3500 3600 3700 3800 3900 4000 4100 4200 4300 4400 4500 4600 4700 4800 4900 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 or more or any range derivable therein different miRNA specific molecules in the library. In specific embodiments libraries have between 5 and 1000 different miRNA specific molecules between 20 and 500 different miRNA specific molecules between 50 and 250 different miRNA specific molecules or between 100 and 225 different miRNA specific molecules. Different miRNA specific molecules refers to nucleic acids that are specific to miRNAs with different sequences.

Synthetic miRNAs are contemplated to be made primarily of RNA though in some embodiments they may be RNA nucleotide analogs DNA or any combination of DNA RNA nucleotide analogs and PNAs.

As suggested above it is contemplated that libraries of the invention may be specific for one or more miRNAs. In embodiments of the invention a library has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 430 440 441 450 460 470 480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550 560 570 580 590 600 610 620 630 640 650 660 670 680 690 700 710 720 730 740 750 760 770 780 790 800 810 820 830 840 850 860 870 880 890 900 910 920 930 940 950 960 970 980 990 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500 1600 1700 1800 1900 2000 2100 2200 2300 2400 2500 2600 2700 2800 2900 3000 31 3200 3300 3400 3500 3600 3700 3800 3900 4000 4100 4200 4300 4400 4500 4600 4700 4800 4900 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000 10000 or more or any range derivable therein different miRNAs or miRNA inhibitors. Accordingly it is understood that the library contains one or more nucleic acids for these different miRNAs. In specific embodiments the library is specific to human miRNAs though libraries for multiple organisms are contemplated.

RNA molecules of the invention have miRNA regions or complementary regions. In specific embodiments a synthetic miRNA or miRNA inhibitor has a sequence or complementary sequence that derives from any of SEQ ID NOs 1 805 inclusive. It is particularly contemplated that synthetic nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be derived from any of the mature miRNA sequences in SEQ ID NOs 1 805 or their complement.

As discussed above miRNAs are processed from a precursor molecule. In certain embodiments the specific length of a mature miRNA is unknown. It is contemplated that versions of the synthetic miRNA and miRNA inhibitor libraries will include sequence that extends at least 1 to 5 nucleotides of coding sequence upstream and or downstream of the predicted miRNA sequence. In some embodiments molecules have up to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or more contiguous nucleotides or any range derivable therein that flank the sequence encoding the predominant processed miRNA on one or both sides 5 and or 3 end .

The present invention concerns methods for creating functional profile for all of the known miRNAs. The term functional profile refers to a set of data regarding the cellular phenotypes that result from introducing and inhibiting miRNAs in cells using synthetic miRNA and miRNA inhibitor libraries. Functional profiles for individual miRNAs will enable identification of miRNAs with therapeutic or diagnostic potential. For instance a functional profile for a miRNA might reveal that its absence leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and an inability to induce apoptosis following DNA damage. Furthermore the expression of p53 correlates with whether the miRNA is being up regulated with a synthetic miRNA or down regulated with a miRNA inhibitor. Based on its ties to cell proliferation apoptosis and p53 expression this miRNA might be a target for cancer therapeutics.

In certain embodiments methods concern identifying miRNAs indicative of a disease or condition by detecting a correlation between the activity of particular miRNAs and cellular phenotypes that coincide with a disease or condition.

Libraries of the invention can contain miRNA sequences from any organism having miRNAs specifically including but not limited to mammals such as humans mice and rats. Specifically contemplated are libraries having having at least or having at most 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500 1600 1700 1800 1900 2000 2100 2200 2300 2400 2500 2600 2700 2800 2900 3000 3100 3200 3300 3400 3500 3600 3700 3800 3900 4000 4100 4200 4300 4400 4500 4600 4700 4800 4900 5000 5100 5200 5300 5400 5500 5600 5700 5800 5900 6000 6100 6200 6300 6400 6500 6600 6700 6800 6900 7000 7100 7200 7300 7400 7500 7600 7700 7800 7900 8000 8100 8200 8300 8400 8500 8600 8700 8800 8900 9000 9100 9200 9300 9400 9500 9600 9700 9800 9900 10000 or more different synthetic miRNAs and or miRNA inhibitors that is miRNA specific molecules having different sequences derived from different miRNA genes . Specifically contemplated are such libraries described in the previous sentence with respect to any of SEQ ID NOs 1 805 particularly those corresponding to miRNA sequence s mature sequence or the complement thereof.

The present invention concerns nucleic acid molecules that can introduce or inhibit miRNAs in cultured cells. The nucleic acids may have been produced in cells or in vitro by purified enzymes though they are preferentially produced by chemical synthesis. They may be crude or purified. The term miRNA unless otherwise indicated refers to the processed RNA after it has been cleaved from its precursor. Table 1 indicates which SEQ ID NO corresponds to the particular precursor sequence of an miRNA and what sequences within the SEQ ID NO correspond to the mature sequence. The name of the miRNA is often abbreviated and referred to without the prefix and will be understood as such depending on the context. Unless otherwise indicated miRNAs referred to in the application are human sequences identified as mir X or let X where X is a number and or letter.

It is understood that an miRNA is derived from genomic sequences or a gene. In this respect the term gene is used for simplicity to refer to the genomic sequence encoding the precursor miRNA for a given miRNA. However embodiments of the invention may involve genomic sequences of a miRNA that are involved in its expression such as a promoter or other regulatory sequences.

The term recombinant may be used and this generally refers to a molecule that has been manipulated in vitro or that is the replicated or expressed product of such a molecule.

The term nucleic acid is well known in the art. A nucleic acid as used herein will generally refer to a molecule one or more strands of DNA RNA or a derivative or analog thereof comprising a nucleobase. A nucleobase includes for example a naturally occurring purine or pyrimidine base found in DNA e.g. an adenine A a guanine G a thymine T or a cytosine C or RNA e.g. an A a G an uracil U or a C . The term nucleic acid encompass the terms oligonucleotide and polynucleotide each as a subgenus of the term nucleic acid. 

The term miRNA generally refers to a single stranded molecule but in specific embodiments molecules implemented in the invention will also encompass a region or an additional strand that is partially between 10 and 50 complementary across length of strand substantially greater than 50 but less than 100 complementary across length of strand or fully complementary to another region of the same single stranded molecule or to another nucleic acid. Thus nucleic acids may encompass a molecule that comprises one or more complementary or self complementary strand s or complement s of a particular sequence comprising a molecule. For example precursor miRNA may have a self complementary region which is up to 100 complementary.

As used herein hybridization hybridizes or capable of hybridizing is understood to mean the forming of a double or triple stranded molecule or a molecule with partial double or triple stranded nature.

A nucleobase may be comprised in a nucleoside or nucleotide using any chemical or natural synthesis method described herein or known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such nucleobase may be labeled or it may be part of a molecule that is labeled and contains the nucleobase.

As used herein a nucleoside refers to an individual chemical unit comprising a nucleobase covalently attached to a nucleobase linker moiety. A non limiting example of a nucleobase linker moiety is a sugar comprising 5 carbon atoms i.e. a 5 carbon sugar including but not limited to a deoxyribose a ribose an arabinose or a derivative or an analog of a 5 carbon sugar. Non limiting examples of a derivative or an analog of a 5 carbon sugar include a 2 fluoro 2 deoxyribose or a carbocyclic sugar where a carbon is substituted for an oxygen atom in the sugar ring.

Different types of covalent attachment s of a nucleobase to a nucleobase linker moiety are known in the art. By way of non limiting example a nucleoside comprising a purine i.e. A or G or a 7 deazapurine nucleobase typically covalently attaches the 9 position of a purine or a 7 deazapurine to the 1 position of a 5 carbon sugar. In another non limiting example a nucleoside comprising a pyrimidine nucleobase i.e. C T or U typically covalently attaches a 1 position of a pyrimidine to a 1 position of a 5 carbon sugar Kornberg and Baker 1992 .

As used herein a nucleotide refers to a nucleoside further comprising a backbone moiety . A backbone moiety generally covalently attaches a nucleotide to another molecule comprising a nucleotide or to another nucleotide to form a nucleic acid. The backbone moiety in naturally occurring nucleotides typically comprises a phosphorus moiety which is covalently attached to a 5 carbon sugar. The attachment of the backbone moiety typically occurs at either the 3 or 5 position of the 5 carbon sugar. However other types of attachments are known in the art particularly when a nucleotide comprises derivatives or analogs of a naturally occurring 5 carbon sugar or phosphorus moiety.

A nucleic acid may comprise or be composed entirely of a derivative or analog of a nucleobase a nucleobase linker moiety and or backbone moiety that may be present in a naturally occurring nucleic acid. RNA with nucleic acid analogs may also be labeled according to methods of the invention. As used herein a derivative refers to a chemically modified or altered form of a naturally occurring molecule while the terms mimic or analog refer to a molecule that may or may not structurally resemble a naturally occurring molecule or moiety but possesses similar functions.

The use of other analogs is specifically contemplated for use in the context of the present invention. Such analogs may be used in synthetic nucleic acid molecules of the invention both throughout the molecule or at selected nucleotides. They include but are not limited to 1 ribose modifications such as 2 F 2 NH 2 N 4 thio or 2 O CH and 2 phosphate modifications such as those found in phosphorothioates methyl phosphonates and phosphoroborates . Such analogs have been created to confer stability on RNAs by reducing or eliminating their capacity to be cleaved by ribonucleases. When these nucleotide analogs are present in RNAs they can have profoundly positive effects on the stability of the RNAs in animals. It is contemplated that the use of nucleotide analogs can be used alone or in conjunction with any of the design modifications of a synthetic miRNA for any nucleic acid of the invention.

Both synthetic miRNAs and miRNA inhibitors of the invention specifically contemplate the use of nucleotides that are modified to enhance their activities. Such nucleotides include those that are at the 5 or 3 terminus of the RNA as well as those that are internal within the molecule. Modified nucleotides used in the complementary strands of synthetic miRNAs either block the 5 OH or phosphate of the RNA or introduce internal sugar modifications that enhance uptake of the active strand of the synthetic miRNA. Modifications for the miRNA inhibitors include internal sugar modifications that enhance hybridization as well as stabilize the molecules in cells and terminal modifications that further stabilize the nucleic acids in cells. Further contemplated are modifications that can be detected by microscopy or other methods to identify cells that contain the synthetic miRNAs or miRNA inhibitors.

A nucleic acid may be made by any technique known to one of ordinary skill in the art such as for example chemical synthesis enzymatic production or biological production. Though synthetic miRNAs according to the invention could be produced using recombinant methods it is preferred to produce synthetic miRNAs by chemical synthesis or enzymatic production. Likewise miRNA inhibitors are preferentially produced by chemical synthesis or enzymatic production. Non synthetic miRNAs can be produced by a number of methods including methods involving recombinant DNA technology.

Nucleic acid synthesis is performed according to standard methods. See for example Itakura and Riggs 1980 . Additionally U.S. Pat. No. 4 704 362 U.S. Pat. No. 5 221 619 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 583 013 each describe various methods of preparing synthetic nucleic acids. Non limiting examples of a synthetic nucleic acid e.g. a synthetic oligonucleotide include a nucleic acid made by in vitro chemically synthesis using phosphotriester phosphite or phosphoramidite chemistry and solid phase techniques such as described in EP 266 032 incorporated herein by reference or via deoxynucleoside H phosphonate intermediates as described by Froehler et al. 1986 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 705 629 each incorporated herein by reference. In the methods of the present invention one or more oligonucleotide may be used. Various different mechanisms of oligonucleotide synthesis have been disclosed in for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 659 774 4 816 571 5 141 813 5 264 566 4 959 463 5 428 148 5 554 744 5 574 146 5 602 244 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

A non limiting example of an enzymatically produced nucleic acid include one produced by enzymes in amplification reactions such as PCR see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 683 202 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 682 195 each incorporated herein by reference or the synthesis of an oligonucleotide described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 645 897 incorporated herein by reference.

Oligonucleotide synthesis is well known to those of skill in the art. Various different mechanisms of oligonucleotide synthesis have been disclosed in for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 659 774 4 816 571 5 141 813 5 264 566 4 959 463 5 428 148 5 554 744 5 574 146 5 602 244 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Basically chemical synthesis can be achieved by the diester method the triester method polynucleotides phosphorylase method and by solid phase chemistry. These methods are discussed in further detail below.

The diester method was the first to be developed to a usable state primarily by Khorana and co workers. Khorana 1979 . The basic step is the joining of two suitably protected deoxynucleotides to form a dideoxynucleotide containing a phosphodiester bond. The diester method is well established and has been used to synthesize DNA molecules Khorana 1979 .

The main difference between the diester and triester methods is the presence in the latter of an extra protecting group on the phosphate atoms of the reactants and products Itakura et al. 1975 . The phosphate protecting group is usually a chlorophenyl group which renders the nucleotides and polynucleotide intermediates soluble in organic solvents. Therefore purification s are done in chloroform solutions. Other improvements in the method include i the block coupling of trimers and larger oligomers ii the extensive use of high performance liquid chromatography for the purification of both intermediate and final products and iii solid phase synthesis.

This is an enzymatic method of DNA synthesis that can be used to synthesize many useful oligonucleotides Gillam et al. 1978 Gillam et al. 1979 . Under controlled conditions polynucleotide phosphorylase adds predominantly a single nucleotide to a short oligonucleotide. Chromatographic purification allows the desired single adduct to be obtained. At least a trimer is required to start the procedure and this primer must be obtained by some other method. The polynucleotide phosphorylase method works and has the advantage that the procedures involved are familiar to most biochemists.

Drawing on the technology developed for the solid phase synthesis of polypeptides it has been possible to attach the initial nucleotide to solid support material and proceed with the stepwise addition of nucleotides. All mixing and washing steps are simplified and the procedure becomes amenable to automation. These syntheses are now routinely carried out using automatic nucleic acid synthesizers.

Phosphoramidite chemistry Beaucage and Lyer 1992 has become by far the most widely used coupling chemistry for the synthesis of oligonucleotides. As is well known to those skilled in the art phosphoramidite synthesis of oligonucleotides involves activation of nucleoside phosphoramidite monomer precursors by reaction with an activating agent to form activated intermediates followed by sequential addition of the activated intermediates to the growing oligonucleotide chain generally anchored at one end to a suitable solid support to form the oligonucleotide product.

Recombinant methods for producing nucleic acids in a cell are well known to those of skill in the art. These include the use of vectors plasmids cosmids and other vehicles for delivery a nucleic acid to a cell which may be the target cell or simply a host cell to produce large quantities of the desired RNA molecule . Alternatively such vehicles can be used in the context of a cell free system so long as the reagents for generating the RNA molecule are present. Such methods include those described in Sambrook 2003 Sambrook 2001 and Sambrook 1989 which are hereby incorporated by reference.

In certain embodiments the present invention concerns nucleic acid molecules that are not synthetic. In some embodiments the nucleic acid molecule has a chemical structure of a naturally occurring nucleic acid and a sequence of a naturally occurring nucleic acid such as the exact and entire sequence of a single stranded primary miRNA see Lee 2002 a single stranded precursor miRNA or a single stranded mature miRNA. In addition to the use of recombinant technology such non synthetic nucleic acids may be generated chemically such as by employing technology used for creating oligonucleotides.

Synthetic miRNAs typically comprise two strands an active strand that is identical in sequence to the mature miRNA that is being studied and a complementary strand that is at least partially complementary to the active strand. The active strand is the biologically relevant molecule and should be preferentially taken up by the complex in cells that modulates translation either through mRNA degradation or translational control. Preferential uptake of the active strand has two profound results 1 the observed activity of the synthetic miRNA increases dramatically and 2 non intended effects induced by uptake and activation of the complementary strand are essentially eliminated. According to the invention several synthetic miRNA designs can be used to ensure the preferential uptake of the active strand.

The introduction of a stable moiety other than phosphate or hydroxyl at the 5 end of the complementary strand impairs its activity in the miRNA pathway. This ensures that only the active strand of the synthetic miRNA will be used to regulate translation in the cell. 5 modifications include but are not limited to NH biotin an amine group a lower alkylamine group an acetyl group 2 O Me DMTO fluoroscein a thiol or acridine or any other group with this type of functionality.

The introduction of nucleotide modifications like 2 OMe NH biotin an amine group a lower alkylamine group an acetyl group DMTO fluoroscein a thiol or acridine or any other group with this type of functionality in the complementary strand of the synthetic miRNA can eliminate the activity of the complementary strand and enhance uptake of the active strand of the miRNA.

As with siRNAs Schwarz 2003 the relative stability of the 5 and 3 ends of the active strand of the synthetic miRNA apparently determines the uptake and activation of the active by the miRNA pathway. Destabilizing the 5 end of the active strand of the synthetic miRNA by the strategic placement of base mismatches in the 3 end of the complementary strand of the synthetic miRNA enhances the activity of the active strand and essentially eliminates the activity of the complementary strand.

The cells used to understand miRNA function may be derived from or contained in any organism e.g. plant animal protozoan virus bacterium or fungus . The plant may be a monocot dicot or gynmosperm the animal may be a vertebrate or invertebrate. Preferred microbes are those used in agriculture or by industry and those that a pathogenic for plants or animals. Fungi include organisms in both the mold and yeast morphologies. Examples of vertebrates include fish and mammals including cattle goat pig sheep hamster mouse rate and human invertebrate animals include nematodes insects arachnids and other arthropods. Preferably the cell is a vertebrate cell. More preferably the cell is a mammalian cell.

The cells used to understand miRNA function may be from the germ line or somatic totipotent or pluripotent dividing or non dividing parenchyma or epithelium immortalized or transformed or the like. The cell can be a gamete or an embryo if an embryo it can be a single cell embryo or a constituent cell or cells from a multicellular embryo. The term embryo thus encompasses fetal tissue. The cell used for miRNA functional analysis may be an undifferentiated cell such as a stem cell or a differentiated cell such as from a cell of an organ or tissue including fetal tissue or any other cell present in an organism. Cell types that are differentiated include adipocytes fibroblasts myocytes cardiomyocytes endothelium neurons glia blood cells megakaryocytes lymphocytes macrophages neutrophils eosinophils basophils mast cells leukocytes granulocytes keratinocytes chondrocytes osteoblasts osteoclasts hepatocytes and cells of the endocrine or exocrine glands. Alternatively cells may be qualified as germ cells nurse cells epithelial cells endothelial cells hormone secreting cells contractile cells skeletal muscle cells cardiac muscle cells blood cells or cells from the bone bone marrow brain breast cervix colon gastrointestinal tract heart kidney large intestine liver lung lymph nodes ovary pancreas prostate small intestine spine or spinal cord spleen stomach testes thymus or uterus.

As used herein the terms cell cell line and cell culture may be used interchangeably. All of these terms also include their progeny which is any and all subsequent generations formed by cell division. It is understood that all progeny may not be identical due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. A host cell may be transfected or transformed which refers to a process by which exogenous nucleic acid is transferred or introduced into the host cell. A transformed cell includes the primary subject cell and its progeny. As used herein the terms engineered and recombinant cells or host cells are intended to refer to a cell into which an exogenous nucleic acid sequence such as for example a small interfering RNA or a template construct encoding a reporter gene has been introduced. Therefore recombinant cells are distinguishable from naturally occurring cells that do not contain a recombinantly introduced nucleic acid.

A tissue may comprise a host cell or cells to be transformed or contacted with a nucleic acid delivery composition and or an additional agent. The tissue may be part or separated from an organism. In certain embodiments a tissue and its constituent cells may comprise but is not limited to blood e.g. hematopoietic cells such as human hematopoietic progenitor cells human hematopoietic stem cells CD34 cells CD4 cells lymphocytes and other blood lineage cells bone marrow brain stem cells blood vessel liver lung bone breast cartilage cervix colon cornea embryonic endometrium endothelial epithelial esophagus facia fibroblast follicular ganglion cells glial cells goblet cells kidney lymph node muscle neuron ovaries pancreas peripheral blood prostate skin skin small intestine spleen stomach testes.

In certain embodiments the host cell or tissue may be comprised in at least one organism. In certain embodiments the organism may be human primate or murine. In other embodiments the organism may be any eukaryote or even a prokayrote e.g. a eubacteria an archaea as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art see for example webpage http phylogeny.arizona.edu tree phylogeny.html . One of skill in the art would further understand the conditions under which to incubate all of the above described host cells to maintain them and to permit their division to form progeny.

Synthetic miRNAs and miRNA inhibitors may be labeled with a radioactive enzymatic colorimetric or other label or tag for detection or isolation purposes. Nucleic acids may be labeled with fluorescence in some embodiments of the invention. The fluorescent labels contemplated for use as conjugates include but are not limited to Alexa 350 Alexa 430 AMCA BODIPY 630 650 BODIPY 650 665 BODIPY FL BODIPY R6G BODIPY TMR BODIPY TRX Cascade Blue Cy3 Cy5 6 FAM Fluorescein Isothiocyanate HEX 6 JOE Oregon Green 488 Oregon Green 500 Oregon Green 514 Pacific Blue REG Rhodamine Green Rhodamine Red Renographin ROX SYPRO TAMRA TET Tetramethylrhodamine and or Texas Red.

It is contemplated that synthetic miRNAs and miRNA inhibitors may be labeled with two different labels. Furthermore fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET may be employed in methods of the invention e.g. Klostermeier et al. 2002 Emptage 2001 Didenko 2001 each incorporated by reference .

A number of techniques for visualizing or detecting labeled nucleic acids are readily available. The reference by Stanley T. Crooke 2000 has a discussion of such techniques Chapter 6 which is incorporated by reference. Such techniques include microscopy arrays Fluorometry Light cyclers or other real time PCR machines FACS analysis scintillation counters Phosphoimagers Geiger counters MRI CAT antibody based detection methods Westerns immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry histochemical techniques HPLC Griffey et al. 1997 spectroscopy capillary gel electrophoresis Cummins et al. 1996 spectroscopy mass spectroscopy radiological techniques and mass balance techniques. Alternatively nucleic acids may be labeled or tagged to allow for their efficient isolation. In other embodiments of the invention nucleic acids are biotinylated.

The present invention involves in some embodiments delivering a nucleic acid into a cell. This may be done as part of a screening method or it may be related to a therapeutic or diagnostic application.

RNA molecules may be encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprised in a vector. The term vector is used to refer to a carrier nucleic acid molecule into which a nucleic acid sequence can be inserted for introduction into a cell where it can be replicated. A nucleic acid sequence can be exogenous which means that it is foreign to the cell into which the vector is being introduced or that the sequence is homologous to a sequence in the cell but in a position within the host cell nucleic acid in which the sequence is ordinarily not found. Vectors include plasmids cosmids viruses bacteriophage animal viruses and plant viruses and artificial chromosomes e.g. YACs . One of skill in the art would be well equipped to construct a vector through standard recombinant techniques which are described in Sambrook et al. 1989 and Ausubel et al. 1996 both incorporated herein by reference. In addition to encoding a modified polypeptide such as modified gelonin a vector may encode non modified polypeptide sequences such as a tag or targeting molecule. A targeting molecule is one that directs the desired nucleic acid to a particular organ tissue cell or other location in a subject s body.

The term expression vector refers to a vector containing a nucleic acid sequence coding for at least part of a gene product capable of being transcribed. Expression vectors can contain a variety of control sequences which refer to nucleic acid sequences necessary for the transcription and possibly translation of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. In addition to control sequences that govern transcription and translation vectors and expression vectors may contain nucleic acid sequences that serve other functions as well and are described

There are a number of ways in which expression vectors may be introduced into cells. In certain embodiments of the invention the expression vector comprises a virus or engineered vector derived from a viral genome. The ability of certain viruses to enter cells via receptor mediated endocytosis to integrate into host cell genome and express viral genes stably and efficiently have made them attractive candidates for the transfer of foreign genes into mammalian cells Ridgeway 1988 Nicolas and Rubenstein 1988 Baichwal and Sugden 1986 Temin 1986 . The first viruses used as gene vectors were DNA viruses including the papovaviruses simian virus 40 bovine papilloma virus and polyoma Ridgeway 1988 Baichwal and Sugden 1986 and adenoviruses Ridgeway 1988 Baichwal and Sugden 1986 . These have a relatively low capacity for foreign DNA sequences and have a restricted host spectrum. Furthermore their oncogenic potential and cytopathic effects in permissive cells raise safety concerns. They can accommodate only up to 8 kb of foreign genetic material but can be readily introduced in a variety of cell lines and laboratory animals Nicolas and Rubenstein 1988 Temin 1986 .

The retroviruses are a group of single stranded RNA viruses characterized by an ability to convert their RNA to double stranded DNA in infected cells they can also be used as vectors. Other viral vectors may be employed as expression constructs in the present invention. Vectors derived from viruses such as vaccinia virus Ridgeway 1988 Baichwal and Sugden 1986 Coupar et al. 1988 adeno associated virus AAV Ridgeway 1988 Baichwal and Sugden 1986 Hermonat and Muzycska 1984 and herpesviruses may be employed. They offer several attractive features for various mammalian cells Friedmann 1989 Ridgeway 1988 Baichwal and Sugden 1986 Coupar et al. 1988 Horwich et al. 1990 .

As used in the patent application screening is a process wherein multiple miRNA specific reagents are delivered separately into individual cell populations or animals. At one or more designated times after delivery the cell populations or animals are assayed for one or more phenotypes. Those cells or animals that have a significantly different phenotype than cells or animals in the negative control group are classified as positives. The miRNA that was being manipulated in the sample is defined as a hit. Hits represent targets for additional research and potential therapeutic development.

In some embodiments there is a multi step process for screening. In certain embodiments there are four general steps 

Assays that measure the intensity of a cellular phenotype range from microscopic assays that monitor cell size cell cycle status or antibody staining to enzymatic assays that assess the turnover of a specific substrate in a cell lysate to direct measurements of biomolecules or small molecules in lysates on cells or in medium.

Critical to the success of a screen is creating an assay that truly measures the cellular phenotype and maximizing the signal to noise ratio of the assay. Maximizing signal to noise involves testing variables like assay time assay components cell type and length of time between transfection and assay. The greater the difference in the assay results between a positive phenotype and a negative control phenotype the greater the spread will be in the screening results and the better the opportunity will be to identify interesting genes.

The first step in this process is identifying a transfection reagent and plating conditions that maximize the uptake of synthetic miRNAs or miRNA inhibitors while maintaining high cell viability. We find it useful to test 2 5 different transfection reagents when using cell lines or 5 10 electroporation conditions when using primary or suspension cells. Transfection can be optimized for the reagent or electroporation condition that worked best among the conditions tested. Screening miRNA specific libraries requires conditions for high throughput transfection. The inventors have developed and used a rapid process that facilitates the transfection of up to 1 000 wells in less than an hour without the need for robotics see delivery below .

Once the assay and transfection process have been developed a library of synthetic miRNAs or miRNA inhibitors can be introduced sequentially into cells in a 24 or 96 well plate. Triplicate transfections for each reagent provide enough data for reasonable statistical analysis.

Validating a hit involves showing that the observed phenotype is due to the miRNA being targeted. Hits are typically confirmed by delivering a dilution series of the miRNA inhibitor or synthetic miRNA that registered as a hit into the cell that was originally assayed. It has been the experience of the inventors that true hits show a dose response.

The present invention concerns the preparation and use of synthetic miRNA and miRNA inhibitor libraries to induce changes in the activity of specific miRNAs in cells. Preparation of synthetic miRNAs and miRNA inhibitors typically involves the chemical synthesis of the active and complementary strands of the synthetic miRNA and the single stranded miRNA inhibitor using any of the methods described in this application. If the active and complementary strands of the synthetic miRNAs are two distinct molecules then the two strands must be hybridized prior to delivery. Hybridization can be achieved by mixing the two nucleic acids together in roughly equimolar amounts and incubating for a time and at a temperature that is appropriate for hybridization. The addition of salt e.g. NaCl or NaOAC enhances hybridization as does the inclusion of a heat denaturation step prior to the incubation used for hybridization.

Libraries of the invention can be used to sequentially up or down regulate one or more miRNAs in samples. This requires methods for introducing the synthetic miRNAs and miRNA inhibitors into cell types with associated cell assays. Lipid based transfection is typically employed to introduce the nucleic acids into immortalized cells and electroporation for primary cells.

Suitable methods for nucleic acid delivery according to the present invention are believed to include virtually any method by which a nucleic acid e.g. DNA RNA including viral and nonviral vectors can be introduced into an organelle a cell a tissue or an organism as described herein or as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such methods include but are not limited to direct delivery of nucleic acids such as by injection U.S. Pat.

A variety of compounds have been attached to the ends of oligonucleotides to facilitate their transport across cell membranes. Short signal peptides found in the HIV TAT HSV VP22 and other proteins have been found to enable the rapid transfer of biomolecules across membranes reviewed by Schwarze 2000 . These signal peptides referred to as Protein Transduction Domains PTDs have been attached to oligonucleotides to facilitate their delivery into cultured cells. Cholesterols have been conjugated to oligonucleotides to improve their uptake into cells in animals MacKellar 1992 . The terminal cholesterol groups apparently interact with receptors or lipids on the surfaces of cells and facilitate the internalization of the modified oligonucleotides. Likewise poly 1 lysine has been conjugated to oligonucleotides to decrease the net negative charge and improve uptake into cells Leonetti 1990 .

A variety of compounds have been developed that complex with nucleic acids deliver them to surfaces of cells and facilitate their uptake in and release from endosomes. Among these are 1 a variety of lipids such as DOTAP or other cationic lipid DDAB DHDEAB and DOPE and 2 non lipid based polymers like polyethylenimine polyamidoamine and dendrimers of these and other polymers. In certain of these embodiments a combination of lipids is employed such as DOTAP and cholesterol or a cholesterol derivative U.S. Pat. No. 6 770 291 which is hereby incorporated by reference . Several of these reagents have been shown to facilitate nucleic acid uptake in animals.

The cellular components involved in the miRNA pathway are becoming known. Proteins that stabilize and or transport miRNAs within cells might enhance the stability and activity of miRNAs because they should protect and guide the bound miRNAs once they are in cells. Mixtures of miRNA transporter proteins and miRNAs could enhance the efficacy of miRNA based therapeutics.

RNAs are hydrophilic molecules by virtue of their anionic phosphate and sugar backbone. Although the nucleobases are hydrophobic hydrophilicity dominates owing to the extensive hydrogen bonding resulting from the phosphate and sugar residues. The hydrophilic character and anionic backbone reduces cellular permeation. Conjugation of lipophilic groups like cholesterol Manoharan 2002 and lauric and lithocholic acid derivatives with C32 functionality Lorenz et al. 2004 have been shown to improve cellular uptake. Moreover binding of steroid conjugated oligonucleotides to different lipoproteins in the bloodstream such as LDL protect their integrity and govern their biodistribution Rump et al. 2000 . Cholesterol attached to anti sense molecules Bijsterbosch et al. 2001 and aptamers Rusconi et al. 2004 has also been shown to stabilize oligonucleotides by allowing binding to lipoproteins. Cholesterol has been demonstrated to enhance uptake and serum stability of siRNAs in vitro Lorenz et al. 2004 and in vivo Soutschek et al. 2004 . Additionally a number of small molecules like SB 435495 Blackie et al. 2002 Isradipine Oravcova et al. 1994 amlodipine Oravcova et al. 1994 and 2 2 4 4 5 5 hexachlorobiphenyl Borlakoglu et al. 1990 could enhance cellular uptake and improve nuclease resistance by promoting lipoprotein association.

The present methods and kits may be employed for high volume screening. A library of synthetic miRNAs and or miRNA inhibitors can be created using methods of the invention. This library may then be used in high throughput assays including microarrays. Specifically contemplated by the present inventors are chip based nucleic acid technologies such as those described by Ziauddin and Sabatini 2001 . Briefly nucleic acids can be immobilized on solid supports. Cells can then be overlaid on the solid support and take up the nucleic acids at the defined locations. The impact on the cells can then be measured to identify cocktails that are having a desirable effect.

In some embodiments the present invention concerns miRNA that are labeled such as for screening assays to evaluate the therapeutic or diagnostic relevance of a particular miRNA species. It is contemplated that miRNA may first be isolated either from a cell in which the miRNA is endogenous to the cell or from a cell in which miRNA is exogenous to the cell and or purified prior to labeling. This may achieve a reaction that more efficiently labels the miRNA as opposed to other RNA in a sample in which the miRNA is not isolated or purified prior to labeling. In many embodiments of the invention the label is non radioactive. Generally nucleic acids may be labeled by adding labeled nucleotides one step process or adding nucleotides and labeling the added nucleotides two step process .

Moreover miRNA may be labeled as is described in U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60 649 584 which is hereby incorporated by reference. Such nucleotides include those that can be labeled with a dye including a fluorescent dye or with a molecule such as biotin. Labeled nucleotides are readily available they can be acquired commercially or they can be synthesized by reactions known to those of skill in the art.

Nucleotides for labelling are not naturally occurring nucleotides but instead refer to prepared nucleotides that have a reactive moiety on them. Specific reactive functionalities of interest include amino sulfhydryl sulfoxyl aminosulfhydryl azido epoxide isothiocyanate isocyanate anhydride monochlorotriazine dichlorotriazine mono or dihalogen substituted pyridine mono or disubstituted diazine maleimide epoxide aziridine sulfonyl halide acid halide alkyl halide aryl halide alkylsulfonate N hydroxysuccinimide ester imido ester hydrazine azidonitrophenyl azide 3 2 pyridyl dithio propionamide glyoxal aldehyde iodoacetyl cyanomethyl ester p nitrophenyl ester o nitrophenyl ester hydroxypyridine ester carbonyl imidazole and the other such chemical groups. In some embodiments the reactive functionality may be bonded directly to a nucleotide or it may be bonded to the nucleotide through a linking group. The functional moiety and any linker cannot substantially impair the ability of the nucleotide to be added to the miRNA or to be labeled. Representative linking groups include carbon containing linking groups typically ranging from about 2 to 18 usually from about 2 to 8 carbon atoms where the carbon containing linking groups may or may not include one or more heteroatoms e.g. S O N etc. and may or may not include one or more sites of unsaturation. Of particular interest in many embodiments are alkyl linking groups typically lower alkyl linking groups of 1 to 16 usually 1 to 4 carbon atoms where the linking groups may include one or more sites of unsaturation. The functionalized nucleotides or primers used in the above methods of functionalized target generation may be fabricated using known protocols or purchased from commercial vendors e.g. Sigma Roche Ambion and NEN. Functional groups may be prepared according to ways known to those of skill in the art including the representative information found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 404 289 4 405 711 4 337 063 and 5 268 486 and Br. Pat. No. 1 529 202 which are all incorporated by reference.

Amine modified nucleotides are used in several embodiments of the invention. The amine modified nucleotide is a nucleotide that has a reactive amine group for attachment of the label. It is contemplated that any ribonucleotide G A U or C or deoxyribonucleotide G A T or C can be modified for labeling. Examples include but are not limited to the following modified ribo and deoxyribo nucleotides 5 3 aminoallyl UTP 8 4 amino butyl amino ATP and 8 6 amino butyl amino ATP N 4 amino butyl ATP N 6 amino butyl ATP N 2 2 oxy bis ethylamine CTP N 6 Amino hexyl ATP 8 6 Amino hexyl amino ATP 5 propargylamino CTP 5 propargylamino UTP 5 3 aminoallyl dUTP 8 4 amino butyl amino dATP and 8 6 amino butyl amino dATP N 4 amino butyl dATP N 6 amino butyl dATP N 2 2 oxy bis ethylamine dCTP N 6 Amino hexyl dATP 8 6 Amino hexyl amino dATP 5 propargylamino dCTP and 5 propargylamino dUTP. Such nucleotides can be prepared according to methods known to those of skill in the art. Moreover a person of ordinary skill in the art could prepare other nucleotide entities with the same amine modification such as a 5 3 aminoallyl CTP GTP ATP dCTP dGTP dTTP or dUTP in place of a 5 3 aminoallyl UTP.

In some embodiments nucleic acids are labeled by catalytically adding to the nucleic acid an already labeled nucleotide or nucleotides. One or more labeled nucleotides can be added to miRNA molecules. See U.S. Pat. No. 6 723 509 which is hereby incorporated by reference.

In other embodiments an unlabeled nucleotide or nucleotides is catalytically added to an miRNA and the unlabeled nucleotide is modified with a chemical moiety that enables it to be subsequently labeled. In embodiments of the invention the chemical moiety is a reactive amine such that the nucleotide is an amine modified nucleotide.

Examples of amine modified nucleotides are well known to those of skill in the art many being commercially available such as from Ambion Sigma Jena Bioscience and TriLink.

In contrast to labeling of cDNA during its synthesis the issue for labeling miRNA is how to label the already existing molecule. The present invention concerns the use of an enzyme capable of using a di or tri phosphate ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide as a substrate for its addition to an miRNA a small RNA molecule. Moreover in specific embodiments it involves using a modified di or tri phosphate ribonucleotide which is added to the 3 end of an miRNA. The source of the enzyme is not limiting. Examples of sources for the enzymes include yeast gram negative bacteria such as and sheep pox virus.

Enzymes capable of adding such nucleotides include but are not limited to poly A polymerase terminal transferase and polynucleotide phosphorylase. In specific embodiments of the invention ligase is contemplated as NOT being the enzyme used to add the label and instead a non ligase enzyme is employed.

Poly A polymerase has been cloned from a number of organisms from plants to humans. It has been shown to catalyze the addition of homopolymer tracts to RNA Martin et al. RNA 4 2 226 30 1998 .

Labels on miRNA or miRNA probes may be colorimetric includes visible and UV spectrum including fluorescent luminescent enzymatic or positron emitting including radioactive . The label may be detected directly or indirectly. Radioactive labels include I P P and S. Examples of enzymatic labels include alkaline phosphatase luciferase horseradish peroxidase and galactosidase. Labels can also be proteins with luminescent properties e.g. green fluorescent protein and phicoerythrin.

The colorimetric and fluorescent labels contemplated for use as conjugates include but are not limited to Alexa Fluor dyes BODIPY dyes such as BODIPY FL Cascade Blue Cascade Yellow coumarin and its derivatives such as 7 amino 4 methylcoumarin aminocoumarin and hydroxycoumarin cyanine dyes such as Cy3 and Cy5 eosins and erythrosins fluorescein and its derivatives such as fluorescein isothiocyanate macrocyclic chelates of lanthanide ions such as Quantum Dye Marina Blue Oregon Green rhodamine dyes such as rhodamine red tetramethylrhodamine and rhodamine 6G Texas Red fluorescent energy transfer dyes such as thiazole orange ethidium heterodimer and TOTAB.

Specific examples of fluorescently labeled ribonucleotides are available from Molecular Probes and these include Alexa Fluor 488 5 UTP Fluorescein 12 UTP BODIPY FL 14 UTP BODIPY TMR 14 UTP Tetramethylrhodamine 6 UTP Alexa Fluor 546 14 UTP Texas Red 5 UTP and BODIPY TR 14 UTP. Other fluorescent ribonucleotides are available from Amersham Biosciences such as Cy3 UTP and Cy5 UTP.

Examples of fluorescently labeled deoxyribonucleotides include Dinitrophenyl DNP 11 dUTP Cascade Blue 7 dUTP Alexa Fluor 488 5 dUTP Fluorescein 12 dUTP Oregon Green 488 5 dUTP BODIPY FL 14 dUTP Rhodamine Green 5 dUTP Alexa Fluor 532 5 dUTP BODIPY TMR 14 dUTP Tetramethylrhodamine 6 dUTP Alexa Fluor 546 14 dUTP Alexa Fluor 568 5 dUTP Texas Red 12 dUTP Texas Red 5 dUTP BODIPY TR 14 dUTP Alexa Fluor 594 5 dUTP BODIPY 630 650 14 dUTP BODIPY 650 665 14 dUTP Alexa Fluor 488 7 OBEA dCTP Alexa Fluor 546 16 OBEA dCTP Alexa Fluor 594 7 OBEA dCTP Alexa Fluor 647 12 OBEA dCTP.

It is contemplated that nucleic acids may be labeled with two different labels. Furthermore fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET may be employed in methods of the invention e.g. Klostermeier et al. 2002 Emptage 2001 Didenko 2001 each incorporated by reference .

Alternatively the label may not be detectable per se but indirectly detectable or allowing for the isolation or separation of the targeted nucleic acid. For example the label could be biotin digoxigenin polyvalent cations chelator groups and the other ligands include ligands for an antibody.

A number of techniques for visualizing or detecting labeled nucleic acids are readily available. The reference by Stanley T. Crooke 2000 has a discussion of such techniques Chapter 6 which is incorporated by reference. Such techniques include microscopy arrays Fluorometry Light cyclers or other real time PCR machines FACS analysis scintillation counters Phosphoimagers Geiger counters MRI CAT antibody based detection methods Westerns immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry histochemical techniques HPLC Griffey et al. 1997 spectroscopy capillary gel electrophoresis Cummins et al. 1996 spectroscopy mass spectroscopy radiological techniques and mass balance techniques.

When two or more differentially colored labels are employed fluorescent resonance energy transfer FRET techniques may be employed to characterize the dsRNA. Furthermore a person of ordinary skill in the art is well aware of ways of visualizing identifying and characterizing labeled nucleic acids and accordingly such protocols may be used as part of the invention. Examples of tools that may be used also include fluorescent microscopy a BioAnalyzer a plate reader Storm Molecular Dynamics Array Scanner FACS fluorescent activated cell sorter or any instrument that has the ability to excite and detect a fluorescent molecule.

The present invention can be employed with miRNA arrays which are ordered macroarrays or microarrays of nucleic acid molecules probes that are fully or nearly complementary or identical to a plurality of miRNA molecules or precursor miRNA molecules and that are positioned on a support material in a spatially separated organization. Macroarrays are typically sheets of nitrocellulose or nylon upon which probes have been spotted. Microarrays position the nucleic acid probes more densely such that up to 10 000 nucleic acid molecules can be fit into a region typically 1 to 4 square centimeters. Microarrays can be fabricated by spotting nucleic acid molecules e.g. genes oligonucleotides etc. onto substrates or fabricating oligonucleotide sequences in situ on a substrate. Spotted or fabricated nucleic acid molecules can be applied in a high density matrix pattern of up to about 30 non identical nucleic acid molecules per square centimeter or higher e.g. up to about 100 or even 1000 per square centimeter. Microarrays typically use coated glass as the solid support in contrast to the nitrocellulose based material of filter arrays. By having an ordered array of miRNA complementing nucleic acid samples the position of each sample can be tracked and linked to the original sample. A variety of different array devices in which a plurality of distinct nucleic acid probes are stably associated with the surface of a solid support are known to those of skill in the art. Useful substrates for arrays include nylon glass and silicon Such arrays may vary in a number of different ways including average probe length sequence or types of probes nature of bond between the probe and the array surface e.g. covalent or non covalent and the like.

Representative methods and apparatus for preparing a microarray have been described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 143 854 5 202 231 5 242 974 5 288 644 5 324 633 5 384 261 5 405 783 5 412 087 5 424 186 5 429 807 5 432 049 5 436 327 5 445 934 5 468 613 5 470 710 5 472 672 5 492 806 5 525 464 5 503 980 5 510 270 5 525 464 5 527 681 5 529 756 5 532 128 5 545 531 5 547 839 5 554 501 5 556 752 5 561 071 5 571 639 5 580 726 5 580 732 5 593 839 5 599 695 5 599 672 5 610 287 5 624 711 5 631 134 5 639 603 5 654 413 5 658 734 5 661 028 5 665 547 5 667 972 5 695 940 5 700 637 5 744 305 5 800 992 5 807 522 5 830 645 5 837 196 5 871 928 5 847 219 5 876 932 5 919 626 6 004 755 6 087 102 6 368 799 6 383 749 6 617 112 6 638 717 6 720 138 as well as WO 93 17126 WO 95 11995 WO 95 21265 WO 95 21944 WO 95 35505 WO 96 31622 WO 97 10365 WO 97 27317 WO 99 35505 WO 09923256 WO 09936760 WO0138580 WO 0168255 WO 03020898 WO 03040410 WO 03053586 WO 03087297 WO 03091426 WO03100012 WO 04020085 WO 04027093 EP 373 203 EP 785 280 EP 799 897 and UK 8 803 000 the disclosures of which are all herein incorporated by reference.

It is contemplated that the arrays can be high density arrays such that they contain 100 or more different probes. It is contemplated that they may contain 1000 16 000 65 000 250 000 or 1 000 000 or more different probes. The probes can be directed to targets in one or more different organisms. The oligonucleotide probes range from 5 to 50 5 to 45 10 to 40 or 15 to 40 nucleotides in length in some embodiments. In certain embodiments the oligonucleotide probes are 20 to 25 nucleotides in length.

The location and sequence of each different probe sequence in the array are generally known. Moreover the large number of different probes can occupy a relatively small area providing a high density array having a probe density of generally greater than about 60 100 600 1000 5 000 10 000 40 000 100 000 or 400 000 different oligonucleotide probes per cm. The surface area of the array can be about or less than about 1 1.6 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 cm.

Moreover a person of ordinary skill in the art could readily analyze data generated using an array. Such protocols are disclosed above and include information found in WO 9743450 WO 03023058 WO 03022421 WO 03029485 WO 03067217 WO 03066906 WO 03076928 WO 03093810 WO 03100448A1 all of which are specifically incorporated by reference.

It is contemplated that the miRNA of a wide variety of samples can be analyzed using assays described herein. While endogenous miRNA is contemplated for use with some embodiments recombinant miRNA including nucleic acids that are complementary or identical to endogenous miRNA or precursor miRNA can also be handled and analyzed as described herein. Samples may be biological samples in which case they can be from blood tissue organs semen saliva tears other bodily fluid hair follicles skin or any sample containing or constituting biological cells. Alternatively the sample may not be a biological sample but be a chemical mixture such as a cell free reaction mixture which may contain one or more biological enzymes .

After the array is prepared and the miRNA in the sample is labeled the population of target nucleic acids is contacted with the array under hybridization conditions where such conditions can be adjusted as desired to provide for an optimum level of specificity in view of the particular assay being performed. Suitable hybridization conditions are well known to those of skill in the art and reviewed in Sambrook et al. 1989 and WO 95 21944. Of particular interest in many embodiments is the use of stringent conditions during hybridization. Stringent conditions are known to those of skill in the art.

It is specifically contemplated that a single array may be contacted with multiple samples. The samples may be labeled with different labels to distinguish the samples. For example a single array can be contacted with a tumor tissue sample labeled with Cy3 and normal tissue sample labeled with Cy5. Differences between the samples for particular miRNAs corresponding to probes on the array can be readily ascertained and quantified.

The small surface area of the array permits uniform hybridization conditions such as temperature regulation and salt content. Moreover because of the small area occupied by the high density arrays hybridization may be carried out in extremely small fluid volumes e.g. about 250 l or less including volumes of about or less than about 5 10 25 50 60 70 80 90 100 l or any range derivable therein . In small volumes hybridization may proceed very rapidly.

Arrays can be used to detect differences between two samples. This can also be used for diagnostic purposes. Specifically contemplated applications include identifying and or quantifying differences between miRNA from a sample that is normal and from a sample that is not normal or between two differently treated samples. Also miRNA may be compared between a sample believed to be susceptible to a particular disease or condition and one believed to be not susceptible or resistant to that disease or condition. A sample that is not normal is one exhibiting phenotypic trait s of a disease or condition or one believed to be not normal with respect to that disease or condition. It may be compared to a cell that is normal with respect to that disease or condition. Phenotypic traits include symptoms of or susceptibility to a disease or condition of which a component is or may or may not be genetic.

Specifically contemplated applications include identifying miRNAs that contribute to cellular processes that are themselves parts of a disease or might otherwise be associated with a particular disease state. Also miRNA functions may be compared between a sample believed to be susceptible to a particular disease or condition and one believed to be not susceptible or resistant to that disease or condition. It is specifically contemplated that RNA molecules of the present invention can be used to treat any of the diseases or conditions discussed in the previous section or modulate any of the cellular pathways discussed in the previous section.

It is specifically contemplated that RNA molecules of the present invention can be used to treat any of the diseases or conditions discussed in the previous section. Moreover any of the methods described above can also be employed with respect to therapeutic and diagnostic aspects of the invention. For example methods with respect to detecting miRNAs or screening for them can also be employed in a diagnostic context.

In therapeutic applications an effective amount of the synthetic miRNAs or miRNA inhibitors of the present invention is administered to a cell which may or may not be in an animal. In some embodiments a therapeutically effective amount of the synthetic miRNAs or miRNA inhibitors of the present invention is administered to an individual for the treatment of disease or condition. The term effective amount as used herein is defined as the amount of the molecules of the present invention that are necessary to result in the desired physiological change in the cell or tissue to which it is administered. The term therapeutically effective amount as used herein is defined as the amount of the molecules of the present invention that achieves a desired effect with respect to a disease or condition. A skilled artisan readily recognizes that in many cases the molecules may not provide a cure but may provide a partial benefit such as alleviation or improvement of at least one symptom. In some embodiments a physiological change having some benefit is also considered therapeutically beneficial. Thus in some embodiments an amount of molecules that provides a physiological change is considered an effective amount or a therapeutically effective amount. 

In some embodiments the molecule has a sequence that corresponds to the miRNA sequence from that particular animal as opposed to from another animal. Thus in some embodiments a human sequence is utilized in the RNA molecules of the present invention.

The nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be administered to a subject alone or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of a condition or disease. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers diluents excipients or auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the proteins into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.

For topical administration the proteins of the invention may be formulated as solutions gels ointments creams suspensions etc. as are well known in the art. Systemic formulations include those designed for administration by injection e.g. subcutaneous intravenous intramuscular intrathecal or intraperitoneal injection as well as those designed for transdermal transmucosal inhalation oral or pulmonary administration. For injection the nucleic acids of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks solution Ringer s solution or physiological saline buffer. The solution may contain formulatory agents such as suspending stabilizing and or dispersing agents. Alternatively the nucleic acid molecules may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle e.g. sterile pyrogen free water before use. For transmucosal administration penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. For oral administration the nucleic acids can be readily formulated by combining the molecules with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the nucleic acids of the invention to be formulated as tablets pills dragees capsules liquids gels syrups slurries suspensions and the like for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. For oral solid formulations such as for example powders capsules and tablets suitable excipients include fillers such as sugars e.g. lactose sucrose mannitol and sorbitol cellulose preparations such as maize starch wheat starch rice starch potato starch gelatin gum tragacanth methyl cellulose hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose sodium carboxymethylcellulose and or polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP granulating agents and binding agents. If desired disintegrating agents may be added such as the cross linked polyvinylpyrrolidone agar or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. If desired solid dosage forms may be sugar coated or enteric coated using standard techniques. For oral liquid preparations such as for example suspensions elixirs and solutions suitable carriers excipients or diluents include water glycols oils alcohols etc. Additionally flavoring agents preservatives coloring agents and the like may be added. For buccal administration the molecules may take the form of tablets lozenges etc. formulated in conventional manner. For administration by inhalation the molecules for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressurized packs or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane trichlorofluoromethane dichlorotetrafluoroethane carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the nucleic acids and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The RNA molecules may also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.

In addition to the formulations described previously the molecules may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly or by intramuscular injection. Thus for example the molecules may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil or ion exchange resins or as sparingly soluble derivatives for example as a sparingly soluble salt.

Alternatively other pharmaceutical delivery systems may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles that may be used to deliver nucleic acids of the invention.

A nucleic acid of the invention may be administered in combination with a carrier or lipid to increase cellular uptake.

Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the chimeric molecules additional strategies for molecule stabilization may be employed.

Nucleic acids may be included in any of the above described formulations as the free acids or bases or as pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those salts that substantially retain the biologic activity of the free bases and which are prepared by reaction with inorganic acids. Pharmaceutical salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous and other protic solvents than are the corresponding free base forms.

It will be appreciated that endotoxin contamination should be kept minimally at a safe level for example less that 0.5 ng mg protein.

In particular embodiments prolonged absorption of an injectable composition can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption such as for example aluminum monostearate gelatin or combinations thereof.

Any embodiment discussed above with respect to delivery or transport to cells can also be employed with respect to implementing delivery of medicinal compounds discussed in this section.

The molecules of the invention will generally be used in an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose. For use to treat or prevent a disease condition the molecules of the invention or pharmaceutical compositions thereof are administered or applied in a therapeutically effective amount. A therapeutically effective amount is an amount effective to ameliorate or prevent the symptoms or prolong the survival of the patient being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.

For systemic administration a therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from in vitro assays. For example a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the ICas determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.

Initial dosages can also be estimated from in vivo data e.g. animal models using techniques that are well known in the art. One having ordinary skill in the art could readily optimize administration to humans based on animal data.

Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the molecules which are sufficient to maintain therapeutic effect. Usual patient dosages for administration by injection range from about 0.1 to 5 mg kg day preferably from about 0.5 to 1 mg kg day. Therapeutically effective serum levels may be achieved by administering multiple doses each day.

In cases of local administration or selective uptake the effective local concentration of the proteins may not be related to plasma concentration. One having skill in the art will be able to optimize therapeutically effective local dosages without undue experimentation.

The amount of molecules administered will of course be dependent on the subject being treated on the subject s weight the severity of the affliction the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician.

The therapy may be repeated intermittently while symptoms detectable or even when they are not detectable. The therapy may be provided alone or in combination with other drugs or treatment including surgery .

Preferably a therapeutically effective dose of the molecules described herein will provide therapeutic benefit without causing substantial toxicity.

Toxicity of the molecules described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. by determining the LD50 the dose lethal to 50 of the population or the LD the dose lethal to 100 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effect is the therapeutic index. Proteins which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a dosage range that is not toxic for use in human. The dosage of the proteins described herein lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the effective dose with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient s condition.

A series of luciferase reporter vectors was created to measure the activities of synthetic miRNAs in cells. The reporter vectors were based on plasmids that had been used to monitor the activity of endogenous miRNAs Tuschl paper . Briefly a mammalian expression vector with the luciferase gene under the control of the CMV early promoter was created. Down stream of the luciferase coding sequence in the 3 UTR of the gene sequences complementary to mature miR 1 2 miR 10 miR 124 miR 19a and miR 130 were added. The reporter vectors were co transfected into HeLa cells along with synthetic miRNAs designed to introduce one of the five miRNAs listed above. The transfections involved mixing 200 ng of reporter vector with 0.3 1 and 3 pmoles of each corresponding synthetic miRNA. The reporter miRNA mixture was mixed with 0.3 l of Lipofectamine 2000 Invitrogen and incubated for 5 15 minutes. Approximately 8 000 cells were added to each miRNA reporter transfection reagent complex in individual wells of a 96 well plate. HeLa cells were grown in D MEM GIBCO supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum GIBCO at 37 C. and 5 CO. 24 48 hrs post transfection the cells were harvested and assayed using the Luciferase assay as described by the manufacturer Promega . The level of luciferase expression in the cell populations was compared to cells transfected with the same reporter but a synthetic miRNA with a sequence that does not correspond to the vector. This non targeting miRNA was referred to as the negative control miRNA.

Final analysis of the synthetic miRNA designs involved measuring the activity of both the active and complementary strands of our synthetic miRNAs. For these studies reporter vectors with luciferase 3 UTR sequences were created that included regions complementary to both the active and the complementary strands of our synthetic miR 33 and let 7b miRNA designs. When co transfected with malfunctioning synthetic miRNAs the reporters with a sequence targeted by the complementary strand exhibit reduced luciferase expression because the complementary strand of the synthetic miRNAs are entering the miRNA pathway in addition to or even instead of the active strand that is desired. For these experiments the co transfection and reporter analysis protocols are identical to what is described above.

While the luciferase reporter constructs were extremely valuable in evaluating the synthetic miRNA designs it was important to verify the findings of the reporter constructs by measuring the effects of the synthetic miRNAs on endogenous gene targets. For these studies the expression of RAS and MYC in cells transfected with let 7 miRNAs was chosen for monitoring. Both RAS and MYC are down regulated by the various members of the let 7 family in humans and publication pending . Using a microarray system specific to miRNAs the inventors have found that HepG2 cells express undetectable levels of let 7. To test the activities of our various designs of our synthetic miRNAs synthetic let 7 miRNAs were created and used to transfect HepG2 cells in 24 well plates using siPORT NeoFX Ambion according to the manufacturer s suggestions. Three days post transfection the cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde stained with DAPI to localize cell nuclei and stained with FITC conjugated antibodies specific to MYC or RAS US Biological according to the manufacturer s suggestions. The relative reduction in target protein expression in synthetic let 7 transfected cells was determined by comparing the staining intensity of MYC and RAS to cells transfected with a negative control miRNA using MetaMorph software.

To ensure that the results of our let 7 assays could be verified by additional miRNA interactions that are observed naturally in cells we created assays for two additional miRNAs with verified targets. In the first a real time PCR assay was developed to measure the level of the HOXB8 mRNA in cells transfected with synthetic miR 196. It has been shown that miR 196 induces degradation of the HOXB8 mRNA in cells. When transfected into cultured cells using siPORT NeoFX according to the manufacturer s instructions effective miR 196 synthetic miRNA designs reduce the levels of the HOXB8 mRNA.

To monitor the effectiveness of synthetic miR 1 2 miRNAs a reporter vector was created wherein the 3 UTR of the G6PD gene was placed immediately down stream of the luciferase coding region. An interaction between miR 1 2 and the G6PD 3 UTR has been published Lewis 2003 . Synthetic miR 1 2 designs were co transfected with the reporter vector and assayed as described in Example 1.

Three general sequence designs were compared for miRNA activity. The first referred to as the miRNA design featured an active strand identical to the mature miRNA found in animals and a complementary strand that was identical to the hairpin sequence that is predicted to exist in cells during the processing of the miRNA prior to activation of the miRNA see below . The second design referred to as the mismatch design was a hybrid of the same active strand as above with a complementary strand with a di nucleotide 3 overhang and two mismatches in the final five nucleotides that preceded the 3 overhang see below . The third design referred to as the siRNA design comprised the same active strand as above hybridized to a second RNA that was fully complementary except that it left 3 di nucleotide overhangs at either end of the double stranded molecule two polynucleotides see below . The examples below involve or correspond to human miRNAs.

To assess whether there were differences between the various miRNA designs in their ability to affect the expression of endogenous genes the following cells were transfected HepG2 cells with three designs of the let 7 synthetic miRNAs A549 with three designs of the miR 196 synthetic miRNAs and HeLa with the G6PD reporter vector and three designs of the miR 1 2 synthetic miRNA. As with the reporter vectors all three synthetic miRNA designs proved capable of reducing the expression of the target genes though it is notable that the siRNA design performed most poorly.

As a final comparison of the three synthetic miRNA designs synthetic miRNAs were co transfected with reporter vectors that included target sites for the complementary strands of the synthetic miRNAs according to the procedure described in Example 1. In this assay it was apparent that the siRNA design significantly affected the reporter vectors indicating that the wrong strand of the miRNA was entering the miRNA pathway . Because the complementary strand might impact the expression of genes that are not natural targets of the miRNA that is being studied the siRNA design is inappropriate for effective synthetic miRNAs.

Although the siRNA design proved problematic in that it exhibited a high rate of complementary strand uptake by the miRNA pathway it did have the advantage that it was easy to hybridize and easy to deliver to cells. For these reasons ways to overcome the problems with complementary strand uptake were explored. The siRNA design was used to test the effects of chemical modifications at the 5 ends of the synthetic miRNAs. For these studies several different complementary strands were synthesized with unique 5 ends. One featured four deoxyribose nucleotides at the 5 end one was a combination of four deoxyribose nucleotides at the 5 end and a 5 NH one had a 5 NH one had a 5 NHCOCH see below .

To confirm that the 5 amino modification is superior to the standard siRNA design for a broad set of synthetic miRNAs the effectiveness of both synthetic miRNA designs was measured in cells co transfected with reporter vectors with miRNA target sites. As seen in the 5 NHis reproducibly superior to the unmodified siRNA design.

The siRNA design was also used to test the effects of chemical modifications at internal domains within the complementary strand. For these studies 2 O Me modifications were placed at various locations along the length of the complementary strand. Below is provided an example of a series of synthetic miRNAs with chemically modified complementary strands.

Synthetic miRNAs with the designs described above were tested for miRNA and complementary strand activity. Interestingly complementary strand modifications at positions 1 and 5 significantly reduced complementary strand activity without altering the activity of the miRNA strand .

A hallmark of cancer is uncontrolled cell proliferation cell proliferation assays are commonly used by researchers to study the influence of genes in oncogenesis. A cell proliferation assay was used in conjunction with the miRNA inhibitor library to identify miRNAs that influence cell proliferation.

The inventors transfected HeLa cells in triplicate with fifteen different synthetic miRNAs using siPORT NeoFX Ambion according to the manufacturer s instructions . Transfected HeLa cells were analyzed using Alamar Blue BioSource International Inc. CA at 24 hr intervals. Alamar Blue is a compound that when reduced by cellular metabolism changes from a non fluorescent blue color to a fluorescent red form that is easily quantified. The amount of Alamar Blue reduced is directly proportional to the cell number providing a rapid method for assessing cell proliferation. To perform the assay the Alamar Blue reagent was added into the tissue culture media at a 10 final concentration. The mixture was incubated for 3 6 hr in growth conditions after which fluorescence was quantified using a Spectra Max GeminiXS Molecular Devices Sunnyvale Calif. . Cells transfected with synthetic miR 124 and miR 106 exhibited significantly lower proliferation than negative control transfected samples as well as samples transfected with the other synthetic miRNAs.

A hallmark of cancer is uncontrolled cell proliferation. Cell proliferation assays are commonly used by researchers to study the influence of genes in oncogenesis. A cell proliferation assay was used in conjunction with our miRNA inhibitor library to identify miRNAs that influence cell proliferation.

Cells were transfected with a library of over 90 miRNA inhibitors to identify miRNAs that are involved in cell growth. HeLa cells 8000 cells well of 96 well plate were transfected in triplicate with 5 pmoles of miRNA inhibitors using siPORT NeoFX Ambion . The media was changed 24 hrs after transfection. 72 hours post transfection we fixed cells with 4 paraformaldehyde permiabilized with 0.1 TritonX 100 and stained with propidium iodide to look at total cell number. The plates were scanned using the TTP labtech Acumen Explorer. Cell number was plotted relative to cells transfected with a negative control miRNA inhibitor . The red horizontal bars bracket normal variation in cell proliferation 20 variation . Insets Specific miRNA inhibitors that either increased cell proliferation left arrow or did not affect cell proliferation right arrow were used in a second round of screening. HeLa cells were transfected with these miRNA inhibitors and cells were fixed and stained with anti b actin antibody and DAPI to visualize cell morphology changes in response to specific miRNA function. Cells transfected with the miRNA inhibitor that increased cell proliferation show marked alteration in cell morphology left inset vs. normal morphology right inset .

A group of nine miRNA inhibitors were identified that caused significant decreases miR 31 150 187 125a 190 191 193 204 and 218 in cell growth and two miRNA inhibitors that caused a significant increase miR 24 and miR 21 in cell growth following transfection into HeLa cells Table 4 . MiRNA 31 inhibition also caused a distinct cellular morphology. A relative cut off of 20 above and below 100 was chosen as genes that were considered significantly changed. These results demonstrate the ability of individual human miRNAs to regulate important cellular processes. Furthermore the diversity of the observed effects demonstrates the potential complexity of cellular outcomes of miRNA mediated regulation of gene expression.

Many diseases including cancer are characterized by an inability to institute programmed cell death or apoptosis. A caspase 3 7 activity assay was used in conjunction with a library of synthetic miRNAs to identify miRNAs that are involved in regulating apoptosis.

A library of eighteen synthetic miRNAs was used to transfect A549 cells 8000 cells well of 96 well plate in triplicate using siPORT NeoFX Ambion . Media was changed after 24 hrs and cells were visually inspected under a microscope to qualitatively inspect cell death 72 hours after transfection. The cells were measured for apoptosis by measuring caspase 3 activity as follows 1 Cells were washed once with PBS and frozen at 80 C. 2 Cells were lysed by adding 40 l of cold lysis buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.2 40 mM NaCl 0.5 NP40 0.5 mM EDTA to the wells and incubated for 20 min at 4 C. 3 Add 160 l ICE buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4 0.1 CHAPS 0.1 mM EDTA 10 sucrose 5 mM DTT containing 20 M DEVDafc substrate. 4 Measure fluorescence increase in one hour at 400 ex 505 em.

Cells transfected with miR 1 2 and miR 33 synthetic miRNAs exhibited reduced caspase 3 7 activity and cells transfected with miR 20 exhibited much higher levels of apoptosis. These three miRNAs likely regulate genes that are involved in controlling apoptosis.

miRNA inhibitors were also used to identify miRNAs that influence cell viability. A library of over 90 miRNA inhibitors was used to transfect A549 cells 8000 cells well of 96 well plate in triplicate using siPORT NeoFX Ambion . Media was changed after 24 hrs and cells were visually inspected under a microscope to qualitatively inspect cell death 72 hours after transfection. Cells were trypsinized and stained with ViaCount Flex Reagent which distinguishes between viable and non viable cells based on permeability of the DNA binding dyes in the reagent. Cells were analyzed using the Guava PCA 96 Personal Cell Analysis .

Twenty one miRNA inhibitors induced a significantly different ratio of live to dead cells than did the negative control miRNA inhibitor . Twelve reduced cell viability and nine increased cell viability Table 5 . Interestingly there was littleoverlap in the miRNAs that affected cell viability in A549 cells and those that affected cell proliferation in HeLa cells suggesting that different cells respond differently to have reduced miRNA activities or cell viability and cell proliferation are not affected by the same cellular pathways.

Apoptosis is a natural cellular process that helps control cancer by inducing death in cells with oncogenic potential. Many oncogenes function by altering induction of apoptosis. To identify miRNAs that participate in apoptosis an apoptosis assay was used with the miRNA inhibitor library.

Using a library of over 90 miRNA inhibitors we screened for miRNAs that affect apoptosis. HeLa cells 8000 cells well of 96 well plate were transfected in triplicate with miRNA inhibitors 5 pmoles using Ambion siPORT NeoFX . The media was changed 24 hrs after transfection and processed cells 72 hours after transfection. The cells were measured for apoptosis by measuring caspase 3 activity as follows 1 Cells were washed once with PBS and frozen at 80 C. 2 Cells were lysed by adding 40 l of cold lysis buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.2 40 mM NaCl 0.5 NP40 0.5 mM EDTA to the wells and incubated for 20 min at 4 C. 3 Add 160 l ICE buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4 0.1 CHAPS 0.1 mM EDTA 10 sucrose 5 mM DTT containing 20 M DEVDafc substrate. 4 Measure fluorescence increase in one hour at 400 ex 505 em.

Samples were also analyzed for cell number using a general esterase assay to normalize the caspase 3 results. FDA substrate 0.4 mg ml fluorescein diacetate FDA in acetonitrile was diluted 1 19 into dilution buffer 40 mM TrisCl pH 7.5 20 mM NaCl 0.5 NP 40 0.02 mg ml final conc . 40 l buffer 40 mM TrisCl pH 7.5 0.5 NP 40 was added to each sample well. Samples were incubated 10 min on ice. 160 l of diluted FDA substrate was added to each well. Fluorescence was measured for 30 min at 37 C. ex 488 em 529 . The slope of fluorescence increase over time is a function of the cell number in the plate.

Normalized screening data are displayed in . miRNAs that affect apoptosis are listed in Table 5 and 6.

In addition to using phenotypic assays to identify miRNAs that influence gross cellular processes or cellular pathways collections of synthetic miRNAs and or miRNA inhibitors can be used to identify miRNAs that directly regulate the expression of a gene. A plasmid was created that had a luciferase gene immediately upstream of the 3 UTR of the G6PD gene. A549 cells were co transfected with the reporter vector and eighteen different synthetic miRNAs. 24 hours post transfection luciferase activity in the various cell populations was measured. Interestingly the miR 1 2 significantly reduced the expression of the luciferase G6PD gene indicating that this family of miRNAs regulates the expression of the G6PD gene. Similar experiments can be used to identify miRNAs that regulate the expression of such important genes as p53 BRCA1 and BRCA2 RAS MYC BCL 2 and others.

As noted in previous examples a number of miRNAs have been identified that are differentially expressed between tumor and normal adjacent tissue samples from the same cancer patients. Interestingly there is significant overlap in the miRNAs that are differentially expressed between different cancers suggesting there is a core set of miRNAs that influence cellular processes that when altered lead to cancer. The following describes experiments aimed at developing a link between miRNA mis regulation and cancer.

Twenty two tumor and normal adjacent tissue NAT samples from lung cancer patients were analyzed using the miRNA array system described above. The arrays were analyzed and the relative expression of each miRNA was compared between the tumor and normal adjacent tissues from each patient. The various miRNAs were clustered based on their relative expression in tumors across different patients . Six miRNAs miR 126 30a 143 145 188 and 331 were expressed at significantly lower levels in the tumors of more than 70 of the patients. Two miRNAs miR 21 and 200b were expressed at significantly higher levels in the tumors of more than 70 of the patients. The differential expression of a number of these miRNAs was verified by Northern analysis .

Twenty five tumor and NAT samples from colon cancer patients were analyzed using our miRNA array process. Like the lung cancer comparisons the various miRNAs were clustered based on their relative expression in tumors across the different colon cancer patients . Five miRNAs miR 143 145 195 130a and miR 331 were expressed at significantly lower levels in the tumors of more than 70 of the patients. Five miRNAs miR 223 21 31 17 and 106 were expressed at significantly higher levels in the tumors of more than 70 of the patients.

It is interesting that eight different miRNAs were differentially expressed between the tumor and normal adjacent samples for most of the lung and colon patient samples that we analyzed . These same miRNAs were also found to be differentially expressed in the breast thymus bladder pancreatic and prostate cancer patients that we analyzed suggesting that these miRNAs might control cellular processes that when altered lead to cancer.

To address whether specific miRNAs might be participating in cancer through the mis regulation of oncogenes we scanned the 3 untranslated regions UTRs of 150 well known oncogenes for sequences with significant homology to the miRNAs identified in our microarray analysis. Potential target sites were selected based on two criteria 

As seen in Table 8 potential target sites in the 3 UTRs of known oncogenes were identified for all of the miRNAs that were observed to be routinely differentially expressed in tumor samples. Interestingly KRAS2 MYCL1 and CBL have multiple predicted miRNA binding sites which could provide the cooperative miRNA binding that has been implicated as an important factor in miRNA regulation Doench et al. 2003 Zeng et al. 2003 . Many of the genes listed in Table 8 become oncogenic when they are over expressed thus it is conceivable that reduced expression of a miRNA could lead to up regulation of one or more oncogenes and subsequently lead to oncogenesis.

Confirming miRNA target site predictions can be done in a variety of ways. In and genetic approaches have been applied wherein mutations in the miRNA and the putative miRNA target site s are made and shown to result in similar phenotypes Ha et al. 1996 Vella et al. 2004 . In mammalian cells where genetic approaches are far more difficult reporter constructs have been used to show that the 3 UTRs of putative target genes are regulated in cells at levels that are disproportionate to reporter vector controls that contain mutations in the putative miRNA binding sites Lewis et al. 2003 . In addition vectors and oligonucleotides have been used to introduce or inhibit miRNAs in cells to determine the effects on endogenous levels of putative target genes Lewis et al. 2003 Kiriakidou et al. 2004 . The latter approach has been undertaken to validate the miRNA target site predictions.

Synthetic miRNAs and miRNA inhibitors have been developed that can be transfected into mammalian cells to either introduce miRNAs into cells or inhibit the activity of miRNAs in cells respectively. See U.S. Ser. No. 60 627 171 which is hereby incorporated by reference. A synthetic miRNA and a miRNA inhibitor corresponding to let 7b were used to determine if the target site predictions were correct. In these experiments cultured cells that express undetectable levels of the miRNA were transfected with the synthetic miRNA using siPORT NeoFX Transfection Agent Ambion . Immunofluorescence assays were used to RAS and C MYC in the transfected cells. The proteins from both oncogenes were expressed at almost three fold lower levels in cells transfected with the synthetic miRNA than cells transfected with a Negative Control miRNA Ambion . In a reciprocal experiment cells that naturally express high levels of the miRNA were transfected with the let 7 miRNA inhibitor. As expected the proteins from both oncogenes were higher in cells transfected with the miRNA inhibitor than in cells transfected with the Negative Control inhibitor Ambion . These results are consistent with the model that the miRNA regulates the expression of the two oncogenes. These data suggest that mis regulation of a key miRNA could participate in cancer progression by failing to regulate the expression of one or more oncogenes.

Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE Lupus is a chronic inflammatory auto immune disease that ultimately leads to immune complex mediated end organ failure. It is characterized by an over activation of CD4 T helper cells and repression of CD8 T cytotoxic activity leading to an overproduction of natural antibodies and pathogenic autoantibodies. Recently several histone modifications were reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs isolated from lupus patients. Diagnosis of lupus is still frequently incorrect mainly because the symptoms vary so widely and they come and go frequently and because the disease mimics so many other disorders. Furthermore diagnosis does not indicate the particular therapy to be used. In the absence of a cure present day treatment of lupus is still primarily tailored to symptomatic relief and not to the diagnosis. A diagnostic assay with high specificity and sensitivity would be very important.

Samples were analyzed from 16 individuals 8 with clinically verified lupus and 8 non lupus patients that were age and gender matched with the lupus patients. Total RNA from these samples was isolated using the glass fiber filter method described above. The total RNA was fractionated by tube electrophoresis to recover the miRNAs. The miRNAs were fluorescently labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 using the two step fluorescent labeling process described above. The labeled miRNAs were hybridized to miRNA probes arrayed on glass slides as described above. The signal from the hybridized miRNAs was quantified using a GenePix 4000B Scanner Axon and the lupus and normal sample signals were compared to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. Each array experiment included duplicate arrays.

Fourteen miRNAs were differentially expressed in all of the lupus samples relative to the matched samples. miR 301 miR 199 miR 95 miR 105 mu miR 290 miR 215 miR 188 miR 186 miR 211 miR 331 and miR 137 were expressed at 50 or less in the lupus samples than the corresponding normal samples. miR 21 miR 223 and miR 342 were expressed at 50 or greater in the lupus samples than the corresponding normal samples. Several of the miRNAs were differentially expressed by as much as ten fold between the lupus and normal samples. These miRNAs represent targets for diagnostic assay of therapeutic development.

Novel infectious particles termed prions composed largely and perhaps solely of a single protein are the likely causative agents of a group of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies that produce lethal decline of cognitive and motor function. Evidence indicates that the responsible protein arrives at a pathogenic state by misfolding from a normal form that has ubiquitous tissue distribution.

Using two cell based prion model systems the identification of miRNAs that might be associated with the process was pursued. One model system comprises two cell lines one of which is susceptible to prion formation and one that is not. The second model system involves cells before and after they have been infected with prions. Total RNA from prion sensitive cells prion insensitive cells and prion infected cells was isolated using the glass fiber filter method described above. The total RNA was fractionated by tube electrophoresis to recover the miRNAs. The miRNAs were fluorescently labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 using the two step fluorescent labeling process described above. The labeled miRNAs were hybridized to miRNA probes arrayed on glass slides as described above. The signal from the hybridized miRNAs was quantified using a GenePix 4000B Scanner Axon and the signal from each of the samples was compared to identify differentially expressed miRNAs.

As seen in ten miRNAs were significantly up or down regulated in both prion sensitive and prion infected cells relative to prion resistant uninfected cells. Arrays on multiple biological replicates for both model systems have confirmed these results. Based on their expression profiles miR 95 135a 7 9 27a 130a 16 26a and 24 likely are involved directly or indirectly in prion infection and might represent diagnostic or therapeutic targets for prion disease.

Stroke is a major cause of death and permanent disability in humans. They occur when blood flow to a region of the brain is obstructed and may result in death of brain tissue. There are two main types of stroke ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is caused by blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain resulting in a deficiency in blood flow ischemia . Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by the bleeding of ruptured blood vessels hemorrhage in the brain. Understanding miRNAs involved in stroke might enhance detection and or treatment.

A stroke model system was used wherein mice are preconditioned by reducing oxygen flow to the brain Kitagawa 1991 . An equivalent set of six mice were used three were preconditioned and three were untreated. 24 hours after pre conditioning the mice were sacrificed. Total RNA from these samples was isolated using the glass fiber filter method described above. The total RNA was fractionated by tube electrophoresis to recover the miRNAs. The miRNAs were fluorescently labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 using the two step fluorescent labeling process described above. The labeled miRNAs were hybridized to miRNA probes arrayed on glass slides as described above. The signal from the hybridized miRNAs was quantified using a GenePix 4000B Scanner Axon and the preconditioned and normal sample signals were compared to identify differentially expressed miRNAs.

Analysis of the miRNA profiles of the preconditioned animals labeled P1 P2 and P4 revealed 10 miRNAs that were expressed at significantly different levels in all three pre conditioned animals relative to the three non treated animals . These miRNAs resulted from ischemic pre conditioning and represent potential targets for stroke diagnosis prevention or treatment.

A hallmark of cancer is uncontrolled cell proliferation cell proliferation assays are commonly used by researchers to study the influence of genes in oncogenesis. A cell proliferation assay was used in conjunction with the miRNA inhibitor library to identify miRNAs that influence cell proliferation.

HeLa human ovarian cancer and A549 human lung cancer cells were transfected in triplicate with 150 synthetic miRNAs using siPORT NeoFX Ambion according to the manufacturer s instructions. The 150 are as follows Let 7a Let 7b Let 7c Let 7d Let 7g mir 1 mir 7 mir 9 mir 10a mir 10b mir 15a mir 16 mir 18 mir 19a mir 17 3p mir 20 mir 21 mir 22 mir 23a mir 23b mir 24 mir 25 mir 26a mir 27a mir 28 mir 29a mir 31 mir 32 mir 30a 3p mir 34a mir 92 mir 95 mir 96 mir 98 mir 99a mir 100 mir 101 mir 103 mir 105 mir 107 mir 108 mir 122 mir 124 mir 125a mir 125b mir 126 mir 128 mir 129 mir 132 mir 133A mir 133B mir 134 mir 135 mir 136 mir 137 mir 139 mir 140 mir 141 mir 142 mir 143 mir 144 mir 145 mir 146 mir 147 mir 148 mir 149 mir 150 mir 151 mir 152 mir 153 mir 155 mir 181a mir 182 mir 183 mir 184 mir 186 mir 187 mir 188 mir 190 mir 191 mir 192 mir 193 mir 194 mir 195 mir 196 mir 197 mir 198 mir 199 mir 201 mir 203 mir 204 mir 205 mir 206 mir 207 mir 208 mir 210 mir 211 mir 212 mir 214 mir 215 mir 216 mir 217 mir 218 mir 219 mir 220 mir 221 mir 223 mir 224 mir 299 mir 301 mir 302 mir 320 mir 322 mir 323 mir 325 mir 324 3p mir 328 mir 330 mir 331 mir 335 mir 337 mir 338 mir 339 mir 340 mir 345 mir 346 mir 367 mir 368 mir 369 mir 370 mir 371 mir 372 mir 373 mir 374 mu mir 290 mu mir 291 mu mir 292 3p mu mir 293 mu mir 294 mu mir 295 mu mir 297 mu mir 298 mu mir 329 mu mir 341 mu mir 344 mu mir 351 mu mir 376b mu mir 380 3p mu mir 409 mu mir 411 mu mir 412

The synthetic miRNAs were double stranded nucleic acid molecules composed of an active strand and a complementary strand. The active strand contained a sequence that was identical to the corresponding mature miRNA. The complementary strand contained a sequence that was 100 complementary to the relevant region of the mature miRNA sequence but 1 lacking two nucleotides on its 3 end that were complementary to the mature miRNA sequence at the 5 end of the active strand and 2 having a dinucleotide overhang on its 5 end with respect to the active strand. In other words the two strands were fully complementary to the other s sequence except that each strand has a dinucleotide 5 overhang with respect to the other strand. The same kind of synthetic miRNAs were used for Examples 18 21 as well. Any exceptions are described below. The miRNAs indicated in the tables identify the miRNA that corresponds to the provided synthetic sequence.

Jurkat cells human leukemia cell and primary human T cells in triplicate were electroporated with the same set of synthetic miRNAs using siPorter 96 Ambion according to the manufacturer s instruction. All cells were analyzed for viable and non viable cells 72 hours post transfection using the PCA 96 Guava with the Viacount Assay. Viable cell number is the number of live cells in a well at the point of the assay. The numbers provided in the tables below are equal to the average number of viable cells in wells transfected with a particular miRNA divided by the number of viable cells in wells transfected with negative control synthetic miRNAs multiplied by 100 to yield the Cell Viability of miRNA transfected cells relative to negative control transfected cells.

Significance was assigned based on the average values of the negative control transfected samples. miRNAs that were significantly different than the negative controls were qualified as significant based on being at least two standard deviations above or below the negative control data.

It is interesting to note that the miRNAs that affect one cell type often fail to affect other cell types. This is likely due to the fact that the cellular processes that are active vary between different cell types. This can be vitally important when considering the potential of miRNA based therapeutics. Abnormal disease cells are different from normal cells owing to the fact that different cellular processes are active in the two cell types. Identifying miRNAs that have differential effects on normal and abnormal cells would be ideal since they could be delivered globally and expected to have an effect on only disease cells. When the cell viability data were compared for the leukemia cancerous T cell cells and primary T cells it was noted that let 7a let 7b and miR 10b all significantly reduce the percentage of viable cells in the leukemia cells while essentially having no effect on the corresponding normal T cells. These miRNAs are candidates for leukemia drugs.

In order for cancer cells to proliferate they must subvert both the machinery that controls the cell division cycle and the process of programmed cell death apoptosis . This is frequently achieved by mutation of specific proto oncogenes such as Ras or tumor suppressors such as p53. The Ras family of membrane associated GTPases transmit signals into the interior of the cell by the activation of a number of cytosolic signal transduction pathways such as the Raf MEK ERK MAP kinase signaling pathway. Disregulation of the Ras Raf MEK ERK pathway plays a major role in cancer pathogenesis Meijer .

To identify miRNAs that affect ERK activation HeLa cells were transfected in a 96 well plate format with 150 different synthetic miRNAs. Prior to transfection the HeLa cells were trypsinized to remove adherent cells and diluted in normal growth medium to 10cells mL. 0.5 l of siPort NeoFX in 9.5 l of Optimem I medium was added to the cells and incubated for 10 minutes at room temp 10 L for each sample . miRNAs were rehydrated with 10 l of diluted siPORT NeoFX. The samples were incubated at 37 C. and then the transfected samples were evaluated 72 hours after transfection.

The controls for ERK activation were performed by depriving the wells of a phosphate source for detection of ERK phosphorylation. 100 l of serum free media DMEM to 37 C. was added per well and the cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37 C. to attain basal phosphorylation levels. For the positive control wells serum free media was aspirated from wells and 100 L of 100 ng mL EGF was added before incubating the cells for 7.5 minutes at 37 C.

Media from all wells was removed by aspiration and the cells were immediately fixed in 150 L of 3.7 Formaldehyde in 1 PBS for 20 minutes at room temp with no shaking. Fixing solution was removed to an appropriate waste container. The fixed cells were washed three times with 1 PBS. The wells were then washed three times with 200 L of 1 PBS containing 0.1 Triton X 100 for 5 minutes per wash with shaking at room temp.

Cells were blocked by adding 150 L of Li COR Odyssey Blocking Buffer to each well. The solution was moved carefully by pipetting down the sides of the wells to avoid detaching the cells. Blocking was for 90 minutes at room temp with moderate shaking on a rotator and the two primary antibodies were added to a tube containing Odyssey Blocking Buffer. The primary antibody was incubated for 2 hours with gentle shaking at room temp Phosho ERK Rabbit 1 100 dilution Cell Signaling Technology 9101 . Total ERK2 Mouse 1 75 dilution Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC 1647 . The wells were washed three times with 1 PBS 0.1 Tween 20 for 5 minutes at room temp with gentle shaking using a generous amount of buffer. The fluorescently labeled secondary antibody was diluted in Odyssey Blocking Buffer Goat anti rabbit Alexa Fluor 680 1 200 dilution Molecular Probes Goat anti mouse IRDye 800CW 1 800 diution Rockland Immunochemicals . The antibody solutions were mixed well and 50 L of the secondary antibody solution was added to each well. The antibody solution was incubated for 60 minutes with gentle shaking at room temp. The plate was washed three times with 1 PBS 0.1 Tween 20 for 5 minutes at room temp with gentle shaking using a generous amount of buffer. After a final wash wash solution was completely removed from wells. The plates were scanned with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System 700 nm detection for Alexa Fluor 680 antibody and 800 nm detection for IRDye 800CW antibody . Negative control transfected cells yield 100 erk activation meaning background levels of active erk . Transfecting cells with some of our miRNAs alters the level of active erk.

Apoptosis is a natural cellular process that helps control cancer by inducing death in cells with oncogenic potential. Many oncogenes function by altering induction of apoptosis. To identify miRNAs that participate in apoptosis an apoptosis assay was used with the miRNA inhibitor library.

HeLa cells 8000 cells well of 96 well plate were transfected in triplicate with more than 150 synthetic miRNAs described above 3 pmoles using Ambion siPORT NeoFX . The media was changed 24 hrs after transfection and cells were processed 72 hrs after transfection. The cells were measured for apoptosis by measuring caspase 3 activity as follows 1 Cells were washed once with PBS and frozen at 80 C. 2 Cells were lysed by adding 40 l of cold lysis buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.2 40 mM NaCl 0.5 NP40 0.5 mM EDTA to the wells and incubated for 20 min at 4 C. 3 Add 160 ul ICE buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4 0.1 CHAPS 0.1 mM EDTA 10 sucrose 5 mM DTT containing 20 uM DEVDafc substrate. 4 Measure fluorescence increase in one hour at 400 ex 505 em.

Samples were also analyzed for cell number using a general esterase assay to normalize the caspase 3 results. FDA substrate 0.4 mg ml fluorescein diacetate FDA in acetonitrile was diluted 1 19 into dilution buffer 40 mM TrisCl pH 7.5 20 mM NaCl 0.5 NP 40 0.02 mg ml final conc . 40 l buffer 40 mM TrisCl pH 7.5 0.5 NP 40 was added to each sample well. Samples were incubated 10 min on ice. 160 ul of diluted FDA substrate was added to each well. Fluorescence was measured for 30 min at 37 deg ex 488 em 529 . The slope of fluorescence increase over time is a function of the cell number in the plate.

miRNAs that affect apoptosis are listed in the table below. These miRNAs apparently regulate pathways that lead to apoptosis. Mis regulation of these miRNAs could induce cells to undergo apoptosis or might keep the cells from undergoing apoptosis. Introducing or inhibiting these miRNAs in cancer or other disease cells that have overcome apoptotic signaling pathways or Parkinson s or other disease cells that have prematurely induced apoptosis could be used to treat the diseases.

Telomerase is a complex of proteins and RNA that maintains the ends of chromosomes by appending telomeres. With rare exceptions terminally differentiated cells lack active telomerase. One of the exceptions is cancer cells. More than 90 of human cancer samples have active telomerase reviewed in Dong et al. 2005 . The hTert gene encodes the catalytic domain of telomerase. The expression of hTert correlates with telomerase activity in cells making it a good surrogate for telomerase activity. An RT PCR based assay for monitoring hTert mRNA expression in telomerase negative cells has been developed and used to identify miRNAs that participate in the regulation of telomerase. The miRNAs that regulate telomerase activity represent intervention points for cancer therapeutics.

BJ cells are normal human foreskin fibroblasts that lack hTert mRNA and telomerase activity. BJ cells were trypsinized and diluted to 13 000 cells ml in normal growth media. 0.3 of lipofectamine 2000 agent was diluted into 40 l of OPTI MEM and incubated for five minutes. The diluted transfection reagent was added to the wells of 96 well plates that contained 150 synthetic miRNAs as described above as well as two different negative control synthetic miRNAs. Each well housed a different synthetic miRNA. The synthetic miRNAs and transfection agent were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature and then 200 l 2 600 cells were added on top of the lipid miRNA complex. Cells were placed in an incubator and RNA was isolated 72 hours later. RNA was isolated from the cells in each well using RNAqueous MagMAX96 Total RNA Isolation kit Cat 1830 standard protocol lyse cells in wells . Reverse transcription was done using the RETROscript reaction by adding 11 l of total RNA 20 100 ng l to 1 ul of random decamers and incubated in 70 C. water bath for 3 minutes then place on ice. Next 8 ul of the cocktail containing Nuc free water 3.8 l 10 Reverse Transcription buffer 2.0 ul 2.5 mM dNTPs 2.0 ul RNase Inhibitor Protein 40 U ul 0.1 ul MMLV RT 100 U l and incubated at 42 C. for 1 hour then 92 C. for 10 minutes.

Real time PCR reactions were assembled to quantify hTert mRNA and 18S rRNA in each of the samples. Nuclease free water 10 Complete PCR buffer SYBR 25 mM MgCl2 2.5 mM dNTPs 50 ROX 18S or hTert specific primers for rev mix 3 uM cDNA from the various samples and Super taq polymerase into a PCR tube. The reaction was heated to 95 C. for 5 minutes and then subjected to 40 cycles of 95 C. for 15 seconds 60 C. for 30 seconds 72 C. for 30 seconds. The amplification products were monitored using the ABI 7600 Applied Biosystems . BJ cells ordinarily fail to yield amplification products with the hTert primers. Those miRNA transfected samples that yielded a hTert PCR product were also analyzed for 18S rRNA lavels to ensure that there were not significantly more cells in the samples that might have contributed to the amount of hTert in the samples.

The hTert mRNA was detected in duplicate transfections of each of the miRNAs listed below. These miRNAs presumably affect pathways that regulate the expression of the hTert gene. Over expression of any of these miRNAs might contribute to cancer by activating telomerase. Regulating the activities of these miRNAs in cancer cells could limit their transformation and overcome oncogenesis.

The adult human body consists of about 50 100 trillion cells. Each day several billion of these cells divide in two to replace the billions of cells that die and are removed. In the course of an average lifetime this adds up to an astronomical number of cell divisions most of which go perfectly well. Errors do occur however and if they are not corrected they may lead to cancer. Cell growth and division are normally controlled by an intricate system of checks and balances. But occasionally a cell will start to proliferate wildly dividing again and again and defying all normal restraints on its growth. That is the beginning of most common forms of cancer.

The inventors transfected 4 000 BJ cells well in triplicate with 46 synthetic miRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 Invitrogen according to the manufacturer s instructions.

The 24 hours post transfection half of the BJ cells from each well were removed to fresh medium. 72 hrs post transfection the cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde at a final concentration of 2 . The fixed cells were stained with propidium iodide TTP LabTech protocol and assessed using the TTP LabTech cell scanner. Propidium iodide stains DNA and the relative DNA content in a cell corresponds with its position in the cell cycle. The cell scanner measured propidium iodide staining in each cell and assigned its position in the cell cycle. The percentage of cells in each stage of cell cycle was calculated and compared to cells transfected with negative control synthetic miRNAs. The relative change in cells in each stage was calculated for each miRNA that was used. Those synthetic miRNAs that induced a significant shift toward or away from a specific stage of cell cycle are listed below. These represent miRNAs that regulate key points in the cell cycle and offer key intervention points for cancer related therapeutic development.

Cell proliferation assays were used in conjunction with our synthetic miRNA library to identify miRNAs that influence cell proliferation in a broad range of cells including those from lung breast prostate skin cervix T cell and foreskin tissues.

Cervical HeLa lung A549 CRL 5826 and HTB 57 breast MCF12A and BT549 prostate 22Rv1 T cells Jurkat and primary normal and skin TE354T TE353SK and BJ cells were transfected in triplicate with each of the more than 150 synthetic miRNAs in our library. With the exceptions of Jurkats and Primary T cells each cell type was transfected with 5 picomoles of each of the miRNAs in the synthetic miRNA library using siPORT NeoFX Ambion at a plating density of approximately 8000 cells well of 96 well plate. The Jurkats and primary T cells were mixed at a rate of approximately 50 000 cells well with 500 picomoles of each of the synthetic miRNAs. The media was changed 24 hrs after transfection. 72 hours post transfection cell number was estimated by one of three methods

Approximately 10 of the miRNAs significantly reduced cell proliferation for at least four different cell types. These miRNAs presented in ranked order in the table below are provided below and can be implemented in methods and compositions of the invention.

Among the cells that were used in the synthetic miRNA library screens are matched pairs of cancer and non cancer cells from breast skin and T cell. Interestingly many synthetic miRNAs differentially affected proliferation in the cell pairs see table below .

The basis for most human diseases is the subversion of one or more cells to function in ways that are outside what they normally do. For instance cancer initiates with the immortalization and transformation of a single cell which then divides repeatedly to form a tumor. Compounds that reduce the viability of disease cells are used routinely to treat patients with cancer and other diseases.

Cervical HeLa lung A549 and T cells Jurkat and primary normal were transfected in triplicate with each of the more than 150 synthetic miRNAs in our library. With the exceptions of Jurkats and Primary T cells each cell type was transfected with 5 picomoles of each of the miRNAs in the synthetic miRNA library using siPORT NeoFX Ambion at a plating density of approximately 8000 cells well of 96 well plate. The Jurkats and primary T cells were mixed at a rate of approximately 50 000 cells well with 500 picomoles of each of the synthetic miRNAs. For the HeLa and A549 cells the media was changed 24 hrs after transfection. 72 hours post transfection cell viability was estimated by one of two methods

A comparison of the viability of jurkat and primary T cells which represent the leukemic and normal forms of T cells let 7 miR 10 miR 101 miR 17 3p miR 19 and miR 34a severely reduced the viability of the leukemia cells without adversely affecting the normal T cells.

To identify miRNAs that participate in apoptosis an apoptosis assay was used with the miRNA inhibitor library.

Approximately 8000 cervical HeLa prostate 22Rv1 T cell Jurkat and skin TE354T cells per well were transfected in triplicate with each of the more than 150 synthetic miRNAs in our library using siPORT NeoFX Ambion . Media was changed after 24 hrs and cells were visually inspected under a microscope to qualitatively inspect cell death 72 hours after transfection. The cells were measured for apoptosis by measuring caspase 3 activity as follows 1 Cells were washed once with PBS and frozen at 80 C. 2 Cells were lysed by adding 40 l of cold lysis buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.2 40 mM NaCl 0.5 NP40 0.5 mM EDTA to the wells and incubated for 20 min at 4 C. 3 Add 160 l ICE buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4 0.1 CHAPS 0.1 mM EDTA 10 sucrose 5 mM DTT containing 20 M DEVDafc substrate. 4 Measure fluorescence increase in one hour at 400 ex 505 em. Samples were also analyzed for cell number using a general esterase assay to normalize the caspase 3 results. FDA substrate 0.4 mg ml fluorescein diacetate FDA in acetonitrile was diluted 1 19 into dilution buffer 40 mM TrisCl pH 7.5 20 mM NaCl 0.5 NP 40 0.02 mg ml final conc . 40 l buffer 40 mM TrisCl pH 7.5 0.5 NP 40 was added to each sample well. Samples were incubated 10 min on ice. 160 l of diluted FDA substrate was added to each well. Fluorescence was measured for 30 min at 37 deg ex 488 em 529 . The slope of fluorescence increase over time is a function of the cell number in the plate.

The impact of each miRNA on apoptosis was assessed by dividing the caspase 3 reading of each well by the average caspase 3 reading for wells transfected with a negative control NC miRNA.

As seen in many different miRNAs were able to increase or decrease apoptosis in the four cell types that were analyzed. A few miRNAs miR 126 miR 26a miR 1 miR 149 and let 7g affected apoptosis in multiple cell types suggesting that they regulate apoptosis via genes that are common in multiple cell types.

Transformation is necessary for tumor formation as it overcomes the cell s natural response to stop dividing when placed in a crowded environment. To identify miRNAs that participate in transformation a transformation assay featuring NIH3T3 cells was used with the synthetic miRNA library. NIH 3T3 cells are used in transformation assays as they lack the capacity to form colonies when plated in soft agar. Modulation of cell processes that inhibit transformation can be readily detected because they induce NIH3T3 cells to begin forming colonies when plated in soft agar.

Approximately 8000 NIH 3T3 cells were transfected in duplicate with each of the more than 150 synthetic miRNAs in our library using siPORT NeoFX Ambion . Media was changed after 24 hrs and the cells were transferred to 24 well dishes containing soft agar. The soft agar limits mobility and ensures that sister cells must remain in contact following cell division. Close contact with other cells typically induces the NIH 3T3 cells to stop dividing. The total number of cells in each well was measured by taking an absorbance reading at 495 nm. The absorbance reading for each well was divided by the average absorbance reading for cells transfected with negative control miRNAs and multiplied by 100 to get the percent change in transformation. An initial screen revealed miR 10 miR 23 miR 24 miR 198 miR 192 and miR 199 as miRNAs that increased transformation relative to cells transfected with negative control. A repeat of the experiment with the initial candidates yielded the following hit as shown below 

Many compounds have been tested in clinical trials for their capacity to positively affect the outcome of patients. In some cases these compounds meet the standards set for by the FDA and they become therapeutics. Unfortunately very few therapeutics are 100 effective. Enhancing the activities of therapeutic compounds provides a significant opportunity within the medical industry. The two most common methods that are used to enhance therapeutics are modifying the chemical structure of the compounds or using multiple therapeutic compounds simultaneously. Whether it would be beneficial to introduce miRNAs in advance of adding compounds that are known to significantly reduce the viability of cancer cells was evaluated. One of the anti cancer compounds that was introduced was TRAIL a compound that binds at least two different receptors and activates the apoptosis pathway to induce cell death primarily in cancer cells. The second compound that was tested in combination with synthetic miRNAs was etoposide a topoisomerase II inhibitor that activates the apoptosis pathway of cancer and normal cells alike by reducing the repair of DNA damage within the cells.

Approximately 8000 cervical HeLa and lung A549 HTB 57 and CRL 5826 cells per well were transfected in triplicate with synthetic miRNAs from our library using siPORT NeoFX Ambion . Media was changed after 24 hrs and etoposide and TRAIL were introduced at a final concentration of approximately 25 M after 48 hours. The cells were visually inspected under a microscope to qualitatively inspect cell death 64 hours after transfection.

The cells treated with etoposide were measured for apoptosis by measuring caspase 3 activity as follows 1 Cells were washed once with PBS and frozen at 80 C. 2 Cells were lysed by adding 40 l of cold lysis buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.2 40 mM NaCl 0.5 NP40 0.5 mM EDTA to the wells and incubated for 20 min at 4 C. 3 Add 160 l ICE buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4 0.1 CHAPS 0.1 mM EDTA 10 sucrose 5 mM DTT containing 20 M DEVDafc substrate. 4 Measure fluorescence increase in one hour at 400 ex 505 em. Samples were also analyzed for cell number using a general esterase assay to normalize the caspase 3 results. FDA substrate 0.4 mg ml fluorescein diacetate FDA in acetonitrile was diluted 1 19 into dilution buffer 40 mM TrisCl pH 7.5 20 mM NaCl 0.5 NP 40 0.02 mg ml final conc . 40 l buffer 40 mM TrisCl pH 7.5 0.5 NP 40 was added to each sample well. Samples were incubated 10 min on ice. 160 l of diluted FDA substrate was added to each well. Fluorescence was measured for 30 min at 37 deg ex 488 em 529 . The slope of fluorescence increase over time is a function of the cell number in the plate.

The cells treated with TRAIL were assessed for cell viability by adding alamar blue each well and analyzing fluorescence using a plate reader. Alamar blue is a substrate for a metabolic enzyme in cells and the reaction product is fluorescent. The fluorescence in each well correlates with the total number of cells in each well.

The effect of each miRNA on the treatments was measured by dividing the caspase 3 or alamar blue reading of the cells transfected with miRNAs and treated with TRAIL or etoposide by the same readings for cells that were only transfected with the miRNAs. The change in caspase 3 activity or alamar blue staining for each miRNA was then divided by the differences observed for two negative control miRNAs and multiplied by 100 to calculate the relative effect induced by the combination of each miRNA and the therapeutic compound. These values are listed as NC in Figure G.

As shown in a number of miRNAs significantly increased the capacity of the two therapeutic compounds to induce cell death in the cancer cells that were treated. Interestingly mir 292 3p mir 132 mir 124 and mir 28 all worked extremely well in combination with both TRAIL and etoposide.

The adult human body consists of about 50 100 trillion cells. Each day several billion of these cells divide in two to replace the billions of cells that die and are removed. In the course of an average lifetime this adds up to an astronomical number of cell divisions most of which go perfectly well. Errors do occur however and if they are not corrected they may lead to cancer. Cell growth and division are normally controlled by an intricate system of checks and balances. But occasionally a cell will start to proliferate wildly dividing again and again and defying all normal restraints on its growth. That is the beginning of most common forms of cancer.

Approximately 8000 cervical HeLa and 4000 skin BJ cells per well were transfected in triplicate with each of the more than 150 synthetic miRNAs in our library. HeLa cells were transfected using siPORT NeoFX Ambion and BJ cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 Invitrogen according to the manufacturer s instructions. 24 hours post transfection half of the cells from each well were removed to fresh medium. 72 hrs post transfection the cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde at a final concentration of 2 . The fixed cells were stained with propidium iodide TTP LabTech protocol and assessed using the TTP LabTech cell scanner. Propidium iodide stains DNA and the relative DNA content in a cell corresponds with its position in the cell cycle. The cell scanner measured propidium iodide staining in each cell and assigned its position in the cell cycle. The percentage of cells in each stage of cell cycle was calculated and compared to cells transfected with negative control synthetic miRNAs. The relative change in cells in each stage was calculated for each miRNA that was used. Those synthetic miRNAs that induced a significant shift toward or away from a specific stage of cell cycle are listed below. These represent miRNAs that regulate key points in the cell cycle and offer key intervention points for cancer related therapeutic development.

As seen in many different miRNAs significantly altered the percentage of cells in the various stages of cell cycle in the two cell types that were analyzed.

In order for cancer cells to proliferate they must subvert both the machinery that controls the cell division cycle and the process of programmed cell death apoptosis . This is frequently achieved by mutation of specific proto oncogenes such as Ras or tumor suppressors such as p53. The Ras family of membrane associated GTPases transmit signals into the interior of the cell by the activation of a number of cytosolic signal transduction pathways such as the Raf MEK ERK MAP kinase signaling pathway. Disregulation of the Ras Raf MEK ERK pathway plays a major role in cancer pathogenesis reviewed in Meijer et al. .

To identify miRNAs that affect ERK activation HeLa cells were transfected in a 96 well plate format with 160 different synthetic miRNAs. Prior to transfection the HeLa cells were trypsinized to remove adherent cells and diluted in normal growth medium to 10cells mL. 0.5 of siPort NeoFX in 9.5 l of Optimem I medium was added to the cells and incubated for 10 minutes at room temp 10 L for each sample . miRNAs were rehydrated with 10 l of diluted siPORT NeoFX. The samples were incubated at 37 C. and then the transfected samples were evaluated 72 hours after transfection.

The controls for ERK activation were performed by depriving the wells of a phosphate source for detection of ERK phosphorylation. 100 l of serum free media DMEM to 37 C. was added per well and the cells were incubated for 4 hours at 37 C. to attain basal phosphorylation levels. For the positive control wells serum free media was aspirated from wells and 100 L of 100 ng mL EGF was added before incubating the cells for 7.5 minutes at 37 C.

Media from all wells was removed by aspiration and the cells were immediately fixed in 150 L of 3.7 Formaldehyde in 1 PBS for 20 minutes at room temp with no shaking. Fixing solution was removed to an appropriate waste container. The fixed cells were washed three times with 1 PBS. The wells were then washed three times with 200 L of 1 PBS containing 0.1 Triton X 100 for 5 minutes per wash with shaking at room temp.

Cells were blocked by adding 150 L of Li COR Odyssey Blocking Buffer to each well. The solution was moved carefully by pipetting down the sides of the wells to avoid detaching the cells. Blocking was for 90 minutes at room temp with moderate shaking on a rotator and the two primary antibodies were added to a tube containing Odyssey Blocking Buffer. The primary antibody was incubated for 2 hours with gentle shaking at room temp Phosho ERK Rabbit 1 100 dilution Cell Signaling Technology 9101 . Total ERK2 Mouse 1 75 dilution Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC 1647 . The wells were washed three times with 1 PBS 0.1 Tween 20 for 5 minutes at room temp with gentle shaking using a generous amount of buffer. The fluorescently labeled secondary antibody was diluted in Odyssey Blocking Buffer Goat anti rabbit Alexa Fluor 680 1 200 dilution Molecular Probes Goat anti mouse IRDye 800CW 1 800 diution Rockland Immunochemicals . The antibody solutions were mixed well and 50 L of the secondary antibody solution was added to each well. The antibody solution was incubated for 60 minutes with gentle shaking at room temp. The plate was washed three times with 1 PBS 0.1 Tween 20 for 5 minutes at room temp with gentle shaking using a generous amount of buffer. After a final wash wash solution was completely removed from wells. The plates were scanned with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System 700 nm detection for Alexa Fluor 680 antibody and 800 nm detection for IRDye 800CW antibody .

Telomerase is a complex of proteins and RNA that maintains the ends of chromosomes by appending telomeres. With rare exceptions terminally differentiated cells lack active telomerase. One of the exceptions is cancer cells. More than 90 of human cancer samples have active telomerase reviewed in Dong et al. 2005 . The hTert gene encodes the catalytic domain of telomerase. The expression of hTert correlates with telomerase activity in cells making it a good surrogate for telomerase activity. We have developed and used an RT PCR based assay for monitoring hTert mRNA expression in telomerase negative cells to identify miRNAs that participate in the regulation of telomerase. The miRNAs that regulate telomerase activity represent intervention points for cancer therapeutics.

BJ cells are normal foreskin fibroblasts that lack hTert mRNA and telomerase activity. BJ cells were trypsinized and diluted to 13 000 cells ml in normal growth media. 0.3 l of lipofectamine 2000 agent was diluted into 40 l of OPTI MEM and incubated for five minutes. The diluted transfection reagent was added to the wells of 96 well plates that contained 151 synthetic miRNAs as well as two different negative control synthetic miRNAs. Each well housed a different synthetic miRNA. The synthetic miRNAs and transfection agent were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature and then 200 l 2 600 cells were added on top of the lipid miRNA complex. Cells were placed in an incubator and RNA was isolated 72 hours later. RNA was isolated from the cells in each well using RNAqueous MagMAX96 Total RNA Isolation kit Cat 1830 standard protocol lyse cells in wells . Reverse transcription was done using the RETROscript reaction by adding 11 ul of total RNA 20 100 ng l to 1 l of random decamers and incubated in 70 C. water bath for 3 minutes then place on ice. Next 8 of the cocktail containing Nuc free water 3.8 l 10 Reverse Transcription buffer 2.0 l 2.5 mM dNTPs 2.0 l RNase Inhibitor Protein 40 U l 0.1 l MMLV RT 100 U l and incubated at 42 C. for 1 hour then 92 C. for 10 minutes.

Real time PCR reactions were assembled to quantify hTert mRNA and 18S rRNA in each of the samples. Nuclease free water 10 Complete PCR buffer SYBR 25 mM MgCl2 2.5 mM dNTPs 50 ROX 18S or hTert specific primers for rev mix 3 M cDNA from the various samples and Super taq polymerase were placed into a PCR tube. The reaction was heated to 95 C. for 5 minutes and then subjected to 40 cycles of 95 C. for 15 seconds 60 C. for 30 seconds 72 C. for 30 seconds. The amplification products were monitored using the ABI 7600 Applied Biosystems . BJ cells ordinarily fail to yield amplification products with the hTert primers. Those miRNA transfected samples that yielded a hTert PCR product were also analyzed for 18S rRNA lavels to ensure that there were not significantly more cells in the samples that might have contributed to the amount of hTert in the samples.

The hTert mRNA was detected in duplicate transfections of each of the miRNAs listed below. These miRNAs presumably affect pathways that regulate the expression of the hTert gene. Over expression of any of these miRNAs might contribute to cancer by activating telomerase. Regulating the activities of these miRNAs in cancer cells could limit their transformation and overcome oncogenesis.

The telomerase activity screen was repeated using a series of siRNAs targeting kinases phosphatases GPCRs transcription factors and assorted other genes. Targeting the genes below with siRNAs resulted in increased hTert expression. Interestingly many of these genes are predicted to be targets for the miRNAs that we found to be hTert regulators see table below .

Many miRNAs appear to be very closely related to others based on their primary sequences. For instance let 7a is a member of the let 7 gene family which includes 7 unique genes within the human genome. The let 7 genes encode miRNAs that vary by as little as a single nucleotide and as many as four nucleotides. In our synthetic miRNA and miRNA inhibitor libraries we have five different human let 7 miRNAs. These miRNAs have been used in many different cell types in screens designed to identify miRNAs involved in a variety of different cellular processes. In many of the screens the various let 7 miRNAs generate similar phenotypes. In some screens all of the let 7 family members yield similar responses. In contrast there are some screens wherein the various let 7 family miRNAs yield significantly different results .

Inflammation is the body s natural protective response to an injury or infection. It is designed to hyper stimulate biological pathways that initiate tissue repair or attack invading pathogens. This response is a delicate balance of both pro and anti inflammatory genes and their proteins. If the inflammatory response is maintained too long it can lead to tissue destruction organ failure or inflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid arthritis Psoriasis Asthma Inflammatory bowel disease Crohn s disease and related conditions Multiple Sclerosis coronary obstructive pulmonary disease COPD Allergic rhinitis hay fever and Cardiovascular disease.

Stat3 is the subject of intense scientific investigation because it s known to be an important transcription factor that turns on genes required for the cell division induction and suppression of apoptosis and cell motility. Many STAT3 target genes are known including those encoding the anti apoptotic proteins Bcl xl Mcl 1 and Bcl 2 the proliferation associated proteins Cyclin D1 and Myc and the pro angiogenic factor VEGF. The inflammatory disease psoriasis is characterized by lesions which contain epidermal keratinocytes that express high levels of activated Stat3. Stat3 has also recently been discovered to play an important role as an anti inflammatory regulator. In normal mice the immune system is initially upregulated in response to bacterial protein challenge creating systemic inflammation followed by down regulation of the initiating factors. Mice with a deletional mutation for Stat3 beta lacked the ability to down regulate the initial inflammatory reaction after bacterial protein challenge which lead to irreversible damage to the animals own tissues and finally to animal death.

A stat3 response assay was used to identify miRNAs that regulate cellular inflammatory response. The stable Stat3 luciferase reporter cell line from Panomics which contains a chromosomal integration of a luciferase reporter construct regulated by 3 copies of the Stat1 response element was used for this purpose. The chemical agent Phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate PMA is known to induce an inflammatory response in exposed cells and was used to stimulate inflammation in this experiment. These cells were transfected in triplicate with each of the more than 206 synthetic miRNAs in our library using siPORT NeoFX Ambion at a plating density of approximately 6000 cells well of 96 well plate. The media was changed 24 h post transfection and exposed to 100 nM PMA for 6 hours starting at 67 hours post transfection. The cells were assayed for changes in total cell number by alamarBlue as previously described and finally harvested at 72 hours post initial transfection. A luciferase assay was performed on all sample lysates to measure Stat3 responsiveness to the procedure. The data was normalized to total cell number using the alamar Blue data and compared to cells transfected with a negative control miRNA that underwent the same procedure.
