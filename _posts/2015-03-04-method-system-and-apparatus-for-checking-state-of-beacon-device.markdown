Moreover although features may be described as operating in a certain combination and the certain combination may be claimed as such one or more features of the claimed combination may be excluded from the combination in some cases and the claimed combination may be changed to sub combinations or variations of sub combinations.

In the same manner while operations have been described in a particular order in the drawings this should not be construed as requiring that the operations should be performed in the described particular order or in a sequential order or all the described operations should be performed in order to achieve desirable results. In some cases multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous. Furthermore the separation of various system components in the embodiments described above should not be construed as requiring such separation in all embodiments and it should be understood that the described program components and systems may be generally integrated together in single software products or packaged into multi software products.

The present disclosure relates generally to a method system and apparatus for checking the state of a beacon device. More particularly in accordance with the present disclosure information about a beacon state of the beacon device can be remotely and automatically checked. Accordingly in order to determinate whether the beacon device normally operates whether the beacon device normally operates can be checked in real time by automatically and remotely checking information about a beacon state thereby reducing the cost and time required for maintenance and management. Furthermore the location of a terminal is measured using a low power BLE beacon signal so that resources consumed in measuring the location of the terminal can be reduced for the sake of the terminal while a logic required to extract information applied to service can be simplified for the sake of the service device. Since this present disclosure has sufficient commercial potential or sales potential and can be realistically and explicitly implemented the present disclosure has industrial availability.

Although the specific embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications additions and substitutions are possible without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.
