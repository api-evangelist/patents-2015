title: Small vehicle encapsulation for torpedo tube vehicle launch
abstract: A containment canister is provided for loading a vehicle. In the canister, the vehicle is restrained by a nose cap and a ring which conforms to an aft section of the vehicle. Longitudinal leads support the vehicle and provide glide surfaces during a launch. A casing with flow ports is affixed to an aft end of the containment canister with the casing encompassing an actuator with an extendable arm and an attached plug. The plug is sized to move in alignment with each canister toward a sealing ring. When the arm is extended; the plug seats against the ring. To eject the vehicle, a signal is sent an actuator to retract the plug aft of the flow ports. As the canister is flooded by a water impulse thru the flow ports; the impulse contacts the aft end of the vehicle to expel the vehicle.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62 080 604 filed on Nov. 17 2014 entitled Small Vehicle Encapsulation SVE Capsule for Torpedo Tube Vehicle Launch by the inventors Angelo DiBiasio Christian Archeval Rivera and Christopher Harding.

The present invention relates to a payload system and specifically to a system for deployment of small diameter payloads using existing submarine torpedo tubes and other similarly shaped tubes.

There is an increasing need to deploy small diameter payloads weapons or vehicles from submarine torpedo tubes. This type of deployment would enhance submarine capability for the Navy.

There is a known encapsulated payload and launcher assembly that could be loaded into a torpedo tube and could use ship services. A capsule of the assembly is self equipped to catapult launch a vehicle. However the capsule does not use either an impulse or swim out launch. Also the assembly can accommodate only one vehicle at a time.

It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a capsule and device capable of deploying multiple small diameter payloads such as weapons vehicles or other devices.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a capsule and device which can be launched from existing torpedo tubes.

It order to attain the objects described above the present invention provides a capsule and supporting device which uses a water impulse.

In the present invention a vehicle loaded into a containment canister in which the vehicle is restrained by a nose cap longitudinal leads and a ring which conforms to an aft section of the vehicle. The longitudinal leads separate the vehicle from an interior of the containment canister and assist in the launch of the vehicle. An actuator casing is affixed to an aft end of the containment canister.

The actuator casing encompasses a linear actuator with an extendable arm and plug. The plug is sized to move in alignment with each canister toward a sealing ring. When the actuator is in the extended position the plug seats against the sealing ring in order to seal the containment canister.

Four containment canisters can be loaded into a module frame thru a canister forward alignment plate with the containers seated secured on a canister foot plate. The module frame assists in positioning the containment canisters. A hollow center spine in the module allows the use of cabling communication links etc.

In operation a signal is sent to one of the actuators to retract the plug to be aft of the flow ports. As the containment canister is flooded by a water impulse thru the flow ports the impulse provides sufficient energy to expel the vehicle out of the containment canister and or the small vehicle encapsulation capsule.

The present invention provides the benefits of modularity which include ease of design manufacturing and maintenance as well as the ease in loading and unloading vehicle and other items to be deployed.

The present invention depicted in allows a vehicle to be loaded into a containment canister . The vehicle is restrained by a nose cap at least three longitudinal leads and a retainer ring which conforms to an aft section of the vehicle. The longitudinal leads separate the vehicle from an interior of the containment canister as well as providing glide surfaces when the vehicle is launched from the canister. An actuator casing is mechanically attached or affixed to an aft open end of the containment canister .

The actuator casing encompasses a linear actuator with an extendable arm . A plurality of flow ports are positioned in a periphery of the actuator casing . A plug is affixed to an end of the actuator arm . The plug acting as valve is sized to move in alignment with each containment canister toward an individual sealing ring . When the actuator is in the extended position as shown in the figure the plug seats against the sealing ring . The default configuration of each containment canister maintains the plug in this closed position in order to seal the containment canister.

As shown in and the end view of four containment canisters can be loaded into a module frame as a bundle. The loading of the canisters is thru a canister forward alignment plate with the containers seated secured on a canister foot plate .

The detail view of depicts an unloaded module frame . Gussets at the alignment plate and the foot plate strengthen the structural integrity of the module frame as well as assisting in the positioning of the containment canisters . A hollow center spine allows the use of cabling communication links etc however the spine would be plugged or would use stuffing boxes for the penetrating cables. The module frame is normally made from strengthened steel however other suitable materials known to those skilled in the art may be used.

In a small vehicle encapsulation SVE capsule of the present invention provides positioning of the containment canisters on the module frame . The SVE capsule includes circumferential flow slots around a periphery of the capsule.

In operation a signal is sent to one of the actuators to retract the plug aft of the flow ports . As the containment canister is flooded by a water impulse thru the flow ports the impulse contacts the aft end of the vehicle . The water impulse provides sufficient energy to launch the vehicle out of the containment canister and the SVE capsule .

The impulse launch is actuated by an air turbine pump not shown that generates water flow into the SVE capsule and thru the flow ports . The ports are sized to control the impulse. Air turbine pump launch systems can produce relatively high pressures and flow rates thru a launching system. Launch from the SVE capsule would be similar to that of a torpedo tube in that an equalizing valve floods the capsule tube thus equalizing pressure with a sea environment. A muzzle door is opened in preparation for payload launch. The SVE capsule can be an existing military suitable capsule capable of encapsulating the containment canister the module frame and the actuator casing .

The present invention provides the benefits of modularity which include ease of design manufacturing and maintenance as well as the ease of loading and unloading vehicle and other items to be deployed.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.

The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive nor to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. Such modifications and variations that may be apparent to a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the accompanying claims.
