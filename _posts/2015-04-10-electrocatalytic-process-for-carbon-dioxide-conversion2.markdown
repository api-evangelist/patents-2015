This invention was made at least in part with U.S. government support under U.S. Department of Energy Grant DE SC0004453. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The field of the invention is catalysis and catalysts. The catalysts of this invention are applicable for example to the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into useful products.

There is a present need to decrease carbon dioxide CO emissions from industrial facilities. Over the years a number of electrochemical processes have been suggested for the conversion of COinto useful products. Processes for COconversion and the catalysts for them are discussed in U.S. Pat.

Generally an electrochemical cell contains an anode a cathode and an electrolyte as indicated in . Catalysts are placed on the anode and or cathode and or in the electrolyte to promote desired chemical reactions. During operation reactants or a solution containing reactants is fed into the cell. Then a voltage is applied between the anode and the cathode to promote an electrochemical reaction.

When an electrochemical cell is used as a COconversion system a reactant comprising CO carbonate or bicarbonate is fed into the cell. A voltage is applied to the cell and the COreacts to form new chemical compounds. Examples of cathode reactions in the Hori Review include CO 2 2H CO HO 2CO 2 CO CO CO HO 2 CO 2OH CO 2HO 4 HCO 3OH CO 2HO 2 HCO 2OH CO HO 2 HCO OH CO 2HO 2 HCO 2OH CO 5HO 6 CHOH 6OH CO 6HO 8 CH 8OH 2CO 8HO 12 CH 12OH 2CO 9HO 12 CHCHOH 12OH 2CO 6HO 8 CHCOOH 8OH 2CO 5HO 8 CHCOO 7OH 2CO 10HO 14 CH 14OH CO 2H 2 CO HO acetic acid oxalic acid oxylate CO 4H 4 CH O where e is an electron. The examples given above are merely illustrative and are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all possible cathode reactions.

Examples of reactions on the anode mentioned in the Hori Review include 2O O 4 2CO O 2CO 4 4OH O 2HO 4 2HO O 4H 4

The examples given above are merely illustrative and are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all possible anode reactions.

In the previous literature catalysts comprising one or more of V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Sn Zr Nb Mo Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd Hf Ta W Re Ir Pt Au Hg Al Si In Sn Tl Pb Bi Sb Te U Sm Tb La Ce and Nd have all shown activity for COconversion. Reviews include Hori Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry 42 89 189 2008 the Hori Review Gattrell et al. Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry 594 1 19 2006 the Gattrell review DuBois Encyclopedia of Electrochemistry 7a 202 225 2006 the DuBois review and the papers Li et al.

The results in the Hori Review show that the conversion of COis only mildly affected by solvent unless the solvent also acts as a reactant. Water can act like a reactant so reactions in water are different than reactions in non aqueous solutions. But the reactions are the same in most non aqueous solvents and importantly the overpotentials are almost the same in water and in the non aqueous solvents.

The catalysts have been in the form of either bulk materials supported particles collections of particles small metal ions or organometallics. Still according to Bell A. Bell. Ed Basic Research Needs Catalysis For Energy US Department Of Energy Report PNNL17712 2008 the Bell Report The major obstacle preventing efficient conversion of carbon dioxide into energy bearing products is the lack of catalyst with sufficient activity at low overpotentials and high electron conversion efficiencies.

The overpotential is associated with lost energy of the process and so the overpotential should be as low as possible. Yet according to The Bell Report Electron conversion efficiencies of greater than 50 percent can be obtained but at the expense of very high overpotentials . This limitation needs to be overcome before practical processes can be obtained.

A second disadvantage of many of the catalysts is that they also have low electron conversion efficiency. Catalyst systems are considered practical where electron conversion is over 50 .

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 830 338 published as US 2011 0237830 and Ser. No. 13 174 365 published as US 2012 0308903 and in International Application No. PCT US2011 030098 published as WO 2011 120021 and PCT US2011 0042809 published as WO 2012 006240 disclose that a catalyst mixture containing an active metal and a Helper Catalyst could catalyze COconversions with low overpotential and high electron conversion efficiency. However the catalysts disclosed in these patent applications showed a lower activity than was desired.

The examples above consider applications for COconversion but the present electrocatalysts overcome limitations of other systems. For example some commercial COsensors use an electrochemical reaction to detect the presence of CO. At present these sensors require over 1 5 watts of power which is too high for portable sensing applications.

The invention provides a novel catalyst mixture that can overcome one or more of the limitations of low rates high overpotentials and low electron conversion efficiencies namely selectivities low rates for catalytic reactions and high power for sensors. The catalyst mixture includes at least one Catalytically Active Element in the form of supported or unsupported particles wherein the particles have an average particle size as defined below between about 0.6 nm and 100 nm preferably between 0.6 nm and 40 nm and most preferable between 0.6 nm and 10 nm.

The invention is not limited to catalysts for COconversion. In particular catalysts that include Catalytically Active Elements and Helper Catalysts might enhance the rate of a wide variety of chemical reactions. Reaction types include homogeneously catalyzed reactions heterogeneously catalyzed reactions chemical reactions in chemical plants chemical reactions in power plants chemical reactions in pollution control equipment and devices chemical reactions in fuel cells and chemical reactions in sensors. The invention includes all of these examples. The invention also includes processes using these catalysts.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 830 338 published as US 2011 0237830 and Ser. No. 13 174 365 not yet published and in International Application No. PCT US2011 030098 published as WO 2011 120021 and PCT US2011 042809 published as WO 2012 006240 disclose that a catalyst mixture containing a Catalytically Active Metal and a Helper Catalyst could catalyze COconversions with low overpotential and high electron conversion efficiency. Active Metals included one or more of V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Sn Zr Nb Mo Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd Hf Ta W Re Ir Pt Au Hg Al Si In Sn Tl Pb Bi Sb Te U Sm Tb La Ce and Nd. Examples of Helper Catalysts included one or more of phosphines imidazoliums pyridiniums pyrrolidiniums phosphoniums sulfoniums prolinates methioninates cholines acetylcholines alanines aminoacetonitriles methylammoniums arginines aspartic acids threonines chloroformamidiniums thiouroniums quinoliniums pyrrolidinols serinols benzamidines sulfamates acetates carbamates triflates and cyanides.

Of course the 338 U.S. application the 365 U.S. application the 098 international application and the 809 international application disclose that not every substance listed above will act as a Helper Catalyst. In general one can determine whether a given substance S is a Helper Catalyst for a reaction R catalyzed by an active metal M as follows 

Further the Helper Catalyst could be in any one of the following forms i a solvent for the reaction ii an electrolyte iii an additive to any component of the system or iv something that is bound to at least one of the catalysts in a system. These examples are meant for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to limit the scope of the invention.

The catalyst disclosed in 338 U.S. application the 365 U.S. application the 098 international application and the 809 international application allowed COto be converted to useful products at low overpotentials and high electron conversion efficiencies. In particular an EMIM silver catalyst with 100 nm silver particles allowed COto be converted with an electron conversion efficiency as high as 99 and an overpotential as small as 0.17 V. Unfortunately the silver EMIM catalysts disclosed in the 338 U.S. application the 365 U.S. application the 098 international application and the 809 international application had a lower catalytic activity than was desired.

In the foregoing applications new catalyst formulations are disclosed that maintain the ability to convert COwith a high electron conversion efficiency and low overpotential but also shows an improved specific catalytic activity. The catalyst was prepared by modifying the structure of the silver so it is more active. The catalyst can be in the form of supported or unsupported metal particles wherein the average particle size is below about 100 nm preferably between 0.6 nm and 40 nm more preferably between 0.6 nm and 20 nm and most preferably between 0.6 nm and 10 nm.

In this context the particle sizes can be determined by one or more of microscopy x ray line broadening chemisorption or small x ray scattering. For example one might measure the x ray diffraction pattern of the catalysts determine the width of the diffraction line at some angle and then calculate the particle size D from the Scherrer equation 

Chemisorption can alternately be used to measure the Sg the surface area of the active element per unit mass and then calculate the particle size from the formula

The invention specifically includes any catalyst with a particle size between 0.6 nm and 100 nm measured by any of x ray line broadening chemisorption or small x ray scattering.

This example illustrates the effect of silver particle size on the rate of COconversion on an EMIM BF4 Sigma Aldrich St Louis Mo. coated silver catalyst.

During the experiments a silver ink was deposited onto a silver rotating disk electrode Pine Instruments Grove City Pa. . In the first experiment the silver electrode was polished and a CV was run as described in paragraph 0099 0102 below. Subsequent experiments were run by depositing one of i 200 nm silver Sigma Aldrich St Louis Mo. ii 100 nm silver Sigma Aldrich St Louis Mo. iii 20 40 nm silver Sigma Aldrich St Louis Mo. vi 5 nm UT Dots Champaign Ill. v 0.67 nm Purest Colloids Westampton N.J. onto the silver electrode and running the CV as in the fourth paragraph below.

In the case of 500 1000 nm 100 nm 20 40 nm silver a silver ink is prepared by mixing 5.6 mg of silver particles with 1 ml deoxygenated Millipore water. The catalyst is applied on the surface of the rotating electrode by adding 60 L of the ink to the surface and allowing the water to evaporate under ambient temperature for 60 minutes. In order to ensure the quality of the measurements special attention is paid to the material cleaning and solution purity.

The 10 nm arrived suspended in an organic solution and so this solution was applied to the silver electrode and subsequently heated in air at 85 C. for 3 hours to remove any residual organics

The counter electrode is made by attaching a 25 25 mm platinum mesh size 52 to a 5 inch platinum wire 99.9 0.004 inch diameter . A silver quasi reference electrode was used. The electrolytes were first loaded into the glass cell and then purged with dry argon 99.99 for two hours in order to remove oxygen from the electrolytes. Prior to each experiment a 20 40 linear sweep cyclic voltammogram at 75 mVsis taken with the range between 2 V and 0 vs. Ag QRE in order to condition the electrodes and remove oxides from the surfaces. Then several cycles were performed at 10 mVsbefore taking the final cycle to insure that the CV had stabilized that is any dirt or other material is removed from the surfaces . Finally cleaning and stabilizing CV cycles were performed at 10 mVs. Then COwas bubbled in the solution at 1 atm pressure for 20 minutes. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted again at a sweep rate of 10 mV s in the range from 2 V to 0 V vs. Ag QRE.

The result above shows that unsupported silver catalysts have an optimal size between 0.6 and 100 nm. Those trained in the art know that if a reaction is structure sensitive on an unsupported catalyst or single crystal it will also show structure sensitivity on a supported catalyst. Further the Korper Paper suggests that if a reaction is structure sensitive on one transition metal it will also be structure sensitive on most other transition metals. In particular the optimum particle size is very similar on most transition metals. Therefore we conclude that V Cr Mn Fe Co Ni Cu Zr Nb Mo Ru Rh Pd Ag Cd W Re Ir Pt Au Hg Pb Bi electrocatalysts for COconversion should have an optimal size between 0.6 and 100 nm.

The examples given above are merely illustrative and are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all possible embodiments applications or modifications of the invention. Thus various modifications and variations of the described methods and systems of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Although the invention has been described in connection with specific embodiments it should be understood that the invention as claimed should not be unduly limited to such specific embodiments. Indeed various modifications of the described modes for carrying out the invention which are obvious to those skilled in the chemical arts or in the relevant fields are intended to be within the scope of the appended claims.
