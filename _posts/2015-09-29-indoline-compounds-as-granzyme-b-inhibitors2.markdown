The present invention disclosure relates generally to agents for treating diseases disorders and conditions treatable by inhibiting Granzyme B and more specifically to substituted indoline compounds that are inhibitors of Granyzme B.

Granzyme B is a pro apoptotic serine protease found in the granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes CTL and natural killer NK cells. Granzyme B is released towards target cells along with the pore forming protein perforin resulting in its perforin dependent internalization into the cytoplasm and subsequent induction of apoptosis see for e.g. Medema et al. 27 3492 3498 1997 . However during aging inflammation and chronic disease Granzyme B can also be expressed and secreted by other types of immune e.g. mast cell macrophage neutrophil and dendritic cells or non immune keratinocyte chondrocyte cells and has been shown to possess extracellular matrix remodeling activity Choy et al. 24 12 2245 2250 2004 and Buzza et al. 280 23549 23558 2005 .

Inhibitors of Granzyme B in humans have been limited to a relatively weak nonspecific inhibitors such as isocoumarins Odake et al. 1991 30 8 2217 2227 b biological inhibitors such as serpinB9 Sun et al. 1996 271 44 27802 27809 c covalently coupled inhibitors such as aldehydes Willoughby et al. 2002 12 16 2197 halomethyl ketones Kam et al. 2000 1477 1 2 307 323 and phosphonates Mahrus and Craik 2005 . 12 567 77 and Kam et al. 2000 and d tricyclic inhibitors Willoughby et al. 2002 .

Nonspecific inhibitors such as isocoumarins are not sufficiently potent or specific to be effective treatments for Granzyme B related diseases disorders and conditions. Likewise the use of biological inhibitors such as serpins is limited by the ability to deliver the inhibitor to the target mammal the cost of manufacturing the biological agents and other off target activities such as inhibition of other serine proteases such as human neutrophil elastase Dahlen et al. 1999 1451 2 3 233 41 Caspase 1 Annaud et al. 1999 15 342 Pt3 655 65 Krieg et al. 2001 15 11 1971 82 and Young et al. 2000 191 9 1535 1544 Caspase 4 and Caspase 8 Annaud et al. 1999 .

The tricyclic inhibitors Willoughby et al. 2001 also suffer from synthetic complexity high manufacturing cost due to the complex core and accompanying low water solubility.

Despite the advances in development of Granzyme B inhibitors there exists a need for compounds that inhibit Granzyme B with selectivity that are relatively simple to manufacture at low cost that are highly water soluble and that do not present drug delivery challenges. The present invention seeks to fulfill this need and provides further related advantages.

An example would be an implant made of a polymeric material adapted to release the compound over a period of time.

One skilled in the art will appreciate that suitable methods of administering a Granzyme B inhibitor directly to the eye are available i.e. invasive and noninvasive methods . Although more than one route can be used to administer the Granzyme B inhibitor a particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route. The present use is not dependent on the mode of administering the agent to an animal preferably a human to achieve the desired effect and the described routes of administration are exemplary. As such any route of administration is appropriate so long as the agent contacts an ocular cell. Thus the Granzyme B inhibitor can be appropriately formulated and administered in the form of an injection eye lotion ointment and implant.

The Granzyme B inhibitor can be applied for example systemically topically intracamerally subconjunctivally intraocularly retrobulbarly periocularly e.g. subtenon delivery subretinally or suprachoroidally. In certain cases it can be appropriate to administer multiple applications and employ multiple routes to ensure sufficient exposure of ocular cells to the Granzyme B inhibitor e.g. subretinal and intravitreous . Multiple applications of the Granzyme B inhibitor can also be required to achieve the desired effect.

Depending on the particular case it may be desirable to non invasively administer the Granzyme B inhibitor to a patient. For instance if multiple surgeries have been performed the patient displays low tolerance to anesthetic or if other ocular related disorders exist topical administration of the Granzyme B inhibitor may be most appropriate. Topical formulations are well known to those of skill in the art. Such formulations are suitable in the context of the use described herein for application to the skin or to the surface of the eye. The use of patches corneal shields see U.S. Pat. No. 5 185 152 and ophthalmic solutions see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 710 182 and ointments is within the skill in the art.

The Granzyme B inhibitor also can be present in or on a device that allows controlled or sustained release such as an ocular sponge meshwork mechanical reservoir or mechanical implant. Implants see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 443 505 4 853 224 and 4 997 652 devices see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 554 187 4 863 457 5 098 443 and 5 725 493 such as an implantable device e.g. a mechanical reservoir an intraocular device or an extraocular device with an intraocular conduit or an implant or a device comprised of a polymeric composition are particularly useful for ocular administration of the expression vector . The Granzyme B inhibitor also can be administered in the form of sustained release formulations see U.S. Pat. No. 5 378 475 comprising for example gelatin chondroitin sulfate a polyphosphoester such as bis 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalate or a polylactic glycolic acid.

When used for treating an ocular disease the Granzyme B inhibitor is administered via an ophthalmologic instrument for delivery to a specific region of an eye. Use of a specialized ophthalmologic instrument ensures precise administration while minimizing damage to adjacent ocular tissue. Delivery of the Granzyme B inhibitor to a specific region of the eye also limits exposure of unaffected cells to the Granzyme B inhibitor. A preferred ophthalmologic instrument is a combination of forceps and subretinal needle or sharp bent cannula.

Alternatively the Granzyme B inhibitor can be administered using invasive procedures such as for instance intravitreal injection or subretinal injection optionally preceded by a vitrectomy or periocular e.g. subtenon delivery. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be injected into different compartments of the eye e.g. the vitreal cavity or anterior chamber .

While intraocular injection is preferred injectable compositions can also be administered intramuscularly intravenously intraarterially and intraperitoneally. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for injectable compositions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art see Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice J. B. Lippincott Co. Philadelphia Pa. Banker and Chalmers eds. pages 238 250 1982 and ASHP Handbook on Injectable Drugs Toissel 4th ed. pages 622 630 1986 .

An effective amount of a Granzyme B inhibitor or a pharmaceutical composition of the invention as described herein includes a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic result such as reduced levels of Granzyme B activity. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the subject and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the compound are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result such as Granzyme B activity. Typically a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease so that a prophylactically effective amount may be less than a therapeutically effective amount.

It is to be noted that dosage values can vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. For any particular subject specific dosage regimens can be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. Dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and do not limit the dosage ranges that can be selected by a medical practitioner. The amount of active compound s in the composition can vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example a single bolus can be administered several divided doses can be administered over time or the dose can be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It may be advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.

In general compounds of the invention should be used without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the compounds of the invention can be determined using standard techniques for example by testing in cell cultures or experimental animals and determining the therapeutic index i.e. the ratio between the LD the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the LD the dose lethal to 100 of the population . In some circumstances however such as in severe disease conditions it may be necessary to administer substantial excesses of the composition.

In a further aspect the invention provides methods of using the compounds of the invention as Granzyme B inhibitors.

In one embodiment the invention provides a method for inhibiting Granzyme B in a subject. In the method an effective amount of a compound of the invention e.g. a compound of Formulae I II III or IV is administered to a subject in need thereof.

In another embodiment the invention provides a method for treating a disease disorder or condition treatable by inhibiting Granzyme B.

The compounds of the invention are useful in treating cutaneous scleroderma epidermolysis bullosa radiation dermatitis alopecia areata and discoid lupus erythematosus.

Scleroderma refers to a heterogeneous group of autoimmune fibrosing disorders. Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis CREST syndrome or LcSSc develop sclerosis of the skin distal to their elbows and knees and have facial involvement. Patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis DcSSc develop proximal in addition to distal skin sclerosis. Both groups of patients are also at high risk of developing internal organ involvement. Patients with LcSSc and DcSSc suffer from Raynaud s phenomenon excessively reduced blood flow in response to cold or emotional stress causing discoloration of the fingers toes and occasionally other areas believed to be the result of vasospasms that decrease blood supply to the respective regions with high frequencies. Management of progressive skin involvement is dependent on additional comorbidities. In patients with skin involvement only mycophenolate mofetil Cellsept immunomodulator or methotrexate T cell modulator have been recommended.

Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita EBA is a chronic mucocutaneous autoimmune skin blistering disease. EBA patients can be classified into two major clinical subtypes noninflammatory classical or mechanobullous and inflammatory EBA which is characterized by cutaneous inflammation. In patients with inflammatory EBA widespread vesiculobullous eruptions are observed typically involving the trunk central body extremities and skin folds. Usually the patients suffer from pruritus rashes . Autoantibodies targeting type VII collagen COLT has been implicated in the pathogenesis. Therefore EBA is a prototypical autoimmune disease with a well characterized pathogenic relevance of autoantibody binding to the target antigen. EBA is a rare disease with an incidence of 0.2 0.5 new cases per million and per year. The current treatment of EBA relies on general immunosuppressive therapy which does not lead to remission in all cases.

Radiation Dermatitis acute skin reaction ranges from a mild rash to severe ulceration. Approximately 85 90 of patients treated with radiation therapy will experience a moderate to severe skin reaction. Acute radiation induced skin reactions often lead to itching and pain delays in treatment and diminished aesthetic appearance and subsequently to a decrease in quality of life. Skin reactions related to radiation therapy usually manifest within 1 4 weeks of radiation start persist for the duration of radiation therapy and may require 2 4 weeks to heal after completion of therapy. The severity of the skin reaction ranges from mild erythema red rash and dry desquamation itchy peeling skin to more severe moist desquamation open wound and ulceration. Treatments that have been assessed for the management of radiation induced skin reactions include topical steroid creams nonsteroidal creams dressings and herbal remedies. Only three trials have showed a significant difference one in favor of a corticosteroid cream one favoring a nonsteroidal cream and one for a dressing. However all three of these trials were small and had limitations thus there is still an unmet medical need.

Late effects of radiation therapy typically months to years post exposure occur at doses greater than a single dose of 20 25 Gy or fractionated doses of 70 Gy or higher. The major underlying histopathological findings at the chronic stage include telangiectasia dense dermal fibrosis round fibrosis sebaceous and sweat gland atrophy loss of hair follicles and with higher doses increased melanin deposition or depigmentation and skin ulcers.

Ramipril was very effective in reducing the late effects of skin injury whereas its mitigating effects on the acute and sub acute injury were modest. However the dose required to mitigate these late effects may be pharmacologically too high to be clinically relevant. More recently it has been shown that significant mitigation of acute skin injury using an adeno associated virus encoding the manganese SOD gene when injected subcutaneously shortly after irradiation. However difficulties in delivery application and cost limit the utility of this treatment strategy.

Alopecia areata AA is a CD8 T cell dependent autoimmune disease of the hair follicle HF in which the collapse of HF immune privilege IP plays a key role. Mast cells MCs are crucial immunomodulatory cells implicated in the regulation of T cell dependent immunity IP and hair growth. Many of these infiltrating immune cells express GzmB suggesting it may be a key mediator in immune cell mediated follicular attack. The peptide substance P was shown to increase the CD8 cells expressing GzmB in the intrafollicular dermis co relating to a regression of follicles into the catagen stage of follicle growth cessation Siebenhaar et al. 2007 127 1489 1497 .

In mice fed a diet with excess vitamin A AA was accelerated and GzmB expressing cells were found in excess surrounding hair follicles including in the isthmus the region of the follicle containing stem cells Duncan et al. 2013 133 334 343 . As GzmB is expressed in the immune cell infiltrate within and surrounding growing follicles it may be a key protease involved in hair loss through autoimmunity apoptosis and ECM degradation.

No drug is currently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of alopecia areata. A number of treatments have been found to be effective using the American College of Physician s criteria for example topical and oral corticosteroids and the sensitizing agents diphenylcyclopropenone and dinitrochlorobenzene. However there is no cure for alopecia areata nor is there any universally proven therapy that induces and sustains remission.

Granzyme B is a serine protease found in cytoplasmic granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer cells that plays an important role in inducing apoptotic changes in target cells during granule exocytosis induced cytotoxicity. When Granzyme B is secreted into the cytoplasm of a target cell through the pore formed by perforin it triggers cytotoxic induced cell death Shah et al. 2011 269 16 21 .

Lupus erythematosus LE is a chronic autoimmune multisystem disease that displays many diverse symptoms in which localized cutaneous LE CLE is on one end of the spectrum and severe systemic LE SLE on the other end. CLE is a disfiguring chronic skin disease with a significant impact on the patients everyday life. CLE are further divided into four main subsets Acute CLE ACLE subacute CLE SCLE and chronic CLE CCLE where classic discoid LE DLE is the most common form. There is also a drug induced form of the disease. The disease often has a chronic and relapsing course that can be induced or aggravated by UV light. CLE patients display well defined skin lesions often in sun exposed areas. Discoid LE is the most common subtype of CLE 60 80 is localized above the neck and 20 40 is generalized lesions both above and below the neck . 70 90 of the DLE patients suffer from photosensitivity and sun exposed areas such as the scalp ears and cheeks which are most commonly involved areas. The lesions start as erythematosus maculae or papules with a scaly surface and then grow peripherally into larger discoid plaques that heal with atrophic scar and pigmentary changes. DLE often results in scarring and alopecia. Mutilation with tissue loss can be seen when the lesions affect the ears and tip of the nose. CLE can be managed but so far not cured. Avoidance of trigger factors is of utmost importance such as cessation of smoking and avoidance of sun exposure. The treatment is about the same for the different CLE subsets where first line of treatment is sun protection and local therapy with corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Antimalarial are the first choice of systemic treatment.

Strong co expression of Granzyme B and the skin homing molecule cutaneous lymphocyte antigen CLA was found in lesional lymphocytes of patients with scarring localized chronic DLE and disseminated chronic DLE which was enhanced compared with nonscarring subacute CLE and healthy controls Wenzel et al. 2005 153 1011 1015 . Wenzel et al. conclude that skin homing cytotoxic Granzyme B positive lymphocytes play an important role in the pathophysiology of scarring chronic DLE and that the potentially autoreactive cytotoxic lymphocytes targeting adnexal structures may lead to scarring lesions in chronic DLE.

Correlation between Granzyme B positive lymphocytes and the presence of CLE was shown by Grassi Grassi et al. 2009 34 910 914 . Granzyme B is an apoptosis immunological mediator that once synthesized and free from activated cytotoxic lymphocytes enters the target cell and starts apoptotic mechanisms involved at different levels in all apoptotic pathways. In CLE apoptosis is characterized by the presence of colloid or Civatte bodies which are evident in the epidermis and papillary dermis of CLE lesions and since Granzyme B is mainly expressed in CLE lesions Grassi et al. conclude that Granzyme B could play a role in the induction of apoptotic mechanisms in CLE.

The expression of Granzyme B and perforin was correlated with clinicopathological features in patients with DLE where both Granzyme B and perforin were expressed in DLE with absent expression in normal skin Abdou et al. 2013 Early Online 1 9 . Abdou et al. concluded that cytotoxicity in dermal lymphocytic inflammation was due to expression of both Granzyme B and perforin.

Extracellular Granzymes B is also reported to play a role in DLE by Grassi et al. Further UV light increases Granzyme B expression in keratinocytes as well as mast cells Hernandez Pigeon 2007 282 8157 8164 . As Granzymes B is in abundance at the dermal epidermal junction DEJ where many key extracellular matrix substrates are present for example laminin fibronectin decorin it follows that Granzymes B may also be damaging the DEJ as is observed in DLE. Given its expression in adnexal structures Granzyme B may also be contributing to alopecia as reduced Granzymes B is associated with reduced hair loss in a murine model of skin aging. Similarly reduced extracellular Granzyme B activity is associated with improved collagen organization and reduced scarring in the skin and aorta.

In view of the established connection between Granzyme B and DLE by virtue of their ability to inhibit Granzyme B the compounds of the invention are useful in methods for treating lupus erythematosus LE including severe systemic LE SLE and localized cutaneous LE CLE e.g. acute CLE ACLE subacute CLE SCLE chronic CLE CCLE and the most common form classic discoid LE DLE . In one embodiment the invention provides a method for treating DLE comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention to a subject suffering from DLE.

In the above methods the administration of the Granzyme B inhibitor can be a systemic administration a local administration e.g. administration to the site an inflamed microenvironment an inflamed joint an area of skin a site of a myocardial infarct an eye a neovascularized tumor or a topical administration to a site e.g. a site of inflammation or a wound .

The term subject or patient is intended to include mammalian organisms. Examples of subjects or patients include humans and non human mammals e.g. nonhuman primates dogs cows horses pigs sheep goats cats mice rabbits rats and transgenic non human animals. In specific embodiments of the invention the subject is a human.

The term administering includes any method of delivery of a Granzyme B inhibitor or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a Granzyme B inhibitor into a subject s system or to a particular region in or on a subject. In certain embodiments a moiety is administered topically intravenously intramuscularly subcutaneously intradermally intranasally orally transcutaneously intrathecal intravitreally intracerebral or mucosally.

As used herein the term applying refers to administration of a Granzyme B inhibitor that includes spreading covering at least in part or laying on of the inhibitor. For example a Granzyme B inhibitor may be applied to an area of inflammation on a subject or applied to for example the eye or an area of inflammation by spreading or covering the surface of the eye with an inhibitor by injection oral or nasal administration.

As used herein the term contacting includes contacting a cell or a subject with a Granzyme B inhibitor. Contacting also includes incubating the Granzyme B inhibitor and the cell together in vitro e.g. adding the inhibitor to cells in culture as well as administering the inhibitor to a subject such that the inhibitor and cells or tissues of the subject are contacted in vivo.

As used herein the terms treating or treatment refer to a beneficial or desired result including but not limited to alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms diminishing the extent of a disorder stabilized i.e. not worsening state of a disorder amelioration or palliation of the disorder whether detectable or undetectable. Treatment can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival in the absence of treatment.

In further aspects the invention provides cosmetic compositions that include one or more granzyme B inhibitors of the invention and methods for using the compositions to treat reduce and or inhibit the appearance of ageing of the skin.

This aspect of the invention is based in part on the observation that granzyme B expression is induced in keratinocytes and immune cells such as mast cells in the skin during aging. When released by these cells granzyme B cleaves extracellular matrix proteins such as decorin which can result in collagen disorganization. This invention is also based in part on the observation that granzyme B cleaves decorin in addition to other extracellular matrix proteins in the interstitial space surrounding cells.

Skin is comprised of three main layers the epidermis the dermis and subcutaneous layers. Each of these three layers has individual compositions. The functions and structures of these layers are known to a person of skill in the art. The epidermis is the outermost layer of skin and includes both living and dead cell layers. The dermis is the middle layer of skin and is comprised of arrangements of collagen fibers which surround many specialized cells and structures. Hair follicles are found within the dermis and produce the hair shaft which grows out through layers of the dermis and epidermis to become visible as hair. The lowermost layer of the skin is the subcutaneous layer often called the sub dermis. The subcutaneous layer is comprised largely of fat and connective tissue and houses larger blood vessels and nerves. Collagen may be found in all layers of the skin but is most prominently in the dermis layer.

A youthful appearance is achieved by not having at least one of the characteristic signs of age. This is often achieved by being young. Nevertheless there are circumstances in which being young does not confer a youthful appearance as a disease or disorder or other non time related event has conferred the characteristics associated with age. A youthful appearance is often characterized by the condition of the skin and the following skin qualities are typically associated with but not limited to a youthful appearance small pore size healthy skin tone radiance clarity tautness firmness plumpness suppleness elasticity softness healthy skin texture healthy skin contours such as few or no wrinkles shallow wrinkle depth few or no fine lines healthy skin luster and brightness moisturized skin healthy skin thickness and resilient skin. If a skin of a subject comprises any one or more of these characteristics then a youthful appearance is achieved.

The appearance of ageing can occur for a variety of reasons but typically happens at a normal rate associated with the passage of time. A rate of appearance of ageing will be different for different subjects depending on a variety of factors including age gender diet and lifestyle. An appearance of ageing is often characterized by the condition of the skin. Characteristics associated with an appearance of ageing in the skin include but are not limited to skin fragility skin atrophy skin wrinkles fine lines skin discoloration skin sagging skin fatigue skin stress skin inelasticity skin fragility skin softening skin flakiness skin dryness enlarged pore size skin thinning reduced rate of skin cell turnover deep and deepening of skin wrinkles. The rate of appearance of ageing can be measured by measuring the rate at which any one or more of the above characteristics appear. An appearance of ageing may be inhibited reduced or treated by reducing or maintaining a state of any one or more of these skin characteristics.

In many circumstances a reduction in the appearance of ageing of skin occurs when the rate of collagen cleavage exceeds the rate of collagen formation. In many other circumstances a youthful appearance of skin is maintained when the rate of collagen formation is equal to the rate of collagen cleavage. In many other circumstances a reduction in a rate of appearance of ageing of skin is achieved when the rate of decorin cleavage and collagen disorganization and cleavage is slowed such that the rate of collagen fibrillogenesis exceeds the rate of collagen cleavage and the ratio of the rate of collagen fibrillogenesis to the rate of collagen cleavage is greater after application of granzyme B inhibitor compound compared to the ratio before application of the compound. In many other circumstances an extracellular protein other than decorin is also cleaved by granzyme B and the beneficial effects of inhibiting granzyme B can be enhanced beyond what is realized by inhibiting decorin cleavage alone.

Regardless of the compound or formulation described herein application administration to a subject as a colloidal dispersion system can be used as a delivery vehicle to enhance the in vivo stability of the compound and or to target the granzyme B inhibitor compound to a particular skin layer tissue or cell type. Colloidal dispersion systems include but are not limited to macromolecule complexes nanocapsules microspheres beads and lipid based systems including oil in water emulsions micelles mixed micelles liposomes and lipidnhibitor complexes of uncharacterized structure. An example of a colloidal dispersion system is a plurality of liposomes. Liposomes are microscopic spheres having an aqueous core surrounded by one or more outer layers made up of lipids arranged in a bilayer configuration see generally Chonn et al. 6 698 708 1995 . Sustained release dosage forms of the compounds described herein can also be used.

The amount of the granzyme B inhibitor compound administered or applied to a subject is not critical except that it should be an amount sufficient to effect improvement of the condition for which the composition is administered applied. Application can be dependent on a number of factors including severity and responsiveness of the condition to be treated and with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months or until improvement of a condition is effected or a diminution of a symptom is achieved.

A cosmetically effective amount of a granzyme B inhibitor compound includes a cosmetically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A cosmetically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired cosmetic result such as improved skin elasticity skin durability skin firming skin texture decrease the appearance or decrease rate of appearance of aging and the like. A cosmetically effective amount of a compound may vary according to factors such as the skin state age sex and weight of the subject and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum cosmetic response. A cosmetically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the compound are outweighed by the cosmetically beneficial effects. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result such as improved skin elasticity skin durability skin firming skin texture a decrease appearance or a decrease in the rate of appearance of aging and the like. Typically a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of skin deterioration so that a prophylactically effective amount may be less than a cosmetically effective amount.

The amount of granzyme B inhibitor administered applied may vary with the severity of the appearance or rate of appearance of age of the skin. For any particular subject specific dosage regimens may be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the judgment of the person applying or supervising the applying of the compositions. Dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and do not limit the dosage ranges that may be selected. The amount of granzyme B inhibitor compound s in the composition or formulation can vary according to factors such as the skin state age sex and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum response. For example a single application can be administered applied several divided doses can be administered applied over time or the amount of the composition administered applied can be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the situation. It can be advantageous to formulate the granzyme B inhibitor compounds in a composition into a dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of application.

By way of example a granzyme B inhibitor compound of the cosmetic composition can be administered applied to achieve from about 0.01 micrograms per milliliter g mL to about 10 milligrams per milliliter from about 0.1 g mL to about 500 g mL from about 0.1 g mL to about 1500 g mL from about 1 g mL to about 2000 g mL and from about 0.1 g mL to about 5000 g mL including any range within these ranges final concentrations at a target site.

Appropriate dosage values can depend on the characteristics of the site to which the composition is to be applied administered and on the form of the granzyme B inhibitor compound used. Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery is provided in the literature and generally available to practitioners in the art. Those skilled in the art will employ different formulations for different uses and the granzyme B inhibitor compound used. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can easily estimate repetition rates for dosing based on measured residence times and concentrations of the granzyme B inhibitor compound in for example a bodily fluid or a tissue. Following successful treatment it can be desirable to have the subject undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the condition wherein a selected compound is administered applied in maintenance doses applied for example once or more daily to once every few days. In certain embodiments granzyme B inhibitor compounds are administered applied in an amount to achieve ex vivo concentrations from about 1 micromolar to about 10 millimolar from about 10 micromolar to about 5000 micromolar or from about 30 micromolar to about 3000 micromolar and from about 25 micromolar to about 3000 micromolar final concentration over a site of interest and including about 25 micromolar or about 1600 micromolar or about 3000 micromolar final concentration over the site and still more typically between about 1 micromolar to about 1000 micromolar.

Compounds or compositions of granzyme B inhibitors can be administered applied by means of a device or appliance such as an implant graft prosthesis garment of clothing stent and the like. Also implants can be devised which are intended to contain and release such compounds or compositions. An example would be an implant made of a polymeric material adapted to release the compound over a period of time. Such implants can be placed into a garment to be worn by a subject for example a glove shirt mask or hat.

The cosmetic compositions of the invention can be used to inhibit or reduce the appearance of ageing. Ageing is a natural phenomenon that cannot be reversed per se but the appearance of ageing such as skin deterioration including but not limited to skin inelasticity skin fragility skin softening skin flakiness skin dryness enlarged pore size skin thinning reduced rate of skin cell turnover skin wrinkling deepening of skin wrinkles skin sagging fine lines and skin discoloration may be inhibited or reduced.

The cosmetic compositions can be used to increase or decrease a rate of increasing or a rate of decreasing occurrences of a particular skin characteristic. In other words the composition when applied to the skin or a portion of the skin of a subject delays the onset of an appearance of aging. For example in a population of subjects where half of the population applies a granzyme B inhibitor to their skin and another half of the population does not apply a granzyme B inhibitor to their skin the half which applied a granzyme B inhibitor would not appear as aged as the half which did not apply the granzyme B inhibitor after a period of time had elapsed. The half of the population which applied a granzyme B inhibitor to the skin would also have maintained a youthful appearance.

The rate at which a particular subject experiences a change in the rate of appearance of a particular skin characteristic i.e. an increasing or decreasing rate of the appearance of a particular skin characteristic will depend on a variety of factors including but not limited to age weight sex and lifestyle of the subject. As such rates are not necessarily constant but a normal rate of increase or of decrease of an appearance of a characteristic defined as being the new occurrence of a particular characteristic over a predetermined period of time under a set of conditions that do not include the presence of a granzyme B inhibitor applied by a method or use of this invention is increased or decreased by applying a granzyme B inhibitor in accordance with a method or use of this invention. Methods of measuring skin characteristics rates of increasing appearance of skin characteristics and rates of decreasing appearance of skin characteristics are known to a person of skill in the art see for example by Agache et al. Springer 2004 .

Surprisingly granzyme B inhibitors can also be used to increase the density of hair follicles of a skin of a subject and may be used to reduce the occurrences of cutaneous xanthomas of a skin of a subject. Actively growing hair follicles contain melanocytes that transfer pigment to matrix keratinocytes imparting color to hair. Additionally sebum produced in sebaceous glands is often secreted via hair follicles. Increased density of hair follicles results in increased pigment production and increased sebum secretion resulting in improved hair appearance e.g. hair that is less grey in color or not grey at all as well as healthier hair and skin. Granzyme B inhibitors also cause hair follicles to appear deeper in the skin which provide stronger hair that is less susceptible to mechanical damage. Additionally a characteristic sign of ageing is the reduction in hair follicle density. It is known in the art that age and follicular miniaturization are weak predictors of total hair count see Chapman et al. 152 646 649 2005 . Consequently the characteristic sign of age associated with hair follicle density is not predictive of hair density.

The cosmetic composition may be applied to a portion of the skin of a subject or to the whole of the skin of the subject. For example the composition may be applied to the skin only on the face only on the scalp on the whole head or to each part of the body.

After incubation 50 uL of this 2 enzyme inhibitor mix was added to the corresponding coated well to initiate fibronectin cleavage 20 nM final granzyme B concentration 8 point inhibitor dilution series starting at 50 uM . The assay was conducted at 30 C. in the TECAN plate reader TECAN INFINITE M1000 Pro which was programmed to monitor the kinetic fluorescence polarization signal filter set Ex Em 470 nm 527 nm with readings taken every minute for 1 hour. Proteolytic activity was evaluated as the rate of fluorescence enhancement in the parallel emission over the linear range of the reaction. Inhibition values were calculated from assay controls and the resulting date is shown in Table 8.

Black 96 well high binding clear bottom assay plates Griener Bio one were treated overnight at 4 C. with 40 uL of 5 ug mL Fibronectin Sigma Aldrich . After fibronectin coating wells were washed 3 times in Tris wash buffer 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 20 mM NaCl then once with granzyme B assay buffer HEPES 50 mM pH 7.5 CHAPS 0.1 . After washing 50 uL of granzyme B assay buffer was added to each fibronectin coated well. In a separate non binding 96 well assay plate 5 uL of relevant 20 inhibitor dilution stocks were added to 45 uL of 2.22 GzmB mix to establish inhibition enzyme inhibitor mixes were all prepared in granzyme B assay buffer and were incubated first at room temperature for 20 minutes then at 30 C. for another 10 minutes . After incubation 50 uL of this 2 enzyme inhibitor mix was added to the corresponding coated well to initiate fibronectin cleavage 20 nM final granzyme B concentration 3 final inhibitor concentrations 0.1 uM 10 uM and 100 uM . The assay was conducted at 30 C. in a plate warmer for 2 hours. After incubation wells were washed 3 times with PBS and then blocked with 2 BSA in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. After sufficient blocking wells were washed an additional 3 times with PBS to remove residual BSA. 3T3 fibroblasts harvested from sub confluent conditions were prepared in serum free DMEM and introduced into the treated wells at 10 000 cells well. Cells were allowed to adhere for 90 minutes or until appropriate attached phenotype was detected. After attachment wells were agitated with gentle repeat pipetting 3 times gently aspirated manually and washed once with PBS. Wells were then fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 hr washed twice with PBS and stained with the nuclear dye DAPI. Microscopic detection and counting of stained nuclei was performed using IMAGE PRO Plus software. Cell count was normalized to Cell Adhesion. The results are shown in Table 9.
