This invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. H94003 04 D 002 0068 awarded by the US Department of the Air Force. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.

The invention relates to interconnection of various components with one another and more particularly to interconnection of various components inside a completely sealed housing such as interconnection of various components within a hermetically sealed microwave module.

There are few dense interconnect options inside closed and or sealed housings or container s e.g. a channelized hermetic microwave module that connect to other routing planes e.g. vertical interconnect. There is a need for a way to make the vertical connections be as small as possible in and out of plane. These dense connections allow for lighter integration of the bias and control circuitry inside the housing walls.

Wherefore it is an object of the present invention to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings and drawbacks associated with the prior art.

An object of the present invention is to eliminate any feed through holes or openings in a central portion of the central core which are provided for directly connecting the multilayered substrate with the circuit card assembly.

Another object of the present invention is to address the high tolerances which are typically required by the feed through holes or openings in the central core which is necessary for ensuring proper electrical connection between the associated connectors of a multilayer substrate located on one side and associated connectors of a circuit card assembly located on another side.

A further object of the present invention is to simplify the connection of the multilayered substrate and the circuit card assembly with one another within the module and also improve the overall efficiency and performance of the module.

Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a multilayer substrate which has at least one preferably a plurality of flexible tabs which extend from the main portion of the multilayer substrate and are readily able to be bent folded and reconfigured 180 in order to facilitate electrical connection of the electrical contacts of the multilayer substrate with the associated electrically connectors of the circuit card assembly.

A still further object of the present invention is to provide at least one and preferably a plurality of passageways about a periphery of the central core which facilitate connection between the flexible coupling tabs of the multilayer substrate with the circuit card assembly.

A still further object of the present invention is to group all of the electrical contacts of the multilayer substrate at the remote free end of one of the flexible coupling tabs and also group all of the associated electrical contacts of the circuit card assembly in one or more peripheral areas of the circuit card assembly e.g. typically four or less locations in order to simplify the connection of the electrical connectors of the multilayer substrate with the associated electrical connectors of the circuit card assembly.

Yet another object of the present invention is to increase the signal density of the flexible coupling tabs so that each flexible coupling tab has a signal density of at least 100 single traces per inch.

All microwave signals are typically routed on a single low loss multilayer substrate. Typically this substrate has openings formed therein for receiving one or more septum walls formed on the microwave side or primary support surface of the central core of the housing. In order to connect the single low loss multilayer substrate with the electrical contact located on the opposed secondary support surface of the central core at least one portion of the multilayer substrate e.g. the flexible coupling tabs wraps around an edge of the central core toward the secondary support surface of the module for connection to the bias and control printed board assembly or the circuit card assembly CCA . In order to facilitate ease of connection a standard low profile SMT connector is typically located between and facilitates connection of the electrical contacts located at the remote free end of the RF Flex multilayer substrate and with the electrical contact s generally located about the periphery of the circuit card assembly. Generally any component s which does not need to be in or close to the RF signal path is located on or comprises part of the bias and control circuit card assembly.

The present invention also relates to a hermetically sealed module comprising a central core housing including a perimeter side wall and a central core having opposed primary and secondary support surfaces at least one coupling passageway being formed within the central core adjacent the perimeter side wall of central core housing a sealed electrical connector interface which facilitates communication with components accommodated within the central core housing a multilayer substrate having at least one flexible coupling tab being supported by the primary support surface at least one surface mounted component being supported by the secondary support surface the at least one flexible coupling tab passing through the at least one coupling passageway and a SMT connector couples a plurality of signal traces of the multilayer substrate with an electrical connection array of the at least one surface mounted component and primary and secondary lids being respectively securing to opposed sides of the perimeter side wall to form the hermetically sealed module.

The present invention also relates to a microwave module comprising a housing with opposed lids a low loss multi layer substrate for routing microwave signals which wraps around the module to connect to a bias and control circuit card assembly and a low profile SMT connector attached to the substrate and the circuit card assembly.

It should be understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale and that the disclosed embodiments are sometimes illustrated diagrammatical and in partial views. In certain instances details which are not necessary for an understanding of this disclosure or which render other details difficult to perceive may have been omitted. It should be understood of course that this disclosure is not limited to the particular embodiments illustrated herein.

The present invention will be understood by reference to the following detailed description which should be read in conjunction with the appended drawings. It is to be appreciated that the following detailed description of various embodiments is by way of example only and is not meant to limit in any way the scope of the present invention.

Turning now to a brief description concerning the various components of the central core housing of the microwave module will now be briefly discussed. This discussion will then be followed by a brief discussion of the remaining components of the microwave module as well as assembly thereof. As shown in those Figures the module according to the present invention has a central core housing which includes a perimeter side wall which generally comprises opposed first and third side walls and opposed second and fourth side walls which are all formed continuously and integral with one another. The opposed first and third side walls and the second and the fourth side walls are all formed integrally with one another and with a generally planar central core . An inner perimeter edge of each opposed side of the central core housing has a perimeter lid recess formed therein which facilitates receiving and sealing of a respective primary or a secondary lid as will be discussed below in further detail.

As noted above the central core is formed integral with the perimeter side wall of the central core housing . The perimeter side wall of the central core housing typically has a height of between about inch to about 1 inches or so depending upon the particular application. The central core typically has a thickness of about 1 16 of an inch to about of an inch or so depending upon the particular application. The central core extends normal to and between the opposed first and third side walls and as well as between the opposed second and fourth side was . The central core is also generally located centrally between the opposed perimeter edges of the side wall of the central core housing . This arrangement permits various microwave and electronic components as shown in for example to be supported by either the primary or the secondary support surfaces of the central core while still sufficiently spacing such components from either the primary or the secondary lids or after final assembly of the microwave module . As will be described below in further detail some of the module components are mounted to the primary support surface e.g. typically an RF flex multilayer substrate while the remaining components are typically mounted to the secondary support surface .

At least one and preferably two or more coupling passageways are formed within and through the central core . Each one of the coupling passageways is formed closely adjacent the side wall of the central core housing and extends completely through the central core . Each coupling passageway is typically either oval or rectangularly shaped and has a length of about inch and a width of about of an inch. Each coupling passageway following installation of the multilayer substrate is located between a perimeter edge of a main portion of the multilayer substrate and an inwardly facing surface of the side wall of the central core housing . The purpose of the coupling passageways is to provide a connection passage though the central core which facilitates electrical coupling of all of the electrical or electronic components supported by the primary support surface with all of the electrical electronic components supported by the secondary support surface of the microwave module . That is according to the present invention all direct feed through connections between the primary and the secondary support surfaces are eliminated in favor of the one or more perimeter passageways and this simplifies design manufacture and assembly of the microwave module .

To facilitate assembly of the desired substrate s component s to either the primary and or the secondary support surfaces of the central core as generally shown in for example a plurality of dies e.g. as many as 50 100 dies may be supported by one or both of those support surfaces . As is conventional in the art during an initial assembly step a base or bottom surface of each one of the dies is permanently secured e.g. by an epoxy to either the primary or the secondary support surfaces of the central core to achieve permanent connection of the respective die at a desired location along the desired support surface of the central core .

As shown in the secondary support surface and possibly the primary support surface of the central core may have one or more recessed cavities formed therein which facilitates accommodating one or more surface mounted plastic parts or components within the central core housing . Each recessed cavity extends only partially into the central core and is sized so as to space any accommodated surface mounted plastic parts or components slightly away from and out of contact with the central core .

With reference now to a brief discussion concerning the multilayer substrate which is typically mounted on the primary support surface of the central core shown in will now be provided. As is conventional in the art the multilayer substrate typically comprises a plurality of layers of flexible substrates depending upon the desired circuitry and function of the microwave module . That is the multilayer substrate typically comprises at least six separate overlapping layers of substrate and as is conventional in the art each one of the separate layers of the substrate typically has the desired layout artwork so as to provide the desired feature function or purpose. In addition as is conventional in the art each one of the layers of the substrate typically has copper artwork formed thereon which tends to increase the overall rigidity of the flexible substrate and generally resists bending thereof.

According to the present invention the bottom surface of the multilayer substrate is typically plated or covered with a copper layer see which forms a grounding surface for grounding the multilayer substrate with the central core following installation of the multilayer substrate on the primary surface of the central core . As generally shown in the multilayer substrate has a top layer which with intermediate layers sandwiched between the top and bottom layers completes formation of the multilayer substrate .

The multilayer substrate has at least one and typically two or more flexible coupling tabs the purpose of which will become apparent from the following discussion. Typically these flexible coupling tabs are formed from a plurality of the intermediate layers of the multilayer substrate i.e. the layers located between the top and the bottom layers of the multilayer substrate . The electrical connections or signal traces from the various layers of the multilayer substrate exit from the main portion of the multilayer substrate via one or more of the flexible coupling tabs . The signal traces extend through the flexible coupling tabs from the main portion of the multilayer substrate and terminate at a connection end of the coupling tab . The signal traces are slightly spaced from but arranged parallel to one another. Each one of the flexible coupling tabs typically has a cross hatching structure which assists with reliable bending of the flexible coupling tabs without compromising the overall integrity and or electrical conductivity of the signal traces extending through the flexible coupling tabs . Due at least in part to this arrangement the present invention is capable of achieving a signal density of 100 signal traces per inch within the flexible coupling tabs .

As is well known in the art since the multilayer substrate operates at high frequency it is highly desirable to use a bare die technique for installing the multilayer substrate on the primary support surface of the central core . As indicated above a plurality of dies are utilized for attaching the desired substrates and or components to either the primary or the secondary surfaces of the central core by this technique.

During a first step of the manufacturing process each one of these plurality of dies is preferably epoxied or otherwise permanently secured to either the primary or the secondary support surface of the central core at desired locations. To facilitate engagement between the associated dies and the multilayer substrate a plurality of strategically located die apertures or holes see are formed in and extend completely through each one of the layers of the multilayered substrate . Each die aperture or hole is slightly larger in diameter than the diameter of the associated die so as to matingly receive the respective die when the multilayered substrate is installed on the primary support surface of the central core . As illustrated the location of the die apertures or holes of respectively correspond with location of the plurality of dies of . Similarly the location of the die apertures or holes of respectively correspond with the location of the plurality of dies of .

In order to facilitate permanent engagement and retention of the multilayer substrate with the respective die of the central core following installation of the multilayer substrate on the primary support surface of the central core each one of the dies is typically ribbon bonded as diagrammatically shown in to a closely adjacent perimeter portion of the respective die aperture or hole of the multilayered substrate . Such ribbon bonding technique typically results in deposition of a bonding layer which is about 0.5 mils thick and about 3 mils wide.

In some applications one or more septum walls may be formed on at least the primary support surface of the central core and possibly the secondary support surface . Each one of the septum walls generally extends between the primary support surface of the central core and an inwardly facing surface of the primary lid or secondary lid once assembled with the central core housing as generally shown in . Each of the septum walls is useful in dividing partitioning or separating the interior chamber of the central core housing into a plurality of partially separate compartments or regions. Such separation facilitates shielding one or more components of the multilayer substrate from one or more other components of the multilayer substrate .

One or more strategically located septum apertures or holes which extend completely through each layer of the multilayered substrate is are arranged so as to closely receive a respective septum wall formed in the primary support surface of the central core when the multilayered substrate is installed on the central core . As illustrated the location of the septum apertures or holes of respectively correspond with location of the septum walls of . Similarly the location of the septum apertures or holes of respectively correspond with the location of the septum walls of . It is to appreciated that the shape the length the width and the thickness of each septum wall can vary depending upon the particular needs of the application at hand. As the various other components and other features of the multilayer substrate are conventional and well known in the art a further detailed discussion concerning the same is not provided.

As shown in other surface mounted components are typically supported by the secondary support surface of the central core . It is to appreciated that the one or more surface mounted components may possibly be individually connected to the secondary support surface of the central core by either screws or some other conventional fastener s not shown in detail . These fasteners may be releasable in order to facilitate releasable attachment of such surface mounted component s to the central core . Alternatively the one or more surface mounted components can each be directly epoxied to the secondary support surface of the central core in order to facilitate a permanent attachment thereto. For many applications two or more surface mounted components are assembled and electrically connected together with one another in a conventional fashion and packaged within one or more larger unitary assemblies of surface mounted components such as a printed board assembly or circuit card assembly . This facilitates ease of installation of the various surface mounted components on the secondary support surface of the central core . The unitary or circuit card assembly of surface mounted components is then epoxied or releasably secured by screws or some other conventional fastener s not shown in detail to the secondary support surface of the central core .

As noted above and illustrated in the secondary support surface of the central core typically has one or more recessed cavities which facilitate receiving and accommodating one or more surface mounted components carried by or supported on a rear surface of the unitary or circuit card assembly . In such instance a perimeter of the rear surface of the unitary or circuit card assembly is epoxied or secured e.g. by screws or some other conventional fastener s to the secondary support surface of the central core . Meanwhile any surface mounted components supported on the rear surface of the circuit card assembly is are accommodated within the recessed cavity . An outwardly facing surface of the circuit card assembly has a plurality of the electrical contacts which are grouped together with one another to form an electrical connection array which facilitates connection with the signal traces of the flexible coupling tabs as will be discussed below in further detail. As is conventional and well known in the art the surface mounted components e.g. bias control and digital signal processing components etc. may comprise for example one or more voltage regulators amplifiers control circuits field programmable gauges etc.

As shown in as well as in a standard low profile SMT connector is utilized for interconnecting the remote free ends of the signal traces of each the flexible coupling tab with the respective electrical connection array of the circuit card assembly . According to one embodiment a first portion of the standard low profile SMT connector is connected e.g. by conventional soldering to the terminated free ends of the signal traces located on a rear surface of each of the flexible coupling tab while a mating second portion of the standard low profile SMT connector is connected e.g. by conventional soldering to the plurality of the electrical contacts of the electrical connection array of the circuit card assembly . As a result of such arrangement when one or more of the flexible coupling tabs passes through the associated coupling passageway and is bent approximately 180 degrees see into a U shape the mating first and second portions of the standard low profile SMT connector can be easily and reliably connected with one another and thereby achieve the desired electrical connections between the components of the multilayer substrate supported by the primary support surface of the central core and the one or more surface mounted components supported by the circuit card assembly secured to the secondary support surface of the central core .

Alternatively it is to be appreciated that the standard low profile SMT connector may be connected e.g. by conventional soldering to either the terminated free ends of the signal traces located on the rear surface of each of the flexible coupling tab or to the plurality of the electrical contacts of the electrical connection array of the circuit card assembly . During assembly the other of the plurality of the electrical contacts of the electrical connection array of the circuit card assembly or the terminated free ends of the signal traces of the flexible coupling tab is then connected with the standard low profile SMT connector e.g. by soldering etc. to complete the connection. Or still further the standard low profile SMT connector may be a completely separate component which is installed between the respective mating connectors of both the flexible coupling tabs and the circuit card assembly during final assembly of the module to facilitate interconnection of the signal traces located on a rear surface at a connector end of each flexible coupling tab with the plurality of the electrical contacts of the electrical connection array of the circuit card assembly .

Following installation of the multilayer substrate on the primary support surface the circuit card assembly on the secondary support surface and interconnection of the signal traces of each flexible coupling tab of the multilayer substrate with the plurality of the electrical contacts of the electrical connection array of the circuit card assembly the primary and secondary lids are then installed within each respective lid recess as shown in and then permanently connected or secured thereto e.g. by laser welding. Immediately prior to hermetically sealing the module the internal chamber may be filled with an inert gas such as argon which improves the overall life of the module . The primary and the secondary lids extend generally parallel to one another but are spaced from one another. This forms a completely closed and hermetically sealed central core housing which in turn defines the hermetically sealed internal chamber which accommodates a variety of microwave and electrical components.

As shown in and previously discussed above the multilayer substrate is formed such that each flexible coupling tab can be bent into a wraparound U shaped configuration. That is a bottom surface of the main body of the multilayer substrate has a first planar portion which is configured to matingly and intimately engage with the primary support surface of the central core while the flexible coupling tabs of the multilayer substrate are each designed so as to be easily bent curved or shaped into the wraparound configuration which is generally U shaped. As generally shown the free end of each flexible coupling tab supports the connection ends of the signal traces of the multilayer substrate and the flexible coupling tab is curved or bent approximately 180 degrees so as to wrap around an edge of the central core and be located generally closely adjacent the second support surface of the central core and facilitate connection with the electrical connection array of the circuit card assembly .

Due to such arrangement it is to be appreciated that the associated contacts of the multilayer substrate are provided on the bottom lowermost layer of the flexible coupling tabs so as to facilitate connection with the corresponding electrical connection array of the one or more surface mounted components of the circuit card assembly . As noted above the connection of the contacts of the multilayer substrate with the associated contacts of the one or more surface mounted components is achieved by the standard low profile SMT connector typically carrier by the multilayer substrate and or the circuit card assembly .

During assembly a top outwardly facing surface of each of the flexible coupling tabs may be attached at e.g. by an epoxy see to the central core housing . Such connection allows the flexible coupling tabs to be permanently secured to an adjacent portion of the perimeter side wall of the central core housing . This permanent connection ensures the positioning of the flexible coupling tabs with respect to the secondary support surfaces SMT connector and adjacent the housing of the central core .

As is conventional in the art and shown in a sealed electrical connector interface is located at a desired location within the exterior surface of the housing and this connector interface facilitates electrical connection with the various electrical components accommodated and hermetically sealed within the internal chamber of the module . As shown a first portion of the connector interface is exposed and can readily be engaged by a conventional connector not shown while a second portion of the connector interface is located inside the module and is connected to a desired component e.g. in this instance connected to the circuit card assembly via a SMT connector and conventional cabling or wiring . As noted above an external conventional connector engages with the connector interface and permits information data signals electrical pulses etc. to flow to and from the module in a conventional manner. As such electrical connections as well as their sealing interface with central core housing are conventional and well known in the art a further detailed description concerning same is not provided.

The approach of the present invention allows for 100 bias control signals to be routed between a traditional SMT CCA and a chip and a wire portion of a hermetic microwave module . The effective pitch of this interconnection is limited to the fine pitch SMT connector
