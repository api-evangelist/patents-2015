This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 849 626 filed Sep. 10 2015 and entitled System for Encoding Customer Data which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 518 076 filed Oct. 20 2014 which is now U.S. Pat. No. 9 159 069 issued Oct. 13 2015 and entitled System for Encoding Customer Data. 

This invention relates generally to analyzing and communicating data and more particularly to encoding customer data.

Enterprises assemble vast amounts of customer data. In conventional systems enterprises communicate uncoded customer data in accordance with a customer identifier such as a customer account number. This is problematic because uncoded data is susceptible to security breaches and uncoded data uses a substantial amount of resources such as bandwidth and memory.

According to embodiments of the present disclosure disadvantages and problems associated with communicating customer data may be reduced or eliminated.

In accordance with a particular embodiment of the present disclosure a rules engine stores a first rule a second rule and customer data wherein the customer data is associated with a particular customer. The rules engine transforms a portion of the customer data into a first code segment by applying a first rule and transforms a portion of the customer data into a second code segment by applying a second rule. In addition the rules engine combines at least the first code segment and the second code segment to form a customer profile code. The customer profile code is associated with a customer identifier. A decision engine communicatively coupled to the rules engine stores third party data wherein the third party data is associated with a request for customer information. The decision engine determines whether the customer identifier of the customer profile code matches the third party data and an interface engine communicatively coupled to the decision engine communicates the customer profile code to a third party if the customer identifier of the customer profile code and the third party data match.

Certain embodiments of the present disclosure may provide one or more technical advantages. A technical advantage of one embodiment includes saving resources such as bandwidth and memory by consolidating large amounts of customer data within an enterprise into a centralized unit and transforming that data on a customer by customer basis into a unique customer profile code. As another example a technical advantage of one embodiment includes mitigating data breaches by communicating secured customer data to third parties via a customer profile code. And a further technical advantage of an embodiment includes conveniently efficiently and securely transferring customer data to third parties by sharing an enterprise s encoded customer profile code with a third party via a secure application programming interface API . As a final example a technical advantage of one embodiment includes providing greater efficiencies for computer resources and network usage.

Other technical advantages of the present disclosure will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures descriptions and claims. Moreover while specific advantages have been enumerated above various embodiments may include all some or none of the enumerated advantages.

Embodiments of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.

Enterprises are organizations and typically include business units divisions or lines of businesses that handle the trade of various goods and services within the enterprise. Services may include but are not limited to transforming customer data into customer profile codes so that it can be efficiently and securely shared with third parties. Services may further include but are not limited to transforming customer profile codes back into customer data after it has been securely received by third parties.

To facilitate providing encoded customer data enterprises may communicate encoded customer profile codes to third parties via networks. Typically enterprises store customer data according to a customer identifier such as a customer account number. The teachings of this disclosure recognize that it would be desirable to provide a rules engine that transforms the customer data into code segments and combines the code segments to form a customer profile code thus creating a snapshot of the customer data. The teachings of this disclosure also recognize that it would be desirable to provide a decision engine that communicates a customer profile code to a third party if the customer identifier associated with the customer profile code matches third party data. Further the teachings of this disclosure recognize that when a customer identifier of a customer profile code matches third party data it would be desirable to communicate the rules and the code segments to a third party to enable the third party to decode the customer profile code. The teachings of this disclosure further recognize that a third party may receive the code segments and transform them back into the customer data by applying rules communicated by the enterprise.

As such the teachings of this disclosure provide for greater efficiencies in computer resources and network usage. For example by transforming vast amounts of customer data into compressed customer profile codes less resources such as bandwidth and memory are required to store the customer data and to communicate the customer data both internally within the enterprise and externally to third parties. Further the teachings of this disclosure provide for greater security of an enterprise s customer data. For instance by encoding the customer data the enterprise reduces the risk of third parties gaining access to its customer data without the enterprise s consent.

In the illustrated embodiment of rules engine stores customer data first rule and second rule . Customer data represents the data of a particular customer wherein n represents any suitable number. Customer data may include descriptive data such as for example customer s demographic data e.g. age gender ethnicity spoken languages employment data e.g. employment status employer employment history direct deposit information life cycle events e.g. retirement having a child buying a house sending child to college geographic data e.g. travel history location of residence location of customer upon occurrence of various events medical information e.g. medical payment history patient status medication purchases hospital or doctor visits health information educational information e.g. degrees tuition loans class schedules and financial information e.g. income investments trades options contracts margins portfolios account information . Further customer data may include behavioral data or general patterns exhibited by customer when using certain products or services. For example behavioral data may include customer s shopping habits e.g. purchasing browsing and registering activities merchant customer data SKU level data for items purchased bank account activities loan and mortgage commitments and operations information. Behavioral data may also include for instance the frequency in which customer visits an institution or call center customer s inquiries at an institution or call center and customer s recorded conversations with an associate of an enterprise. Customer data is not limited to descriptive and behavioral data and can include any data associated with customer .

In addition customer data may comprise one or more customer identifiers . Customer identifier is any identifier associated with customer that differentiates customer from other customers of an enterprise. For example customer identifier may be a phone number an email address biometric information e.g. voice scan retina scan fingerprint facial recognition and the like or an account number of customer . In some embodiments customer identifier may include customer s physical address or customer s driver s license number. Customer identifier can be any data suitable to identify customer . Customer identifier may also be associated with any of the following a user device identifier e.g. computer MAC address mobile identification number mobile subscription identification number International Mobile Station Equipment Identity or IMEI or the like student identification number account number card number dynamic token social media profile or token or any other unique or semi unique identifying information.

In one embodiment customer data is associated with service levels . The different service levels may determine what level of access to customer data a particular third party is entitled to receive. For example some customer data may be associated with one service level such as a lower tier of service and other customer data may be associated with another service level such as a higher tier of service. The different tiers of service levels may then be associated with particular third parties that may request access to the customer data . Thus a particular third party that pays a higher price enjoys a trusted status with the enterprise or otherwise maintains a higher status may be entitled to more different or enhanced customer data associated with a higher service level . In contrast another third party that may pay a lower price have a less trusted or untrusted status with the enterprise or otherwise maintains a lower status may be entitled to less or basic customer data associated with a lower service level . Alternatively or in addition third parties in different industries may get access to different customer data and service levels . Third parties can subscribe with the enterprise to gain access to the customer data as a part of an on boarding process. During this on boarding process the third parties can subscribe to a particular service level for a particular subscription fee.

Rules of rules engine include any parameters for classifying customer data . For example rules may facilitate classification of customer data in accordance with any of the variety of customer data described above such as for example customer s income transactional history credit rating or date of birth. Rules may be created or managed by devices persons or any other suitable source. For example associates may write specific rules for third party . As another example software may be used to evolve rules over time based on patterns shown by system .

Rules engine of system also includes first rule as shown in of the illustrated embodiment. First rule may include one or more conditions wherein n represents any suitable number. First rule may also include one or more code segments wherein n represents any suitable number. In some embodiments conditions are associated with code segments . For example condition may be associated with code segment . In the illustrated embodiment of conditions and are associated with income brackets. Customer data may represent customer s income. As such if customer income data falls below 25 000 annually then rules engine transforms into code segment which is represented by X1 in . Similarly if customer income data falls at or between 25 000 and 50 000 annually then rules engine transforms customer income data into code segment represented by X2 . And if customer income data is above 50 000 annually then rules engine transforms customer income data into code segment represented by X3 . For example if customer income data is 15 000 annually then rules engine transforms customer income data into code segment X1 as shown in the illustrated embodiment of .

Though only one condition is satisfied in the illustrated embodiment of more than one condition may be satisfied in other embodiments or no condition may be satisfied depending on the parameters of customer data . Further in some embodiments first rule includes less than three conditions. Alternatively first rule may include more than three conditions for example ten conditions. Further conditions and may be associated with more than one type of customer data. For example condition may be associated with customer s income whereas conditions and are associated with customer s quantity of purchases within a given period of time. Moreover different rules and conditions may be used in conjunction with the specific service levels described above and with reference to customer authentication requests described with reference to geographical areas described with reference to and customer operations history described with reference to . The rules and conditions used in those embodiments may depend on the particular request for customer data or the particular retrieved customer data .

In some embodiments rules engine of system further comprises second rule . Second rule may include one or more conditions wherein n represents any suitable number. Second rule may also include one or more code segments wherein n represents any suitable number. In some embodiments conditions are associated with code segments . For example condition may be associated with code segment . In the illustrated embodiment of conditions and are associated with birth year brackets. Customer data may represent customer s birth year. As such if birth year customer data falls at or between the years 1940 and 1959 then rules engine transforms customer data into code segment represented by Y1 . Similarly if birth year customer data falls at or between the years 1960 and 1979 then rules engine transforms customer data into code segment represented by Y2 . And if birth year customer data falls at or between the years 1980 and 1999 then the rules engine transforms customer data into code segment represented by Y3 . For example if birth year customer data is the year 1967 then rules engine transforms customer birth year data into code segment Y2 as shown in the illustrated embodiment of .

While first rule includes three conditions and and second rule includes three conditions and in the illustrated embodiment of rules engine of system may include more or less than two rules and each rule may include more or less than three conditions. For example rules engine may comprise 1 000 rules wherein each rule includes 100 conditions. As another example rules engine may comprise a first rule with five conditions a second rule with 100 conditions and a third rule with one condition. Conditions and may be associated with more than one type of customer data . For example condition may be associated with customer s birth year condition may be associated with customer s purchases and condition may be associated with customer s income. Further while rules and in the illustrated embodiment include conditions rules may instead or in addition include any suitable information for use in the operation of rules engine .

In some embodiments rules engine of system transforms at least a portion of customer data into a customer profile code based on at least a combination of code segments and . For example as shown in the illustrated embodiment of rules engine concatenates code segment represented by X1 and code segment represented by Y2 to generate customer profile code represented by X1Y2 . In some instances rules engine may concatenate more than two code segments to generate customer profile code for example X1Y2Z3 . Rules engine may transform customer data in any manner suitable for compressing or securing customer data . For example transforming customer data may include encoding encrypting or hashing customer data 

While rules engine in the illustrated embodiment of concatenates code segments and to form customer profile code rules engine may transform code segments and in any manner suitable for coding data. For instance code segments X1 and Y2 may jointly be represented by alphanumeric characters A1 by the number 10 or by a symbol such as a triangle. Further customer profile code may utilize any coding system suitable to protect against the unauthorized use of customer s information. For example customer profile code may be an alphanumeric code as shown in the illustrated embodiment of . As another example customer profile code may be a binary code. Rules engine may generate customer profile codes for multiple customers 

Some customer profile codes may be more sophisticated than other customer profile codes . For instance a customer with a large amount of customer data may have a more sophisticated customer profile code than a customer with a less amount of customer data . Further in some embodiments customer profile code is associated with customer identifier . Customer identifier may be located within customer data and can be any data that differentiates customer from other customers of enterprise . For example customer identifier may be customer s social security number customer s bank account number or customer s email address.

Rules engine of system may apply rules to customer data on a periodic or continuous basis to generate customer profile code . For example rules engine may generate customer profile code periodically by applying rules to customer data once every minute once a week or three times a week. As another example rules engine may apply rules to customer data in real time so that the customer profile code is always based on the most recent customer data . In some embodiments rules engine may only apply certain rules to the exclusion of others to generate customer profile code . Similarly rules engine may only apply certain conditions to the exclusion of others to generate customer profile code .

System as shown in the illustrated embodiment of also includes decision engine . Decision engine is communicatively coupled to rules engine and is operable to store third party data associated with a request for customer information. Third party data is information that can be used to identify customer of enterprise such as an email address a telephone number a social security number or a bank account number. Decision engine may also store customer data customer identifiers or a portion thereof.

Decision engine is further operable to determine whether customer identifier of customer profile code matches third party data . For example if customer identifier is represented by phone number 555 0102 and third party data is represented by phone number 555 0102 then decision engine verifies a match between customer identifier and third party data . In some embodiments decision engine may determine whether third party data matches more than one customer identifier . For instance system may require that two pieces of third party data for example and match two customer identifiers for example and . In some embodiments decision engine may determine a confidence score based on the number and type of customer identifiers that match third party data . For example if a suitable number e.g. 3 of customer identifiers match third party data or if highly trusted types of customer identifiers e.g. biometric data collection of biographic of unique information matches third party data or any suitable combination of number of type of customer identifiers match third party data then decision engine may register a higher confidence score . If the confidence score meets or exceeds a predetermined customer identifier threshold then decision engine determines a match. If the confidence score falls below the threshold then decision engine determines a mismatch. The level of threshold can be set e.g. high low or medium depending on the type of customer data requested e.g. higher threshold for more sensitive customer data the service level of the third party requesting the customer data e.g. lower threshold for third party with high service level the particular customer or any suitable number and combination of the foregoing.

Decision engine is further operable to determine what customer data a particular third party is entitled to based on service levels . For example a third party that enjoys a high service level with the enterprise may be entitled to a particular portion of customer data while a third party that enjoys a lower service level with the enterprise may be entitled to a different portion of customer data . As described above the service level associated with a particular third party may be determined according to the third party s subscription with the enterprise as established during an on boarding process. The third party s subscription can also be terminated as part of an off boarding process and the terminated third party would no longer have access to customer data in that situation. In response to a request for customer data from a third party decision engine determines the identity and service level of the third party and retrieves the appropriate customer data according to the determined service level for that third party.

System of the illustrated embodiment of also includes an interface engine . Interface engine is communicatively coupled to decision engine and operable to communicate customer profile code to third party if customer identifier of customer profile code matches third party data . Third party can be any party external to enterprise that can benefit from receiving customer information that has been transformed into code segments based on conditions such as income and birth year. Examples of third parties include merchants health care organizations credit card companies financial institutions e commerce sites social media sites or financial sites such as financial planning websites. In addition third party may be a realty site or an aggregator.

Interface engine of system may be further operable to communicate rules conditions and and code segments and to third party to facilitate decoding of customer profile code . For example if customer identifier of customer profile code matches third party data interface engine may communicate first rule and second rule to third party . Further if customer identifier of customer profile code matches third party data interface engine may communicate the code segments associated with the satisfied conditions to third party to enable third party to decode customer profile code . As such in accordance with the illustrated embodiment of third party can utilize code segment X1 to associate third party data with an income less than 25 000 annually. Similarly third party can utilize code segment Y2 to associate third party data with a date of birth between the years 1960 and 1979.

Interface engine of system may operate as an application programming interface API . As such interface engine may communicate customer profile code to third party by granting third party access to customer profile code via the API. In addition interface engine may communicate rules conditions and and code segments and to third party by granting third party access to the API. By utilizing a secure API an enterprise can efficiently and conveniently share customer profile codes and other information operable to decode the customer profile codes with third parties.

Transforming customer data into customer profile codes leads to greater efficiencies of system . Because customer profile codes represent compressed versions of customer data they can be stored using less memory and communicated using less bandwidth. Further customer profile codes are less susceptible to breach since they are encoded. And because customer profile codes represent satisfied conditions rather than specific customer data customer data of enterprise remains protected.

Modifications additions or omissions may be made to system without departing from the scope of the invention. For example system may include any number of rules engines decision engines and interface engines . As another example decision module may request third party data from an external module. Furthermore the components of system may be integrated or separated. For example rules engine and decision engine may be incorporated into a single component. In another example decision engine and interface engine may be incorporated into a single component.

In the illustrated embodiment of assembly module comprises interface processor and memory . Memory of assembly module includes customer data sources wherein n represents any suitable number. Customer data sources may be associated with customer and may include customer data such as demographic and behavioral data of customer .

In one embodiment as described in greater detail below with respect to customer data may be associated with a particular customer to be authenticated by a third party. In this embodiment a third party may seek to authenticate a particular customer. For example a merchant a bank or a credit card company may be trying to determine whether to offer a credit card to a customer and if so how big of a credit line to associate with the credit card. In this example the third party requests customer data e.g. annual salary employment status monthly deposits into account interruptions to automatic deposit annual spend etc. for this particular customer to inform its decision of whether and how much credit to offer to the customer based on the received customer data . In another example a third party may be attempting to verify the identity of a particular customer with whom it is interacting. In this example the third party requests customer identification information from the customer and customer data e.g. demographic information account information other identifying data from the enterprise. If the customer identification information from the customer matches the customer data received from the enterprise then the customer s identity is verified. Each of these examples is generally referred to as authenticating a customer . The customer data provided in either or both of the above examples can fall into a specific range e.g. annual salary of customer is between 50 000 and 99 999 or be a specific value or statement e.g. customer is unemployed .

In another embodiment as described in greater detail below with respect to customer data may be associated with one or more customers in a particular geographical region such as in a particular one or more cities or zip codes. In this embodiment the customer data may be associated with particular customers in the geographic region may be aggregated for all customers in the geographic region or may be aggregated for a subset of customers in the geographic region where that subset of customers share certain common characteristics e.g. common demographic information or common behavioral information . A third party that requests this customer data specific to a particular geographic area may then use it to analyze the potential of providing goods and services in that geographical area. In one embodiment a third party merchant may use this information to determine which additional geographic markets it should or should not enter or which targeted goods or services to offer in a particular existing geographic market.

For example a high end grocery chain can request and analyze customer data to determine the shopping habits and trends of its targeted demographic customers in a particular city or zip code to determine whether or not to open a new store in that geographical area. In another example the high end grocery chain may analyze customer data to determine that it should market and sell more or less of a particular good or service in a particular one of its stores based on the shopping habits or trends of its targeted demographic customers in that geographical area. In still another example a healthcare organization may request and analyze the medical payment history or medication purchase information for a targeted demographic of customers to determine whether or not to open a doctor s office or offer particular health goods or services e.g. using SKU level data in a particular geographical area. The healthcare company can also use customer data to set up their business in a new geographic area by determining their competitors pricing structure in that area. These examples are non limiting and provided to explain the underlying methodology for how customer data can be used to analyze opportunities in a particular geographic area.

In still another embodiment as described in greater detail below with respect to customer data may be associated with a particular set of customers associated with a particular third party. For example a third party merchant may seek information for a set of its existing customers or a set of potential customers for its goods and services. This third party merchant may then use the customer data for these customers to determine their operations history e.g. where that set of customers spends money to purchase goods and services how much money that set of customers spends on goods and services elsewhere the frequency of spending for that set of customers etc. . The third party merchant can then use this information to target those locations for its own sales and marketing. In one embodiment if a first merchant determines that its customers are spending a lot of money purchasing goods and services at a second merchant whether online or brick and mortar then that first merchant can target its marketing activities in conjunction with the second merchant and vice versa.

For example a high end grocery chain can use customer data to determine that its existing or potential customers are spending their disposable income at nearby golf courses and movie theaters and purchasing gas at particular gas stations. The grocery chain can analyze this customer data to then perform targeted marketing e.g. advertising coupons joint promotions and the like in those places where its existing or potential customers are otherwise spending their money. In these examples the customer data may be aggregated over a subset of customers sharing particular demographic information or other characteristics. These examples are non limiting and provided to explain the underlying methodology for how customer data can be used to determine an operations history for customers which includes where the customer spends money how much how frequently and other associated trends.

For example assembly module and rules engine may be incorporated into a single component. In another example rules engine and decision engine may be incorporated into a single component.

At step interface of decision engine receives third party data associated with a request for customer information from external module . Third party data is information that can be used to identify a customer such as an address telephone number social security number or bank account number. Decision engine determines whether customer identifier matches third party data at step .

If customer identifier matches third party data the method proceeds to step . At step interface of decision engine communicates customer profile code to third party at a communication time period. For example if customer identifier of customer is represented as account number ABCXYZ and third party data is represented as account number ABCXYZ then customer identifier matches third party data and interface communicates customer s profile code to third party . Interface of decision engine may communicate a plurality of customer profile codes simultaneously or decision engine may transmit each customer profile code separately to third party . In certain embodiments interface of decision engine may communicate updated customer profile codes to third party . In some instances decision engine may communicate customer profile codes via an API. The communication time period indicates a time or periodicity to communicate the data. The communication time period can be a fixed time period a variable time period a time period that occurs when network resource usage is at a low period or any indication of when interface of decision engine should communicate customer profile code .

If decision engine determines customer identifier does not match third party data at step then decision engine does not communicate customer profile code to third party . In some embodiments processor of decision engine generates a data report. For example the data report may state that the third party data did not match customer identifiers . In some embodiments interface of decision engine may communicate the data report to third party . The data report may include information such as the number of requests for customer information communicated to decision engine within a period of time the number of requests processed by decision engine within a period of time or the number of matches or non matches generated by decision engine .

Modifications additions or omissions may be made to the method depicted in . The method may include more fewer or other steps. For example if customer identifier matches third party data interface of decision engine may communicate one or more rules to third party . As another example if customer identifier matches third party data interface of decision engine may communicate code segments to third party to facilitate decoding of customer profile code . As yet another example steps may be performed in parallel or in any suitable order. Further any suitable component of system may perform one or more steps of the method.

At step decision engine retrieves customer data associated with the service level determined at step . At step rules engine applies the rules to this customer data to transform the customer data into code segments as described above. At step rules engine generates a customer profile code based on the code segments generated at step . Interface communicates the customer profile code to the third party at step and execution terminates at step .

Upon transforming the code segments into customer data external module determines whether the customer is authentic at step . For example external module may receive a customer s financial information to determine whether to extend a line of credit to customer .
