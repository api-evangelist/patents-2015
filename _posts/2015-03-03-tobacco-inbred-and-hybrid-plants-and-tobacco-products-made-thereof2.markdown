The present disclosure provides tobacco inbred plants NC174 SRC CMS NC174 SRC NC821 11 SRC NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC NC645 Bmr Bmr SRC and hybrids NC 5 SRC and NC 8 SRC.

The present disclosure also includes progenies of the provided plants including hybrids.

Tobacco L. is an important commercial crop in the United States as well as in other countries. In tobacco plants N demethylation of nicotine results in nornicotine a secondary alkaloid known to be a precursor for formation of N Nitrosonornicotine NNN in cured leaves. NNN is an undesired component of cured leaves.

The predominant alkaloid found in commercial tobacco varieties is nicotine typically accounting for 90 95 of the total alkaloid pool. The remaining alkaloid fraction is comprised primarily of three additional pyridine alkaloids nornicotine anabasine and anatabine. Nornicotine is generated directly from nicotine through the activity of the enzyme nicotine N demethylase. Nornicotine usually represents less than 5 of the total pyridine alkaloid pool but through a process termed conversion tobacco plants that initially produce very low amounts of nornicotine give rise to progeny that metabolically convert a large percentage of leaf nicotine to nornicotine. In tobacco plants that have genetically converted termed converters the great majority of nornicotine production occurs during the senescence and curing of the mature leaf Wernsman and Matzinger 1968 12 226 228 . Burley tobaccos are particularly prone to genetic conversion with rates as high as 20 per generation observed in some cultivars.

During the curing and processing of the tobacco leaf a portion of the nornicotine is metabolized to the compound NNN a tobacco specific nitrosamine TSNA that has been asserted to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals Hecht and Hoffmann 1990 8 273 294 Hoffmann et al. 1994 41 1 52 Hecht 1998 11 559 603 . In flue cured tobaccos TSNAs are found to be predominantly formed through the reaction of alkaloids with the minute amounts of nitrogen oxides present in combustion gases formed by the direct fired heating systems found in traditional curing barns Peele and Gentry 1999 Formation of Tobacco specific Nitrosamines in Flue cured Tobacco CORESTA Meeting Agro Phyto Groups Suzhou China . Retrofitting these curing barns with heat exchangers virtually eliminated the mixing of combustion gases with the curing air and dramatically reduced the formation of TSNAs in tobaccos cured in this manner Boyette and Hamm 2001 27 17 22. . In contrast in the air cured Burley tobaccos TSNA formation proceeds primarily through reaction of tobacco alkaloids with nitrite a process catalyzed by leaf borne microbes Bush et al. 2001 27 23 46 . Thus far attempts to reduce TSNAs through modification of curing conditions while maintaining acceptable quality standards have not proven to be successful for the air cured tobaccos.

 Introducing in the context of a polynucleotide sequence e.g. a recombinant polynucleotide and or expression cassette of the disclosure means presenting a polynucleotide sequence to the plant plant part and or plant cell in such a manner that the polynucleotide sequence gains access to the interior of a cell. Where more than one polynucleotide sequence is to be introduced these polynucleotide sequences can be assembled as part of a single polynucleotide or nucleic acid construct or as separate polynucleotide or nucleic acid constructs and can be located on the same or different transformation vectors. Accordingly these polynucleotides can be introduced into plant cells in a single transformation event in separate transformation events or e.g. as part of a breeding protocol. Thus the term transformation as used herein refers to the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid into a cell. Transformation of a cell may be stable or transient. Thus in some embodiments a plant cell plant part or plant of this disclosure can be stably transformed with a recombinant polynucleotide of the disclosure. In other embodiments a plant cell plant part or plant of this disclosure can be transiently transformed with a recombinant polynucleotide of the disclosure.

In one aspect the present disclosure provides tobacco cultivars and parts thereof from NC174 SRC representative sample seeds of this cultivar having been deposited with the ATCC under ATCC Accession No. PTA 121048. In another aspect the present disclosure provides a tobacco plant or part thereof produced by growing a seed of NC174 SRC. In a further aspect a plant of the present disclosure can include a plant with all or essentially all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of cultivar NC174 SRC.

While not being limited by process NC174 SRC is a result of the introduction of three mutated CYP82E genes in a burley tobacco cultivar NC174. The three genes are a mutated CYP82E4 gene recited as 325 6 775 in Lewis et al. Three nicotine demethylase genes mediate nornicotine biosynthesis in L. Functional characterization of the CYP82E10 gene 71 2010 1988 1998 SEQ ID NO 1 which sets forth a cyp82e4 W329Stop hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety a mutated CYP82E5v2 recited in Lewis et al. supra as 325 6 1 13 SEQ ID NO 2 which sets forth a cyp82e5v2 W422Stop hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and a mutated CYP82E10 recited in Lewis et al. supra as 325 6 1041 SEQ ID NO 11 which sets forth a cyp82e10 P381S hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . Mutations cyp82e4 W329Stop and cyp82e5v2 W422Stop result in truncated proteins while cyp82E10 P381S results in a nonfunctional protein. A cyp82e4 W329Stop e4 a cyp82e5v2 W422Stop e5 and a cyp82e10 P381S e10 mutation are introduced from a e4e4 e5e5 e10e10 triple mutant from a strong converter burley background line DH98 325 6 as listed in Table 4 of Lewis et al. supra into a burley tobacco cultivar NC174 background.

NC174 SRC is the result of seven backcrosses with burley cultivar NC174 as the recurrent parent followed by two rounds of selfing with selection for homozygosity for the cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S mutations to yield BCFplants NC174 SRC in which the wild type CYP82E4 CYP82E5v2 and CYP82E10 alleles of NC174 are replaced by the mutant e.g. cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles.

NC174 SRC progeny plants have genetic backgrounds that are at least 95 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 similar to NC174. NC174 SRC plants exhibit low nornicotine levels and produce leaves with reduced potential for accumulating derived NNN during curing storage and smoking.

In other aspects the present disclosure also provides tobacco cultivars and parts thereof from CMS NC174 SRC representative sample seeds of this cultivar having been deposited with the ATCC under ATCC Accession No. PTA 121069. In further aspects the present disclosure provides a tobacco plant or part thereof produced by growing a seed of CMS NC174 SRC. In still further aspects the plant of the present disclosure can include a plant with all or essentially all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of cultivar CMS NC174 SRC. CMS NC174 SRC is a male sterile CMS version of NC174 CMS NC174 SRC produced by crossing a plant of CMS NC174 as a female with pollen of NC174 SRC BCFto produce male sterile plants heterozygous for all three mutations. The CMS progeny plants of the CMS NC174 NC174 SRC BCFcross are male sterile. A plurality of CMS NC174 NC174 SRC BCF CMS plants e.g. CMS Fprogeny plants are screened for the cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S mutations to identify plants heterozygous for all three mutations. A single male sterile plant resulting from this cross is backcrossed as a female to NC174 SRC to prepare BCFCMS progeny. BCFCMS progeny homozygous for the cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S mutations are identified by genotyping and designated as CMS NC174 SRC. Because the CMS NC174 SRC line is male sterile it is maintained via pollination with NC174 SRC. NC174 SRC is crossed as the male parent to CMS NC174 SRC to prepare CMS NC174 SRC Fprogeny plants.

CMS NC174 SRC and CMS NC174 SRC Fprogeny plants have genetic backgrounds that are at least 95 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 similar to NC174. CMS NC174 SRC and CMS NC174 SRC Fprogeny plants exhibit low nornicotine levels and produce leaves with reduced potential for accumulating derived NNN during curing storage and smoking.

In some aspects the present disclosure provides tobacco cultivars and parts thereof from NC821 11 SRC where representative sample seeds of this cultivar have been deposited with the ATCC under ATCC Accession No. PTA 121050. In other aspects the present disclosure provides a tobacco plant or part thereof produced by growing a seed of NC821 11 SRC. In still further aspects a plant of the present disclosure can include a plant with all or essentially all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of cultivar NC821 11 SRC. While not being limited by process NC821 11 SRC is a result of introducing the cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S mutations from DH98 325 6. Findividuals originating from a cross between NC821 11 and DH98 325 6 and heterozygous for each mutation are then backcrossed seven times to NC821 11 to produce BCFprogeny. BCFindividuals heterozygous for all three mutations are self pollinated to produce BCFseed and individuals homozygous for all three mutations identified. A single BCFplant is self pollinated to produce BCF NC821 11 SRC in which the wild type CYP82E4 CYP82E5v2 and CYP82E10 alleles of NC821 11 are replaced by the mutant e.g. cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S .

NC821 11 SRC has a genetic background that is at least 95 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 similar to NC821 11. NC821 11 SRC exhibits low nornicotine levels and produce leaves with reduced potential for accumulating derived NNN during curing storage and smoking.

In another aspect the present disclosure provides a tobacco plant or part thereof produced by growing the seed of NC 5 SRC. In a further aspect a plant of the present disclosure can include a plant with all or essentially all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of cultivar NC 5 SRC.

While not being limited by process NC 5 SRC is produced by pollinating plants of CMS NC174 SRC with pollen of NC821 11 SRC. Again not limited by any particular scientific theory cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S mutations all encode for proteins with reduced or eliminated ability to convert nicotine to nornicotine. NC 5 SRC has a genetic background that is at least 95 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 similar to burley tobacco cultivar NC 5 LC a hybrid generated by pollinating plants of a male sterile breeding line CMS NC174 with pollen produced by fertile breeding line NC821 11. NC 5 SRC exhibits low nornicotine and is not subject to conversion to high nornicotine.

The CMS progeny plants of the CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC BCFcross are male sterile. A plurality of CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC BCF CMS plants e.g. CMS Fprogeny plants are screened for the cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S mutations to identify plants heterozygous for all three mutations and for DNA markers linked to Bmr. A single male sterile plant resulting from this cross is backcrossed as a female to NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC to prepare BCFCMS progeny. BCFCMS progeny homozygous for the cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S mutations and the Bmr blue mold resistance locus are identified by genotyping and designated as CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC. Because the CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC line is male sterile it is maintained via pollination with NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC. NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC is crossed as the male parent to CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC to prepare CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC Fprogeny plants.

CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC and CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC Fprogeny plants have genetic backgrounds that are at least 95 at least 97 at least 98 or at least 99 similar to NC775 Bmr Bmr. CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC and CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC Fprogeny plants exhibit low nornicotine levels and produce leaves with reduced potential for accumulating derived NNN during curing storage and smoking.

Thus in some aspects an F F F or later generation tobacco plant containing the cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles is crossed with a second plant and progeny of the cross are identified in which the cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles are present. It will be appreciated that the second plant can be NC174 CMS NC174 NC821 11 NC775 Bmr Bmr CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr NC645 Bmr Bmr or any other species or line optionally with an additional desirable trait such as herbicide resistance.

In still other aspects methods of the present disclosure further include self pollinating or pollinating a male sterile pollen acceptor with a pollen donor capable of being used in production of a progeny plant of the present disclosure such as a male sterile hybrid of the present disclosure. Either the male sterile pollen acceptor plant or the pollen donor plant has at least one mutant allele two or even three mutant alleles at a nicotine demethylase locus such as the cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles. In an aspect all three alleles at each nicotine demethylase locus are mutant alleles making the plant homozygous for cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S.

Breeding can be carried out via any known procedures. DNA fingerprinting SNP or similar technologies may be used in a marker assisted selection MAS breeding program to transfer or breed mutant alleles of a nicotine demethylase gene into other tobaccos. For example a breeder can create segregating populations from hybridizations of a genotype containing cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles with an agronomically desirable genotype. Plants in the For backcross generations can be screened using a marker developed from cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop or cyp82e10 P381S alleles or a fragment thereof using one of the techniques known in the art or disclosed herein. Plants identified as possessing one or more cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles can be backcrossed or self pollinated to create a second population to be screened. Depending on the expected inheritance pattern or the MAS technology used it may be necessary to self pollinate the selected plants before each cycle of backcrossing to aid identification of the desired individual plants. Backcrossing or other breeding procedure can be repeated until the desired phenotype of the recurrent parent is recovered. A recurrent parent in the present disclosure can be NC174 SRC CMS NC174 SRC NC821 11 SRC NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC NC645 Bmr Bmr SRC NC 5 SRC or NC 8 SRC. Other breeding techniques can be found for example in Wernsman E. A. and Rufty R. C. 1987. Chapter Seventeen. Tobacco. pages 669 698 In Cultivar Development. Crop Species. W. H. Fehr ed. MacMillan Publishing Go. Inc. New York N.Y. incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The result of a plant breeding program using the mutant tobacco plants described herein includes useful lines cultivars varieties progeny inbreds and hybrids. As used herein the term cultivar or variety refers to a population of plants that share constant characteristics which separate them from other plants of the same species. A cultivar or variety is often although not always sold commercially. While possessing one or more distinctive traits a cultivar or variety is further characterized by a very small overall variation between individuals within that cultivar or variety. A pure line variety may be created by several generations of self pollination and selection or vegetative propagation from a single parent using tissue or cell culture techniques. A cultivar or variety can be essentially derived from another cultivar line or variety. As defined by the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants Dec. 2 1961 as revised at Geneva on Nov. 10 1972 on Oct. 23 1978 and on Mar. 19 1991 a cultivar or variety is essentially derived from an initial cultivar or variety if a it is predominantly derived from the initial cultivar or variety or from a cultivar or variety that is predominantly derived from the initial cultivar or variety while retaining the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial cultivar or variety b it is clearly distinguishable from the initial cultivar or variety and c except for the differences which result from the act of derivation it conforms to the initial cultivar or variety in the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial cultivar or variety. Essentially derived varieties can be obtained for example by the selection of a natural or induced mutant a somaclonal variant a variant individual from plants of the initial cultivar or variety backcrossing or transformation. A line as distinguished from a cultivar or variety most often denotes a group of plants used non commercially for example in plant research. A line typically displays little overall variation between individuals for one or more traits of interest although there may be some variation between individuals for other traits.

Hybrid tobacco varieties can be produced by preventing self pollination of female parent plants i.e. seed parents of a first variety permitting pollen from male parent plants of a second variety to fertilize the female parent plants and allowing Fhybrid seeds to form on the female plants. Self pollination of female plants can be prevented by emasculating the flowers at an early stage of flower development. Alternatively pollen formation can be prevented on the female parent plants using a form of male sterility. For example male sterility can be produced by cytoplasmic male sterility CMS or transgenic male sterility wherein a transgene inhibits microsporogenesis and or pollen formation or self incompatibility. Female parent plants containing CMS are particularly useful. In aspects in which the female parent plants are CMS pollen may be harvested from male fertile plants and applied manually to the stigmas of CMS female parent plants and the resulting Fseed is harvested.

Plants can be used to form single cross tobacco Fhybrids. In such an aspect the plants of the parent varieties can be grown as substantially homogeneous adjoining populations to facilitate natural cross pollination from the male parent plants to the female parent plants. The Fseed formed on the female parent plants is selectively harvested by conventional means. One also can grow the two parent plant varieties in bulk and harvest a blend of Fhybrid seed formed on the female parent and seed formed upon the male parent as the result of self pollination. Alternatively three way crosses can be carried out wherein a single cross Fhybrid is used as a female parent and is crossed with a different male parent. As another alternative double cross hybrids can be created wherein the Fprogeny of two different single crosses are themselves crossed. Self incompatibility can be used to particular advantage to prevent self pollination of female parents when forming a double cross hybrid.

Successful crosses yield Fplants that are fertile have cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles and can be backcrossed with one of the parents such as NC174 SRC CMS NC174 SRC NC821 11 SRC NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC NC645 Bmr Bmr SRC NC 5 SRC or NC 8 SRC if desired. In some aspects a plant population in the Fgeneration is screened for cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles. Selected plants can be crossed with one of the parents and the first backcross BC1 generation plants are self pollinated to produce a BC1 Fpopulation that is again screened for variant nicotine demethylase gene expression e.g. the null version of the nicotine demethylase gene . The process of backcrossing self pollination and screening is repeated for example at least four times until the final screening produces a plant that is fertile and reasonably similar to the recurrent parent. This plant if desired is self pollinated and the progeny are subsequently screened again to confirm that the plant exhibits the same low nicotine conversion phenotype as NC174 SRC CMS NC174 SRC NC821 11 SRC NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC CMS NC775 Bmr Bmr SRC NC645 Bmr Bmr SRC NC 5 SRC NC 8 SRC. Breeder s seed of the selected plant is produced using standard methods including for example field testing confirmation of the null condition for nicotine demethylase chemical analyses of cured leaf to determine the level of alkaloids and or chemical analyses of cured leaf to determine the ratio of nornicotine to nicotine nornicotine.

NC174 SRC is a backcross derived version of burley tobacco cultivar NC174 carrying introduced mutations in three genes CYP82E4 SEQ ID NO 5 CYP82E5 SEQ ID NO 8 and CYP82E10 SEQ ID NO 9 previously documented to encode for nicotine demethylase enzymes Lewis et al. 2010 . The introduced mutations in CYP82E4 cyp82e4 W329Stop SEQ ID NO 1 and CYP82E5 cyp82e5v2 W422Stop SEQ ID NO 2 encode for premature stop codons which render the genes non functional. The introduced mutation in CYP82E10 cyp82e10 P381S SEQ ID NO 11 does not encode for a premature stop codon but does render the gene product non functional for converting nicotine to nornicotine Lewis et al. 2010 . When in homozygous condition the three mutations result in tobacco plants with 1 reduced genetic capacity to demethylate nicotine to form nornicotine and 2 a corresponding diminished potential to accumulate N nitrosonornicotine NNN a potent carcinogen found in many tobacco products. The mutation in CYP82E4 cyp82e4 W329Stop SEQ ID NO 1 also provides phenotypic stability for the nicotine conversion trait and eliminates the requirement to utilize the cumbersome LC method for reducing levels of nornicotine in tobacco cultivars.

The original tobacco cultivar NC174 is a fertile inbred line. CMS NC174 is a cytoplasmic male sterile version of NC174. To develop NC174 SRC an individual plant of NC174 is pollinated with a plant of the genetic background DH98 325 6 carrying mutations in each of the three nicotine demethylase genes. Findividuals originating from this cross and heterozygous for each mutation are backcrossed to the recurrent parent NC174 to produce BCFprogeny. BCFprogeny are screened using genotyping methodologies to identify individuals heterozygous for all three mutations. A single triple heterozygous BCFplant is backcrossed to NC174 to produce BCFprogeny. The process of backcrossing and identification of individuals heterozygous for all three mutations is repeated through the BCF BCF BCF BCF and BCFstages. At the BCFstage individuals heterozygous for all three mutations from each pedigree are self pollinated to produce BCFseed. A large number of BCFprogeny from each pedigree are genotyped to identify individuals homozygous for all three mutations. A single BCFplant homozygous for all three mutations is self pollinated to produce a BCFfamily NC174 SRC in which the wild type CYP82E4 CYP82E5v2 and CYP82E10 alleles of NC174 were replaced by the mutant alleles cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S .

The male sterile CMS version of NC174 SRC CMS NC174 SRC is produced by crossing a plant of CMS NC174 as a female with pollen of NC174 SRC to produce male sterile plants heterozygous for all three mutations. A single male sterile plant resulting from this cross is then subsequently backcrossed as a female to NC174 SRC to produce progeny that are segregating for individuals homozygous for all three mutations. Triple homozygous individuals are identified by DNA genotyping to produce the CMS NC174 SRC line. Because the line is male sterile it is maintained via pollination with NC174 SRC.

NC174 SRC is evaluated for cured leaf chemistry yield and physical quality at two North Carolina field research locations during 2013 Reidsville and Waynesville . NC174 is included for comparison. The experimental design at each location is a randomized complete block design with four replications. Experimental units are single 20 plant plots. Plots are harvested and air cured. Plot weights are used to determine per acre yields. Cured leaf is evaluated by a former USDA tobacco grader. Fifty gram composite leaf samples are collected from each plot and analyzed for percent nicotine nornicotine anatabine anabasine and percent nicotine conversion using gas chromatography equipment.

Comparisons using the least significant difference LSD test indicates that NC174 SRC has lower levels of nornicotine and percent nicotine conversion relative to NC174 Table 1 . NC174 and NC174 SRC are not significantly different from each other for percent nicotine but are significantly different for yield and cured leaf quality indices.

NC821 11 SRC is a backcross derived version of burley tobacco cultivar NC821 11 carrying introduced null mutations in three genes CYP82E4 SEQ ID NO 5 CYP82E5 SEQ ID NO 8 and CYP82E10 SEQ ID NO 9 previously documented to encode for nicotine demethylase enzymes Lewis et al. 71 2010 1988 1998 . The introduced mutations in CYP82E4 cyp82e4 W329Stop SEQ ID NO 1 and CYP82E5 cyp82e5v2 W422Stop SEQ ID NO 2 encode for premature stop codons which render the genes non functional. The introduced mutation in CYP82E10 cyp82e10 P381S SEQ ID NO 11 does not encode for a premature stop codon but does render the gene product non functional for converting nicotine to nornicotine Id. . When in homozygous condition the three mutations result in tobacco plants with 1 reduced genetic capacity to demethylate nicotine to form nornicotine and 2 a corresponding diminished potential to accumulate N nitrosonornicotine NNN a potent carcinogen found in many tobacco products. The mutation in CYP82E4 cyp82e4 W329Stop SEQ ID NO 1 also provides phenotypic stability for the nicotine conversion trait and eliminates the requirement to utilize the cumbersome LC method for reducing levels of nornicotine in tobacco cultivars see e.g. Jack et al. 2007.
