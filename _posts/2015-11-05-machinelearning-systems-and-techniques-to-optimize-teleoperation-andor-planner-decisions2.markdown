title: Machine-learning systems and techniques to optimize teleoperation and/or planner decisions
abstract: A system, an apparatus or a process may be configured to implement an application that applies artificial intelligence and/or machine-learning techniques to predict an optimal course of action (or a subset of courses of action) for an autonomous vehicle system (e.g., one or more of a planner of an autonomous vehicle, a simulator, or a teleoperator) to undertake based on suboptimal autonomous vehicle performance and/or changes in detected sensor data (e.g., new buildings, landmarks, potholes, etc.). The application may determine a subset of trajectories based on a number of decisions and interactions when resolving an anomaly due to an event or condition. The application may use aggregated sensor data from multiple autonomous vehicles to assist in identifying events or conditions that might affect travel (e.g., using semantic scene classification). An optimal subset of trajectories may be formed based on recommendations responsive to semantic changes (e.g., road construction).

Various embodiments relate generally to autonomous vehicles and associated mechanical electrical and electronic hardware computer software and systems and wired and wireless network communications to provide automated decision selection and execution in autonomous vehicles.

Environments in which an autonomous vehicle may be tasked to navigate in may change over time due to changes in patterns of use e.g. by pedestrians road infrastructure e.g. traffic signs traffic lights road markings etc. road conditions e.g. road construction a lane closure potholes an obstruction on a road surface etc. . Changes in road conditions such as lane closures potholes and the like may require the autonomous vehicle to take appropriate actions to alter an initial guided path to a revised guided path. However detecting events that may give rise to the need to implement a change may not be effective if the autonomous vehicle is not configured to predict a course of action to take based on a newly detected event. Moreover information associated with an event and responses taken by the autonomous vehicle in response to the event may not benefit other autonomous vehicles that may also encounter a similar event unless the information and or response is disseminated to the other autonomous vehicles.

Thus what is needed is a solution to implement event detection that predicts optimal courses of action responsive to the event without the limitations of conventional techniques.

Although the above described drawings depict various examples of the invention the invention is not limited by the depicted examples. It is to be understood that in the drawings like reference numerals designate like structural elements. Also it is understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale.

Various embodiments or examples may be implemented in numerous ways including as a system a process an apparatus a user interface or a series of program instructions on a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network where the program instructions are sent over optical electronic or wireless communication links. In general operations of disclosed processes may be performed in an arbitrary order unless otherwise provided in the claims.

A detailed description of one or more examples is provided below along with accompanying figures. The detailed description is provided in connection with such examples but is not limited to any particular example. The scope is limited only by the claims and numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents thereof. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the described techniques may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For clarity technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the examples has not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description.

According to some examples at least some of autonomous vehicles to are configured as bidirectional autonomous vehicles such as bidirectional autonomous vehicle AV . Bidirectional autonomous vehicle may be configured to travel in either direction principally along but not limited to a longitudinal axis . Accordingly bidirectional autonomous vehicle may be configured to implement active lighting external to the vehicle to alert others e.g. other drivers pedestrians cyclists etc. in the adjacent vicinity and a direction in which bidirectional autonomous vehicle is traveling. For example active sources of light may be implemented as active lights when traveling in a first direction or may be implemented as active lights when traveling in a second direction. Active lights may be implemented using a first subset of one or more colors with optional animation e.g. light patterns of variable intensities of light or color that may change over time . Similarly active lights may be implemented using a second subset of one or more colors and light patterns that may be different than those of active lights . For example active lights may be implemented using white colored lights as headlights whereas active lights may be implemented using red colored lights as taillights. Active lights and or portions thereof may be configured to provide other light related functionalities such as provide turn signal indication functions e.g. using yellow light . According to various examples logic in autonomous vehicle may be configured to adapt active lights and to comply with various safety requirements and traffic regulations or laws for any number of jurisdictions.

In some embodiments bidirectional autonomous vehicle may be configured to have similar structural elements and components in each quad portion such as quad portion . The quad portions are depicted at least in this example as portions of bidirectional autonomous vehicle defined by the intersection of a plane and a plane both of which pass through the vehicle to form two similar halves on each side of planes and . Further bidirectional autonomous vehicle may include an autonomous vehicle controller that includes logic e.g. hardware or software or as combination thereof that is configured to control a predominate number of vehicle functions including driving control e.g. propulsion steering etc. and active sources of light among other functions. Bidirectional autonomous vehicle also includes a number of sensors disposed at various locations on the vehicle other sensors are not shown .

Autonomous vehicle controller may be further configured to determine a local pose e.g. local position of an autonomous vehicle and to detect external objects relative to the vehicle. For example consider that bidirectional autonomous vehicle is traveling in the direction in road network . A localizer not shown of autonomous vehicle controller can determine a local pose at the geographic location . As such the localizer may use acquired sensor data such as sensor data associated with surfaces of buildings and which can be compared against reference data such as map data e.g. 3D map data including reflectance data to determine a local pose. Further a perception engine not shown of autonomous vehicle controller may be configured to detect classify and predict the behavior of external objects such as external object a tree and external object a pedestrian . Classification of such external objects may broadly classify objects as static objects such as external object and dynamic objects such as external object . The localizer and the perception engine as well as other components of the AV controller collaborate to cause autonomous vehicles to drive autonomously.

According to some examples autonomous vehicle service platform is configured to provide teleoperator services should an autonomous vehicle request teleoperation. For example consider that an autonomous vehicle controller in autonomous vehicle detects an object obscuring a path on roadway at point as depicted in inset . If autonomous vehicle controller cannot ascertain a path or trajectory over which vehicle may safely transit with a relatively high degree of certainty then autonomous vehicle controller may transmit request message for teleoperation services. In response a teleoperator computing device may receive instructions from a teleoperator to perform a course of action to successfully and safely negotiate obstacles . Response data then can be transmitted back to autonomous vehicle to cause the vehicle to for example safely cross a set of double lines as it transits along the alternate path . In some examples teleoperator computing device may generate a response identifying geographic areas to exclude from planning a path. In particular rather than provide a path to follow a teleoperator may define areas or locations that the autonomous vehicle must avoid.

In view of the foregoing the structures and or functionalities of autonomous vehicle and or autonomous vehicle controller as well as their components can perform real time or near real time trajectory calculations through autonomous related operations such as localization and perception to enable autonomous vehicles to self drive.

In some cases the bidirectional nature of bidirectional autonomous vehicle provides for a vehicle that has quad portions or any other number of symmetric portions that are similar or are substantially similar to each other. Such symmetry reduces complexity of design and decreases relatively the number of unique components or structures thereby reducing inventory and manufacturing complexities. For example a drivetrain and wheel system may be disposed in any of the quad portions . Further autonomous vehicle controller is configured to invoke teleoperation services to reduce the likelihood that an autonomous vehicle is delayed in transit while resolving an event or issue that may otherwise affect the safety of the occupants. In some cases the visible portion of road network depicts a geo fenced region that may limit or otherwise control the movement of autonomous vehicles to the road network shown in . According to various examples autonomous vehicle and a fleet thereof may be configurable to operate as a level 4 full self driving automation or L4 vehicle that can provide transportation on demand with the convenience and privacy of point to point personal mobility while providing the efficiency of shared vehicles. In some examples autonomous vehicle or any autonomous vehicle described herein may be configured to omit a steering wheel or any other mechanical means of providing manual i.e. human controlled steering for autonomous vehicle . Further autonomous vehicle or any autonomous vehicle described herein may be configured to omit a seat or location reserved within the vehicle for an occupant to engage a steering wheel.

At data representing a subset of candidate trajectories may be received from an autonomous vehicle responsive to the detection of the event. For example a planner of an autonomous vehicle controller may calculate and evaluate large numbers of trajectories e.g. thousands or greater per unit time such as a second. In some embodiments candidate trajectories are a subset of the trajectories that provide for relatively higher confidence levels that an autonomous vehicle may move forward safely in view of the event e.g. using an alternate path provided by a teleoperator . Note that some candidate trajectories may be ranked or associated with higher degrees of confidence than other candidate trajectories. According to some examples subsets of candidate trajectories may originate from any number of sources such as a planner a teleoperator computing device e.g. teleoperators can determine and provide approximate paths etc. and may be combined as a superset of candidate trajectories. At path guidance data may be identified at one or more processors. The path guidance data may be configured to assist a teleoperator in selecting a guided trajectory from one or more of the candidate trajectories. In some instances the path guidance data specifies a value indicative of a confidence level or probability that indicates the degree of certainty that a particular candidate trajectory may reduce or negate the probability that the event may impact operation of an autonomous vehicle. A guided trajectory as a selected candidate trajectory may be received at responsive to input from a teleoperator e.g. a teleoperator may select at least one candidate trajectory as a guided trajectory from a group of differently ranked candidate trajectories . The selection may be made via an operator interface that lists a number of candidate trajectories for example in order from highest confidence levels to lowest confidence levels. At the selection of a candidate trajectory as a guided trajectory may be transmitted to the vehicle which in turn implements the guided trajectory for resolving the condition by causing the vehicle to perform a teleoperator specified maneuver. As such the autonomous vehicle may transition from a non normative operational state.

According to some embodiments portions of the autonomous vehicle AV control logic may be implemented using clusters of graphics processing units GPUs implementing a framework and programming model suitable for programming the clusters of GPUs. For example a compute unified device architecture CUDA compatible programming language and application programming interface API model may be used to program the GPUs. CUDA is produced and maintained by NVIDIA of Santa Clara Calif. Note that other programming languages may be implemented such as OpenCL or any other parallel programming language.

According to some embodiments autonomous vehicle control logic may be implemented in hardware and or software as autonomous vehicle controller which is shown to include a motion controller a planner a perception engine and a localizer . As shown autonomous vehicle controller is configured to receive camera data Lidar data and radar data or any other range sensing or localization data including sonar data or the like. Autonomous vehicle controller is also configured to receive positioning data such as GPS data IMU data and other position sensing data e.g. wheel related data such as steering angles angular velocity etc. . Further autonomous vehicle controller may receive any other sensor data as well as reference data . In some cases reference data includes map data e.g. 3D map data 2D map data 4D map data e.g. including Epoch Determination and route data e.g. road network data including but not limited to RNDF data or similar data MDF data or similar data etc.

Localizer is configured to receive sensor data from one or more sources such as GPS data wheel data IMU data Lidar data camera data radar data and the like as well as reference data e.g. 3D map data and route data . Localizer integrates e.g. fuses the sensor data and analyzes the data by comparing sensor data to map data to determine a local pose or position of bidirectional autonomous vehicle . According to some examples localizer may generate or update the pose or position of any autonomous vehicle in real time or near real time. Note that localizer and its functionality need not be limited to bi directional vehicles and can be implemented in any vehicle of any type. Therefore localizer as well as other components of AV controller may be implemented in a unidirectional vehicle or any non autonomous vehicle. According to some embodiments data describing a local pose may include one or more of an x coordinate a y coordinate a z coordinate or any coordinate of any coordinate system including polar or cylindrical coordinate systems or the like a yaw value a roll value a pitch value e.g. an angle value a rate e.g. velocity altitude and the like.

Perception engine is configured to receive sensor data from one or more sources such as Lidar data camera data radar data and the like as well as local pose data. Perception engine may be configured to determine locations of external objects based on sensor data and other data. External objects for instance may be objects that are not part of a drivable surface. For example perception engine may be able to detect and classify external objects as pedestrians bicyclists dogs other vehicles etc. e.g. perception engine is configured to classify the objects in accordance with a type of classification which may be associated with semantic information including a label . Based on the classification of these external objects the external objects may be labeled as dynamic objects or static objects. For example an external object classified as a tree may be labeled as a static object while an external object classified as a pedestrian may be labeled as a static object. External objects labeled as static may or may not be described in map data. Examples of external objects likely to be labeled as static include traffic cones cement barriers arranged across a roadway lane closure signs newly placed mailboxes or trash cans adjacent a roadway etc. Examples of external objects likely to be labeled as dynamic include bicyclists pedestrians animals other vehicles etc. If the external object is labeled as dynamic and further data about the external object may indicate a typical level of activity and velocity as well as behavior patterns associated with the classification type. Further data about the external object may be generated by tracking the external object. As such the classification type can be used to predict or otherwise determine the likelihood that an external object may for example interfere with an autonomous vehicle traveling along a planned path. For example an external object that is classified as a pedestrian may be associated with some maximum speed as well as an average speed e.g. based on tracking data . The velocity of the pedestrian relative to the velocity of an autonomous vehicle can be used to determine if a collision is likely. Further perception engine may determine a level of uncertainty associated with a current and future state of objects. In some examples the level of uncertainty may be expressed as an estimated value or probability .

Planner is configured to receive perception data from perception engine and may also include localizer data from localizer . According to some examples the perception data may include an obstacle map specifying static and dynamic objects located in the vicinity of an autonomous vehicle whereas the localizer data may include a local pose or position. In operation planner generates numerous trajectories and evaluates the trajectories based on at least the location of the autonomous vehicle against relative locations of external dynamic and static objects. Planner selects an optimal trajectory based on a variety of criteria over which to direct the autonomous vehicle in way that provides for collision free travel. In some examples planner may be configured to calculate the trajectories as probabilistically determined trajectories. Further planner may transmit steering and propulsion commands as well as decelerating or braking commands to motion controller . Motion controller subsequently may convert any of the commands such as a steering command a throttle or propulsion command and a braking command into control signals e.g. for application to actuators or other mechanical interfaces to implement changes in steering or wheel angles and or velocity .

Localizer is configured to localize autonomous vehicle i.e. determine a local pose relative to reference data which may include map data route data e.g. road network data such as RNDF like data and the like. In some cases localizer is configured to identify for example a point in space that may represent a location of autonomous vehicle relative to features of a representation of an environment. Localizer is shown to include a sensor data integrator which may be configured to integrate multiple subsets of sensor data e.g. of different sensor modalities to reduce uncertainties related to each individual type of sensor. According to some examples sensor data integrator is configured to fuse sensor data e.g. Lidar data camera data radar data etc. to form integrated sensor data values for determining a local pose. According to some examples localizer retrieves reference data originating from a reference data repository which includes a map data repository for storing 2D map data 3D map data 4D map data and the like. Localizer may be configured to identify at least a subset of features in the environment to match against map data to identify or otherwise confirm a pose of autonomous vehicle . According to some examples localizer may be configured to identify any amount of features in an environment such that a set of features can one or more features or all features. In a specific example any amount of Lidar data e.g. most or substantially all Lidar data may be compared against data representing a map for purposes of localization. Generally non matched objects resulting from the comparison of the environment features and map data may be a dynamic object such as a vehicle bicyclist pedestrian etc. Note that detection of dynamic objects including obstacles may be performed with or without map data. In particular dynamic objects may be detected and tracked independently of map data i.e. in the absence of map data . In some instances 2D map data and 3D map data may be viewed as global map data or map data that has been validated at a point in time by autonomous vehicle service platform . As map data in map data repository may be updated and or validated periodically a deviation may exist between the map data and an actual environment in which the autonomous vehicle is positioned. Therefore localizer may retrieve locally derived map data generated by local map generator to enhance localization. Local map generator is configured to generate local map data in real time or near real time. Optionally local map generator may receive static and dynamic object map data to enhance the accuracy of locally generated maps by for example disregarding dynamic objects in localization. According to at least some embodiments local map generator may be integrated with or formed as part of localizer . In at least one case local map generator either individually or in collaboration with localizer may be configured to generate map and or reference data based on simultaneous localization and mapping SLAM or the like. Note that localizer may implement a hybrid approach to using map data whereby logic in localizer may be configured to select various amounts of map data from either map data repository or local map data from local map generator depending on the degrees of reliability of each source of map data. Therefore localizer may still use out of date map data in view of locally generated map data.

Perception engine is configured to for example assist planner in planning routes and generating trajectories by identifying objects of interest in a surrounding environment in which autonomous vehicle is transiting. Further probabilities may be associated with each of the object of interest whereby a probability may represent a likelihood that an object of interest may be a threat to safe travel e.g. a fast moving motorcycle may require enhanced tracking rather than a person sitting at a bus stop bench while reading a newspaper . As shown perception engine includes an object detector and an object classifier . Object detector is configured to distinguish objects relative to other features in the environment and object classifier may be configured to classify objects as either dynamic or static objects and track the locations of the dynamic and the static objects relative to autonomous vehicle for planning purposes. Further perception engine may be configured to assign an identifier to a static or dynamic object that specifies whether the object is or has the potential to become an obstacle that may impact path planning at planner . Although not shown in note that perception engine may also perform other perception related functions such as segmentation and tracking examples of which are described below.

Planner is configured to generate a number of candidate trajectories for accomplishing a goal to reaching a destination via a number of paths or routes that are available. Trajectory evaluator is configured to evaluate candidate trajectories and identify which subsets of candidate trajectories are associated with higher degrees of confidence levels of providing collision free paths to the destination. As such trajectory evaluator can select an optimal trajectory based on relevant criteria for causing commands to generate control signals for vehicle components e.g. actuators or other mechanisms . Note that the relevant criteria may include any number of factors that define optimal trajectories the selection of which need not be limited to reducing collisions. For example the selection of trajectories may be made to optimize user experience e.g. user comfort as well as collision free trajectories that comply with traffic regulations and laws. User experience may be optimized by moderating accelerations in various linear and angular directions e.g. to reduce jerking like travel or other unpleasant motion . In some cases at least a portion of the relevant criteria can specify which of the other criteria to override or supersede while maintain optimized collision free travel. For example legal restrictions may be temporarily lifted or deemphasized when generating trajectories in limited situations e.g. crossing double yellow lines to go around a cyclist or travelling at higher speeds than the posted speed limit to match traffic flows . As such the control signals are configured to cause propulsion and directional changes at the drivetrain and or wheels. In this example motion controller is configured to transform commands into control signals e.g. velocity wheel angles etc. for controlling the mobility of autonomous vehicle . In the event that trajectory evaluator has insufficient information to ensure a confidence level high enough to provide collision free optimized travel planner can generate a request to teleoperator for teleoperator support.

Autonomous vehicle service platform includes teleoperator e.g. a teleoperator computing device reference data repository a map updater a vehicle data controller a calibrator and an off line object classifier . Note that each element of autonomous vehicle service platform may be independently located or distributed and in communication with other elements in autonomous vehicle service platform . Further element of autonomous vehicle service platform may independently communicate with the autonomous vehicle via the communication layer . Map updater is configured to receive map data e.g. from local map generator sensors or any other component of autonomous vehicle controller and is further configured to detect deviations for example of map data in map data repository from a locally generated map. Vehicle data controller can cause map updater to update reference data within repository and facilitate updates to 2D 3D and or 4D map data. In some cases vehicle data controller can control the rate at which local map data is received into autonomous vehicle service platform as well as the frequency at which map updater performs updating of the map data.

Calibrator is configured to perform calibration of various sensors of the same or different types. Calibrator may be configured to determine the relative poses of the sensors e.g. in Cartesian space x y z and orientations of the sensors e.g. roll pitch and yaw . The pose and orientation of a sensor such a camera Lidar sensor radar sensor etc. may be calibrated relative to other sensors as well as globally relative to the vehicle s reference frame. Off line self calibration can also calibrate or estimate other parameters such as vehicle inertial tensor wheel base wheel radius or surface road friction. Calibration can also be done online to detect parameter change according to some examples. Note too that calibration by calibrator may include intrinsic parameters of the sensors e.g. optical distortion beam angles etc. and extrinsic parameters. In some cases calibrator may be performed by maximizing a correlation between depth discontinuities in 3D laser data and edges of image data as an example. Off line object classification is configured to receive data such as sensor data from sensors or any other component of autonomous vehicle controller . According to some embodiments an off line classification pipeline of off line object classification may be configured to pre collect and annotate objects e.g. manually by a human and or automatically using an offline labeling algorithm and may further be configured to train an online classifier e.g. object classifier which can provide real time classification of object types during online autonomous operation.

Teleoperator manager is configured to manage a number of teleoperator computing devices with which teleoperators provide input. Simulator is configured to simulate operation of one or more autonomous vehicles as well as the interactions between teleoperator manager and an autonomous vehicle . Simulator may also simulate operation of a number of sensors including the introduction of simulated noise disposed in autonomous vehicle . Further an environment such as a city may be simulated such that a simulated autonomous vehicle can be introduced to the synthetic environment whereby simulated sensors may receive simulated sensor data such as simulated laser returns. Simulator may provide other functions as well including validating software updates and or map data. Policy manager is configured to maintain data representing policies or rules by which an autonomous vehicle ought to behave in view of a variety of conditions or events that an autonomous vehicle encounters while traveling in a network of roadways. In some cases updated policies and or rules may be simulated in simulator to confirm safe operation of a fleet of autonomous vehicles in view of changes to a policy. Some of the above described elements of autonomous vehicle service platform are further described hereinafter.

Communication channels are configured to provide networked communication links among a fleet of autonomous vehicles and autonomous vehicle service platform . For example communication channel includes a number of different types of networks and with corresponding subnetworks e.g. to to ensure a certain level of redundancy for operating an autonomous vehicle service reliably. For example the different types of networks in communication channels may include different cellular network providers different types of data networks etc. to ensure sufficient bandwidth in the event of reduced or lost communications due to outages in one or more networks and .

An example of a data exchange for facilitating teleoperations via the communications protocol is described as follows. Consider that obstacle data is generated by a perception system of an autonomous vehicle controller. Further planner options data is generated by a planner to notify a teleoperator of a subset of candidate trajectories and position data is generated by the localizer. Obstacle data planner options data and position data are transmitted to a messaging service bridge which in accordance with message service configuration data generates telemetry data and query data both of which are transmitted via data centric messaging bus into teleoperator application as telemetry data and query data . Teleoperator API receives telemetry data and inquiry data which in turn are processed in view of Route data and message service configuration data . The resultant data is subsequently presented to a teleoperator via teleoperator computing device and or a collaborative display e.g. a dashboard display visible to a group of collaborating teleoperators . Teleoperator reviews the candidate trajectory options that are presented on the display of teleoperator computing device and selects a guided trajectory which generates command data and query response data both of which are passed through teleoperator API as query response data and command data . In turn query response data and command data are transmitted via data centric messaging bus into autonomous vehicle application as query response data and command data . Messaging service bridge receives query response data and command data and generates teleoperator command data which is configured to generate a teleoperator selected trajectory for implementation by a planner. Note that the above described messaging processes are not intended to be limiting and other messaging protocols may be implemented as well.

Trajectory evaluator includes a state and event manager which in turn may include a confidence level generator . Trajectory evaluator further includes a guided trajectory generator and a trajectory generator . Further planner is configured to receive policy data perception engine data and localizer data .

Policy data may include criteria with which planner uses to determine a path that has a sufficient confidence level with which to generate trajectories according to some examples. Examples of policy data include policies that specify that trajectory generation is bounded by stand off distances to external objects e.g. maintaining a safety buffer of 3 feet from a cyclist as possible or policies that require that trajectories must not cross a center double yellow line or policies that require trajectories to be limited to a single lane in a 4 lane roadway e.g. based on past events such as typically congregating at a lane closest to a bus stop and any other similar criteria specified by policies. Perception engine data includes maps of locations of static objects and dynamic objects of interest and localizer data includes at least a local pose or position.

State and event manager may be configured to probabilistically determine a state of operation for an autonomous vehicle. For example a first state of operation i.e. normative operation may describe a situation in which trajectories are collision free whereas a second state of operation i.e. non normative operation may describe another situation in which the confidence level associated with possible trajectories are insufficient to guarantee collision free travel. According to some examples state and event manager is configured to use perception data to determine a state of autonomous vehicle that is either normative or non normative. Confidence level generator may be configured to analyze perception data to determine a state for the autonomous vehicle. For example confidence level generator may use semantic information associated with static and dynamic objects as well as associated probabilistic estimations to enhance a degree of certainty that planner is determining safe course of action. For example planner may use perception engine data that specifies a probability that an object is either a person or not a person to determine whether planner is operating safely e.g. planner may receive a degree of certainty that an object has a 98 probability of being a person and a probability of 2 that the object is not a person .

Upon determining a confidence level e.g. based on statistics and probabilistic determinations is below a threshold required for predicted safe operation a relatively low confidence level e.g. single probability score may trigger planner to transmit a request for teleoperation support to autonomous vehicle service platform . In some cases telemetry data and a set of candidate trajectories may accompany the request. Examples of telemetry data include sensor data localization data perception data and the like. A teleoperator may transmit via teleoperator computing device a selected trajectory to guided trajectory generator . As such selected trajectory is a trajectory formed with guidance from a teleoperator. Upon confirming there is no change in the state e.g. a non normative state is pending guided trajectory generator passes data to trajectory generator which in turn causes trajectory tracker as a trajectory tracking controller to use the teleop specified trajectory for generating control signals e.g. steering angles velocity etc. . Note that planner may trigger transmission of a request for teleoperation support prior to a state transitioning to a non normative state. In particular an autonomous vehicle controller and or its components can predict that a distant obstacle may be problematic and preemptively cause planner to invoke teleoperations prior to the autonomous vehicle reaching the obstacle. Otherwise the autonomous vehicle may cause a delay by transitioning to a safe state upon encountering the obstacle or scenario e.g. pulling over and off the roadway . In another example teleoperations may be automatically invoked prior to an autonomous vehicle approaching a particular location that is known to be difficult to navigate. This determination may optionally take into consideration other factors including the time of day the position of the sun if such situation is likely to cause a disturbance to the reliability of sensor readings and traffic or accident data derived from a variety of sources.

In another state of operation e.g. a normative state static map data current and predicted object state data local pose data and plan data e.g. global plan data are received into trajectory calculator which is configured to calculate e.g. iteratively trajectories to determine an optimal one or more paths. Next at least one path is selected and is transmitted as selected path data . According to some embodiments trajectory calculator is configured to implement re planning of trajectories as an example. Nominal driving trajectory generator is configured to generate trajectories in a refined approach such as by generating trajectories based on receding horizon control techniques. Nominal driving trajectory generator subsequently may transmit nominal driving trajectory path data to for example a trajectory tracker or a vehicle controller to implement physical changes in steering acceleration and other components.

Teleoperator action recommendation controller includes logic configured to receive and or control a teleoperation service request via autonomous vehicle AV planner data which can include requests for teleoperator assistance as well as telemetry data and other data. As such planner data may include recommended candidate trajectories or paths from which a teleoperator via teleoperator computing device may select. According to some examples teleoperator action recommendation controller may be configured to access other sources of recommended candidate trajectories from which to select an optimum trajectory. For example candidate trajectories contained in autonomous vehicle planner data may in parallel be introduced into simulator which is configured to simulate an event or condition being experienced by an autonomous vehicle requesting teleoperator assistance. Simulator can access map data and other data necessary for performing a simulation on the set of candidate trajectories whereby simulator need not exhaustively reiterate simulations to confirm sufficiency. Rather simulator may provide either confirm the appropriateness of the candidate trajectories or may otherwise alert a teleoperator to be cautious in their selection.

Teleoperator interaction capture analyzer may be configured to capture numerous amounts of teleoperator transactions or interactions for storage in repository which for example may accumulate data relating to a number of teleoperator transactions for analysis and generation of policies at least in some cases. According to some embodiments repository may also be configured to store policy data for access by policy manager . Further teleoperator interaction capture analyzer may apply machine learning techniques to empirically determine how best to respond to events or conditions causing requests for teleoperation assistance. In some cases policy manager may be configured to update a particular policy or generate a new policy responsive to analyzing the large set of teleoperator interactions e.g. subsequent to applying machine learning techniques . Policy manager manages policies that may be viewed as rules or guidelines with which an autonomous vehicle controller and its components operate under to comply with autonomous operations of a vehicle. In some cases a modified or updated policy may be applied to simulator to confirm the efficacy of permanently releasing or implementing such policy changes.

Simulator interface controller is configured to provide an interface between simulator and teleoperator computing devices . For example consider that sensor data from a fleet of autonomous vehicles is applied to reference data updater via autonomous AV fleet data whereby reference data updater is configured to generate updated map and route data . In some implementations updated map and route data may be preliminarily released as an update to data in map data repositories and or as an update to data in route data repository . In this case such data may be tagged as being a beta version in which a lower threshold for requesting teleoperator service may be implemented when for example a map tile including preliminarily updated information is used by an autonomous vehicle. Further updated map and route data may be introduced to simulator for validating the updated map data. Upon full release e.g. at the close of beta testing the previously lowered threshold for requesting a teleoperator service related to map tiles is canceled. User interface graphics controller provides rich graphics to teleoperators whereby a fleet of autonomous vehicles may be simulated within simulator and may be accessed via teleoperator computing device as if the simulated fleet of autonomous vehicles were real.

Fleet optimization manager is shown to include a hybrid autonomous vehicle non autonomous vehicle processor which in turn includes an AV non AV optimization calculator and a non AV selector .

Further to diagram the planner of autonomous vehicle may have calculated candidate trajectories each having a high confidence level associated with safely navigating autonomous vehicle around the potholes in road surface . The planner may select one of the candidate trajectories for execution by the autonomous vehicle and the selected trajectory is denoted as depicted in heavy line .

Due to the position of the potholes on the road surface the autonomous vehicle may not be able to avoid hitting one or both of the potholes therefore there is a possibility that hitting one or both of the potholes may cause damage to the autonomous vehicle and or affect ride comfort of passengers being transported by the autonomous vehicle . In some examples the selected trajectory may be calculated to allow the autonomous vehicle to continue its transit through region by traveling past the potholes . In other examples the selected trajectory may be calculated to allow the autonomous vehicle to execute a safe stop trajectory to prevent the autonomous vehicle from potentially running over one or both of the potholes and being damaged and or disturbing passengers.

In other examples an external system e.g. a simulator or teleoperator in communication with the autonomous vehicle may compute the alternative candidate trajectories rank the alternative candidate trajectories e.g. ranked in order of confidence level from highest confidence level to lowest confidence level and select one of the alternative candidate trajectories to be executed e.g. alternative candidate trajectory by the autonomous vehicle under control of the planner .

The data representing the telemetry data and or policy data may be received by the policy explorer .

The one or more computer resources may access one or more data repositories and may compare compute correlate or otherwise process data associated with data and one or more of the data repositories to generate updated policy data .

Data repositories need not be internal to the policy explorer and some or all of the data repositories may be accessed from a resource external to the policy explorer . Data repository may include data representative of sensor data map data local pose data telemetry data policy data and other data associated with autonomous vehicles in the of autonomous fleet. Data repository may include processed data and or raw e.g. unprocessed data .

Data repository may include data representative of teleoperations associated with one or more vehicles in the fleet of autonomous vehicles. Data repository may include other data associated with operation of a fleet of autonomous vehicles. Policy explorer may include and or have access to more or fewer data repositories than depicted in diagram for example. Policy explorer may include and or have access to data repositories having other types of data than described above in reference to diagram for example.

The policy explorer may communicate the updated policy data to one or more autonomous vehicles e.g. or other vehicles in the fleet and or to the autonomous vehicle for example. In other examples the updated policy data may be communicated to a teleoperator a simulator or both.

Updated policy data may include one or more candidate trajectories and the one or more candidate trajectories may have the same or different confidence levels associated with each candidate trajectory. Candidate trajectories may be arranged in a predetermined order or rank such as a ranking order based on confidence level e.g. ranked from highest confidence level to lowest confidence level or vice versa .

Updated policy data may include other data being configured to cause a system that receives the data e.g. an autonomous vehicle a simulator a teleoperator to take an action such as implementing a selected one of the one or more candidate trajectories for example. In other examples the other data may be configured to allow the system that receives the data to select based on a criteria e.g. ranking based on highest confidence level one of the one or more candidate trajectories for implementation e.g. to determine which of the one or more candidate trajectories is selected as the selected candidate trajectory . As one example updated policy data may include data being configured to cause candidate trajectory to be selected by the system receiving the updated policy data . As another example updated policy data may include data being configured to cause the autonomous vehicle to decide which of the candidate trajectories to be selected based on a criteria e.g. applied by planner that may be applied to data included in updated policy data such as the above mentioned confidence level associated with each candidate trajectory.

In some examples a selected candidate trajectory e.g. candidate trajectory may be selected based on a policy requiring the selected candidate trajectory having a confidence level predicted to provide a safe trajectory for the autonomous vehicle to navigate based on an event or condition that prompted the updated policy data to be generated. In other examples a selected candidate trajectory e.g. candidate trajectory may be selected based on a policy underlining a preferred customer experience e.g. a smooth ride absent the jolting effects of potholes or other metric associated with operation of the autonomous vehicle e.g. averting potential damage due to an event such as potholes road debris etc. .

In other examples the updated policy data may be received by a system e.g. autonomous vehicle after the event has already occurred and policy data e.g. policy data in place at the time of the event may have been used to determine a selected candidate trajectory e.g. from one or more computed e.g. by planner candidate trajectories . The later received updated policy data may be accessed to implement candidate trajectory determinations at a future time when another event e.g. detection by a sensor system and semantic classification by a perception and or planner of potholes occasions machine learning to consider alternative policy data to avoid or otherwise mitigate the effects of the event on operation of the autonomous vehicle. For example the updated policy data may be accessed by a planner to compute candidate trajectories to compare the candidate trajectories with candidate trajectories and select e.g. based on confidence levels which candidate trajectory to select for guiding the path of the autonomous vehicle. The updated policy data may include data representing rules associated with events or semantic classifications of pothole objects detected along a computed path of an autonomous vehicle and the rule may determine that candidate trajectories be rejected in favor of candidate trajectories because candidate trajectories avoid the possibility of contact with the potholes for example.

At a stage data representing a confidence level associated with the event may be extracted from the policy data. For example the confidence level may be ranked confidence level values associated with candidate trajectories computed by a planner of the autonomous vehicle.

At a stage a state of operation of the autonomous vehicle may be determined based on the confidence level. For example the confidence level extracted at the stage may exceed a range of acceptable confidence levels associated with normative operation of the autonomous vehicle e.g. an optimized path having a computed probability of facilitating collision free travel of the autonomous vehicle complying with traffic laws providing a comfortable user experience or a comfortable user ride . As another example the confidence level extracted at the stage may be indicative of confidence levels associated with non normative operation of the autonomous vehicle due to possible trajectories that are insufficient to guarantee collision free travel of the autonomous vehicle.

At a stage data representing candidate trajectories responsive to the event e.g. trajectories that avoid contact with potholes may be calculated based on the telemetry data and the state of operation of the autonomous vehicle e.g. normative or non normative operation . Each candidate trajectory calculated at the stage may have an associated confidence level.

At a stage updated policy data associated with the event may be generated. The updated policy data may include the candidate trajectories.

At a stage the updated policy data may be communicated e.g. transmitted . As one example the updated policy data may be communicated to a planner of at least one autonomous vehicle e.g. to one or more autonomous vehicles in a fleet of autonomous vehicles . In other examples the updated policy data may be communicated to a teleoperator e.g. being configured to influence path planning and or navigational control in one or more autonomous vehicles . In yet other examples the updated policy data may be communicated to a simulator e.g. configured to simulate an autonomous vehicle in a synthetic environment . In some examples the updated policy data may be communicated to a data store memory e.g. non volatile memory data repository or other data storage system.

One or more of the stages of flow chart may be implemented by a policy explorer e.g. policy explorer of or other system e.g. a planner a teleoperator a simulator . The updated policy data may be communicated using wired e.g. in and or wireless e.g. in communication over one or more data communications networks for example.

Policy explorer may access functionality of physics processor and its associated sub blocks and controller and evaluator for example. Policy explorer may access functionality of correlator to determine correlation between items of data comparator to compare data with other data statistical change point detector and or probabilistic inference calculator to determine confidence intervals. Policy explorer may generate simulated policy data to be simulated in simulator and generate updated policy data based on analysis of simulation results such as confidence levels associated with simulated candidate trajectories. For example updated policy data may be determined at least in part by simulated candidate trajectories having high confidence levels that meet and or exceed a predetermined value e.g. 95 or higher confidence level .

Updated policy data may be communicated e.g. via a communications network to one or more destinations including but not limited to a teleoperator one or more autonomous vehicles and a data repository for example. Teleoperator may generate policy data based on the updated policy data . Teleoperator may generate policy data based on other data such as data updated policy data or both for example.
