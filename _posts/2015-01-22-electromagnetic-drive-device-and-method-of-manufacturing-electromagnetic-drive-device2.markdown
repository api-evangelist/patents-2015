This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT JP2015 051647 filed Jan. 22 2015 claiming priority based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2014 014685 filed Jan. 29 2014 the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present disclosure relates to an electromagnetic drive device that includes a core that has a core body portion a bobbin in which a tubular bobbin body portion is disposed over the entire region in the circumferential direction on the outer side of the core body portion in the radial direction a coil wound around the outer peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion a cover portion that covers the coil from the outer side in the radial direction over the entire region of the bobbin body portion in the axial direction and the circumferential direction and a connector portion that houses a power feed terminal of the coil the electromagnetic drive device controlling the position of a sliding member in a housing space formed by the core body portion in the axial direction in accordance with the state of power feed to the coil and relates to a method of manufacturing the electromagnetic drive device.

The electromagnetic drive device and the method of manufacturing the electromagnetic drive device described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2001 332419 JP 2001 332419 A Patent Document 1 are known as the electromagnetic drive device described above and the method of manufacturing the electromagnetic drive device. In the following description in the BACKGROUND ART section the names and the reference numerals of members used in Patent Document 1 are cited in brackets. Patent Document 1 describes a technology for forming a cover portion fixation portion by charging a resin the cover portion covering a coil coil from the outer side in the radial direction with a bobbin body portion tubular portion of a bobbin around which the coil has been wound disposed on the outer side of a core body portion tubular portion of a stator core in the radial direction. When forming the cover portion as illustrated in of Patent Document 1 the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion is disposed so as to contact the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion over substantially the entire region in the axial direction.

 Patent Document 1 Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2001 332419 JP 2001 332419 A paragraphs 0026 and 0027 FIG. 3 etc. 

In such an electromagnetic drive device in general a connector portion that houses the power feed terminal of the coil is formed in a part of the region in the circumferential direction although not clearly stated in Patent Document 1. Both the cover portion and the connector portion are formed from a resin which is a material that has electrical insulation. Therefore it is conceivable to integrally form the cover portion and the connector portion from a resin e.g. through injection molding . In the case of such a configuration however the member which is integrally formed from a resin is not uniform in shape in the circumferential direction. Therefore a contraction force generated when the resin is cooled to be cured may be non uniform in the circumferential direction which may apply an offset load to the core body portion which is disposed on the inner side of the cover portion in the radial direction. Depending on the magnitude of the offset load the core body portion which forms a sliding surface for the sliding member may be deformed to such a degree as to lower the performance of the electromagnetic drive device. In Patent Document 1 however such an issue is not taken into special consideration.

In view of the foregoing it is desirable to provide a technology that makes it possible to suppress deformation of a core body portion in the case where a cover portion and a connector portion are integrally formed from a resin.

In view of the foregoing the present disclosure provides an electromagnetic drive device including a core that has a core body portion that extends in an axial direction a bobbin that has a tubular bobbin body portion that extends in the axial direction the bobbin body portion being disposed on an outer side of the core body portion in a radial direction over an entire region of the core body portion in a circumferential direction a coil wound around an outer peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion a cover portion that covers the coil from the outer side in the radial direction over an entire region of the bobbin body portion in the axial direction and the circumferential direction and a connector portion that houses a power feed terminal of the coil the core body portion including a first body portion and a second body portion coupled to each other in the axial direction the first body portion being formed in a tubular shape that extends in the axial direction and a space surrounded by an inner peripheral surface of the first body portion forming a housing space for a sliding member that slides in the axial direction along the inner peripheral surface the second body portion being formed in a tubular shape that extends in the axial direction and that has an inner peripheral surface that is smaller in diameter than the inner peripheral surface of the first body portion or formed in a solid columnar shape that extends in the axial direction and the electromagnetic drive device controlling a position of the sliding member in the housing space in the axial direction in accordance with a state of power feed to the coil the electromagnetic drive device includes that the cover portion and the connector portion are integrally formed from a resin and an outer peripheral surface of the second body portion and an inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion contact each other and an outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and an inner peripheral surface of a target end portion which is an end portion of the bobbin body portion on a side in a direction from the second body portion toward the first body portion in the axial direction are spaced from each other in at least a part of a region in the circumferential direction.

In the characteristic configuration described above the cover portion and the connector portion are integrally formed from a resin. Therefore the resin in the vicinity of the coupling portion between the cover portion and the connector portion may be cured at a delayed timing compared to the resin in the other parts during execution of a resin molding step e.g. an injection molding step . This is because the resin in the vicinity of the coupling portion may be cooled at a low speed because of the presence of a great amount of resin in the vicinity of the coupling portion a limited heat conduction path through the molding die in the vicinity of the coupling portion etc. In the case where the resin in the vicinity of the coupling portion is cured at a delayed timing in this way a contraction force in the direction of pulling the resin which has already been cured toward the coupling portion is applied when the resin in the vicinity of the coupling portion is cured. Regarding the first body portion and the second body portion of the core body portion the second body portion is formed in a tubular shape that has an inner peripheral surface that is smaller in diameter than the inner peripheral surface of the tubular first body portion or formed in a solid columnar shape. Therefore the first body portion in which the housing space for the sliding member is formed is significantly affected by an offset load due to the contraction force compared to the second body portion.

In view of this respect in the characteristic configuration described above the outer peripheral surface of the second body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion contact each other and the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in at least a part of the region in the circumferential direction. Consequently it is possible to suppress deformation of the core body portion by suppressing application of an offset load due to the contraction force generated when the resin is cured to the first body portion which is easily deformable compared to the second body portion during execution of the resin molding step. That is with the characteristic configuration described above it is easy to provide an electromagnetic drive device in which the cover portion and the connector portion are integrally formed from a resin and in which deformation of the core body portion is suppressed.

Preferable aspects of the present disclosure will be described below. It should be noted however that the scope of the present disclosure is not limited by the preferable aspects described below.

In one aspect preferably the first body portion has a magnetic flux restriction portion provided in a region in which the bobbin body portion is disposed in the axial direction the magnetic flux restriction portion restricting magnetic flux that passes through the first body portion in the axial direction a thickness of the first body portion at a location where the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed is smaller than a thickness of parts of the core body portion positioned in the axial direction on both sides of the magnetic flux restriction portion and the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in an entire region in the axial direction on a side opposite of the magnetic flux restriction portion from the second body portion in the axial direction.

The magnetic flux restriction portion described above is intended to apply a magnetic attraction force to the sliding member by forming a flow of magnetic flux via the sliding member between a part of the first body portion on the side opposite of the magnetic flux restriction portion from the second body portion in the axial direction and the second body portion. In the configuration described above the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed by reducing the thickness of a part of the first body portion. In order to appropriately generate a magnetic attraction force the magnetic flux restriction portion is generally provided at a position close to an end portion of the first body portion on the side of the second body portion in the axial direction. Therefore the first body portion is configured to be easily deformable in the case where an offset load is applied to a part of the first body portion on the side opposite of the magnetic flux restriction portion from the second body portion in the axial direction. In this respect in the configuration described above the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in the entire region in the axial direction on the side opposite of the magnetic flux restriction portion from the second body portion the magnetic flux restriction portion in the axial direction. Therefore it is possible to suppress deformation of the core body portion by suppressing application of an offset load due to the contraction force generated when the resin is cured to a part of the first body portion on the side opposite of the magnetic flux restriction portion from the second body portion in the axial direction.

In one aspect preferably the electromagnetic drive device further includes a case that houses the cover portion the first body portion has a magnetic flux exchange surface provided on a side opposite of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion from the second body portion in the axial direction the magnetic flux exchange surface being an outer peripheral surface disposed so as to face the case in the radial direction in order to exchange magnetic flux with the case and the magnetic flux exchange surface is larger in diameter than a part of the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion that faces the target end portion of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction.

With the configuration a large magnetic path cross sectional area between the magnetic flux exchange surface and the case can be secured compared to a case where the magnetic flux exchange surface is equal in diameter to a part of the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion that faces the target end portion of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction. Hence the permeance between the magnetic flux exchange surface and the case can be increased in other words magnetic flux that leaks when magnetic flux is exchanged can be reduced as a result of which the magnetic attraction force to be applied to the sliding member can be easily improved.

In one aspect preferably a coupling portion between the connector portion and the cover portion is formed in a part of a region in the circumferential direction the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in a specific region in the circumferential direction and the specific region is a region in the circumferential direction on a side opposite of an axis of the core body portion from the region where the coupling portion is disposed.

With the configuration the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion can be spaced from each other in a region in the circumferential direction that is appropriate from the viewpoint of suppressing deformation of the core body portion while appropriately considering the fact that an offset load toward the coupling portion between the cover portion and the connector portion may be applied to the target end portion of the bobbin body portion because of the contraction force generated when the resin is cured during execution of a resin molding step e.g. an injection molding step .

In one aspect preferably the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in an entire region in the circumferential direction.

With the configuration the spaced portion in which the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other can be formed by relatively simple processing such as lathing for example compared to a case where the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in only a part of the region in the circumferential direction. Hence the steps for manufacturing the electromagnetic drive device can be simplified.

In one aspect preferably the connector portion has a part that extends in the axial direction on an outer side of the cover portion in the radial direction.

With the configuration it is necessary to dispose a molding die in a gap that extends in the axial direction between a part of the connector portion that extends in the axial direction on the outer side of the cover portion in the radial direction and the cover portion during execution of a resin molding step e.g. an injection molding step . Therefore a heat conduction path through the molding die in the vicinity of the coupling portion between the cover portion and the connector portion tends to be limited during execution of the resin molding step as a result of which the resin in the vicinity of the coupling portion tends to be cooled at a low speed. In this respect in the electromagnetic drive device according to the present disclosure as described above it is possible to suppress deformation of the core body portion by suppressing application of an offset load due to the contraction force generated when the resin is cured to the first body portion during execution of the resin molding step. Thus the configuration according to the present disclosure discussed above is particularly suitable to a case where the connector portion has a part that extends in the axial direction on the outer side of the cover portion in the radial direction.

In view of the foregoing the present disclosure also provides a method of manufacturing an electromagnetic drive device including a core that has a tubular core body portion that extends in an axial direction a bobbin that has a tubular bobbin body portion that extends in the axial direction the bobbin body portion being disposed on an outer side of the core body portion in a radial direction over an entire region of the core body portion in a circumferential direction a coil wound around an outer peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion a cover portion that covers the coil from the outer side in the radial direction over an entire region of the bobbin body portion in the axial direction and the circumferential direction and a connector portion that houses a power feed terminal of the coil the core body portion including a first body portion and a second body portion coupled to each other in the axial direction the first body portion being formed in a tubular shape that extends in the axial direction and a space surrounded by an inner peripheral surface of the first body portion forming a housing space for a sliding member that slides in the axial direction along the inner peripheral surface the second body portion being formed in a tubular shape that extends in the axial direction and that has an inner peripheral surface that is smaller in diameter than the inner peripheral surface of the first body portion or formed in a solid columnar shape that extends in the axial direction and the electromagnetic drive device controlling a position of the sliding member in the housing space in the axial direction in accordance with a state of power feed to the coil the method including an arrangement step of disposing the core body portion on an inner side of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction such that an outer peripheral surface of the second body portion and an inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion contact each other and such that an outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and an inner peripheral surface of a target end portion which is an end portion of the bobbin body portion on a side in a direction from the second body portion toward the first body portion in the axial direction are spaced from each other in at least a part of a region in the circumferential direction and an injection molding step of integrally forming the connector portion and the cover portion through injection molding of a resin the injection molding step being executed after execution of the arrangement step.

With the characteristic configuration described above the first body portion in which the housing space for the sliding member is formed is significantly affected by an offset load due to the contraction force of a resin compared to the second body portion for the reason discussed above when the connector portion and the cover portion are integrally formed in the injection molding step. In this respect in the characteristic configuration described above the core body portion is disposed on the inner side of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction such that the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the target end portion which is an end portion of the bobbin body portion on the side in the direction from the second body portion toward the first body portion in the axial direction are spaced from each other in at least a part of the region in the circumferential direction in the arrangement step which is executed before execution of the injection molding step. Hence it is possible to suppress deformation of the core body portion by suppressing application of an offset load due to the contraction force generated when the resin is cured to the first body portion which is easily deformable compared to the second body portion during execution of the injection molding step. That is with the characteristic configuration described above the cover portion and the connector portion can be integrally formed through injection molding of a resin while suppressing deformation of the core body portion.

An electromagnetic drive device and a method of manufacturing an electromagnetic drive device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings. Here a case where the electromagnetic drive device according to the present disclosure is applied to an electromagnetic valve see will be described as an example.

In the following description unless specifically differentiated the axial direction L the circumferential direction C and the radial direction R are defined with reference to the axis A of a core core body portion see etc. . The first axial direction L1 indicates the direction toward one side in the axial direction L. The second axial direction L2 indicates the direction toward the other side in the axial direction L the direction opposite to the first axial direction L1 . As discussed later the core body portion includes a first body portion and a second body portion coupled to each other in the axial direction L. The first axial direction L1 is the direction from the first body portion toward the second body portion along the axial direction L. The second axial direction L2 is the direction from the second body portion toward the first body portion along the axial direction L. In the embodiment as illustrated in the first axial direction L1 is the direction from the side of the electromagnetic drive device toward the side of a device in the embodiment a valve portion to be driven by the electromagnetic drive device along the axial direction L.

In the following members that compose the electromagnetic valve are described using the axial direction L the circumferential direction C and the radial direction R on the assumption that the members are assembled to the electromagnetic valve as a finished product even when the members in a manufacturing stage are described. In the following description in addition terms related to the dimension the arrangement direction the arrangement position and so forth such as parallel orthogonal and coaxial for example of each member may allow a difference due to an error an error that may be tolerated during manufacture .

As illustrated in the electromagnetic valve includes the electromagnetic drive device and the valve portion . The electromagnetic drive device will be described in detail later in 2. Configuration of Electromagnetic Drive Device . The valve portion is driven by the electromagnetic drive device and regulates an input hydraulic pressure and outputs the regulated hydraulic pressure. The electromagnetic valve is used to control the hydraulic pressure of working oil supplied to engagement devices such as clutches and brakes for example.

The valve portion includes a tubular sleeve in which a plurality of ports are formed and a spool that slides in the axial direction L inside the sleeve . The plurality of ports include an input port to which oil e.g. oil at a line pressure is input an output port from which oil which has been subjected to the pressure regulation by the valve portion is output a discharge port from which oil is discharged drained and so forth. The hydraulic pressure output from the output port is controlled by changing the state of communication between the ports in accordance with the position of the spool in the axial direction L. The spool is configured to be moved in the axial direction L in conjunction with a plunger driven by the electromagnetic drive device . In the embodiment the spool is configured to be moved in the axial direction L together with the plunger .

Specifically as illustrated in a shaft is interposed between the spool and the plunger in the axial direction L. The spool is urged by an urging member toward the side in the second axial direction L2 the side of the electromagnetic drive device in the axial direction L which causes an end portion of the spool on the side in the second axial direction L2 to abut against the shaft and causes an end portion of the shaft on the side in the second axial direction L2 to abut against the plunger . The spool is basically moved in the axial direction L together with the plunger either in the case where the plunger is moved toward the side in the first axial direction L1 against the urging force of the urging member by an electromagnetic drive force generated by the electromagnetic drive device or in the case where the plunger is moved toward the side in the second axial direction L2 by the urging force of the urging member .

Next the configuration of the electromagnetic drive device as an essential portion of the present disclosure will be described. As illustrated in the electromagnetic drive device includes the core a bobbin a coil a cover portion and a connector portion . The electromagnetic drive device controls the position of the plunger which slides along the inner peripheral surface of the core body portion the first body portion to be discussed later in the axial direction L the position in the axial direction L in a plunger housing space S to be discussed later in accordance with the state of power feed to the coil . The core the plunger and a case to be discussed later are formed from a ferromagnetic material such as high purity iron for example . At least one of the outer peripheral surface of the plunger and the inner peripheral surface of the core body portion in the example only the former is provided with a non magnetic layer formed from a non magnetic material such as nickel and phosphorus for example . In addition the bobbin the cover portion and the connector portion are formed from a resin which is a material that has electrical insulation a thermoplastic resin such as a polyphenylene sulfide resin for example . In the embodiment the plunger corresponds to the sliding member according to the present disclosure.

The core includes the tubular core body portion which extends in the axial direction L. The core body portion is formed by cutting or the like for example. As illustrated in the core body portion is formed in a cylindrical shape. Specifically the core body portion includes the first body portion and the second body portion which are coupled to each other in the axial direction L. The first body portion is formed in a tubular shape that extends in the axial direction L. The second body portion is formed in a tubular shape that extends in the axial direction L and that has an inner peripheral surface that is smaller in diameter than the inner peripheral surface of the first body portion or formed in a solid columnar shape that extends in the axial direction L. A bobbin body portion to be discussed later is disposed on the outer side of the core body portion in the radial direction R. The core body portion has a magnetic flux restriction portion provided in the region in which the bobbin body portion is disposed in the axial direction L. The magnetic flux restriction portion is a part that restricts magnetic flux that passes through the core body portion in the axial direction L. The magnetic flux restriction portion is formed in the first body portion and restricts magnetic flux that passes through the first body portion in the axial direction L. The magnetic flux restriction portion is formed in the vicinity of an end portion of the first body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 a coupling portion with the second body portion . A part of the core body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion applies a magnetic attraction force to the plunger when the coil is energized. That is the plunger is attracted to be moved in the first axial direction L1 when the coil is energized. Since a part of the core body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion applies a magnetic attraction force to the plunger when the coil is energized in the manner described above it is possible to provide a spaced portion to be discussed later while suppressing an effect on the magnetic circuit.

The magnetic flux restriction portion is configured such that the magnetic resistance of the core body portion at the magnetic flux restriction portion is larger than that of parts of the core body portion in the axial direction L on both sides of the magnetic flux restriction portion . In addition the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed over the entire region in the circumferential direction C. In the embodiment as illustrated in the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed by reducing the wall thickness the thickness of the tubular part of the core body portion at the location where the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed to be smaller than that of parts in the axial direction L on both sides of the region. That is the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed by making the thickness of the first body portion at the location where the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed smaller than the thickness of parts of the core body portion in the example the first body portion positioned in the axial direction L on both sides of the magnetic flux restriction portion . In the embodiment the magnetic resistance is increased by reducing the magnetic path area at the magnetic flux restriction portion . Specifically in the embodiment the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed by a recessed portion formed in the outer peripheral portion of the core body portion and dented inward in the radial direction R. In the embodiment in addition the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed in the vicinity in the axial direction of an end surface of the plunger on the side in the first axial direction L1 with the plunger moved to the position see at which the plunger is farthest from the second body portion in the axial direction L. Providing such a magnetic flux restriction portion suppresses a flow of magnetic flux not via the plunger between a part of the first body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion and the second body portion . As a result when the coil is energized a flow of magnetic flux via the plunger is formed between the part of the first body portion and the second body portion which applies a magnetic attraction force to the plunger . Meanwhile the inner peripheral surface of the core body portion in the example the first body portion is formed to be uniform equal in diameter along the axial direction L over the entire region in the axial direction L including the region in which the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed. In order to secure the strength of the core body portion etc. a member formed from a non magnetic material may be disposed in the recessed portion which forms the magnetic flux restriction portion .

In the embodiment the core body portion includes the first body portion which is in a cylindrical shape that extends in the axial direction L and the second body portion which is coupled to the side of the first body portion in the first axial direction L1. A cylindrical housing space plunger housing space S that houses the plunger is formed by the inner peripheral surface of the first body portion . The plunger slides in the axial direction L along the inner peripheral surface of the first body portion inside the plunger housing space S. The bottom portion an end portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 of the plunger housing space S is formed by an end surface of the second body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2. In the embodiment the second body portion is formed in a cylindrical shape with an inner peripheral surface smaller in diameter than the first body portion and the entire core body portion is formed in a cylindrical shape that extends in the axial direction L. That is in the embodiment the second body portion is formed in a tubular shape that extends in the axial direction L and that has an inner peripheral surface that is smaller in diameter than the inner peripheral surface of the first body portion . The shaft is inserted through a hole portion which is formed by the inner peripheral surface of the second body portion and which extends in the axial direction L so as to be slidable in the axial direction L. In the embodiment the first body portion and the second body portion are formed integrally with each other. In the embodiment in addition a flange portion that projects outward in the radial direction R with respect to the outer peripheral surface of the second body portion is coupled to an end portion of the second body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1. In the embodiment the second body portion and the flange portion are formed integrally with each other. In the embodiment the plunger housing space S corresponds to the housing space according to the present disclosure.

The bobbin includes the tubular bobbin body portion which extends in the axial direction L. As illustrated in the bobbin body portion is formed in a cylindrical shape. The coil is wound around the outer peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion . The coil is a tubular coil in the example a cylindrical coil that is formed by winding a coated conductor around the outer peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion and that extends in the axial direction L. The bobbin body portion is disposed over the entire region in the circumferential direction C on the outer side of the core body portion in the radial direction R. In the embodiment flange shaped holding portions that extend outward in the radial direction R are formed at respective end portions of the bobbin body portion on both sides in the axial direction L so as to hold the coil from both sides in the axial direction L. As illustrated in the holding portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 is disposed so as to contact the flange portion of the core from the side in the second axial direction L2.

In the embodiment the bobbin body portion is disposed with respect to the core body portion such that the entire region in which the bobbin body portion is disposed in the axial direction L is included in the region in which the core body portion is disposed in the axial direction L. Specifically an end portion a target end portion to be discussed later of the bobbin body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2 is disposed on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to an end portion of the core body portion in the example the first body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2. In addition an end portion of the bobbin body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 is disposed at the same position in the axial direction L as an end portion of the core body portion in the example the second body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1.

The cover portion is formed to cover the coil from the outer side in the radial direction R over the entire region of the bobbin body portion in the axial direction L and the circumferential direction C. That is as illustrated in the cover portion is formed in a cylindrical shape that extends in the axial direction L and that is larger in diameter than the cylindrical coil . The case is disposed so as to house the core the bobbin the coil and the cover portion . The case is formed in a bottomed tubular shape. Here the term bottomed tubular shape refers to a shape that has a tubular portion that extends in the axial direction L and a bottom portion that closes or closes only a part of an opening portion of the tubular portion on one side in the axial direction L. Specifically the case is formed in a bottomed tubular shape that opens on the side in the first axial direction L1 and has a cylindrical portion disposed on the outer side of the cover portion in the radial direction R over the entire region in the circumferential direction C and a bottom portion that closes the opening portion of the cylindrical portion on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the core and the bobbin . Hence the opening portion of the plunger housing space S which is formed in a bottomed tubular shape that opens on the side in the second axial direction L2 by the inner peripheral surface of the first body portion is closed by the bottom portion of the case . As illustrated in the case the cylindrical portion described above which houses the cover portion is disposed so as to be fitted externally fitted with the outer peripheral surface a magnetic flux exchange surface to be discussed later of a part of the first body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2. In addition the electromagnetic drive device and the valve portion are fixed to each other with an end portion of the case on the side in the first axial direction L1 and an end portion of the sleeve of the valve portion on the side in the second axial direction L2 joined e.g. joined by swaging to each other.

The connector portion is formed to house a power feed terminal of the coil . An end portion of the coated conductor which constitutes the coil is electrically connected to the power feed terminal . Electric power is supplied to the coil via the power feed terminal with a connector external connector on the power source side connected to the connector portion . The connector portion is disposed on the outer side of the cover portion in the radial direction R. In the example the connector portion is disposed on the outer side of the case in the radial direction R. In the embodiment the connector portion has a part that extends in the axial direction L on the outer side of the cover portion in the radial direction R. The part which extends in the axial direction L has a part disposed in the region in which the cover portion is disposed in the axial direction L. Specifically the connector portion is formed in a bottomed tubular shape in the example a bottomed tubular shape that opens on the side in the second axial direction L2 that has a tubular portion that extends in the axial direction L and the tubular portion is disposed so as to extend in the axial direction L on the outer side of the cover portion in the radial direction R.

The cover portion and the connector portion are integrally formed from a resin. In the embodiment the cover portion and the connector portion are integrally formed through injection molding of a resin with the bobbin body portion around which the coil has been wound disposed on the outer side of the core body portion in the radial direction R. The injection molding will be described in detail later in 3. Method of Manufacturing Electromagnetic Drive Device . In the embodiment as illustrated in the connector portion is coupled to the cover portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion . That is a coupling portion between the connector portion and the cover portion is formed on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion . The coupling portion is formed to extend in the radial direction R so as to couple the cover portion and the connector portion tubular portion which is disposed on the outer side of the cover portion in the radial direction R. In the embodiment the coupling portion is configured to couple an end portion of the cover portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 to the connector portion and the connector portion tubular portion is formed to extend from the coupling portion toward the side in the second axial direction L2. In addition as illustrated in the coupling portion is formed in a part of the region in the circumferential direction C.

As illustrated in the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion contact each other on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion . Specifically the outer peripheral surface of a part of the first body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion contacts the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion and the outer peripheral surface of the second body portion contacts the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion over the entire region of the second body portion in the axial direction L. In the embodiment the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion contact each other over the entire region in the circumferential direction C on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion . The outer peripheral surface of the second body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion contact each other in the manner described above.

Meanwhile the spaced portion in which the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other is formed in the region in the axial direction L on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion and corresponding to an end portion hereinafter referred to as target end portion of the bobbin body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2. The target end portion is an end portion of the bobbin body portion on the side in the direction from the second body portion toward the first body portion in the axial direction L. In the embodiment the region in the axial direction L corresponding to the target end portion is set on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion so as to include the position of the target end portion in the axial direction L. Specifically in the embodiment the region in the axial direction L corresponding to the target end portion is set as a region in the axial direction L that extends from the position of the target end portion in the axial direction L to the region in which the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed in the axial direction L. In the embodiment as discussed above the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed by a recessed portion formed in the outer peripheral portion of the core body portion and dented inward in the radial direction R and the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other also in the region in which the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed in the axial direction L as in the spaced portion . In this way the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in at least a part of the region in the circumferential direction C. In the embodiment the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in the entire region in the axial direction on the side opposite of the magnetic flux restriction portion from the second body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2 in the axial direction L.

In the embodiment as illustrated in the spaced portion is formed over the entire region in the circumferential direction C. In other words the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in the entire region in the circumferential direction C. In the example the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in the entire region in the axial direction L and the circumferential direction C on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion in the axial direction L. That is the region in the circumferential direction C on the side opposite of the axis A from the region where the coupling portion is disposed is included in the region in which the spaced portion is formed in the circumferential direction C. Here the region in the circumferential direction C on the side opposite of the axis A from the region where the coupling portion is disposed is a region that has a range of up to 180 degrees and mainly includes the region in the circumferential direction C that is shifted by 180 degrees radian from the region in which the coupling portion is disposed in the circumferential direction C. The region in the circumferential direction C that is shifted by 180 degrees from the region in which the coupling portion is disposed in the circumferential direction C is a region in the circumferential direction C disposed point symmetrically about the axis A with respect to the region in which the coupling portion is disposed in the circumferential direction C as seen in the axial direction L.

In the embodiment the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion is formed to be uniform equal in diameter in the entire region in the axial direction L. The spaced portion is formed by making the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion in the example the first body portion in the region in the axial direction L corresponding to the target end portion smaller in diameter than the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion in the example the first body portion and the second body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion . That is in the embodiment as illustrated in when the diameter of the outer peripheral surface cylindrical outer peripheral surface of the second body portion is defined as D1 and the diameter of a part of the outer peripheral surface cylindrical outer peripheral surface of the first body portion that faces the target end portion of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R is defined as D2 the core body portion is formed such that a relationship D2D2 is established. In the embodiment in order to fit externally fit the bobbin body portion with the core body portion along the axial direction L from the side in the second axial direction L2 when disposing the bobbin body portion on the outer side of the core body portion in the radial direction R the value of D3 is set to be equal to or less than the value of D1 D3 D1 . In the example the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the spaced portion is formed to be equal in diameter to the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion . That is in the example the core body portion is formed such that a relationship D3 D1 is established.

As illustrated in the magnetic flux exchange surface of the first body portion discussed above is formed by a part of the outer peripheral surface cylindrical outer peripheral surface of the first body portion that is disposed to face the case the inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical portion of the case in the radial direction R. The magnetic flux exchange surface is formed on the side opposite of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion from the second body portion in the axial direction L the side in the second axial direction L2 and exchanges magnetic flux with the case when the coil is energized. In the embodiment as described above the diameter D3 of the magnetic flux exchange surface is larger than the diameter D2 of a part of the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion that faces the target end portion of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R. That is the magnetic flux exchange surface is larger in diameter than a part of the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion that faces the target end portion of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R. In the example the magnetic flux exchange surface is equal in diameter to the outer peripheral surface of the second body portion . Consequently the permeance between the magnetic flux exchange surface and the case can be increased in other words magnetic flux that leaks when magnetic flux is exchanged can be reduced by securing a large magnetic path cross sectional area between the magnetic flux exchange surface and the case compared to a case where the magnetic flux exchange surface is equal in diameter to a part of the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion that faces the target end portion of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R.

As a supplementary description in a simplified model the permeance between the magnetic flux exchange surface and a part of the case to be fitted externally fitted with the magnetic flux exchange surface is represented as B D when the difference between the diameter D3 of the magnetic flux exchange surface and the diameter of the part of the case is defined as D the permeability of the magnetic path here air is defined as and the magnetic path cross sectional area is defined as B . When the width of the magnetic flux exchange surface in the axial direction L is defined as X the magnetic path cross sectional area B is represented as D3 X . Hence as the diameter D3 of the magnetic flux exchange surface becomes larger the magnetic path cross sectional area B becomes larger as a result of which the permeance also becomes larger in other words the magnetic resistance becomes smaller . In view of this respect when the magnetic flux exchange surface is larger in diameter than a part of the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion that faces the target end portion of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R a large permeance can be secured between the magnetic flux exchange surface and the case compared to a case where the magnetic flux exchange surface is equal in diameter to the part of the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion that faces the target end portion of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R as a result of which the magnetic attraction force to be applied to the plunger can be improved.

A method of manufacturing the electromagnetic drive device according to the embodiment will be described with reference to . As illustrated in the method of manufacturing the electromagnetic drive device according to the embodiment includes a coil winding step step 01 an arrangement step step 02 and an injection molding step step 03 .

In the coil winding step step 01 as illustrated in the coil is wound around the outer peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion . In the embodiment the holding portions are formed at the respective end portions of the bobbin body portion on both sides in the axial direction L and the coil is disposed in a cylindrical space defined by the bobbin body portion on the inner side in the radial direction R and defined by the pair of holding portions on both sides in the axial direction L.

The arrangement step step 02 is executed after execution of the coil winding step. In the arrangement step as illustrated in the core body portion is disposed on the inner side of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R using the core in which the core body portion is provided with the magnetic flux restriction portion . In the embodiment the holding portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 is disposed so as to contact the flange portion of the core from the side in the second axial direction L2. With the holding portion disposed in this way as illustrated in the magnetic flux restriction portion is disposed in the region in which the bobbin body portion is disposed in the axial direction L. In this state in addition the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion contact each other on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion and the spaced portion in which the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other is formed in the region in the axial direction L on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion and corresponding to an end portion of the bobbin body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2. That is in the arrangement step the core body portion is disposed on the inner side of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R such that the outer peripheral surface of the second body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion contact each other and such that the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in at least a part of the region in the circumferential direction C in the embodiment the entire region in the circumferential direction C .

The injection molding step step 03 is executed after execution of the arrangement step. In the injection molding step the connector portion and the cover portion are integrally formed through injection molding of a resin. In the embodiment in the injection molding step as illustrated in the connector portion and the cover portion are integrally formed through injection molding of a resin molding material such that the coupling portion between the connector portion and the cover portion is formed on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion . The injection molding step will be specifically described below.

First as illustrated in the core and the bobbin with the core body portion disposed on the inner side of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R are disposed inside a first molding die and a second molding die . The core and the bobbin may be disposed inside the first molding die and the second molding die in the arrangement step. The core is disposed as held by the first molding die and the second molding die from both sides in the axial direction L. In the example the flange portion of the core is held by the first molding die and the second molding die from both sides in the axial direction L via the bobbin around which the coil has been wound.

A cover void that corresponds to the shape of the cover portion and a connector void that corresponds to the shape of the connector portion are formed with the core and the bobbin disposed inside the first molding die and the second molding die . The connector void communicates with the cover void via a void that corresponds to the shape of the coupling portion . A resin in the example a thermoplastic resin in a molten state is charged into the voids via an injection path . In the embodiment although not illustrated a resin from an identical resin supply source is supplied uniformly from a plurality of locations in the circumferential direction C to the cover void . By cooling the charged resin to cure the resin the cover portion and the connector portion are integrally formed molded as coupled by the coupling portion as illustrated in . In this event the cover portion is insert molded so as to be integrated with the bobbin and the coil and the connector portion is insert molded so as to be integrated with the power feed terminal

In the embodiment providing the spaced portion makes it possible to integrally form the cover portion and the connector portion through injection molding of a resin while suppressing deformation of the core in particular the first body portion of the core body portion in which the plunger housing space S is formed. This respect will be described with reference to the embodiment of the present disclosure illustrated in etc. and a comparative example illustrated in . illustrates a comparative example to which the present disclosure is not applied in which the spaced portion discussed above is not formed. Although the electromagnetic drive device illustrated in is not an embodiment of the present disclosure reference numerals that are the same as those of etc. are given in order to facilitate understanding.

When the resin is cooled to be cured in the injection molding step the volume of the resin is decreased which generates a contraction force in the resin. The cover portion which is formed through injection molding is formed so as to cover the coil from the outer side in the radial direction R over the entire region of the bobbin body portion in the axial direction L and the circumferential direction C. Therefore when the resin which constitutes the cover portion is cooled to be cured the contraction force of the resin may be applied to the core body portion which is disposed on the inner side of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R via the bobbin body portion which is disposed on the inner side of the cover portion in the radial direction R. If the contraction force is uniform or generally uniform in the circumferential direction C the core body portion may not be deformed to such a degree as to reduce the performance of the electromagnetic drive device . In the case where the cover portion and the connector portion are integrally formed through injection molding of a resin however an offset load may be applied to the core body portion with the contraction force which is applied to the core body portion being non uniform in the circumferential direction C which may deform the core body portion to such a degree as to reduce the performance of the electromagnetic drive device .

The reason is as follows. As illustrated in the molding die in the example the first molding die used during execution of the injection molding step is provided with a die part that separates a part in the example the tubular portion of the connector portion that extends in the axial direction L on the outer side of the cover portion in the radial direction R and the cover portion from each other in the radial direction R. When a resin in a molten state is charged the molding die also becomes hot. However the die part which has a limited heat conduction path is cooled at a low speed compared to other parts of the molding die. In addition a great amount of resin is charged in the vicinity of the die part in order to form the connector portion . Therefore the resin in the vicinity of the die part is cured at a delayed timing compared to the resin in the other parts and the resin which has already been cured is pulled toward the die part because of a contraction force generated when the resin in the vicinity of the die part is cured. In addition as illustrated in the coupling portion between the cover portion and the connector portion is formed in a part of the region in the circumferential direction C and the coupling portion is formed on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion . Consequently the contraction force of the resin that is cured at a delayed timing is also offset significantly. Because of such factors in the configuration described above as illustrated in an exaggerated manner in relation to the comparative example of the bobbin may be deformed such that an end portion of the bobbin on the side in the second axial direction L2 is brought closer to the coupling portion along with which the core body portion may also be deformed.

In view of this respect in the embodiment as discussed above the spaced portion in which the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other is formed in the region in the axial direction L corresponding to an end portion target end portion of the bobbin body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2. In the embodiment further the spaced portion is formed over the entire region in the circumferential direction C so that the region in the circumferential direction C on the side opposite of the axis A from the region where the coupling portion is disposed is included in the region in which the spaced portion is formed in the circumferential direction C. Consequently it is possible to suppress deformation of the core body portion by suppressing contact between the bobbin body portion and the core body portion first body portion in the case where the bobbin is deformed as described above.

In the embodiment in the arrangement step the core is brought closer to the bobbin in the axial direction L to fit the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion with the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion . Therefore the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion contact each other on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion to such a degree that the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion can be fitted with the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion at least after execution of the arrangement step. Regarding this respect as described above when the resin which constitutes the cover portion is cooled to be cured the contraction force of the resin is applied to the bobbin body portion in the direction of reducing the diameter. Therefore the degree of contact between the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion is enhanced by execution of the injection molding step.

Lastly an electromagnetic drive device and a method of manufacturing an electromagnetic drive device according to other embodiments of the present disclosure will be described. A configuration disclosed in each of the following embodiments may be applied in combination with a configuration disclosed in any other embodiment unless any contradiction occurs.

The order of the coil winding step and the arrangement step may be reversed. In this case the coil is wound around the bobbin body portion which is disposed on the outer side of the core body portion in the radial direction R in the coil winding step. In either case the coil winding step is executed before the injection molding step.

 2 In the embodiment described above the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the spaced portion is formed to be larger in diameter than the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion in the region in which the spaced portion is formed in the axial direction L. However embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. For example as in the example illustrated in the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the spaced portion may be formed to be equal in diameter to the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion in the region in which the spaced portion is formed in the axial direction L. In this case the magnetic flux exchange surface is equal in diameter to a part of the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion that faces the target end portion of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R. That is the diameter D3 of the magnetic flux exchange surface is equal to the diameter D2 of a part of the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion that faces the target end portion of the bobbin body portion in the radial direction R.

 3 In the embodiment described above the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed by reducing the wall thickness the thickness of the first body portion of the core body portion at a location where the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed to be smaller than that of parts in the axial direction L on both sides of the region. However embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. For example as in the example illustrated in a part of the core body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion and a part of the core body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion may be coupled to each other in the axial direction L by a coupling member that forms the magnetic flux restriction portion . The coupling member is formed from a non magnetic material and couples parts of the core body portion that are disposed separately on both sides of the magnetic flux restriction portion in the axial direction L to each other in a magnetically separated manner. Coupling by the coupling member may be implemented by joining through swaging or joining through brazing for example.

 4 In the embodiment described above the region in the axial direction L in which the spaced portion is formed is set as a region in the axial direction L that extends from the position in the axial direction L of an end portion of the bobbin body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2 to the region in the axial direction L in which the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed in the axial direction L. That is the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion are spaced from each other in the entire region in the axial direction on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion in the axial direction L. However embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. The spaced portion may be formed at least at a position in the axial direction L corresponding to an end portion target end portion of the bobbin body portion on the side in the second axial direction L2 e.g. a position that is the same in the axial direction L as the end portion and an end portion of the region in the axial direction L in which the spaced portion is formed on the side in the first axial direction L1 may be set on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the region in which the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed. That is the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion may be separated from each other in only a part of the region in the axial direction L on the side in the second axial direction L2 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion in the axial direction L note that the region should include a position that is the same in the axial direction L as the target end portion .

 5 In the embodiment described above the spaced portion is formed over the entire region in the circumferential direction C. However embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. The spaced portion may be formed in only a part of the region in the circumferential direction C. That is the outer peripheral surface of the first body portion and the inner peripheral surface of the target end portion of the bobbin body portion may be spaced from each other in only a part of the region in the circumferential direction C a specific region to be discussed later . Here when the region in the circumferential direction C in which the spaced portion is formed is defined as the specific region the specific region is preferably set in a region in the circumferential direction C on the side opposite of the axis A from the region where the coupling portion is disposed as in the example illustrated in . In the example illustrated in the specific region is set as a region that has a range of 180 degrees. The specific region may also be set as a region that has a range of less than 180 degrees e.g. a region in the circumferential direction C that is shifted by 180 degrees from the region in which the coupling portion is disposed in the circumferential direction C .

 6 In the embodiment described above the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion is formed to be uniform equal in diameter in the entire region in the axial direction L. However embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. The inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion in the region in which the spaced portion is formed in the axial direction L may be formed to be larger in diameter than the inner peripheral surface of the bobbin body portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion . In this case unlike the embodiment described above the outer peripheral surface of the core body portion may be formed to be uniform in the entire region in the axial direction L excluding the region in which the magnetic flux restriction portion is formed.

 7 In the embodiment described above the connector portion is coupled to the cover portion on the side in the first axial direction L1 with respect to the magnetic flux restriction portion .

In this case unlike the embodiment described above the second body portion may be formed in a columnar shape that extends in the axial direction L rather than a cylindrical shape that extends in the axial direction L. In this case the second body portion is formed in a solid columnar shape that extends in the axial direction L.
