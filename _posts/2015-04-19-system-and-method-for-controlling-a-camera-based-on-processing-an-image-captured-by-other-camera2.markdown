title: System and method for controlling a camera based on processing an image captured by other camera
abstract: A device comprises a first digital camera having a first center line of sight and a second digital camera having a second center line of sight that is parallel and opposing the first camera. A method for controlling the first camera based on estimating the angular deviation between a person gaze direction and the line of sight of the first digital camera. A human face is detected in an image captured as an image file by the second digital camera, using a face detection algorithm. An angular deviation α is estimated, defined between the second center line of sight and an imaginary line from the second camera to the detected human face based on the captured image, and an angular deviation β is estimated, defined between the imaginary line from the second camera to the detected face and the human face gaze direction based on the captured image.
