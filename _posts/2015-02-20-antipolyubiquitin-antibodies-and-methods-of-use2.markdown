The present invention relates to the field of anti polyubiquitin antibodies and more particularly to anti polyubiquitin antibodies that do not specifically bind to monoubiquitin and that are specific for particular lysine linkage forms of polyubiquitin and methods of using the same.

Ubiquitin is a small protein that has important regulatory roles in a wide variety of cellular pathways. Ubiquitin chains linked through the lysine at position 11 K11 have been identified as important regulators of cell division Jin et al. 2008 Kirkpatrick et al. 2006 and have been implicated in signaling degradation of ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex APC C substrates an essential step in eukaryotic cell division Jin et al. 2008 Williamson et al. 2009 . The APC C recruits two E2 enzymes the ubiquitin chain initiating UbcH10 and the chain elongating Ube2S which assemble K11 linked chains with high specificity Garnett et al. 2009 Williamson et al. 2009 Wu et al. 2010 . Loss of this APC C specific E2 module leads to defects in mitotic progression Williamson et al. 2009 Song and Rape Molecular Cell in press . While these results suggest that K11 linked chains drive protein degradation by the proteasome during mitosis characterization of ubiquitin chains assembled by the APC C UbcH10 and Ube2S has relied largely on in vitro experiments. Direct evidence of K11 linked polyubiquitin chains regulating protein degradation in cells has been lacking due to an absence of tools available to directly detect them.

Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . With the exception of CDR1 in VH CDRs generally comprise the amino acid residues that form the hypervariable loops. CDRs also comprise specificity determining residues or SDRs which are residues that contact antigen. SDRs are contained within regions of the CDRs called abbreviated CDRs or a CDRs. Exemplary a CDRs a CDR L1 a CDR L2 a CDR L3 a CDR H1 a CDR H2 and a CDR H3 occur at amino acid residues 31 34 of L1 50 55 of L2 89 96 of L3 31 35B of H1 50 58 of H2 and 95 102 of H3. See Almagro and Fransson 13 1619 1633 2008 . Unless otherwise indicated HVR residues and other residues in the variable domain e.g. FR residues are numbered herein according to Kabat et al. supra.

An isolated antibody is one which has been separated from a component of its natural environment. In some embodiments an antibody is purified to greater than 95 or 99 purity as determined by for example electrophoretic e.g. SDS PAGE isoelectric focusing IEF capillary electrophoresis or chromatographic e.g. ion exchange or reverse phase HPLC . For review of methods for assessment of antibody purity see e.g. Flatman et al. 848 79 87 2007 .

An isolated nucleic acid refers to a nucleic acid molecule that has been separated from a component of its natural environment.

 Isolated nucleic acid encoding an anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibody refers to one or more nucleic acid molecules encoding antibody heavy and light chains or fragments thereof including such nucleic acid molecule s in a single vector or separate vectors and such nucleic acid molecule s present at one or more locations in a host cell.

As used herein the terms K linked polyubiquitin and Lys linked polyubiquitin are interchangeable and refer to a polyubiquitin molecule comprising at least one isopeptide bond between the C terminus of one ubiquitin moiety and a lysine at position in another ubiquitin moiety. For example a K11 linked polyubiquitin is used interchangeably with a Lys11 linked polyubiquitin and both terms refer to a polyubiquitin molecule comprising an isopeptide bond between the C terminus of one of the ubiquitin moieties in the molecule and the lysine at position 11 in another ubiquitin moiety in the molecule.

As used herein a statement that a first lysine linkage differs from a second lysine linkage indicates that the first lysine linkage between one ubiquitin moiety and another ubiquitin moiety involves a different lysine residue e.g. K6 K11 K27 K29 K33 K48 and or K63 than the second lysine linkage between one ubiquitin moiety and another ubiquitin moiety.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical and or bind the same epitope except for possible variant antibodies e.g. containing naturally occurring mutations or arising during production of a monoclonal antibody preparation such variants generally being present in minor amounts. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques including but not limited to the hybridoma method recombinant DNA methods phage display methods and methods utilizing transgenic animals containing all or part of the human immunoglobulin loci such methods and other exemplary methods for making monoclonal antibodies being described herein.

A naked antibody refers to an antibody that is not conjugated to a heterologous moiety e.g. a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel. The naked antibody may be present in a pharmaceutical formulation.

 Native antibodies refer to naturally occurring immunoglobulin molecules with varying structures. For example native IgG antibodies are heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150 000 daltons composed of two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains that are disulfide bonded. From N to C terminus each heavy chain has a variable region VH also called a variable heavy domain or a heavy chain variable domain followed by three constant domains CH1 CH2 and CH3 . Similarly from N to C terminus each light chain has a variable region VL also called a variable light domain or a light chain variable domain followed by a constant light CL domain. The light chain of an antibody may be assigned to one of two types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequence of its constant domain.

The term package insert is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products that contain information about the indications usage dosage administration combination therapy contraindications and or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.

 Percent amino acid sequence identity with respect to a reference polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the reference polypeptide sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or Megalign DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for aligning sequences including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein however amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN 2. The ALIGN 2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech Inc. and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office Washington D.C. 20559 where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN 2 program is publicly available from Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. or may be compiled from the source code. The ALIGN 2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system including digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN 2 program and do not vary.

In situations where ALIGN 2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons the amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to with or against a given amino acid sequence B which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain amino acid sequence identity to with or against a given amino acid sequence B is calculated as follows 100 times the fraction X Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN 2 in that program s alignment of A and B and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B the amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the amino acid sequence identity of B to A.

As used herein the term polyubiquitin is defined as all species of native human and synthetic polymeric chains of ubiquitin which fall within human and synthetic classes of different polymeric linkages of ubiquitin including but not limited to K6 linked polyubiquitin K11 linked polyubiquitin K27 linked polyubiquitin K29 linked polyubiquitin K33 linked polyubiquitin K48 linked polyubiquitin and K63 linked polyubiquitin. Polyubiquitin may be of any length and includes at least two ubiquitin moieties. Polyubiquitin is distinguished from tandem repeats of ubiquitin that are originally expressed as a single protein.

As used herein treatment and grammatical variations thereof such as treat or treating refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual being treated and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include but are not limited to preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease alleviation of symptoms diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease preventing metastasis decreasing the rate of disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state and remission or improved prognosis. In some embodiments antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or to slow the progression of a disease.

As used herein the terms ubiquitin and monoubiquitin are used interchangeably and refer to any native ubiquitin from any vertebrate source including mammals such as primates e.g. humans and rodents e.g. mice and rats unless otherwise indicated. The term encompasses full length unprocessed ubiquitin as well as any shortened or posttranslationally modified form of ubiquitin that results from processing in the cell excepting molecules comprised of multiple ubiquitin moieties. The term also encompasses naturally occurring variants of ubiquitin e.g. splice variants or allelic variants. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary human ubiquitin is shown in SEQ ID NO 1 MQIFVKTLTGKTITLEVEPSDTIENVKAKIQDKEGIPPDQQRLIFA GKQLEDGRTLSDYNIQKESTLHLVLRLRGG SEQ ID NO 1 . Ubiquitin has at least one lysine residue at amino acid 6 amino acid 11 amino acid 27 amino acid 29 amino acid 33 amino acid 48 and or amino acid 63 marked in bold in SEQ ID NO 1 above .

As used herein the term ubiquitin pathway refers to a biochemical pathway in a cell or reconstituted in vitro that includes ubiquitin and or polyubiquitin.

The term variable region or variable domain refers to the domain of an antibody heavy or light chain that is involved in binding the antibody to antigen. The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain VH and VL respectively of a native antibody generally have similar structures with each domain comprising four conserved framework regions FRs and three hypervariable regions HVRs . See e.g. Kindt et al. 6ed. W.H. Freeman and Co. page 91 2007 . A single VH or VL domain may be sufficient to confer antigen binding specificity. Furthermore antibodies that bind a particular antigen may be isolated using a VH or VL domain from an antibody that binds the antigen to screen a library of complementary VL or VH domains respectively. See e.g. Portolano et al. 150 880 887 1993 Clarkson et al. 352 624 628 1991 .

The term vector as used herein refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of propagating another nucleic acid to which it is linked. The term includes the vector as a self replicating nucleic acid structure as well as the vector incorporated into the genome of a host cell into which it has been introduced. Certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of nucleic acids to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as expression vectors. 

In one aspect the invention is based in part on the creation of antibodies that are capable of specifically recognizing a first polyubiquitin molecule containing a first polyubiquitin linkage but not specifically binding to a second polyubiquitin molecule containing a second polyubiquitin linkage. In certain embodiments antibodies that specifically bind to K11 linked polyubiquitin are provided. Antibodies of the invention are useful both in research and e.g. for the diagnosis or treatment e.g. of diseases and disorders relating to aberrant cell cycle progression.

The unique properties of the anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention make them particularly useful for distinguishing between different lysine linked forms of polyubiquitin in a cellular system without resorting to cumbersome and expensive genetic manipulation or biophysical methods such as mass spectrometry. The anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be used to characterize the function s and activities of specific K11 linked polyubiquitins both in vitro and in vivo. The anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can also be used to determine the role of specific K11 linked polyubiquitins in the development and pathogenesis of disease. The anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can further be used to treat diseases in which one or more specific lysine linked polyubiquitins are aberrantly regulated or aberrantly functioning without interfering with the normal activity of polyubiquitins for which the anti polyubiquitin antibodies are not specific.

The anaphase promoting complex APC C is known to act as the ubiquitinating E3 ligase responsible for the majority of the K11 linked polyubiquitin chains synthesized during mitosis. In particular APC C mediated K11 linked polyubiquitination of mitotic proteins such as cyclins geminin and Plk1 results in subsequent degradation of those labeled proteins by the proteasome. When endogenous ubiquitin is mutated such that the lysine at position 11 is changed to an arginine and therefore cannot be used for the lysine linkage the resulting mutant cells demonstrate an aberrant lack of degradation of important mitotic proteins and cell cycle arrest. In this mutation results in death of the embryo prior to gastrulation. The presence and accessibility of the K11 linked polyubiquitin label thus plays an important role in normal cell cycle progression and the antibodies and Fabs of the invention provide a useful therapeutic means for modulation of disorders and disease states in which cell cycle regulation is aberrant. In one embodiment the anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention are used to treat diseases and disorders where cell cycle progression is aberrantly upregulated resulting in too much cell division such as cancer. In another embodiment the anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention are used to treat diseases and disorders where cell cycle progression is aberrantly downregulated resulting in too little cell division and concomitant wasting or destruction of tissue. Examples of such diseases include but are not limited to degenerative muscle disorders and degenerative nerve disorders including but not limited to Charcot Marie Tooth syndrome poliomyelitis amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Guillain Barre syndrome .

As used herein the terms cell proliferative disorder and proliferative disorder refer to disorders that are associated with some degree of abnormal cell proliferation. In one embodiment the cell proliferative disorder is cancer.

The terms cancer and cancerous refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth proliferation. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to carcinoma lymphoma e.g. Hodgkin s and non Hodgkin s lymphoma blastoma sarcoma and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer small cell lung cancer non small cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma of the lung squamous carcinoma of the lung cancer of the peritoneum hepatocellular cancer gastrointestinal cancer appendiceal cancer pancreatic cancer glioblastoma cervical cancer ovarian cancer liver cancer bladder cancer hepatoma breast cancer colon cancer colorectal cancer endometrial or uterine carcinoma salivary gland carcinoma kidney cancer liver cancer prostate cancer vulval cancer thyroid cancer hepatic carcinoma leukemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders and various types of head and neck cancer.

The term tumor as used herein refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation whether malignant or benign and all pre cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues. The terms cancer cancerous cell proliferative disorder proliferative disorder and tumor are not mutually exclusive as referred to herein.

The term degenerative muscle disorder refers to or describes the physiological condition in muscle containing animals that is typically characterized by deterioration or weakening of skeletal and or smooth muscle such that normal muscular function is reduced. Examples of degenerative muscular disorders include but are not limited to muscular dystrophy myotonic dystrophy myotonia congenita cachexia sarcopenia multiple sclerosis amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Isaac s syndrome stiff person syndrome familiar periodic paralyses myopathy myotonia rhabdomyolyses muscle atrophy and various types of muscle weakness and muscle rigidity.

The term degenerative nerve disorder refers to or describes the physiological condition in nerve containing animals that is typically characterized by deterioration of nervous tissue or deterioration of communication between cells in nervous tissue. Examples of degenerative nerve disorders include but are not limited to neurodegenerative diseases including but not limited to Lewy body disease postpoliomyelitis syndrome Shy Draeger syndrome olivopontocerebellar atrophy Parkinson s disease multiple system atrophy amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Guillian Barre syndrome Carcot Marie Tooth syndrome striatonigral degeneration and nervous cell tissue destruction caused by or associated with tauopathies prion diseases bulbar palsy motor neuron disease dementia and nervous system heterodegenerative disorders including but not limited to Canavan disease Huntington s disease neuronal ceroidlipofuscinosis Alexander s disease Tourette s syndrome Menkes kinky hair syndrome Cockayne syndrome Halervorden Spatz syndrome lafora disease Rett syndrome hepatolenticular degeneration Lesch Nyhan syndrome and Unverricht Lundborg syndrome .

In another aspect the anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention find utility as reagents for detection and isolation of K11 linked polyubiquitin such as detection of polyubiquitin in various cell types and tissues including the determination of polyubiquitin density and distribution in cell populations and within a given cell and cell sorting based on the presence or amount of polyubiquitin. In yet another aspect the present anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies are useful for the development of polyubiquitin antagonists with blocking activity patterns similar to those of the subject antibodies of the invention. As a further example anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be used to identify other anti polyubiquitin antibodies that bind substantially the same antigenic determinant s of polyubiquitin as the antibodies exemplified herein including linear and conformational epitopes.

The anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies of the invention can be used in assays based on the physiological pathways in which polyubiquitin is involved to screen for small molecule antagonists of K11 linked polyubiquitin function. For example since K11 linked polyubiquitin chains are known to be necessary for normal cell cycle progression through anaphase CITE the activity of anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies to modulate up or down regulate cell cycle progression in treated cells or tissues may be compared to the activity of one or more potential small molecule antagonists of K11 linked polyubiquitin in modulating cell cycle progression.

In a further aspect an anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibody according to any of the above embodiments may incorporate any of the features singly or in combination as described in Sections 1 7 below 

In certain embodiments an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant Kd of 1 M 100 nM 10 nM 1 nM 0.1 nM 0.01 nM or 0.001 nM e.g. 10M or less e.g. from 10M to 10M e.g. from 10M to 10M .

In one embodiment Kd is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay RIA performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of I labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen then capturing bound antigen with an anti Fab antibody coated plate see e.g. Chen et al. 293 865 881 1999 . To establish conditions for the assay MICROTITER multi well plates Thermo Scientific are coated overnight with 5 g ml of a capturing anti Fab antibody Cappel Labs in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 and subsequently blocked with 2 w v bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature approximately 23 C. . In a non adsorbent plate Nunc 269620 100 pM or 26 pM I antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest e.g. consistent with assessment of the anti VEGF antibody Fab 12 in Presta et al. 57 4593 4599 1997 . The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight however the incubation may continue for a longer period e.g. about 65 hours to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature e.g. for one hour . The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 polysorbate 20 TWEEN 20 in PBS. When the plates have dried 150 l well of scintillant MICROSCINT 20 Packard is added and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT gamma counter Packard for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20 of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.

According to another embodiment Kd is measured using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACOR 2000 or a BIACORE 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C. with e.g. immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIACORE Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 to 5 g ml 0.2 M before injection at a flow rate of 5 l minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 polysorbate 20 TWEEN 20 surfactant PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 l min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIACORE Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen et al. 293 865 881 1999 . If the on rate exceeds 10Msby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM AMINCO spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stirred cuvette. Other coupling chemistries for the target antigen to the chip surface e.g. streptavidin biotin hydrophobic interaction or disulfide chemistry are also readily available instead of the amine coupling methodology CM5 chip described above as will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

In certain embodiments an antibody provided herein is an antibody fragment. Antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fab Fab Fab SH F ab Fv and scFv fragments and other fragments described below. For a review of certain antibody fragments see Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 . For a review of scFv fragments see e.g. Pluckth n in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 see also WO 93 16185 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 894 and 5 587 458. For discussion of Fab and F ab fragments comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues and having increased in vivo half life see U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046.

Diabodies are antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites that may be bivalent or bispecific. See for example EP 404 097 WO 1993 01161 Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 . Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al. 9 129 134 2003 .

In one example a chimeric antibody comprises a non human variable region e.g. a variable region derived from a mouse rat hamster rabbit or non human primate such as a monkey and a human constant region. In a further example a chimeric antibody is a class switched antibody in which the class or subclass has been changed from that of the parent antibody. Chimeric antibodies include antigen binding fragments thereof.

In certain embodiments a chimeric antibody is a humanized antibody. Typically a non human antibody is humanized to reduce immunogenicity to humans while retaining the specificity and affinity of the parental non human antibody. Generally a humanized antibody comprises one or more variable domains in which HVRs e.g. CDRs or portions thereof are derived from a non human antibody and FRs or portions thereof are derived from human antibody sequences. A humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of a human constant region. In some embodiments some FR residues in a humanized antibody are substituted with corresponding residues from a non human antibody e.g. the antibody from which the HVR residues are derived e.g. to restore or improve antibody specificity or affinity.

Humanized antibodies and methods of making them are reviewed e.g. in Almagro and Fransson 13 1619 1633 2008 and are further described e.g. in Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 Queen et al. 86 10029 10033 1989 U.S. Pat.

Human framework regions that may be used for humanization include but are not limited to framework regions selected using the best fit method see e.g. Sims et al. 151 2296 1993 framework regions derived from the consensus sequence of human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chain variable regions see e.g. Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 and Presta et al. 151 2623 1993 human mature somatically mutated framework regions or human germline framework regions see e.g. Almagro and Fransson 13 1619 1633 2008 and framework regions derived from screening FR libraries see e.g. Baca et al. 272 10678 10684 1997 and Rosok et al. 271 22611 22618 1996 .

In certain embodiments an antibody provided herein is a human antibody. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. Human antibodies are described generally in van Dijk and van de Winkel 5 368 74 2001 and Lonberg 20 450 459 2008 .

Human antibodies may be prepared by administering an immunogen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce intact human antibodies or intact antibodies with human variable regions in response to antigenic challenge. Such animals typically contain all or a portion of the human immunoglobulin loci which replace the endogenous immunoglobulin loci or which are present extrachromosomally or integrated randomly into the animal s chromosomes. In such transgenic mice the endogenous immunoglobulin loci have generally been inactivated. For review of methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic animals see Lonberg 23 1117 1125 2005 . See also e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 075 181 and 6 150 584 describing XENOMOUSE technology U.S. Pat. No. 5 770 429 describing HM technology U.S. Pat. No. 7 041 870 describing K M MOUSE technology and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2007 0061900 describing VM technology . Human variable regions from intact antibodies generated by such animals may be further modified e.g. by combining with a different human constant region.

Human antibodies can also be made by hybridoma based methods. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described. See e.g. Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 and Boerner et al. 147 86 1991 . Human antibodies generated via human B cell hybridoma technology are also described in Li et al. 103 3557 3562 2006 . Additional methods include those described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7 189 826 describing production of monoclonal human IgM antibodies from hybridoma cell lines and Ni 26 4 265 268 2006 describing human human hybridomas . Human hybridoma technology Trioma technology is also described in Vollmers and Brandlein 20 3 927 937 2005 and Vollmers and Brandlein 27 3 185 91 2005 .

Human antibodies may also be generated by isolating Fv clone variable domain sequences selected from human derived phage display libraries. Such variable domain sequences may then be combined with a desired human constant domain. Techniques for selecting human antibodies from antibody libraries are described below.

Antibodies of the invention may be isolated by screening combinatorial libraries for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are reviewed e.g. in Hoogenboom et al. in 178 1 37 O Brien et al. ed. Human Press Totowa N.J. 2001 and further described e.g. in the McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 597 1992 Marks and Bradbury in 248 161 175 Lo ed. Human Press Totowa N.J. 2003 Sidhu et al. 338 2 299 310 2004 Lee et al. 340 5 1073 1093 2004 Fellouse 101 34 12467 12472 2004 and Lee et al. 284 1 2 119 132 2004 .

In certain phage display methods repertoires of VH and VL genes are separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction PCR and recombined randomly in phage libraries which can then be screened for antigen binding phage as described in Winter et al. 12 433 455 1994 . Phage typically display antibody fragments either as single chain Fv scFv fragments or as Fab fragments. Libraries from immunized sources provide high affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively the naive repertoire can be cloned e.g. from human to provide a single source of antibodies to a wide range of non self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al. 12 725 734 1993 . Finally naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning unrearranged V gene segments from stem cells and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 . Patent publications describing human antibody phage libraries include for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 750 373 and US Patent Publication Nos. 2005 0079574 2005 0119455 2005 0266000 2007 0117126 2007 0160598 2007 0237764 2007 0292936 and 2009 0002360.

Antibodies or antibody fragments isolated from human antibody libraries are considered human antibodies or human antibody fragments herein.

In certain embodiments an antibody provided herein is a multispecific antibody e.g. a bispecific antibody. Multispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different sites. In certain embodiments one of the binding specificities is for K11 linked polyubiquitin and the other is for any other antigen. In certain embodiments bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of K11 linked polyubiquitin. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express K11 linked polyubiquitin. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments.

Techniques for making multispecific antibodies include but are not limited to recombinant co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs having different specificities see Milstein and Cuello 305 537 1983 WO 93 08829 and Traunecker et al. 10 3655 1991 and knob in hole engineering see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168 . Multi specific antibodies may also be made by engineering electrostatic steering effects for making antibody Fc heterodimeric molecules WO 2009 089004A1 cross linking two or more antibodies or fragments see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 using leucine zippers to produce bi specific antibodies see e.g. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 using diabody technology for making bispecific antibody fragments see e.g. Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 and using single chain Fv sFv dimers see e.g. Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 and preparing trispecific antibodies as described e.g. in Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

Engineered antibodies with three or more functional antigen binding sites including Octopus antibodies are also included herein see e.g. US 2006 0025576A1 .

The antibody or fragment herein also includes a Dual Acting FAb or DAF comprising an antigen binding site that binds to K11 linked polyubiquitin as well as another different antigen see US 2008 0069820 for example .

In certain embodiments amino acid sequence variants of the antibodies provided herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of an antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate modifications into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics e.g. antigen binding.

In certain embodiments antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions are provided. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the HVRs and FRs. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of conservative substitutions. More substantial changes are provided in Table 1 under the heading of exemplary substitutions and as further described below in reference to amino acid side chain classes. Amino acid substitutions may be introduced into an antibody of interest and the products screened for a desired activity e.g. retained improved antigen binding decreased immunogenicity or improved ADCC or CDC.

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.

One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further study will have modifications e.g. improvements in certain biological properties e.g. increased affinity reduced immunogenicity relative to the parent antibody and or will have substantially retained certain biological properties of the parent antibody. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody which may be conveniently generated e.g. using phage display based affinity maturation techniques such as those described herein. Briefly one or more HVR residues are mutated and the variant antibodies displayed on phage and screened for a particular biological activity e.g. binding affinity .

Alterations e.g. substitutions may be made in HVRs e.g. to improve antibody affinity. Such alterations may be made in HVR hotspots i.e. residues encoded by codons that undergo mutation at high frequency during the somatic maturation process see e.g. Chowdhury 207 179 196 2008 and or SDRs a CDRs with the resulting variant VH or VL being tested for binding affinity. Affinity maturation by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries has been described e.g. in Hoogenboom et al. in 178 1 37 O Brien et al. ed. Human Press Totowa N.J. 2001 . In some embodiments of affinity maturation diversity is introduced into the variable genes chosen for maturation by any of a variety of methods e.g. error prone PCR chain shuffling or oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis . A secondary library is then created. The library is then screened to identify any antibody variants with the desired affinity. Another method to introduce diversity involves HVR directed approaches in which several HVR residues e.g. 4 6 residues at a time are randomized HVR residues involved in antigen binding may be specifically identified e.g. using alanine scanning mutagenesis or modeling. CDR H3 and CDR L3 in particular are often targeted.

In certain embodiments substitutions insertions or deletions may occur within one or more HVRs so long as such alterations do not substantially reduce the ability of the antibody to bind antigen. For example conservative alterations e.g. conservative substitutions as provided herein that do not substantially reduce binding affinity may be made in HVRs. Such alterations may be outside of HVR hotspots or SDRs. In certain embodiments of the variant VH and VL sequences provided above each HVR either is unaltered or contains no more than one two or three amino acid substitutions.

A useful method for identification of residues or regions of an antibody that may be targeted for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 1989 244 1081 1085. In this method a residue or group of target residues e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu are identified and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid e.g. alanine or polyalanine to determine whether the interaction of the antibody with antigen is affected. Further substitutions may be introduced at the amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the initial substitutions. Alternatively or additionally a crystal structure of an antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues may be targeted or eliminated as candidates for substitution. Variants may be screened to determine whether they contain the desired properties.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

In certain embodiments an antibody provided herein is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to an antibody may be conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more glycosylation sites is created or removed.

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See e.g. Wright et al. 15 26 32 1997 . The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates e.g. mannose N acetyl glucosamine GlcNAc galactose and sialic acid as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the stem of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.

In one embodiment antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached directly or indirectly to an Fc region. For example the amount of fucose in such antibody may be from 1 to 80 from 1 to 65 from 5 to 65 or from 20 to 40 . The amount of fucose is determined by calculating the average amount of fucose within the sugar chain at Asn297 relative to the sum of all glycostructures attached to Asn 297 e.g. complex hybrid and high mannose structures as measured by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry as described in WO 2008 077546 for example. Asn297 refers to the asparagine residue located at about position 297 in the Fc region Eu numbering of Fc region residues however Asn297 may also be located about 3 amino acids upstream or downstream of position 297 i.e. between positions 294 and 300 due to minor sequence variations in antibodies. Such fucosylation variants may have improved ADCC function. See e.g. US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003 0157108 Presta L. US 2004 0093621 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Examples of publications related to defucosylated or fucose deficient antibody variants include US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 WO2002 031140 Okazaki et al. 336 1239 1249 2004 Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 . Examples of cell lines capable of producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation Ripka et al. 249 533 545 1986 US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta L and WO 2004 056312 A1 Adams et al. especially at Example 11 and knockout cell lines such as alpha 1 6 fucosyltransferase gene FUT8 knockout CHO cells see e.g. Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 Kanda Y. et al. 94 4 680 688 2006 and WO2003 085107 .

Antibodies variants are further provided with bisected oligosaccharides e.g. in which a biantennary oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region of the antibody is bisected by GlcNAc. Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 2003 011878 Jean Mairet et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. and US 2005 0123546 Umana et al. . Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described e.g. in WO 1997 30087 Patel et al. WO 1998 58964 Raju S. and WO 1999 22764 Raju S. .

In certain embodiments one or more amino acid modifications may be introduced into the Fc region of an antibody provided herein thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence e.g. a human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region comprising an amino acid modification e.g. a substitution at one or more amino acid positions.

In certain embodiments the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 492 1991 . Non limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 see e.g. Hellstrom I. et al. 83 7059 7063 1986 and Hellstrom I et al. 82 1499 1502 1985 U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 see Bruggemann M. et al. 166 1351 1361 1987 . Alternatively non radioactive assays methods may be employed see for example ACTI non radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry CellTechnology Inc. Mountain View Calif. and CytoTox 96 non radioactive cytotoxicity assay Promega Madison Wis. . Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 . C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. See e.g. C1q and C3c binding ELISA in WO 2006 029879 and WO 2005 100402. To assess complement activation a CDC assay may be performed see for example Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 Cragg M. S. et al. 101 1045 1052 2003 and Cragg M. S. and M. J. Glennie 103 2738 2743 2004 . FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art see e.g. Petkova S. B. et al. 18 12 1759 1769 2006 .

Antibodies with reduced effector function include those with substitution of one or more of Fc region residues 238 265 269 270 297 327 and 329 U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 . Such Fc mutants include Fc mutants with substitutions at two or more of amino acid positions 265 269 270 297 and 327 including the so called DANA Fc mutant with substitution of residues 265 and 297 to alanine U.S. Pat. No. 7 332 581 .

Certain antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs are described. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 WO 2004 056312 and Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 . 

In certain embodiments an antibody variant comprises an Fc region with one or more amino acid substitutions which improve ADCC e.g. substitutions at positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region EU numbering of residues .

In some embodiments alterations are made in the Fc region that result in altered i.e. either improved or diminished C1q binding and or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity CDC e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551 WO 99 51642 and Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 are described in US2005 0014934A1 Hinton et al. . Those antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Such Fc variants include those with substitutions at one or more of Fc region residues 238 256 265 272 286 303 305 307 311 312 317 340 356 360 362 376 378 380 382 413 424 or 434 e.g. substitution of Fc region residue 434 U.S. Pat. No. 7 371 826 .

See also Duncan Winter 322 738 40 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 260 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 and WO 94 29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants.

In certain embodiments it may be desirable to create cysteine engineered antibodies e.g. thioMAbs in which one or more residues of an antibody are substituted with cysteine residues. In particular embodiments the substituted residues occur at accessible sites of the antibody. By substituting those residues with cysteine reactive thiol groups are thereby positioned at accessible sites of the antibody and may be used to conjugate the antibody to other moieties such as drug moieties or linker drug moieties to create an immunoconjugate as described further herein. In certain embodiments any one or more of the following residues may be substituted with cysteine V205 Kabat numbering of the light chain A118 EU numbering of the heavy chain and S400 EU numbering of the heavy chain Fc region. Cysteine engineered antibodies may be generated as described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 7 521 541.

In certain embodiments an antibody provided herein may be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. The moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody include but are not limited to water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers prolypropylene oxide ethylene oxide copolymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymer is attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

In another embodiment conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube Kam et al. 102 11600 11605 2005 . The radiation may be of any wavelength and includes but is not limited to wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody nonproteinaceous moiety are killed.

Antibodies may be produced using recombinant methods and compositions e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567. In one embodiment isolated nucleic acid encoding an anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibody described herein is provided. Such nucleic acid may encode an amino acid sequence comprising the VL and or an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody e.g. the light and or heavy chains of the antibody . In a further embodiment one or more vectors e.g. expression vectors comprising such nucleic acid are provided. In a further embodiment a host cell comprising such nucleic acid is provided. In one such embodiment a host cell comprises e.g. has been transformed with 1 a vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antibody and an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody or 2 a first vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antibody and a second vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody.

In one embodiment a method of making an anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibody is provided wherein the method comprises culturing a host cell comprising a nucleic acid encoding the antibody as provided above under conditions suitable for expression of the antibody and optionally recovering the antibody from the host cell or host cell culture medium .

For recombinant production of an anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibody nucleic acid encoding an antibody e.g. as described above is isolated and inserted into one or more vectors for further cloning and or expression in a host cell. Such nucleic acid may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody .

Suitable host cells for cloning or expression of antibody encoding vectors include prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells described herein. For example antibodies may be produced in bacteria in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 648 237 5 789 199 and 5 840 523. See also Charlton 248 B. K. C. Lo ed. Humana Press Totowa N.J. 2003 pp. 245 254 describing expression of antibody fragments in . After expression the antibody may be isolated from the bacterial cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be further purified.

In addition to prokaryotes eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody encoding vectors including fungi and yeast strains whose glycosylation pathways have been humanized resulting in the production of an antibody with a partially or fully human glycosylation pattern. See Gerngross 22 1409 1414 2004 and Li et al. 24 210 215 2006 .

Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are also derived from multicellular organisms invertebrates and vertebrates . Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains have been identified which may be used in conjunction with insect cells particularly for transfection of cells.

Plant cell cultures can also be utilized as hosts. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 959 177 6 040 498 6 420 548 7 125 978 and 6 417 429 describing PLANTIBODIES technology for producing antibodies in transgenic plants .

Vertebrate cells may also be used as hosts. For example mammalian cell lines that are adapted to grow in suspension may be useful. Other examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells as described e.g. in Graham et al. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK mouse sertoli cells TM4 cells as described e.g. in Mather 23 243 251 1980 monkey kidney cells CV1 African green monkey kidney cells VERO 76 human cervical carcinoma cells HELA canine kidney cells MDCK buffalo rat liver cells BRL 3A human lung cells W138 human liver cells Hep G2 mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 TRI cells as described e.g. in Mather et al. 383 44 68 1982 MRC 5 cells and FS4 cells.

Anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies provided herein may be identified screened for or characterized for their physical chemical properties and or biological activities by various assays known in the art.

In one aspect an antibody of the invention is tested for its antigen binding activity e.g. by known methods such as ELISA Western blot etc.

In another aspect competition assays may be used to identify an antibody that competes with e.g. any of Fabs A3 A6 A9 B5 F5 or G3 or antibodies G3 1A11 1C12 1F12 2A3 2A6 2D7 2E6 2G4 or hybrid antibodies 1C12 2E6 or 2A3 2E6 as described herein for binding to K11 linked polyubiquitin. In certain embodiments such a competing antibody binds to the same epitope e.g. a linear or a conformational epitope that is bound by any of Fabs A3 A6 A9 B5 F5 or G3 or antibodies G3 1A11 1C12 1F12 2A3 2A6 2D7 2E6 2G4 or hybrid antibodies 1C12 2E6 or 2A3 2E6 as described herein . Detailed exemplary methods for mapping an epitope to which an antibody binds are provided in Morris 1996 Epitope Mapping Protocols in vol. 66 Humana Press Totowa N.J. .

In an exemplary competition assay immobilized K11 linked polyubiquitin is incubated in a solution comprising a first labeled antibody that binds to K11 linked polyubiquitin e.g. antibodies G3 1A11 1C12 1F12 2A3 2A6 2D7 2E6 2G4 or hybrid antibodies 1C12 2E6 or 2A3 2E6 and a second unlabeled antibody that is being tested for its ability to compete with the first antibody for binding to K11 linked polyubiquitin. The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control immobilized K11 linked polyubiquitin is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to K11 linked polyubiquitin excess unbound antibody is removed and the amount of label associated with immobilized K11 linked polyubiquitin is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized K11 linked polyubiquitin is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to K11 linked polyubiquitin.

In addition such definition of chemotherapeutic agents includes bisphosphonates such as clodronate for example BONEFOS or OSTAC DIDROCAL etidronate NE 58095 ZOMETA zoledronic acid zoledronate FOSAMAX alendronate AREDIA pamidronate SKELID tiludronate or ACTONEL risedronate as well as troxacitabine a 1 3 dioxolane nucleoside cytosine analog antisense oligonucleotides particularly those that inhibit expression of genes in signaling pathways implicated in abherant cell proliferation such as for example PKC alpha Raf H Ras and epidermal growth factor receptor EGF R vaccines such as THERATOPE vaccine and gene therapy vaccines for example ALLOVECTIN vaccine LEUVECTIN vaccine and VAXID vaccine LURTOTECAN topoisomerase 1 inhibitor ABARELIX rmRH lapatinib ditosylate an ErbB 2 and EGFR dual tyrosine kinase small molecule inhibitor also known as GW572016 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts acids or derivatives of any of the above.

Such combination therapies noted above encompass combined administration where two or more therapeutic agents are included in the same or separate formulations and separate administration in which case administration of the antibody of the invention can occur prior to simultaneously and or following administration of the additional therapeutic agent and or adjuvant. Antibodies of the invention can also be used in combination with radiation therapy.

An antibody of the invention and any additional therapeutic agent can be administered by any suitable means including parenteral intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local treatment intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration. Dosing can be by any suitable route e.g. by injections such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic. Various dosing schedules including but not limited to single or multiple administrations over various time points bolus administration and pulse infusion are contemplated herein.

Antibodies of the invention would be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation the type of disorder or treatment and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein or about from 1 to 99 of the dosages described herein or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically clinically determined to be appropriate.

The location of the binding target of an antibody of the invention may be taken into consideration in preparation and administration of the antibody. When the binding target is an intracellular molecule certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof to be introduced into the cell where the binding target is located. In one embodiment an antibody of the invention can be expressed intracellularly as an intrabody. The term intrabody as used herein refers to an antibody or antigen binding portion thereof that is expressed intracellularly and that is capable of selectively binding to a target molecule as described in Marasco Gene Therapy 4 11 15 1997 Kontermann Methods 34 163 170 2004 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 004 940 and 6 329 173 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0104402 and PCT Publication No. WO2003 077945. Intracellular expression of an intrabody is effected by introducing a nucleic acid encoding the desired antibody or antigen binding portion thereof lacking the wild type leader sequence and secretory signals normally associated with the gene encoding that antibody of antigen binding fragment into a target cell. Any standard method of introducing nucleic acids into a cell may be used including but not limited to microinjection ballistic injection electroporation calcium phosphate precipitation liposomes and transfection with retroviral adenoviral adeno associated viral and vaccinia vectors carrying the nucleic acid of interest. One or more nucleic acids encoding all or a portion of an anti polyubiquitin antibody of the invention can be delivered to a target cell such that one or more intrabodies are expressed which are capable of intracellular binding to a polyubiquitin and modulation of one or more polyubiquitin mediated cellular pathways.

In another embodiment internalizing antibodies are provided. Antibodies can possess certain characteristics that enhance delivery of antibodies into cells or can be modified to possess such characteristics. Techniques for achieving this are known in the art. For example cationization of an antibody is known to facilitate its uptake into cells see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 703 019 . Lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody into cells. Where antibody fragments are used the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is generally advantageous. For example based upon the variable region sequences of an antibody peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See e.g. Marasco et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 7889 7893 1993 .

Entry of modulator polypeptides into target cells can be enhanced by methods known in the art. For example certain sequences such as those derived from HIV Tat or the Antennapedia homeodomain protein are able to direct efficient uptake of heterologous proteins across cell membranes. See e.g. Chen et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96 4325 4329 1999 .

When the binding target is located in the brain certain embodiments of the invention provide for the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof to traverse the blood brain barrier. Certain neurodegenerative diseases are associated with an increase in permeability of the blood brain barrier such that the antibody or antigen binding fragment can be readily introduced to the brain. When the blood brain barrier remains intact several art known approaches exist for transporting molecules across it including but not limited to physical methods lipid based methods and receptor and channel based methods.

Physical methods of transporting the antibody or antigen binding fragment across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to circumventing the blood brain barrier entirely or by creating openings in the blood brain barrier. Circumvention methods include but are not limited to direct injection into the brain see e.g. Papanastassiou et al. Gene Therapy 9 398 406 2002 interstitial infusion convection enhanced delivery see e.g. Bobo et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 2076 2080 1994 and implanting a delivery device in the brain see e.g. Gill et al. Nature Med. 9 589 595 2003 and Gliadel Wafers Guildford Pharmaceutical . Methods of creating openings in the barrier include but are not limited to ultrasound see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002 0038086 osmotic pressure e.g. by administration of hypertonic mannitol Neuwelt E. A. Implication of the Blood Brain Barrier and its Manipulation vols. 1 2 Plenum Press N.Y. 1989 permeabilization by e.g. bradykinin or permeabilizer A 7 see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 112 596 5 268 164 5 506 206 and 5 686 416 and transfection of neurons that straddle the blood brain barrier with vectors containing genes encoding the antibody or antigen binding fragment see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003 0083299 .

Lipid based methods of transporting the antibody or antigen binding fragment across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to encapsulating the antibody or antigen binding fragment in liposomes that are coupled to antibody binding fragments that bind to receptors on the vascular endothelium of the blood brain barrier see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20020025313 and coating the antibody or antigen binding fragment in low density lipoprotein particles see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040204354 or apolipoprotein E see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040131692 .

Receptor and channel based methods of transporting the antibody or antigen binding fragment across the blood brain barrier include but are not limited to using glucocorticoid blockers to increase permeability of the blood brain barrier see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2002 0065259 2003 0162695 and 2005 0124533 activating potassium channels see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005 0089473 inhibiting ABC drug transporters see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0073713 coating antibodies with a transferrin and modulating activity of the one or more transferrin receptors see e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0129186 and cationizing the antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents will depend on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 mg kg 10 mg kg of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 10 mg kg. Thus one or more doses of about 0.5 mg kg 2.0 mg kg 4.0 mg kg or 10 mg kg or any combination thereof may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently e.g. every week or every three weeks e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty or e.g. about six doses of the antibody . An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

Phage display based isolation of anti K11 linked polyubiquitin antibodies was performed with several different libraries using standard techniques. Briefly enzymatically synthesized full length K11 linked diubiquitin Michael Rape s lab UC Berkeley was immobilized on 96 well Maxisorb immunoplates NUNC . Plates were coated overnight at 4 C. with 5 g mL K11 diubiquitin in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6. The coated plates were subsequently blocked with 200 L well of 2.5 milk in PBS containing 0.05 Tween 20 PBST . The na ve phage library was precipitated from glycerol stocks with volume of 20 PEG 2.5M NaCl and resuspended in 2.5 milk PBST and incubated at 25 C. for one hour. The resuspended phage were added 100 L well to the blocked plates and incubated at 25 C. for four hours with shaking. After binding plates were washed ten times with PBST and phage were eluted with 150 L well of 50 mM HCl 500 mM KCl for 30 minutes at 25 C. with shaking. The elution was neutralized with 150 L well 1M Tris pH 7.5 and subsequently propagated in XL 1 Blue Stratagene with the addition of M13K07 helper phage.

Amplified phage were used for additional rounds of selection against K11 linked diubiquitin as above. In rounds two through four soluble monoubiquitin or polyubiquitin of different linkage forms were added to the phage for counterselection. In the second round 10 g mL of soluble monoubiquitin Boston Biochem was used. In the third and fourth rounds 10 g mL each of soluble monoubiquitin linear diubiquitin K48 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 and K63 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 chains all Boston Biochem were used.

Ninety six individual clones from both the third and the fourth rounds of sorting from each library were grown up in a 96 well format in 1 mL of 2YT broth containing 50 g mL carbenicillin and 10phage mL M13K07 helper phage at 37 C. overnight with shaking. Cells were pelleted and supernatants used in high throughput phage spot ELISAs for binding to K11 linked diubiquitin monoubiquitin linear diubiquitin K48 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 K63 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 an anti gD antibody Genentech or an uncoated well. All of the Fab phage display libraries contained a carboxy terminal gD tag on the light chain which permits assessment of display level by observing the binding of an anti gD antibody. The panel of ubiquitin proteins was immobilized on 384 well Maxisorb immunoplates NUNC as above. Plates were coated overnight at 4 C. with 2 g mL of each ubiquitin protein in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6. The coated plates were subsequently blocked with 60 L well of 2.5 milk in PBST for one hour at 25 C. with shaking. After one hour the blocking buffer was removed and 20 L well of PBST and 10 L well of phage supernatant were added. Plates were incubated at 25 C. for one hour with shaking. The plate was washed six times with PBST. Thirty microliters of a 1 5 000 dilution of an anti M13 horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody GE Healthcare in PBST was used for detection of phage binding. After washing bound secondary antibody was detected using a TMB substrate KPL followed by quenching with an equal volume of 1 M phosphoric acid and spectrophotometric readings at 450 nm.

A na ve anti peptide Fab phage display library was subjected to four rounds of sorting against the above referenced purified K11 linked diubiquitin UC Berkeley as described above. The anti peptide Fab phage display library used contains randomized amino acids in all three heavy chain CDRs and light chain CDRL3 and was based on a modified humanized antibody 4D5 framework with a longer CDRL1 and permitting CDRL2 sequence variation. No enrichment in specific anti K11 linked diubiquitin binders was observed after four rounds of sorting.

Next a na ve YSGX Fab phage display library was subjected to four rounds of sorting against the above referenced purified K11 linked diubiquitin UC Berkeley as described above. The YSGX Fab phage display library used contains randomized amino acids in all three heavy chain CDRs and in light chain CDRL3 see U.S. published patent application no. 2005 0106667 and Fellouse et al. 2007 J. Mol. Biol. 373 924 40 and is based on humanized antibody 4D5. Only a modest three fold enrichment in binders for K11 linked diubiquitin was observed after four rounds of sorting. Of these binders all showed a weak signal for binding to K11 linked diubiquitin with additional weak binding to the other ubiquitin and polyubiquitin forms.

Finally a na ve VH Fab phage display library was subjected to four rounds of sorting against the above referenced K11 linked diubiquitin. The VH Fab phage display library contains randomized amino acids in all three heavy chain CDRs see U.S. Published Patent Application No. US20050119455 and Lee C. W. et al. 2004 JMB 340 1073 93 and is based on a humanized antibody 4D5. Twenty four fold enrichment was observed after four rounds of sorting. Strong K11 linked diubiquitin specific binders were identified from this library sorting. The heavy chains of VH library clones from the third and fourth rounds of sorting were sequenced. The HVR H1 HVR H2 and HVR H3 sequences were expected to be clone specific whereas the heavy chain framework sequences and the entire light chain sequence HVR and framework regions were expected to be invariant based on the VH library design. The HVR L1 sequence was RASQDVSTAVA SEQ ID NO 2 the CDR L2 sequence was SASFLYS SEQ ID NO 3 and the HVR L3 sequence was QQSYTTPPT SEQ ID NO 4 . Six unique heavy chain sequences were identified and given designators A3 A6 A9 B5 F5 and G3. Clone G3 was the strongest binder to K11 linked diubiquitin and the most specific in the phage spot ELISA assay described above it showed no binding to monoubiquitin linear diubiquitin K48 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 or K63 linked polyubiquitin 1 7 . The consensus amino acid sequences of the HVR regions of the heavy chains of these six Fabs were HVR H1 X1 X2 X3 X4 Ile X5 SEQ ID NO 24 wherein X1 is selected from serine and threonine X2 is selected from asparagine aspartic acid serine and glycine X3 is selected from tyrosine serine and threonine X4 is selected from tryptophan aspartic acid glycine and tyrosine and X5 is selected from serine and histidine HVR H2 X6 X7 Ile X8 P X9 G X10 T X11 SEQ ID NO 25 wherein X6 is selected from glycine and alanine X7 is selected from aspartic acid tryptophan glycine glutamic acid and valine X8 is selected from serine tyrosine and asparagine X9 is selected from aspartic acid alanine histidine and asparagine X10 is selected from tyrosine and serine and X11 is selected from tyrosine aspartic acid and asparagine and HVR H3 X12 X13 X14 X15 X16 X17 X18 X19 X20 X21 D SEQ ID NO 26 wherein X12 is selected from arginine and lysine X13 is selected from glutamic acid glycine aspartic acid and proline X14 is selected from serine isoleucine valine and tryptophan X15 is selected from tryptophan glycine tyrosine and phenylalanine X16 is selected from tryptophan tyrosine leucine glycine and phenylalanine X17 is selected from serine tyrosine phenylalanine and glycine X18 is selected from alanine phenylalanine tyrosine and glycine or is not present X19 is selected from tryptophan glycine alanine and tyrosine or is not present X20 is valine or is not present and X21 is selected from methionine and phenylalanine.

Clones from the VH Fab phage display library were expressed under the control of the alkaline phosphatase PhoA promoter. Both the light chain and the heavy chain contained an amino terminal bacterial stII signal sequence to allow secretion in and were expressed from a single phagemid vector. The heavy chain carboxyl terminus was fused in frame to a leucine zipper followed by gene product III gpIII of the M13 bacteriophage allowing for display of a bivalent Fab zip fragment on phage. In order to express soluble Fab a stop codon was introduced into the G3 phagemid between the end of the CH1 constant domain of the Fab and the start of the leucine zipper. Mutagenic oligonucleotides RF6471 1 TCTTGTGACAAAACTCACTAAC GCATGAAACAGCTAGAGG SEQ ID NO 33 and RF6471 2 CCTCTAGCTGTTTCATGCG TTAGTGAGTTTTGTCACAAGA SEQ ID NO 34 were used to insert the stop codon using the QuikChange Lightning Site Directed Mutagenesis kit Stratagene . The resulting soluble G3 Fab expression plasmid was transformed into the strain 62A7 Genentech and plated on solid agar containing carbenicillin. A single colony was used to inoculate 25 mL of 2YT broth containing 50 g mL carbenicillin. The culture was grown overnight at 37 C. and 5 mL were used to inoculate 500 mL of complete C.R.A.P. media 3.57 g NH SO 0.71 g sodium citrate 2HO 1.07 g KCl 5.36 g yeast extract certified 5.36 g Hycase SF Sheffield pH adjusted to 7.3 by addition of KOH and volume adjusted to 872 mL with ultrapure water autoclaved cooled to 55 C. to which was added per L 110 mL 1M MOPS pH 7.3 11 mL 50 glucose and 7 mL 1M MgSO with 50 g mL carbenicillin. The cultures were grown at 30 C. for 24 hours with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were stored at 20 C. The Fab was purified by resuspending the cell pellet in 35 mL of cold wash buffer Phosphate Buffered Saline PBS 150 mM NaCl containing 10 g mL DNaseI Invitrogen 0.2 mg mL lysozyme USB and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride Calbiochem . The pellet was resuspended by vortexing rapidly for 45 minutes at 25 C. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation and lysate was loaded on 1 mL protein A sepharose GE Healthcare column preequilibrated with cold wash buffer. The column was washed with 50 mL of cold wash buffer eluted with 3 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid and neutralized with 150 L of 2 M Tris pH 11.0. The Fab was concentrated using Amicon Ultra 15 centrifugal filter units 10 kDa cut off Millipore . The resulting Fab concentration was determined spectrophotometrically 1 OD 1.5 mg mL .

The affinity of the G3 Fab was determined by surface plasmon resonance SPR using a BIACORE 3000 GE Healthcare . Approximately 60 resonance units RUs of K11 linked diubiquitin Genentech K48 linked diubiquitin Boston Biochem and K63 linked diubiquitin Boston Biochem were immobilized on separate flow cells of a CM5 chip using the amine coupling protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Two fold serial dilutions 0.5 500 nM of G3 Fab in 10 mM Hepes pH 7.2 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 Tween 20 HBST were injected 60 L total at a flow rate of 30 L minute over each flow cell using HBST as the running buffer. The signal for each flow cell was recorded and the reference signal from an unconjugated and blocked flow cell was subtracted. Following a dissociation period of eight minutes the chip surface was regenerated with 20 L of 10 mM HCl. Data were fit to a 1 1 binding model with drifting baseline. Kinetic constants and binding constants were simultaneously calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using software provided by the manufacturer and are shown in Table 2 top row. The average Avg. and the standard deviation Std. dev. from three measurements of the kinetic constants kand k and binding constant K of the G3 Fab are shown. G3 binds K11 linked diubiquitin with a binding constant of 105 nM. It demonstrates no detectable binding to K48 linked diubiquitin or K63 linked diubiquitin.

The purified G3 Fab was tested for binding to a panel of ubiquitin proteins by ELISA. K11 linked diubiquitin UC Berkeley monoubiquitin Boston Biochem linear diubiquitin Boston Biochem K48 linked diubiquitin Boston Biochem and K63 linked diubiquitin Boston Biochem were immobilized on 96 well Maxisorb immunoplates. Plates were coated at 25 C. for two hours with 5 g mL of each protein in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6 with shaking. The coated plates were blocked with 200 L well of 2.5 milk in PBST for one hour at 25 C. with shaking. Twelve two fold serial dilutions of the G3 Fab were made in 2.5 milk in PBST from 1.0 M to 0.5 nM. After one hour the blocking buffer was removed and 100 L well of each G3 Fab dilution was added and incubated at 25 C. for one hour with shaking. The plate was then washed 12 times with PBST using a plate washer. A 1 5 000 dilution of an anti human kappa light chain specific HRP conjugated secondary antibody Sigma Aldrich in PBST was used for detection of Fab binding. 100 L well of the secondary dilution was added and the plate was incubated at 25 C. for 30 minutes with shaking. The plate was then washed 12 times with PBST using a plate washer and twice with PBS manually. Bound secondary antibody was detected using a TMB substrate KPL followed by quenching with an equal volume of 1 M phosphoric acid. The absorbance was read at 450 nm. The G3 Fab showed concentration dependent binding to only K11 linked diubiquitin but not monoubiquitin linear diubiquitin K48 linked diubiquitin or K63 linked diubiquitin . Thus G3 is highly specific for K11 linked diubiquitin in an ELISA format.

The G3 Fab was further tested in an IC50 competition ELISA to get another estimate of affinity. An initial titer ELISA was performed to determine the concentration of Fab at which a signal of OD 0.5 would be achieved. K11 linked diubiquitin Genentech was immobilized on 96 well Maxisorb immunoplates by coating overnight at 4 C. at a concentration of 1 g mL in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6. The coated plates were blocked with 200 L well of 2.5 milk in PBST for one hour at 25 C. with shaking. Twelve two fold serial dilutions of the G3 Fab were made in 2.5 milk in PBST from 1 M to 0.5 nM. After one hour the blocking buffer was removed and 100 L well of each G3 Fab dilution was added and incubated at 25 C. for 15 minutes with shaking. The plate was then washed six times with PBST using a plate washer. A 1 5 000 dilution of a goat anti human Fab fragment specific HRP conjugated secondary antibody Sigma Aldrich in PBST was used for detection of Fab binding. 100 L well of the secondary dilution was added and the plate was incubated at 25 C. for 30 minutes with shaking. The plate was then washed 12 times with PBST using a plate washer and twice with PBS manually. Bound secondary antibody was detected using a TMB substrate KPL followed by quenching with an equal volume of 1 M phosphoric acid. The absorbance was read at 450 nm. The concentration of Fab at which an OD 0.5 was 94 nM. Two fold serial dilutions of soluble K11 linked diubiquitin plus 94 nM of G3 Fab in 2.5 milk in PBST were incubated at 25 C. for one hour with shaking. The amount of unbound Fab at each K11 linked diubiquitin concentration was then measured by incubating the mixtures with a 96 well Maxisorb immunoplate that had been coated with 1 g mL K11 linked diubiquitin and blocked with 2.5 milk in PBST. The Fab K11 mixture was incubated on the plate for 15 minutes at 25 C. with shaking. The plate was then washed six times with PBST using a plate washer. A 1 5 000 dilution of a goat anti human Fab fragment specific HRP conjugated secondary antibody Sigma Aldrich in PBST was used for detection of Fab binding. 100 L well of the secondary dilution was added and the plate was incubated at 25 C. for 30 minutes with shaking. The plate was then washed 12 times with PBST using a plate washer and twice with PBS manually. Bound secondary antibody was detected using a TMB substrate KPL followed by quenching with an equal volume of 1 M phosphoric acid. The absorbance was read at 450 nm. The absorbance was plotted against K11 linked diubiquitin concentration and shows that the IC50 is 75 nM . This is consistent with the 105 nM Kdetermined by SPR above.

The G3 Fab was also tested for its ability to specifically bind to K11 linked diubiquitin UC Berkeley monoubiquitin Boston Biochem linear diubiquitin Boston Biochem K48 linked diubiquitin Boston Biochem and K63 linked diubiquitin Boston Biochem in a Western blot. One g of each protein in 1 LDS buffer Invitrogen with reducing agent was heated at 70 C. for ten minutes and run on 4 12 NuPAGE Bis Tris 1.0 mm gels in MES buffer Invitrogen in duplicate. One gel was stained by coomassie blue to detect all proteins. The other gel was transferred at constant 30 V for one hour by wet transfer in 10 methanol and 1 NuPAGE transfer buffer Invitrogen to 0.2 m nitrocellulose Invitrogen . Non specific binding sites on the membrane were blocked by incubation in 5 milk in PBST for one hour at 25 C. with shaking. The membrane was then incubated in 5 g mL of G3 Fab in 5 milk in PBST for 1.5 hours at 25 C. with shaking. The membrane was washed three times in PBST with shaking. The G3 Fab was detected by incubating the membrane in a 1 10 000 dilution of a goat anti human Fab fragment specific HRP conjugated secondary antibody Sigma Aldrich in 5 milk in PBST for one hour at 25 C. with shaking. The membrane was then washed three times in PBST followed by one wash in PBS. The secondary antibody was detected using Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate Pierce Biotechnology followed by exposure of the blots to film. The G3 Fab detected only the K11 linked diubiquitin but not monoubiquitin linear diubiquitin K48 linked diubiquitin or K63 linked diubiquitin see . Thus it is highly specific for K11 linked diubiquitin in a western blot format as well.

The G3 phagemid clone from the VH library was converted from bivalent Fab zip format to monovalent Fab display for affinity maturation purposes. The leucine zipper between the end of the CH1 constant domain and gpIII was removed using Kunkel mutagenesis see Kunkel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 488 1985 . A TAA stop codon was simultaneously inserted separately into either CDR L1 CDR L2 CDR L3 CDR H3 or both CDRs L3 and H3 resulting in L1 L2 L3 H3 and L3 H3 stop templates respectively for library synthesis. Stop codons force diversity within a particular CDR loop by requiring repair of the stop in order to obtain full length Fab expression and display on phage. Mutagenic oligonucleotide F220 delzip TCTTGTGACAAAACTCACAGTGGCGGTGGCTCTGGT SEQ ID NO 35 was combined separately with each one of the stop codon mutagenic oligonucleotides listed below and 1 g of G3 phagemid Kunkel DNA. The CDR L1 stop mutagenic oligonucleotide used to insert a TAA stop codon at position 24 Kabat numbering within CDR L1 of the light chain was 4D5LC1.stop GTCACCATCACCTGCGCCAGTCAGGATGTG SEQ ID NO 36 . The CDR L2 stop mutagenic oligonucleotide used to insert a TAA stop codon at position 50 Kabat numbering within CDR L2 of the light chain was 4D5LC2.stop GAAGCTTCTGATTTACGCATCCTTCCTCTAC SEQ ID NO 37 . The CDR L3 stop mutagenic oligonucleotide used to insert a TAA stop codon at position 89 Kabat numbering within CDR L3 of the light chain was 4D5LC3.stop GCAACTTATTACTGTCAATCTTATACTACTC SEQ ID NO 38 . The CDR H3 stop mutagenic oligonucleotide used to insert a TAA stop codon at position 98 Kabat numbering within CDR H3 of the heavy chain was VH5CDRH3 413Vh5SRo6 GAGGACACTGCCGTCTATTATTGTGCTCGTGAGGCCTCGCTGCCCCCCTACGTTA TGGACTACTGGGGTCAAGGAACACTAGTC SEQ ID NO 39 . The resulting monovalent Fab phagemid stop templates were used for affinity maturation library generation.

Two affinity maturation approaches were taken. In the first approach libraries were generated which contained amino acid diversity only within the light chain. These light chain libraries allowed for soft randomization of each light chain CDR position as described below. In the second approach libraries were generated which contained amino acid diversity in both the heavy chain and light chain CDRs in various combinations. These heavy chain libraries contained either amino acid diversity found within naturally occurring human antibodies or soft randomization of mainly surface exposed residues as described below.

All libraries were generated by Kunkel mutagenesis see Kunkel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 488 1985 . In the case of soft randomization degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized such that the wild type residue would be retained 50 of the time and 50 of the time one of the remaining 19 amino acids would be encoded. To achieve soft randomization oligonucleotides were designed such that certain nucleotide positions were occupied 70 of the time with the indicated base and 10 of the time occupied by one of the three other bases Gallop et al. J. Med. Chem. 37 1233 1994 . For those oligonucleotides where such soft randomization was included at a particular base the presence of soft randomization is indicated by the presence of a number at that base position. The number 5 indicates that the base adenine is present 70 of the time at that position while the bases guanine cytosine and thymine are each present 10 of the time. Similarly the number 6 refers to guanine 7 to cytosine and 8 to thymine where in each case each of the other three bases is present only 10 of the time. In the case of hard randomization degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized such that amino acid diversity found at certain positions within natural human antibodies would be allowed. In this case degenerate codons were used where the letter R encodes for guanine or adenine Y encodes for thymine or cytosine M encodes for adenine or cytosine K encodes for guanine or thymine S encodes for guanine or cytosine W encodes for adenine or thymine H encodes for adenine cytosine or thymine B encodes for guanine thymine or cytosine V encodes for guanine cytosine or adenine D encodes for guanine adenine or thymine and N encodes for guanine adenine cytosine or thymine.

Four light chain libraries were generated and designated L1 L2 L3 and L1 L2 L3. The L1 library had positions 24 34 Kabat numbering of the light chain soft randomized.

The L1 mutagenic oligonucleotides F111 L1 SEQ ID NO 43 and F202 L1 SEQ ID NO 44 were mixed at a 1 2 ratio. Equal amounts of the L1 oligo mix and mutagenic oligonucleotide G3CDRH3soft SEQ ID NO 56 and 20 g of Kunkel DNA of the L1 stop template described in Example 2A were used to generate the library by Kunkel mutagenesis.

The H2 H3 library had positions 50 52 but not 52a 53 54 98 100 and 100b Kabat numbering of the heavy chain soft randomized. Equal amounts mutagenic oligonucleotides G3CDRH2soft and G3CDRH3soft SEQ ID NOs 55 and 56 and 20 g of Kunkel DNA of the H3 stop template described in Example 2A were used to generate the library by Kunkel mutagenesis.

The H3 library had positions 98 100 and 100b Kabat numbering of the heavy chain soft randomized. The mutagenic oligonucleotide G3CDRH3soft SEQ ID NO 56 and 20 g of Kunkel DNA of the H3 stop template described in Example 2A were used to generate the library by Kunkel mutagenesis.

The mutagenesis reactions were electroporated into electrocompetent XL1 Blue Stratagene and recovered in 25 mL of SOC medium for 45 minutes at 37 C. with shaking. Twenty microliters were removed and ten fold serial dilutions were plated onto solid agar plates containing carbenicillin and grown overnight at 37 C. to determine the library size. The remaining culture was transferred to 500 mL of 2YT broth containing 50 g mL carbenicillin and 10phage mL M13K07 helper phage. The cells were infected at 37 C. for one hour with shaking. 50 g mL of kanamycin was added and the cultures were grown for another seven hours at 37 C. with shaking. The temperature was then shifted to 30 C. and the cultures were grown for another 22 hours. The libraries each contained at least 3.5 10colony forming units CFUs . The phage were purified from the culture supernatant by two rounds of precipitation with volume of 20 polyethylene glycol PEG 2.5M NaCl.

The light chain libraries underwent four rounds of sorting. Each of the four libraries was sorted separately in parallel through all four rounds using the following protocol. The first round was plate based sorting with K11 linked diubiquitin immobilized on a 96 well Maxisorb immunoplate NUNC . Plates were coated overnight at 4 C. with 5 g mL K11 linked diubiquitin UC Berkeley in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6. The coated plates were blocked with 200 L well of 2.5 milk in PBS containing 0.05 Tween 20 PBST for one hour at 25 C. with shaking. The phage libraries were diluted to an OD 2.0 in 2.5 milk in PBST and 30 g mL of monoubiquitin was added for counterselection. After one hour the blocking buffer was removed and 100 L well of the phage was added and incubated at 25 C. for two hours with shaking. After binding the plate was washed 20 times with PBST by manually filling the wells and dumping off the buffer between washes. Phage were eluted with 150 L well of 50 mM HCl 500 mM KCl for 30 minutes at 25 C. with shaking. The elution was neutralized with 150 L well of 1 M Tris pH 7.5 and subsequently propagated in XL1 Blue Stratagene with the addition of M13K07 helper phage.

Amplified phage were used for additional rounds of selection against K11 linked diubiquitin in solution based sorting. K11 linked diubiquitin UC Berkeley was biotinylated with a three fold molar excess of EZ Link Sulfo NHS biotin Pierce Biotechnology . In the second sort neutravidin Pierce Biotechnology was immobilized on a 96 well Maxisorb immunoplate NUNC . Plates were coated overnight at 4 C. with 5 g mL neutravidin in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6. The coated plates were blocked with 200 L well of 2.5 milk in PBST for one hour at 25 C. with shaking. Phage from the first round of sorting were diluted to an OD 1.0 in 2.5 milk in PBST with 250 nM of biotinylated K11 linked diubiquitin UC Berkeley and 10 g mL each of monoubiquitin linear diubiquitin K48 polyubiquitin 2 7 and K63 polyubiquitin 2 7 all from Boston Biochem for counterselection. Phage were allowed to bind the biotinylated K11 linked diubiquitin in solution for two hours at 25 C. with rotation. After binding the phage were diluted five fold in 2.5 milk in PBST and phage bound to the biotinylated K11 linked diubiquitin were captured on the neutravidin plates for 10 minutes at 25 C. with shaking. After capture the plate was washed 30 times with PBST by manually filling the wells and removing the buffer between washes. Phage were eluted with 100 L well of 50 mM HCl 500 mM KCl for 30 minutes at 25 C. with shaking. The elution was neutralized with 100 L well of 1 M Tris pH 7.5 and subsequently propagated in XL1 Blue Stratagene with the addition of M13K07 helper phage.

The stringency of the later sorts was increased in three ways by decreasing the amount of biotinylated K11 linked diubiquitin used in the sort by increasing the number and duration of plate washes and by decreasing the duration of phage binding. The third sort was performed identically to the second sort described above except the number of plate washes was increased to 40. The fourth sort was performed identically to the third sort except the amount of biotinylated K11 linked diubiquitin was decreased to 100 nM the binding time was decreased to one hour and four additional plate washes were added. These washes were incubated at 25 C. for 15 minutes each with shaking. Enrichment was calculated for each round by comparing the number of phage recovered with K11 linked diubiquitin compared to an uncoated well for plate sorting or a neutravidin coated well for solution sorting. Enrichment was observed in all four rounds for all four libraries see Table 3 .

After four rounds of sorting 48 individual clones were picked from each of the four libraries total of 192 and grown up in 96 well format in 1 mL of 2YT broth containing 50 g mL carbenicillin and 10phage mL M13K07 helper phage. Supernatants from those cultures were used in high throughput phage spot ELISAs for binding to K11 linked diubiquitin UC Berkeley monoubiquitin Boston Biochem linear diubiqutin Boston Biochem K48 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 Boston Biochem K63 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 Boston Biochem an anti gD antibody Genentech or an uncoated well as described in Example 1 . Thirty two clones were identified that demonstrated specific binding to K11 linked diubiquitin.

The heavy chain libraries underwent four rounds of sorting. Each of the four libraries were sorted in parallel for the first round and then pooled for sorts two through four. Plate based sorting was used in the first round exactly as described above for the light chain libraries. Amplified phage were used in later rounds of sorting. Stringency of the later sorts was increased in four ways by decreasing the amount of biotinylated K11 linked diubiquitin used in the sort by increasing the number and duration of plate washes by decreasing the duration of phage binding and by adding excess unbiotinylated K11 linked diubiquitin to compete for phage binding before capturing with neutravidin. The second sort was solution based and performed as described above for the light chain libraries except 100 nM biotinylated K11 linked diubiquitin was used and phage from all six libraries was pooled and sorted together. The third sort was performed as described for the light chain libraries except 10 nM biotinylated K11 linked diubiquitin was used and binding time was decreased to one hour. The fourth sort was performed as described above for the light chain libraries except three parallel sorts were done with 5 nM 1 nM and 0.5 nM biotinylated K11 linked diubiquitin. In addition after one hour of phage binding and before capture with neutravidin 30 g mL of unbiotinylated K11 linked diubiquitin UC Berkeley was added and allowed to compete for phage binding for 30 minutes at 25 C. with rotation to select for clones with slower off rates. Enrichment was calculated for each round as described above. Enrichment was observed in all four rounds see Table 3 .

After four rounds of sorting 192 clones were picked and grown up in 96 well format in 1 mL of 2YT broth containing 50 g mL carbenicillin and 10phage mL M13K07 helper phage. Supernatants from those cultures were used in high throughput phage spot ELISAs for binding to K11 linked diubiquitin monoubiquitin linear diubiqutin K48 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 K63 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 an anti gD antibody or an uncoated well as described in Example 1 . Twenty three clones were identified that demonstrated specific binding to K11 linked diubiquitin. Single spot competition phage ELISAs were performed to determine which clones had the biggest improvement in affinity over the parental G3 clone. The phage supernatants from the phage spot ELISAs Example 2C were used. The competition ELISA was performed as described for the IC50 ELISA Example 1B except phage supernatants were used instead of purified Fab and only a single concentration 50 nM of soluble K11 linked diubiquitin Genentech was used. The competition was also performed for each clone without the addition of any soluble K11 linked diubiquitin to determine the phage binding signal in the absence of any competing antigen. The percent inhibition in binding in the presence of 50 nM K11 linked diubiquitin was calculated as 1 ODfor 50 nM K11 ODfor no K11 100 . The G3 parental clone showed on average 33 percent inhibition of binding in the presence of 50 nM K11 linked diubiquitin see Table 4 . Clones showing 60 percent inhibition or greater were selected for further analysis.

Both the light and heavy chains of the highest affinity clones identified in the single spot competition phage ELISA example 2C were sequenced. A total of eight unique affinity matured clones were identified see along with several identical siblings see Table 4 . Clones G3L1.1A11 G3L1.1C12 G3HC.2A3 and G3HC.2G4 contained mutations only within CDR L1. Clones G3HC.2A6 and G3HC.2D7 contained mutations within CDR H3. G3L2.1F12 contained mutations within CDR L2 including an amber stop codon that could be substituted with a glutamine when expressed in an amber suppressor strain such as the XL1 Blue that was used in this phage sorting. Clone G3HC.2E6 contained mutations only within CDR H2.

The consensus amino acid sequences of the light chain HVR regions that displayed variability in the above clones were HVR L1 X22 X23 Ser X24 X25 X26 X27 X28 X29 X30 X31 SEQ ID NO 73 wherein X22 is selected from arginine and glycine X23 is selected from alanine and valine X24 is selected from glutamine and histidine X25 is selected from aspartic acid asparagine and isoleucine X26 is selected from leucine and valine X27 is selected from serine aspartic acid glycine and glutamic acid X28 is selected from threonine and serine X29 is selected from alanine valine and phenylalanine X30 is selected from valine and isoleucine and X31 is selected from alanine and serine and HVR L2 X32 X33 X34 Phe X35 Tyr Ser SEQ ID NO 74 wherein X32 is selected from serine and asparagine X33 is selected from glutamine and alanine X34 is selected from glutamic acid and serine and X35 is selected from leucine and valine.

The consensus amino acid sequences of the heavy chain HVR regions that displayed variability in the above clones were HVR H2 X36 Ile Asn Pro X37 Gly Gly Tyr Thr Tyr Tyr Ala Asp Ser Val Lys Gly SEQ ID NO 75 wherein X36 is selected from alanine and glycine and X37 is selected from alanine and asparagine and HVR H3 Glu Trp Tyr X38 X39 Gly Tyr Val Met Asp Tyr SEQ ID NO 76 wherein X38 is selected from phenylalanine and tyrosine and X39 is selected from glycine and aspartic acid.

The specificity of the eight affinity matured clones for polyubiquitins of different linkages was assessed by phage ELISA. The phage ELISAs were performed as described in Example 1 except that instead of phage supernatants six five fold serial dilutions of purified phage starting at OD 1.0 were used. All of the affinity matured clones bound K11 linked diubiquitin in a phage concentration dependent manner . Only very weak binding to K48 linked polyubiquitin was seen at the highest phage concentration tested.

The G3 parental and eight affinity matured Fab variable domains were cloned into a Fab expression plasmid lacking the gD tag on the light chain constant domain. In addition the amber stop TAG within CDR L2 of clone G3L2.1F12 was mutated to CAG to encode glutamine. Mutagenic oligonucleotides 5 G3LC1F12stopQ CCGAAGCTTCTGATTTACAACCAGGAA TTCGTGTACAGCGGAGTC SEQ ID NO 77 and 3 G2LCF12stopQ GACTCCGCTGTA CACGAATTCCTGGTTGTAAATCAGAAGCTTCGG SEQ ID NO 78 were used to replace the TAG codon with a CAG codon using the QuikChange Lightning Site Directed Mutagenesis kit Stratagene . The resulting plasmids were transformed into strain 64B4 Genentech expressed as soluble Fabs and purified using Protein A sepharose as described in Example 1. Purified Fabs were used in SPR experiments to determine their affinities as described in Example 1 using the same chip. All eight clones showed improved dissociation constants K for K11 linked diubiquitin relative to the parental molecule and no detectable binding to either K48 linked or K63 linked diubiquitin see Table 2 .

The highest affinity clones with mutations in the light chain were G3L1.1C12 and G3HC.2A3 with dissociation constants of 35 nM and 25 nM respectively. Both contained only CDR L1 changes see and improvements in both the on rates k and the off rates k see Table 2 relative to the parental G3 clone were observed. The highest affinity clone with mutations in the heavy chain was G3HC.2E6 with a dissociation constant of 47 nM. This clone contained only CDR H2 changes and only off rate improvement was observed.

Due to the affinity maturation library designs described in Example 2B there was no combination of CDR mutants that would have allowed both CDR L1 and CDR H2 changes. Therefore hybrid Fab phagemids were generated using standard restriction digest cloning methods which combined the light chain of G3L1.1C12 and the heavy chain of G3HC.2E6 resulting in clone 1C12 2E6 or the light chain of G3HC.2A3 and the heavy chain of G3HC.2E6 resulting in clone 2A3 2E6 see . These hybrids were also expressed as soluble Fabs purified and analyzed by SPR as described in Examples 1C and 1D. The combinations of these heavy and light chains resulted in additive affinity improvements see Table 2 . Both 1C12 2E6 and 2A3 2E6 had dissociation constants of 12 nM for K11 linked diubiquitin corresponding to nearly a nine fold improvement in affinity compared to the G3 parental Fab which was due to both improvements in on and off rates for both hybrids. In addition neither 1C12 2E6 nor 2A3 2E6 demonstrated detectable binding to either K48 linked or K63 linked diubiquitin.

The parental Fab G3 and the two affinity matured hybrid Fabs 1C12 2E6 and 2A3 2E6 were expressed in 293 cells as human immunoglobulins IgGs . Expression constructs were generated by cloning the Fab variable domains into pRK mammalian expression constructs encoding the heavy and light chains of human kappa IgG1 Gorman et al. DNA Prot. Eng. Tech. 2 3 10 1990 . IgGs were purified by affinity chromatography on protein A sepharose columns by standard methodologies as described for the Fab purification in Example 1 and buffer exchanged into PBS using PD10 desalting columns GE Healthcare .

The affinities of the hybrid Fabs were initially determined by SPR using amine coupling of the antigen directly on a CM5 chip Example 2F . This involved the primary amines of available lysine side chains on the antigen. Lysines involved in isopeptide bonds linking two ubiquitin monomers together to form diubiquitin would be unavailable for coupling. Since K11 K48 and K63 linked diubiquitin have different lysine residues participating in the isopeptide bond the lysines available for coupling to the chip are also different and therefore different epitopes may be available or unavailable for antibody binding accordingly.

To avoid potentially confounding effects of lysines coupled to the chip the affinities of the IgGs generated in this example were tested in SPR using an IgG capture method on a BIACORE 3000 GE Healthcare . Approximately 11 500 resonance units RUs of an anti human Fc capture antibody GE Healthcare were immobilized on flow cells one and two of a CM5 chip using the amine coupling protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Sixty L of 0.5 g mL IgG in 10 mM Hepes pH 7.2 150 mM NaCl and 0.01 Tween 20 HBST was injected at a flow rate of 30 L minute over flow cell two resulting in capture of approximately 800 RUs of IgG. Flow cell one had only the capture antibody on it to serve as a reference subtraction. Two fold serial dilutions 0.5 500 nM of K11 linked diubiquitin Genentech K48 linked diubiquitin Boston Biochem or K63 linked diubiquitin Boston Biochem in HBST were injected 60 L total at a flow rate of 30 L minute over flow cells one and two. The signal for each flow cell was recorded and the reference signal was subtracted. Following a dissociation period of four minutes the chip surface was regenerated with 15 L of 3M MgCl. Data were fit to a 1 1 binding model with mass transfer for the G3 IgG or a 1 1 binding model with drifting baseline for 1C12 2E6 and 2A3 2E6 IgGs. Kinetic constants and binding constants were simultaneously calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using software provided by the manufacturer and are shown in Table 5.

The G3 IgG had a Kfor binding K11 diubiquitin of 129 nM whereas both the 1C12 2E6 and 2A3 2E6 IgGs bound with a Kof 20 nM. These affinities were consistent and within the acceptable two fold range of error of the binding constants measured for the same Fabs using the direct coupling of antigen method see Table 2 . In addition no detectable binding to K48 linked diubiquitin or K63 linked diubiquitin was observed.

The specificity of the G3 parental 1C12 2E6 and 2A3 2E6 IgGs were tested for binding to a panel of ubiquitin proteins by ELISA. K11 linked diubiquitin Genentech monoubiquitin linear diubiquitin K48 linked diubiquitin K63 linked diubiquitin K48 linked polyubiquitin K63 linked polyubiquitin all from Boston Biochem were immobilized on 96 well Maxisorb immunoplates. Plates were coated at 25 C. for two hours with 1 g mL of each protein in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6 with shaking. The coated plates were blocked with 200 L well of 2.5 milk in PBST for one hour at 25 C. with shaking. Eleven two fold serial dilutions of the G3 parental 1C12 2E6 and 2A3 2E6 IgGs were made in 2.5 milk in PBST from 20 g mL to 0.02 g mL. After one hour the blocking buffer was removed and 100 L well of each IgG dilution was added and incubated at 25 C. for one hour with shaking. The plate was then washed six times with PBST using a plate washer. A 1 5 000 dilution of a goat anti human Fc specific HRP conjugated F ab secondary antibody Jackson Immunoresearch in PBST was used for detection of IgG binding. One hundred L well of the secondary antibody dilution was added and the plate was incubated at 25 C. for 30 minutes with shaking. The plate was then washed 12 times with PBST using a plate washer and twice with PBS manually. Bound secondary antibody was detected using a TMB substrate KPL followed by quenching with an equal volume of 1 M phosphoric acid. The absorbance was read at 450 nm. All three IgGs recognized K11 linked diubiquitin even at very low concentrations of IgG. Approximately the same signal for K11 linked diubiquitin binding was observed for G3 1C12 2E6 and 2A3 2E6 at each IgG concentration despite the fact that there is a seven to nine fold difference in affinity between them. Thus this ELISA format was not able to distinguish between the affinities of the parental IgG and the affinity matured variants. In addition at low IgG concentrations all three IgGs were highly specific however upon increasing the IgG concentration towards 20 g mL some limited nonspecific binding to K48 linked polyubiquitin K63 linked diubiquitin and K63 linked polyubiquitin could be seen for both 1C12 2E6 and 2A3 2E6 in this assay format.

To identify a more stringent condition that would allow one to distinguish between the affinities of the different IgGs and provide more specific recognition of K11 linked diubiquitin in this assay format the ELISAs were performed again in a buffer containing 4 M urea 4 M urea 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 135 mM NaCl 1 Triton X 100 10 glycerol 1 mM EDTA 1.5 mM MgCl . Under these stringent conditions very little binding to K11 linked diubiquitin was observed for the G3 parental IgG except at the highest concentration of IgG tested 20 g mL . In contrast for the affinity matured variants 1C12 2E6 and 2A3 2E6 strong binding was seen at all concentrations including the lowest IgG concentration of 0.02 g mL. In addition the use of 4 M urea buffer allows a high degree of specificity for K11 linked diubiquitin to be maintained. Only 1C12 2E6 showed very weak binding to K48 linked polyubiquitin at the highest concentration of IgG tested. 2A3 2E6 shows no binding to any of the ubiquitin forms other than K11 linked diubiquitin even at the highest concentration of IgG tested 20 g mL . Therefore under these stringent conditions an increased affinity translates to increased function of the antibodies in the ELISA.

The G3 parental 1C12 2E6 and 2A3 2E6 IgGs were first tested for their ability to detect pure diubiquitin chains in a western blot. Seven two fold serial dilutions of K11 linked diubiquitin Genentech from 1 g to 15 ng and 1 g each of monoubiquitin linear diubiquitin K48 linked diubiquitin and K63 linked diubiquitin all from Boston Biochem in 1 LDS buffer Invitrogen were heated at 70 C. for ten minutes and run on 4 12 Bis Tris NuPAGE 1.0 mm gels Invitrogen under non reducing conditions in MES buffer Invitrogen in quadruplicate. One gel was stained by Coomassie to detect all proteins. The other three gels were transferred at 30 V constant for one hour by wet transfer in 10 methanol and 1 NuPAGE transfer buffer Invitrogen to 0.2 m nitrocellulose Invitrogen . Non specific binding sites on the membranes were blocked by incubation in 5 milk in PBST for one hour at 25 C. with shaking. The membranes were then incubated in 1 g mL of G3 1C12 2E6 or 2A3 2E6 IgG in 5 milk in PBST for one hour at 25 C. with shaking. The membrane was washed three times in PBST with shaking. The IgGs were detected by incubating the membrane in a 1 10 000 dilution of a goat anti human Fc specific HRP conjugated F ab secondary antibody Jackson Immunoresearch in 5 milk in PBST for one hour at 25 C. with shaking. The membrane was then washed three times in PBST followed by one wash in PBS. The secondary antibody was detected using Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate Pierce Biotechnology followed by exposure of the blots to film.

All three IgGs detected only K11 linked diubiquitin but not monoubiquitin linear diubiquitin K48 linked diubiquitin or K63 linked diubiquitin indicating that they are highly specific for K11 linked diubiquitin in a western blot context see . In addition the affinity matured variants were much more sensitive than the G3 parental IgG in that they were able to detect as little as 15 ng of K11 linked diubiquitin whereas the G3 IgG limit of detection was 125 ng in this particular blot exposure. Therefore the approximately seven to nine fold improvement in affinity of the hybrids over the parental antibody translated into improved function in a western blot in recognition of K11 linked diubiquitin. Despite increased affinity for the desired antigen specificity is maintained and there was no detectable binding of either 1C12 2E6 or 2A3 2E6 IgG to any of the other ubiquitin forms tested. Since the 1C12 2E6 and 2A3 2E6 affinity matured variants behaved identically in SPR analysis specificity IgG ELISAs and western blots for diubiquitin described above only 2A3 2E6 was used in further testing.

The K11 linkage specific antibodies were generated against a K11 linked diubiquitin antigen so they presumably recognized either the linkage itself or more likely the surrounding surface residues on the donor and acceptor ubiquitins that are placed in close proximity due to the conformation of diubiquitin which results from the K11 linkage. Since diubiquitin is the smallest recognition unit of antigen and K11 linked polyubiquitin is a polymer chain with diubiquitin as the repeating monomer unit the antibodies should also bind longer polyubiquitin chains joined by K11 linkages. To examine this the 2A3 2E6 IgG was tested for its ability to detect pure polyubiquitin chains in a western blot. 1 g each of monoubiquitin Boston Biochem K48 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 Boston Biochem K63 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 Boston Biochem and K11 linked polyubiquitin Genentech in 1 LDS buffer Invitrogen with reducing agent was heated at 70 C. for ten minutes and run on 4 12 Bis Tris NuPAGE 1.0 mm gels Invitrogen under reducing conditions in MES buffer Invitrogen in triplicate. One gel was stained by SimplyBlue coomassie stain Invitrogen to detect all proteins. The remainder of the western blot was performed as above except that the transfer to 0.45 m nitrocellulose Invitrogen was performed at 30V for two hours. Whereas the control pan ubiquitin antibody P4D1 recognized monoubiquitin K48 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 K63 linked polyubiquitin 2 7 and K11 linked polyubiquitin the 2A3 2E6 IgG recognized only K11 linked polyubiquitin see . Thus just as with K11 linked diubiquitin the 2A3 2E6 antibody can detect polyubiquitin chains containing the K11 linkage but does not recognize polyubiquitin chains of other linkages.

Since the 2A3 2E6 antibody could specifically bind to pure K11 linked polyubiquitin chains the 2A3 2E6 IgG was next tested for its ability to detect K11 linked polyubiquitin chains from both mammalian and yeast whole cell lysates. 293T cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Media DMEM supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum FBS and 2 mM L glutamine. Cells were scraped from the plates spun down at 2000 rpm for ten minutes at 4 C. washed with 20 mL of cold PBS and repelleted. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 8 M urea 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 25 mM NaCl 10 L mL of 100 Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitors Pierce Biotechnology 5 mM EDTA Pierce Biotechnology and 2 mM N ethylmalemide NEM Pierce Biotechnology and then briefly sonicated to reduce the viscosity. The lysate was diluted two fold to 4 M urea in immunoprecipitation IP buffer 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 135 mM NaCl 1 Triton X 100 10 glycerol 1 mM EDTA 1.5 mM MgCl . strain YRG 2 Stratagene was grown in YEPD media at 30 C. overnight. 18 mL of cells were pelleted at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes washed in water and repelleted resulting in a 400 mg cell pellet. Cells were lysed according to the manufacturer s instructions in 1 mL of Y PER Pierce Biotechnology supplemented with 25 M MG132 Cayman Chemical 2 mM NEM Pierce Biotechnology 1 mM PMSF Calbiochem and 5 mM dithiolthreitol DTT .

Fifty nanograms of K11 linked diubiquitin Genentech 1 g of K48 linked diubiquitin Boston Biochem 1 g of K63 linked diubiquitin Boston Biochem 100 g of total protein from the 293T cell lysate and 22 L of the cell lysate in 1 LDS buffer Invitrogen with reducing agent was heated at 70 C. for ten minutes and run on 4 12 Bis Tris NuPAGE 1.0 mm gels Invitrogen under reducing conditions in MES buffer Invitrogen in duplicate. The gel transfer and western blots were performed as described above except that the transfer to 0.45 m nitrocellulose Invitrogen was performed at 30V for two hours. The 2A3 2E6 IgG detected the positive control K11 linked diubiquitin but neither of the negative controls K48 linked diubiquitin or K63 linked diubiquitin . In addition 2A3 2E6 was able to recognize a high molecular weight smear characteristic of polyubiquitination from the 293T cell lysate as well as several high molecular weight bands from the yeast cell lysate. Thus this IgG also was capable of detecting K11 linked polyubiquitin chains from whole cell lysates.

To further characterize the specificity of the antibody and determine whether it could be used for immunoprecipitations IPs a MuRF1 autoubiquitination reaction was used to generate a pure substrate modified with polyubiquitin chains of multiple linkages. MuRF1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is known to autoubiquitinate itself in the absence of substrate with K11 linked K48 linked and K63 linked polyubiquitin chains when combined with the E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme Ube1 and the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcH5c Kim H. T. et al. 2007 JBC 282 17375 86 . Autoubiquitination reactions were carried out with 100 nM recombinant human His Ube1 Boston Biochem 5 M recombinant human UbcH5c Boston Biochem 1 M recombinant human His MuRF1 Boston Biochem 100 M recombinant human ubiquitin Boston Biochem 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 20 mM KCl 5 mM MgCl 2 mM adenosine triphosphate ATP and 1 mM DTT in a total volume of 40 L at 37 C. for 1.5 hours. The reactions were performed with both wild type ubiquitin as well as K11R mutant ubiquitin Boston Biochem to prevent the formation of K11 linked chains in order to probe the specificity of the antibody. Six microliters of each reaction was diluted 100 fold with IP buffer 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 135 mM NaCl 1 Triton X 100 10 glycerol 1 mM EDTA 1.5 mM MgCl containing 4 M 2 M 1 M 0.5 M or 0 M urea. Each IP reaction was precleared with 50 L of Protein A Dynabeads Invitrogen at 25 C. for one hour with rotation. Beads were captured with a magnet and supernatants were transferred to new tubes. Twenty micrograms of 2A3 2E6 IgG was added to each IP and incubated at 25 C. overnight with rotation. The next day the IgG was captured with 100 L of Protein A Dynabeads per IP by incubating at 25 C. for 15 minutes with rotation. Beads were captured and washed three times with 1 mL of lysis buffer containing the appropriate amount of urea and then twice with 1 mL of PBS capturing between each wash. During the final wash the beads were transferred to a new tube. The IP material was eluted by resuspending the beads in 20 L of 1 LDS sample buffer Invitrogen with reducing agent and incubating at 70 C. for ten minutes.

Ten percent of each input reaction and 100 of the IP material was run on 4 12 Bis Tris NuPAGE 1.0 mm gels Invitrogen under reducing conditions in MES buffer Invitrogen . Western blots were carried out as described above with the pan ubiquitin P4D1 antibody. The results demonstrated that under all tested concentrations of urea the 2A3 2E6 antibody was capable of immunoprecipitating the autoubiquitinated MuRF1 when wild type ubiquitin was used in the autoubiquitination reaction . In addition no IP of residual monoubiquitin present in the input lane was seen.

When K11R mutant ubiquitin is used it blocks the ability of MuRF1 to generate K11 linked polyubiquitin chains however the autoubiquitination still generates K48 linked and K63 linked chains. Therefore one would expect that if the 2A3 2E6 IgG is specific for K11 linked chains then no IP of autoubiquitinated MuRF1 should be observed when K11R mutant ubiquitin is used. Indeed this was the case when the IP was performed in the presence of 4 M urea indicating that the 2A3 2E6 IgG is highly specific for K11 linked chains under those conditions . This specificity was lost when the urea concentration is reduced to 2 M. This is consistent with the increased specificity seen with 4 M urea in the ELISAs shown in Example 3A as well as the specificity seen under 4 M urea in IPs with other ubiquitin linkage specific antibodies generated against the K48 and K63 linkages see e.g. the antibodies described in published patent application US20070218069 .

To further probe the specificity of the IgG in IPs four MuRF1 autoubiquitination reactions were performed using recombinant human wild type K11R mutant K48R mutant and K63R mutant ubiquitin Boston Biochem as described above. Use of the lysine to arginine mutants prevents polyubiquitin linkages from being formed through those specific lysines. The four reactions were then split and equal portions were subjected to IP by the 2A3 2E6 IgG and a human kappa IgG1 isotype control antibody that does not specifically bind to any form of ubiquitin Genentech . The input material from each autoubiquitination reaction as well each immunoprecipitated sample were separated by parallel SDS PAGE gels for Coomassie staining and western blot analysis with the pan ubiquitin P4D1 antibody as described above.

As shown in the 2A3 2E6 IgG was able to IP autoubiquitinated MuRF1 only when K11 linked chains were present when wild type K48R or K63R mutant ubiquitin was used . When the K11R mutant ubiquitin was used MuRF1 was not able to assemble K11 linked chains see mass spectrometry confirmation below and the 2A3 2E6 IgG was unable to IP any autoubiquitinated MuRF1 under those conditions. In contrast the isotype control antibody was unable to IP any autoubiquitinated MuRF1 from any of the four autoubiquitination reactions.

Guided by the pan ubiquitin western blot signal mass spectrometry analysis was performed on the high molecular weight gel region 188 kDa . Briefly the portion of the gel corresponding to this region was excised and subjected to in gel tryptic digestion. Gel pieces were destained using 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate 50 methanol and then desiccated with acetonitrile ACN . To permit effective uptake of trypsin gel pieces were incubated on ice for 2 hours with 20 ng L modified sequencing grade trypsin Promega diluted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate 5 ACN. Digests were performed overnight at 37 C. and stopped by the addition of 50 ACN 5 formic acid FA . Isotope labeled internal standard peptides 1 pmol were added to each sample prior to two rounds of extraction. Extracted peptides were dried completely and resuspended in 10 ACN 5 FA 0.01 hydrogen peroxide at least 30 minutes prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Samples were loaded directly onto a Thermo AQUASIL C18 column 2.1 150 mm and separated using an Agilent 1200 capillary LC at a flow rate of 200 L min over a 26 minute gradient of 5 to 90 buffer B 98 ACN 0.1 FA . Mass spectrometric detection was performed on an ABI 4000 QTRAP using a segmented multiple reaction monitoring MRM method for detecting both labeled and unlabeled peptides covering the sequence of ubiquitin. Quantitation was performed by comparing peak areas between labeled and unlabeled versions of each peptide using ABI Multiquant 1.1 software.

Input samples from the wild type ubiquitin reaction showed a mixture of K11 K48 and K63 linked polyubiquitin chains while reactions with ubiquitin mutants K11R K48R and K63R were deficient in K11 K48 and K63 linkages respectively . In the sample immunoprecipitated by the 2A3 2E6 IgG from the reaction using wild type ubiquitin the polyubiquitin linkage profiles remained similar to the input material see suggesting that the majority of substrate molecules carry each of the three primary linkages K11 K48 and K63 . Similar results were obtained during characterization of anti K48 and anti K63 linkage specific antibodies Newton K. et al. 2008 Cell 134 668 678 . Immunoprecipitation with the 2A3 2E6 IgG from the K48R and K63R mutant ubiquitin reactions pulled down autoubiquitinated MuRF1 with polyubiquitin linkage profiles similar to their corresponding inputs. By contrast the 2A3 2E6 IgG failed to immunoprecipitate polyubiquitin from K11R mutant ubiquitin reactions due to the lack of the target linkage. This indicates that the 2A3 2E6 IgG is highly specific for K11 linked chains in IPs. As expected the isotype control antibody was unable to pull down ubiquitin from any of the four reactions.

The 2A3 2E6 IgG was also tested for its ability to IP K11 linked polyubiquitin chains from whole cell lysates. 293T cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Media DMEM supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum FBS and 2 mM L glutamine. Cells were transfected with plasmids to over express human wild type ubiquitin K0 mutant ubiquitin all seven lysines mutated to arginine or were mock transfected . Transfections were performed according to the manufacturer s instructions using 25 g of DNA and 75 L of Lipofectamine 2000 Invitrogen per five 10 cm plates. Forty eight hours after transfection the cells were harvested and lysed as described above. The total protein concentration of each lysate was adjusted to 10 mg mL in 8 M urea. Lysates were then diluted to 4 M urea with IP buffer 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 135 mM NaCl 1 Triton X 100 10 glycerol 1 mM EDTA 1.5 mM MgCl resulting in a total protein concentration of 5 mg mL. A volume of 1 mL 5 mg of total protein was used per IP reaction.

In addition to IPs performed with the 2A3 2E6 IgG a human kappa IgG1 isotype control antibody that does not specifically bind to any form of ubiquitin Genentech was also used. Each IP reaction was precleared with 100 L of Protein A Dynabeads Invitrogen at 25 C. for two hours with rotation followed by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 2 minutes to remove precipitated material. Beads were captured with a magnet and supernatants were transferred to new tubes. Forty g of 2A3 2E6 or control IgG was added to each IP and incubated at 25 C. overnight with rotation. The next day the IgG was captured with 200 L of Protein A Dynabeads per IP by incubating at 25 C. for 15 minutes with rotation. Beads were captured and washed five times with 1 mL of 4 M urea IP buffer 4 M urea 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 135 mM NaCl 1 Triton X 100 10 glycerol 1 mM EDTA 1.5 mM MgCl and then five times with 1 mL of PBS capturing between each wash. During the final wash the beads were transferred to a new tube. The IP material was eluted by resuspending the beads in 15 L of 1 LDS sample buffer Invitrogen with reducing agent and incubating at 70 C. for ten minutes. For western blot analysis 0.1 of the 5 mg mL whole cell lysate input and 10 of the IP material was run on a 4 12 Bis Tris NuPAGE 1.0 mm gel Invitrogen under reducing conditions in MES buffer Invitrogen . Western blots were carried out as described above using the pan ubiquitin P4D1 antibody. For mass spectrometry analysis 10 of the 5 mg mL whole cell lysate input and 90 of the IP material was run a 4 12 Bis Tris NuPAGE 1.0 mm gel Invitrogen under reducing conditions in MES buffer Invitrogen . The gel was stained with SimplyBlue stain Invitrogen .

In the mock transfected lysate relatively little polyubiquitin was present and immunoprecipitated by 2A3 2E6 . When wild type ubiquitin was overexpressed polyubiquitin chains within the whole cell lysate were greatly increased along with polyubiquitin chains pulled down by 2A3 2E6 suggesting that K11 linked polyubiquitin chains are upregulated upon ubiquitin over expression. Surprisingly when the K0 mutant ubiquitin which has all lysine residues mutated to arginines and therefore cannot form polyubiquitin chains containing isopeptide bonds is overexpressed polyubiquitin chains are also highly upregulated. This suggests that over expression of K0 leads to increased synthesis of polyubiquitin chains containing endogenous ubiquitin. A large portion of these chains must have been K11 linked since 2A3 2E6 was able to IP them. To determine whether that was indeed the case mass spectrophotometric analysis was performed as described above with the exception that gel pieces were incubated on ice for 45 minutes with 20 ng L modified sequencing grade trypsin Promega diluted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate 5 ACN and then the trypsin solution was removed and replaced with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate 5 ACN prior to overnight digestion at 37 C. Two molecular weight regions from the coomassie stained polyacrylamide gel corresponding to 188 kDa were analyzed .

Quantitative analysis of these samples showed enrichment of K11 linkages in the immunoprecipitations relative to the percentage of K11 linkages present in the input lysates . The detection of significant levels of K48 and K63 linkages suggested that individual substrates commonly carry ubiquitin chains of different linkages either as heterogeneous mixed linkage chains or possibly as homogenous chains on separate substrate lysines. Immunoprecipitations performed with an isotype control Ab revealed negligible amounts of ubiquitin in chains in all cases data not shown consistent with the western blot results in .
