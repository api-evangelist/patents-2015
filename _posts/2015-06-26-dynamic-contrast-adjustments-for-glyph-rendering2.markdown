title: Dynamic contrast adjustments for glyph rendering
abstract: Systems, methods, and computer-readable media are disclosed for dynamic contrast adjustment for glyph rendering. Example methods may include rendering a first glyph associated with a font in a first font size, increasing a first contrast of the first glyph in the first font size by adjusting a first grayscale value associated with the first glyph in the first font size to generate an adjusted first grayscale value, and storing the adjusted first grayscale value in a grayscale mapping table associated with the font, the grayscale mapping table comprising a default grayscale value for the first glyph in a second font size. Example methods may include generating a font file comprising the first glyph and the grayscale mapping table.

The continued proliferation of digital works has led to an increase in the availability of such works. Similarly there has been an increase in the availability of electronic devices and applications used for consuming these works. For instance users consume digital content such as electronic books eBooks on an assortment of electronic devices. Electronic devices may include various types and sizes of displays such as electronic ink displays and liquid crystal displays. Digital content may appear different on different electronic device displays. Accordingly visual appearance of the same digital content may vary across different devices resulting in reduced readability on certain electronic devices.

This disclosure relates to among other things systems methods computer readable media techniques and methodologies for dynamic contrast adjustments for glyph rendering. Users may consume digital content such as text content on electronic devices also referred to herein as user devices . Electronic devices may have various display types or display sizes. Accordingly certain digital content may be rendered or may otherwise appear differently on different devices. In one example a visual contrast or appearance of text content may be different on an electronic device with an electronic ink e ink display than on an electronic device with a frontlit or backlit display. Further fonts and font sizes may impact the appearance and readability of text content on a display of an electronic device.

Embodiments of the disclosure may facilitate dynamic contrast adjustments for glyph rendering such that the visual contrast or readability of certain text content may be customized or improved on a particular electronic device. Further because only certain types of text content such as text of a certain font or text at a certain font size may be affected or may have a reduced contrast on a particular device embodiments of the disclosure may independently adjust a contrast for a particular glyph for a particular font size and or for a particular category or subcategory of glyphs. Contrast may be a difference in luminance or color that makes a representation of an object distinguishable and may be determined by a difference in a color and brightness of the object and other objects within the same field of view. Accordingly contrast adjustments for particular glyphs of a font may be facilitated by embodiments of the disclosure as well as contrast adjustments for every glyph associated with a font. Embodiments of the disclosure may include color text halftone text and grayscale text as well as related contrast adjustment functionality for respective text types. Embodiments of the disclosure may further be used by operators or users with contrast adjustment permissions to set or adjust default contrast values for particular glyphs or categories of glyphs on a particular device.

The systems methods computer readable media techniques and methodologies for dynamic contrast adjustments for glyph rendering may facilitate contrast adjustments for individual or multiple glyphs of a font. For example if only glyphs of a font size 12 and under are poorly visible or have insufficient contrast embodiments of the disclosure may increase the contrast for those glyphs while leaving the remaining glyphs at a default contrast. Further embodiments of the disclosure may automatically identify and or adjust a contrast for glyphs related to a glyph for which the contrast has been adjusted. For example if the contrast for a glyph such as b in font size 16 has been adjusted by a particular amount embodiments of the disclosure may identify a glyph such as d that has similar glyph features and may automatically adjust a contrast of d by the same amount. Glyph categories and or subcategories which may include glyphs having a certain level of similarity may be generated by embodiments of the disclosure. For example glyph categories may be generated based at least in part on a number of curves in a glyph a slope of curves in a glyph a length of curves in a glyph a number of straight lines in a glyph a length of straight lines in a glyph and the like.

Embodiments of the disclosure may adjust a contrast value for one or more glyphs by modifying a grayscale value associated with the particular glyph or category of glyphs. Grayscale values may indicate a range of shading for pixels from white to black with numerical values. For example grayscale values may range from 0 255 where a grayscale value of 0 may represent a black color and a grayscale value of 255 may represent a white color.

Referring now to an example embodiment of a user interface in accordance with one or more embodiments of the disclosure is illustrated. also includes a user such as an operator and a user device or operator device . The operator may be a master user or user with permissions to set and or adjust default contrast values for one or more glyphs associated with a particular font by modifying at least one grayscale value associated with a particular glyph or category of glyphs. For example the operator may be a maker or manufacturer of the operator device an author or developer of a particular font or mobile application an author or publisher of digital content or another user with permission to set and or adjust default contrast values. In some embodiments the operator may not be a human and may be a machine or apparatus configured to set and or adjust contrast values. For example the operator may be a camera or other apparatus configured to determine an appearance of glyphs on a display of the operator device . The operator device may be a user device or other configuration device that is configured to set and or adjust default contrast values. For example the operator device may be a master device that may be used to configure default contrast values for particular glyphs. The user interface may be presented to the operator and access to the user interface may be limited to users or operators with appropriate permissions in some embodiments. The operator may desire to set and or adjust one or more default contrast values for particular glyphs or categories of glyphs or may desire to consume digital content such as text on a display of the operator device . Example types of text content may include without limitation electronic books eBooks or other electronic publications e.g. magazines comic books Manga books social media news feeds documents websites other Internet content etc. or the like. Content may include text content graphical content audio content video content or the like and may include information that is broadcast streamed or contained in computer files stored on a device configured to render the content. While example embodiments of the disclosure may be described in the context of eBooks and or electronic reader e reader devices it should be appreciated that the disclosure is more broadly applicable to any form of digital content consumable on any suitable user device including without limitation a smartphone a tablet a wearable device a content streaming device a digital media consumption device a video game console a set top box or any other suitable device. The display may be any one of an e ink display a frontlit display a backlit display or another display and may be of any dimension. For example the display may be dimensioned as a smartphone display a tablet display a laptop display a desktop display or another dimension.

In the operator may use the operator device to consume for example an eBook on the display . Prior to presenting the eBook on the display the operator device may identify one or more fonts and or glyphs used in the eBook. Glyphs may be symbols representative of readable characters that convey information to a user. More specifically a glyph may be indicative of an individual letter or character of an alphabet a number a symbol a punctuation mark and or another symbol. Glyphs may include glyph data that can be used by a renderer or rendering engine to generate lines and or curves that form the glyph. Each font and or typeface may include a set of one or more glyphs. A typeface as described herein may include a set of one or more fonts. Fonts may include one or more of a particular size weight and or style of a typeface. For example Times New Roman may be considered a typeface and Times New Roman Italics may be considered a font. Font and typeface may be used interchangeably herein. A glyph may be constructed in any number of font sizes however the glyph

Upon determining which fonts and or glyphs are used in the eBook the operator device may generate one or more glyph categories including groups of similar glyphs as determined by one or more similarity metrics. For example the operator device may generate a glyph category of glyphs including glyphs with curved portions such as c and o. Curved portions may include any portions that form a glyph that are curved such as Bezier curves. Bezier curves may be parametric curves used to form curved portions of some glyphs. In another example the operator device may generate a glyph category including glyphs with a number of curved portions within a certain range such as equal to or greater than 1 curved portion and less than or equal to 2 curved portions such as a and u. The operator device may further generate glyph categories for example for glyphs with both curved portions and straight portions such as b and d as well as for glyphs having curved portions with certain slopes or for glyphs having curved portions or straight line portions with certain lengths. Any of the glyph categories generated by the operator device may be generated as subcategories of a glyph category. For example a glyph category including all glyphs with only straight line portions may include a subcategory of glyphs with 2 straight line portions such as V and another subcategory of glyphs with 3 straight line portions such as E or A. In the example of the operator device may generate a glyph category including glyphs with a range of 1 to 3 curved portions which may include among others a b c d g and h. For example an a glyph may include a curved portion and a straight portion . Because the a glyph includes between 1 and 3 curved portions the a glyph may be included in the glyph category.

Upon generating the glyph categories and or subcategories in some embodiments the operator device may determine one or more font sizes for which a contrast adjustment is available. For example the operator device may determine that a font has a font size restriction threshold of 16 point size indicating that font sizes of 16 and below are eligible for a contrast adjustment. In this example font sizes over 16 points may not need contrast adjustments and may therefore be ineligible for contrast adjustments. In some embodiments the font size restriction threshold value may not be included as eligible for a contrast adjustment e.g. only font sizes below 16 point size are eligible in the example above . Accordingly glyphs of a certain font size or font size range may be eligible for a contrast adjustment while the same glyphs in a larger font size may be readily visible or may be readable without contrast adjustments. In some embodiments all font sizes may be eligible for contrast adjustments.

In some embodiments certain glyphs may be thin or may otherwise have thin portions such that some or all of the glyph in a certain font size may appear washed out or may have low contrast on certain device displays. For example the top portion of the glyph a may be relatively thin and may have low contrast in some font sizes making the glyph difficult to read. Thin glyphs may therefore be eligible for a contrast adjustment to make some or all of the respective glyph more contrasting and therefore easier to read. In one example the operator device may identify thin glyphs by identifying a minimum curve separation or stroke weight in an outline of a glyph. The minimum curve separation may be measured by calculating a difference between coordinates of various points along a curved portion of the glyph outline. If the minimum curve separation meets a thinness threshold the operator device may determine that the glyph is eligible for a contrast adjustment. The thinness threshold may be indicated by a distance value a number of pixels or another suitable metric indicative of a distance between two curved portions of a glyph.

Upon determining glyphs that are eligible for a contrast adjustment the operator device may render some or all of the glyphs on the display of the operator device . In some embodiments the operator device may render individual glyphs individual categories of glyphs individual subcategories of glyph or another set or subset of glyphs at the same time during a single screen on the display of the operator device . For example in the operator device may determine that glyphs of the glyph category are eligible for contrast adjustments. The operator device may render a portion of the glyph category including glyphs with a range of 1 to 3 curved portions. While example glyphs are depicted in solely for illustration it is understood that the glyph category may include additional glyphs and that the depicted glyphs may not belong in any specific glyph category.

The operator device may render some or all of the glyphs in the glyph category in any number of font sizes. For example as shown in the operator device may generate a waterfall presentation of some of the glyphs in the glyph category. The waterfall presentation may include the set of glyphs rendered in a first font size on a first line . The waterfall presentation may further include the same set of glyphs rendered in a second font size which may be greater than the first font size on a second line and in a third font size which may be greater than the second font size on a third line . The waterfall presentation may include glyphs rendered in any number of font sizes. In some embodiments the number of font sizes may be limited by a font size restriction threshold device hardware digital media content e.g. eBooks may have a set range of font sizes and other factors. The operator device may categorize and or render only glyphs that are used in the digital content or the eBook or may categorize each glyph associated with the font. Similarly the waterfall presentation may include only glyphs that are used in the eBook or may include each glyph associated with a font.

In the operator device may render a portion of the glyphs of the identified glyph category that are eligible for contrast adjustments in a first font size of 10 points on the first line in a second font size of 11 points on the second line and in a third font size of 12 points on the third line . The font associated with the glyphs may have a font size restriction threshold of 12 points accordingly the operator device may not render the glyphs in a font size greater than 12 points such as a 14 point font size.

The operator device may present contrast adjustment options for one or more glyphs of the fonts included in the eBook. Contrast adjustments may be implemented for individual glyphs or instances of glyphs e.g. for a glyph at a particular font size or may be implemented for entire categories of glyphs e.g. for all glyphs with straight line portions . The contrast adjustment options may include a contrast increase option and or a contrast decrease option. Contrast adjustments made to a particular glyph or group of glyphs may be automatically propagated to other glyphs in the same category as the glyph that was modified in some embodiments.

As shown in the operator device may present a first row contrast adjustment option to enable contrast adjustments for every glyph in the first line . The operator device may present a second row contrast adjustment option to enable contrast adjustments for every glyph in the second line . The operator device may further present a third row contrast adjustment option to enable contrast adjustments for every glyph in the third line . The operator device may further present a contrast adjustment option for the entire category and may present an approve option for a user or an operator to approve the current contrast of one or more of the rendered glyphs. In some embodiments the operator device may present contrast adjustments for individual glyphs rendered on the display for individual font sizes of glyphs rendered on the display e.g. for rows or lines of glyphs for the entire category of glyphs rendered on the display or for another set or subset of the rendered glyphs.

In the operator of the operator device may select the individual a glyph for a contrast adjustment. The operator may select the glyph via any suitable input method. The operator device may receive an indication that a contrast for the a glyph is to be adjusted. The operator device may present contrast adjustment options which may include an increase option and a decrease option for the a glyph . The contrast adjustment options may be rendered anywhere on the display . The operator may select the contrast increase option and the operator device may receive an indication to increase a contrast of the a glyph .

Upon receiving the indication to increase the contrast for the a glyph the operator device may identify one or more grayscale values associated with the a glyph . One or more pixels that represent a glyph may have a pixel value which describes a brightness and or color of the pixel. The grayscale values associated with the a glyph may represent shading of pixels that form the a glyph . For example the operator device may determine a glyph identifier associated with the a glyph and a font size associated with the particular instance of the a glyph for the contrast adjustment. Based at least in part on the glyph identifier and the font size the operator device may identify a mapping table for the font. The operator device may identify a table identifier comprising grayscale values for the a glyph in the font size of 10 points and may determine that a default grayscale value of the a glyph is 220. The operator device may modify a grayscale value of one or more pixels associated with the a glyph. For example the operator device may increase or decrease some or all of the grayscale values associated with the glyph identifier and the font size in accordance with the contrast adjustment indications received by the operator device . In some embodiments the glyph identifier may be associated with a particular table of grayscale values. In such instances the operator device may modify the particular table associated with the glyph identifier or may associate a different table with the glyph identifier. The different table may include modified grayscale values in accordance with the contrast adjustments to the glyph. In some embodiments contrast curves may be applied to one or more pixels where contrast curves are selected from one or more predefined contrast curves. Contrast curves may be associated with particular grayscale values and may represent an average luminance of one or more pixels.

The operator device may modify the grayscale values associated with the a glyph by a predetermined increment. For example in embodiments with a grayscale range of 0 to 255 the operator device may modify grayscale values by increments of for example 1 2 5 10 15 20 25 or any other number of units. Each indication received by the operator device for example by a user continually selecting the contrast increase option may trigger a subsequent incremental change in the contrast by adjusting the grayscale value incrementally. In the operator device may receive two indications to increase the contrast of the a glyph. A default grayscale value associated with the a glyph may be 220 and the operator device may adjust the contrast in increments of 10 units. Accordingly in response to the two indications the operator device may modify the grayscale value from 220 to 200 thereby increasing a darkness of pixels forming some or all of the a glyph . In as shown in a second user interface the operator device may render a contrast adjusted a glyph .

The operator device may present options to propagate contrast adjustments to a single glyph or to a subset of the rendered glyphs across an entire glyph category. In some embodiments the operator device may automatically propagate the contrast adjustments across the entire glyph category or across an entire font size. For example as shown in a second user interface in the operator may have selected only the a glyph in the 10 point font size for the contrast adjustment. The operator device may present an option to the operator to propagate the contrast adjustment across the other glyphs or may automatically propagate the contrast adjustments. For example as shown in the operator device may automatically propagate the contrast adjustment to the a glyph across each of the rendered glyphs in the same 10 point font size on the first line . Accordingly a contrast adjustment may be made to each of the glyphs on the first line and the adjusted glyphs may be rendered on an updated first line . In some embodiments the propagated contrast adjustment may be an adjustment of 20 to some or all of the grayscale values associated with the other glyphs in the present example.

Upon determining a modified grayscale value for one or more of the rendered glyphs the operator device may render the modified glyphs with the modified grayscale values. The operator may readjust one or more glyphs by selecting a readjust option or may approve the appearance of the modified glyphs by selecting an approve option . If the operator selects the approve option the operator device may receive a confirmation notification indicating that the operator has approved the glyph contrast for the rendered glyphs.

Upon determining that the glyph contrast is approved the operator device may store the modified grayscale values for each of the modified and or rendered glyphs. In some embodiments the modified grayscale values may be stored in a grayscale mapping table that may be used by the operator device to render the glyph with the modified grayscale values. The operator device may associate the modified grayscale values with each of the respective glyph identifiers. The operator device may generate a font file including the glyphs and the grayscale mapping table.

Example embodiments of the disclosure provide a number of technical features or technical effects. For example in accordance with example embodiments of the disclosure device specific contrast adjustments to glyphs can be made and stored for future use. For example text content may appear different on different displays. Embodiments of the disclosure may facilitate custom contrast adjustments for glyphs on specific devices to facilitate visibility and readability of text on different devices. Embodiments of the disclosure may generate glyph categories including glyphs that are similar based at least in part on a similarity metric. Contrast adjustments to a glyph may be automatically propagated to other glyphs in the same category reducing active user input needed to facilitate accurate contrast for various glyphs. The above examples of technical features and or technical effects of example embodiments of the disclosure are merely illustrative and not exhaustive.

One or more illustrative embodiments of the disclosure have been described above. The above described embodiments are merely illustrative of the scope of this disclosure and are not intended to be limiting in any way. Accordingly variations modifications and equivalents of embodiments disclosed herein are also within the scope of this disclosure. The above described embodiments and additional and or alternative embodiments of the disclosure will be described in detail hereinafter through reference to the accompanying drawings.

In examples of glyph category generation are illustrated along with an operator and an operator device . The operator device may be the same or different than the operator device of . In a first example of glyph category generation the operator device may generate a category of glyphs having a specific number or a specific range of curved portions. Curved portions of glyphs may be formed by Bezier curves. Curved portions of glyphs may have stroke weights that represent a thickness of a respective curved portion and may be indicated by numerical values. Curved portion information for particular glyphs may be included in glyph data associated with the glyph. For example in curved portion information may be included in glyph data . The glyph data may be included in font files in some embodiments. In the first example the operator device may generate a glyph category of glyphs having a range of 1 to 3 curved portions. For example the operator device may analyze an a glyph via a glyph identifier in the glyph data to determine a number of curved portions included in the a glyph of the first example . The operator device may determine that the a glyph has 2 curved portions. A first curved portion may form an outer portion of an outline of the a glyph and a second curved portion may form an inner portion of the outline of the a glyph. In other embodiments a number of curved portions of a glyph may be calculated using different methods such as identifying a central axis about a glyph outline e.g. rather than considering inner and outer portions of a glyph outline considering corresponding portions as a single curve identifying continuous curved portions identifying discrete curved portions e.g. a B glyph may have 2 curved portions etc. In the example of the first curved portion may have a first curve length . Curve portion lengths or curve lengths may be a measurement of curve length between the endpoints of a particular curve. Similarly the second curved portion may have a second curve length . The glyph data may further indicate that the a glyph has 1 straight line portion which may be a stem width in some embodiments that may form a right edge of the a glyph. The straight line portion may be formed by an inner and outer straight line portion along the glyph outline. The straight line portion may have a straight line length that may be measured along the inner outline portion or the outer outline portion of the glyph outline. The glyph data may further indicate that the a glyph includes a serif and has a maximum curve slope of a particular value. The maximum curve slope may be determined by the operator device or may be included in the glyph data . The maximum curve slope value may be a number which is used to indicate the steepness of a curve at a particular point. The slope of a curve at a point is defined to be the slope of the tangent line. The slope value of a curve at a point may be identified by calculating a derivative. In a tangent line may be used to identify a maximum slope value at a point .

The operator device may generate a glyph category with a first group of glyphs in a particular font size having a number of curved portions within a range of curved portion values. The operator device may determine that the a glyph has 2 curved portions and therefore is within the range of curved portions. The operator device may therefore include the a glyph in the glyph category.

In a second example of glyph category generation the operator device may generate a category of glyphs having a particular curve slope value or range of curve slope values. In some embodiments the operator device may generate a subcategory of a glyph category rather than generating a glyph category. For example the operator device may analyze a c glyph which may be included in the glyph data and determine curve slope values associated with the c glyph . Such curve slope values may include a maximum curve slope value average curve slope values minimum curve slope values or other slope values. While the c glyph may be included in the same glyph category as the a glyph because of the number of curved portions in the c glyph the operator device may generate a subcategory with glyphs having particular curve slope values or a range of curve slope values such as a maximum curve slope value of 6. Accordingly the operator device may generate a subcategory including the c glyph .

The c glyph may include a first curved portion with a first curve length and a second curved portion that form a glyph outline of the c glyph . The first curved portion and the second curved portion may be connected by end curved portions to complete the glyph outline. The c glyph may have a maximum slope value at a point indicated by a tangent line .

In some embodiments the operator device may automatically generate a category or subcategory of glyphs upon detecting a certain level of similarity or dissimilarity between glyphs. For example the operator device may determine that a difference between a first curve slope value such as the maximum curve slope value of a first curve of the a glyph and a second curve slope value such as the maximum curve slope value of a second curve of the c glyph meets a subcategory generation threshold. The subcategory generation threshold may indicate a tolerance within which glyphs of a category may have for particular glyph features. For example a subcategory generation threshold may indicate 1 for a difference in number of straight line portions for glyphs of a certain category. If the tolerance is exceeded the operator device may generate a subcategory of the glyph category with the glyphs that exceed the tolerance.

The operator device may further generate glyph categories or subcategories for glyphs having certain curved portion lengths or straight line lengths. For example the operator device may determine that a difference between a first curve length value of a first curve of the first glyph and a second curve length value of a second curve of the second glyph meets a subcategory generation threshold and the operator device may generate subcategories or categories for respective glyphs in a glyph category.

The operator device may further generate glyph categories or subcategories for glyphs based at least in part on curved portion slopes. For example the operator device may determine that a difference between a first curve slope value of a first curve of a first glyph and a second curve slope value of a second curve of a second glyph meets a subcategory generation threshold and the operator device may generate subcategories or categories for respective glyphs in a glyph category.

In a third example of glyph category generation the operator device may generate a glyph category or a subcategory for glyphs having a certain number or range of straight line portions or for glyphs having both curved portions and straight line portions. For example the operator device may determine that a d glyph has 1 straight line portion as indicated by outer straight line portion and inner straight line portion on the illustrated glyph outline. The outer straight line portion may have a line length . The d glyph may further include an outer curved portion and an inner curved portion forming the glyph outline. The d glyph may further have a minimum curve separation or a stroke weight that is measured determined or calculated at a point of least distance between two curves of the d glyph such as between a top portion of the outer curved portion and the inner curved portion . The operator device may generate a glyph category with a first group of glyphs in a font size having a number of straight line portions within a range of straight line portion values. In another example straight line length may be considered in generating glyph categories or subcategories.

In addition in some embodiments contrast adjustment eligibility may be determined prior to adjusting a contrast for one or more glyphs. For example some glyphs may be associated with a font size restriction threshold indicative of which font sizes or font size ranges are eligible for contrast adjustments. In some embodiments glyphs having a certain minimum curve separation distance or stroke weight that satisfies a thinness threshold may be eligible for contrast adjustments. Other embodiments may not include any restrictions such that all glyphs are eligible for contrast adjustments.

In an example embodiment a user device may identify a font size restriction value associated with a font. The font size restriction value may be associated with a font file. The font size restriction value may be indicative of a maximum font size at which a contrast is adjustable. The user device may determine that a font size is less than or equal to the font size restriction value prior to presenting contrast adjustment options for a font. In another example a user device may determine a minimum curve separation distance between a first curve and a second curve of the first glyph. In some embodiments the user device may calculate the difference by analyzing glyph outlines while in other embodiments the information may be stored or accessible via font information or a font file. The user device may determine that the minimum curve separation distance meets a contrast adjustment threshold prior to rendering the first glyph or presenting contrast adjustment options.

At block of the method in computer executable instructions of one or more module s stored on a memory of a user device may be executed to render a first glyph associated with a font in a first font size. Example device architecture including modules is illustrated in .

In an example operator device is depicted with an operator . The operator device may include a display . The operator device may be for example the operator device of . The operator device render glyphs on the display . The operator device may render one or more glyphs in one or more font sizes such as in a waterfall presentation. Glyphs may be rendered in a first font size on a first line of text in a second font size on a second line of text and so forth.

At block of the method in computer executable instructions of one or more module s stored on a memory of a user device may be executed to increase a first contrast of the first glyph in the first font size by adjusting a first grayscale value associated with the first glyph in the first font size to generate an adjusted first grayscale value.

In the operator may select a first glyph for which to make a contrast adjustment. The operator device may receive an indication of the selection of the first glyph . The operator device may present a first option to increase individual glyph contrast a second option to decrease individual glyph contrast a third option to generate a new glyph category or exceptions e.g. for punctuation marks etc. and the like. Other embodiments may present additional or fewer or different options that those illustrated in the example of .

The operator may select the first option to increase the individual glyph contrast of the first glyph and the operator device may receive a request to increase a contrast of the first glyph . In response to the request the operator device may increase the contrast by adjusting a grayscale value associated with the first glyph in the first font size to generate an adjusted grayscale value. For example the operator device may identify glyph data associated with the first glyph in the font size and may reduce a first grayscale value of the first glyph by an incremental amount. For example the operator device may reduce one or more grayscale values associated with the first glyph by an increment of 20 units from a value of 200 to a modified or adjusted grayscale value of 180.

Alternately if the operator selected the second option to decrease the individual glyph contrast the operator device may identify glyph data associated with the first glyph in the font size and may increase a first grayscale value of the first glyph by the incremental amount such as by 20 units. Accordingly the operator device may adjust the grayscale value from 200 to 220. In some embodiments the operator device may automatically propagate contrast adjustments across one or more other glyphs in the same glyph category or subcategory as the first glyph .

Upon adjusting the contrast for a particular glyph or set of glyphs the operator device may render the glyphs with the modified grayscale values. The operator device may request approval of the modified grayscale value s . The operator may confirm or approve the contrast and or visibility of the modified glyphs and the operator device may receive a confirmation indication confirming that the grayscale value s is approved. The operator device may assign the adjusted grayscale value s to the glyphs such as the first glyph in a grayscale mapping table.

At block of the method in computer executable instructions of one or more module s stored on a memory of a user device may be executed to store the adjusted first grayscale value in a grayscale mapping table associated with the font the grayscale mapping table comprising a default grayscale value for the first glyph in a second font size. The operator device may store the adjusted grayscale value in a grayscale mapping table associated with the font. The grayscale mapping table may include a default grayscale value for the first glyph in a second font size.

At block of the method in computer executable instructions of one or more module s stored on a memory of a user device may be executed to generate a font file comprising the first glyph and the grayscale mapping table. In the operator device may generate a font file with the first glyph and the grayscale mapping table. In some embodiments the operator device may determine that the font is a true type font and may modify a true type grayscale value of the first glyph to correspond to the adjusted first grayscale value.

The operator device may receive a render request to render text content on the display of the operator device . The operator device may determine that the text content includes the first glyph in the same font size and as a result the operator device may render the text content with the grayscale mapping table by rendering the first glyph with the adjusted grayscale value.

For example the operator device which may be the same or different that the operator devices may render a set of glyphs on a display of the operator device . The operator device may present a first option to increase contrast and a second option to decrease contrast of one or more rendered glyphs. The set of glyphs may include glyphs with at least two straight line portions and 0 curved line portions. A first glyph which may be an H glyph may have a first stem and a second stem forming portions of the first glyph . The second stem or the right stem of the glyph may be aligned with the pixel grid of the display . The first stem however may not be aligned with the pixel grid of the display . As a result the left stem or the first stem of the glyph may stretch across a first pixel column and a second pixel column . Contrast values or grayscale values for the first pixel column and the second pixel column may be reduced to compensate for the spillage into adjacent pixel columns. As a result the first stem may appear fuzzy or hazy to the operator .

Embodiments of the disclosure may compensate for such misaligned portions of glyphs by symmetrically adjusting a contrast of different portions of the glyph. For example the operator may desire to increase a contrast of the first glyph by selecting the first option . In response the operator device may adjust a contrast of both columns of the first stem of the first glyph . Specifically the operator device may increase a contrast of the first column and the second column such that the first stem is uniform in contrast. The operator device may further increase a contrast of the remainder of the first glyph such as the second stem such that the entire glyph is uniform in contrast in this example. In other examples grayscale values may not be uniform for certain glyphs. The operator device may further extend the second stem across a third pixel column and a fourth column so as to generate a symmetric glyph with the desired contrast in accordance with the operator s settings. In another example the operator device may determine that a first edge of a glyph outline of the first glyph in a font size is positioned within a first pixel of the display such that the pixel or pixel column has a reduced contrast. The operator device may automatically increase or adjust a second grayscale value for a second pixel at which a second edge that may be opposite the first edge of the first glyph is positioned. Because the rendered glyphs of include glyphs with straight line portions a likelihood of reduced visibility or washing out of any one of the glyphs may be reduced due to the straight line portions. Accordingly embodiments of the disclosure may bias any incremental adjustment to contrast to a relatively light contrast with respect to curved glyphs so as to avoid a difference in contrast between glyphs with straight lines and glyphs with curved portions. For example embodiments of the disclosure may reduce an increment by which adjustments to grayscale values are made for each adjustment indication received by the device. In one example a contrast adjustment for a straight line glyph may adjust grayscale values for the straight line glyph by 5 units while contrast adjustments for curved line glyphs may adjust grayscale values for the curved line glyph by 10 units.
