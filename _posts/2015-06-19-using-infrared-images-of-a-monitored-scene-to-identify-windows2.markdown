title: Using infrared images of a monitored scene to identify windows
abstract: A camera system includes memory, a lens assembly arranged to direct light from a scene onto an image sensing element, an image sensing element configured to receive light from the scene via the lens assembly, at least one infrared illuminator configured to transmit infrared light, and a processor, coupled to the image sensing element and the illuminators. The processor is configured to operate the illuminators and the image sensing element in a first mode whereby infrared light transmitted by the illuminators and reflected from the scene is used to generate a two-dimensional image of the scene. The processor is also configured to operate the illuminators and the image sensing element in a second mode whereby infrared light transmitted by the illuminators and reflected from the scene is used to detect a first region, located within the scene, having a specific material.
