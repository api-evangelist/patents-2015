With reference to additional information about the processor will be provided.

The processor converts an image stored in the memory of the electronic device or an image input to the electronic device to have a lower resolution than a resolution of the image. Hereinafter converting the image to have a lower resolution than a resolution of the image will be referred to as down scaling . Once the image is scaled down the processor may process the down scaled image from a high resolution domain into a low resolution domain. By encoding the image in this way the processor may reduce the amount of the image while minimizing deterioration of the image.

The processor converts an image stored in the memory or an image input to the electronic device to have a higher resolution than a resolution of the image. Hereinafter converting the image to have a higher resolution than a resolution of the image will be referred to as up scaling . Once the image is scaled up the processor processes the up scaled image to a high resolution domain.

As such by performing image processing with respect to the original image the processor performs encoding with respect to the original image. The processor decodes the encoded image to repair the image and provide the image to the user. In particular the processor encodes the image by using a side channel between two channels for image processing for example a main channel and the side channel thereby minimizing the rate of deterioration of the image. The main channel indicates the image itself and main channel encoding may indicate for example enlargement reduction color change of the image and so forth. The side channel indicates information about the image and may include for example a pixel specific color value the size of the image and the like.

The processor encodes the image by using the side channel. In the following description encoding using the side channel will be referred to as side channel encoding . The processor also generates information about a way used to encode the image or a way to decode the encoded image hereinafter referred to as side channel information and includes the generated information in the encoded image during side channel encoding of the image. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the processor may transmit the side channel encoded image to another electronic device for example the electronic device through the communication interface .

The processor decodes the side channel encoded image. The processor decodes the encoded image based on the side channel information included in the side channel encoded image. The image to be decoded may have been side channel encoded by another electronic device for example the electronic device .

Referring to the processor may include one or more of a scaling module a luminance variation calculation module a quantization module a run length encoder and a clamping module .

The scaling module performs down scaling or up scaling with respect to the image. Down scaling involves converting for example an image having a resolution of 3000 2000 to have a lower resolution of 750 500 or an image having a resolution of 1920 1080 to have a lower resolution of 960 540. According to an embodiment the scaling module may reduce four pixels of 2 2 pixels forming a square into one pixel. In the following description the down scaled image will be referred to as a down image . Up scaling involves converting for example an image having a resolution of 750 500 to have a higher resolution of 3000 2000 or an image having a resolution of 960 540 to have a higher resolution of 1920 1080. According to an embodiment the scaling module may enlarge the image to 2 2 pixels forming one pixel. In the following description the up scaled image will be referred to as an up image . The image which has not yet been side channel encoded by the processor will be referred to as an original image .

For example the scaling module may perform down scaling with respect to the original image by performing box filtering using a 2 2 matrix as below. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the scaling module may down scale the original image by using an algorithm other than the 2 2 box filtering.

For example the scaling module may perform up scaling by performing 4 4 cubic interpolation with respect to the original image by using the following four 4 4 matrices. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the scaling module may up scale the original image according to an algorithm that is finer than the 4 4 cubic interpolation or a linear interpolation algorithm that is simpler than 4 4 cubic interpolation.

The luminance variation calculation module may calculate a local average luminance or a luminance variation. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the luminance variation calculation module may calculate a pixel specific luminance variation L by using Equation 1 

The quantization module quantizes a pixel specific luminance variation calculated by the luminance variation calculation module . That is the quantization module converts the luminance variation into a first variation binary signal.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the quantization module performs a side channel operation with respect to the first variation binary signal to reduce a length of the first variation binary signal into which the luminance variation is binarized. The side channel operation may be performed truncation or clamping. The first variation binary signal may have 1 sign bit and 8 magnitude bits. The quantization module may adjust the magnitude bits of the first variation binary signal to be simpler through clamping or truncation.

The quantization module simplifies the side channel information that is the first variation binary signal through the side channel operation thereby reducing the size of the first variation binary signal and thus reducing a bandwidth of a side channel of the image. For example assuming that 8 magnitude bits of the first variation binary signal are 10110101 then the quantization module may simplify 10110101 into 10111111 or 10110000 . In the following description a signal simplifying the first variation binary signal with truncation or clamping will be referred to as a second variation binary signal .

The run length encoder may reduce the size of the side channel information by compressing second variation binary signals per pixel of the image. For example assuming that there are in the image 100 pixels for which the second variation binary signal is 1011 the run length encoder may include 100 1011 in the side channel information thus compressing the second variation binary signals for all the 100 pixels. By compressing the second variation binary signals in this way the run length encoder may indicate that the second variation binary signal for all the 100 pixels is 1011 .

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the second variation binary signal may be output in a state of not being compressed by the run length encoder .

The clamping module may force the first variation binary signal to 0 or 255 such that magnitude bits of the first variation binary signal binarized by the quantization module except for the sign bit are not less than 0 or do not exceed 255.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the processor may further include an error correction module not shown . The error correction module may correct an error of a signal a pixel specific luminance variation is encoded by the scaling module the luminance variation calculation module the quantization module the run length encoder or the clamping module . The error correction module may also correct an error of a signal that may be generated during decoding of the encoded signal.

In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a method for encoding an image the method including converting an original image into a down image by downscaling the original image converting the down image into an up image by upscaling the down image calculating a pixel specific luminance variation between the original image and the up image by using a local average luminance for each pixel included in the original image converting the pixel specific luminance variation into a first variation binary signal by binarizing the luminance variation converting the first variation binary signal into a second variation binary signal by simplifying the first variation binary signal and outputting the second variation binary signal by including the second variation binary signal in the down image.

Referring to the scaling module of the processor down scales the original image in operation S. The scaling module converts the original image into a low resolution image by down scaling the original image. In this way the scaling module converts the original image into the down image in operation S.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the luminance variation calculation module of the processor may calculate an average luminance of each pixel included in the down image and pixels adjacent to each pixel neighboring pixels in operation S. For example the luminance variation calculation module may calculate an average luminance in a set of 3 3 pixels. The calculated average luminance will be referred to as a local average luminance .

The scaling module up scales the down scaled original image in operation S that is the down image in operation S. The up scaling operation of operation S may be performed to additionally interpolate the local average luminance and according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may be omitted under control of the processor . As such in operation S the scaling module may convert the down image into an up image by up scaling the down image.

The processor may calculate the local average luminance by using the up image output to the scaling module in operation S. The up image corresponds to a result of upscaling the downscaled original image that is the down image to the original size and thus the local average luminance of the up image may be the same as the local average luminance of the down image.

The luminance variation calculation module calculates a luminance variation for the original image by using the average luminance in operation S. The luminance variation calculation module calculates a luminance variation for each pixel included in the original image by using a luminance value of each pixel included in the original image and a luminance value of each pixel included in an image processed by the scaling module for example a result of downscaling the original image and then upscaling the down scaled original image by the scaling module that is the up image.

If the luminance variation is calculated for each pixel included in the original image the quantization module converts the luminance variation into a first variation binary signal by binarizing the luminance variation in operation S. Thus the pixel specific luminance variation may be expressed as a binary signal. The first variation binary signal converted in operation S may include 1 sign bit and 8 magnitude bits.

The quantization module then performs the side channel operation with respect to the first variation binary signal to simplify the first variation binary signal into a second variation binary signal in operation S. In operation S for example the quantization module may change lower 4 bits of the magnitude bits 8 bits of the first variation binary signal into 0000 thus converting the first variation binary signal into the second variation binary signal.

If the side channel operation is completed the run length encoder performs run length encoding with respect to the second variation binary signal and outputs the result in operation S. Thus the processor may reduce the length of the second variation binary signal for example from 9 bits to 5 bits.

The luminance variation calculation module calculates a pixel specific luminance variation for the original image by using a luminance value of each pixel included in the original image and a luminance value of each pixel included in an image converted by the scaling module that is a result of downscaling the original image and then upscaling the down scaled original image by the scaling module that is the up image.

Referring to a luminance value in the original image that is an original luminance value may correspond to each pixel included in the original image. To each pixel luminance values and of neighboring pixels adjacent to each pixel and a local average luminance value calculated based on the luminance values and of the neighboring pixels may correspond. The luminance values and of the neighboring pixels may be luminance values in the original image.

The luminance variation calculation module may calculate a difference between a luminance value of a pixel in the original image that is the original luminance value and the local average luminance value as a luminance variation for the pixel.

Referring to a first variation binary signal may include 1 sign bit and 8 magnitude bits . As mentioned above to reduce a bit depth of the first variation binary signal clamping and truncation may be used. Clamping may involve filling a value of a last significant bit LSB in bits including for example first through sixth bits from bottom among the magnitude bits . For example assuming that the first variation binary signal is 111110010 the quantization module may determine 0 for values of the bits illustrated in because the value of the LSB is 0. As a result the first variation binary signal may be converted into 111110000 by the quantization module . As such 111110000 into which the first variation binary signal is converted corresponds to a second variation binary signal.

Truncation may involve filling a value of a most significant bit MSB in for example a particular range of the magnitude bits for example bits including third through sixth bits. For example assuming the first variation binary signal is 111110010 the quantization module may determine 1 for values of the bits illustrated in because the value of the MSB is 1. As a result the first variation binary signal may be converted into 111111111 by the quantization module . As such 111111111 into which the first variation binary signal is converted corresponds to the second variation binary signal.

Referring to the processor converts a main channel of the image from a red green blue RGB color system into an Ybyry color system in operation S. That is in operation S the processor may convert the RGB color of the image into the Ybyry color. In this case the processor may convert the RGB color system into the Ybyry color system using Equation 2 2 4 2 2 Equation 2

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the scaling module of the processor may scale up the image of the RGB color system prior to operation S. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure after operation S the scaling module may scale up the image of the Ybyry color system after operation S.

By converting the main channel from the RGB color system into the Ybyry color system the processor obtains a luminance channel luma Y separated from chroma channels in the Ybyry color system. The luminance channel may be assumed to be the Ybyry color system. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the processor decodes the side channel information included in the image after operation thus obtaining a pixel specific luminance variation included in the image.

The processor adds the decoded luminance variation luma Y to the luminance channel Ybyry and outputs the Y byry color system in operation . Operation may be performed by adding the luminance variation luma Y to an up image which is a result of upscaling a down image obtained by downscaling the original image by the processor . The processor may combine the main channel with the side channel and outputs Y byry color system in operation S. In operation S the processor may repair the original image to a display quality that is similar with that of the original image by using the luminance variation luma Y that is a luminance variation between the up image and the original image.

The processor converts the Y byry color system into the RGB color system in operation S and corrects an error that may occur in operations S through S in operation S. In operation S the clamping module of the processor may fix the magnitude bit of the first variation binary signal to 0 or 255 by using clamping.

In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure there is provided an electronic device for performing side channel encoding an image the electronic device including a memory configured to store an original image and a processor configured to convert the original image into a down image by downscaling the original image convert the down image into an up image by upscaling the down image calculate a pixel specific luminance variation between the original image and the up image by using a local average luminance for each pixel included in the original image convert the luminance variation into a first variation binary signal by binarizing the luminance variation convert the first variation binary signal into a second variation binary signal by simplifying the first variation binary signal and output the second variation binary signal by including the second variation binary signal in the down image.

The image of may be a 4 4 cubic interpolated image of for example the original image of . If the size of the original image of is 100 the size of the image of may be 23. The size of the image of obtained by cubic interpolating and side channel encoding the original image a may be 36. As such if side channel encoding is performed the size of the image is increased when compared to a case where side channel encoding is not performed without causing display quality deterioration such that an image of a display quality that is similar to that of the original image may be provided to the user.

The image of may be a 4 4 cubic interpolated image of the original image of . If the size of the original image of is 100 the size of the image of may be 10. The size of the image of obtained by cubic interpolating and at the same time side channel encoding the original image of may be 20. As such if side channel encoding is performed the size of the image is increased when compared to a case where side channel encoding is not performed without causing display quality deterioration such that an image of a display quality that is similar to that of the original image may be provided to the user.

The image of may be a 4 4 cubic interpolated image of the original image of . If the size of the original image of is 100 the size of the image of may be 26. The size of the image of obtained by cubic interpolating and at the same time side channel encoding the original image of may be 36. As such if side channel encoding is performed the size of the image is increased when compared to a case where side channel encoding is not performed without causing display quality deterioration such that an image of a display quality that is similar to that of the original image may be provided to the user.

The image of may be a 4 4 cubic interpolated image of the original image of . If the size of the original image of is 100 the size of the image of may be 24. The size of the image of obtained by cubic interpolating and at the same time side channel encoding the original image of may be 34. As such if side channel encoding is performed the size of the image is increased when compared to a case where side channel encoding is not performed without causing display quality deterioration such that an image of a display quality that is similar to that of the original image may be provided to the user.

Referring to a first image which is the original image is an image having a black text in a white background and may be a text oriented image.

The second image of has been obtained by performing high resolution tone mapping with respect to the first image while maintaining the resolution of the first image . Thus the second image may have only a changed background color that is the gray color while maintaining the resolution of the first image without display quality deterioration.

Downscaling with respect to the first image may be for example scaling and the resolution of the second image in is assumed to be of the resolution of the first image which is the original image. The third image has been obtained by performing high resolution tone mapping with respect to the second image while maintaining the resolution of the second image . A fourth image has been obtained by upscaling the third image such that the resolution of the fourth image is the same as the first image that is the original image. The fourth image is an image obtained by simply upscaling the third image to increase the resolution of the third image four times. As can be seen from the fourth image obtained by simply upscaling the third image maintains the same effect as high resolution tone mapping but has display quality deterioration unlike in the third image .

Downscaling with respect to the first image may be for example scaling and the resolution of the second image in is assumed to be of the resolution of the first image that is the original image.
