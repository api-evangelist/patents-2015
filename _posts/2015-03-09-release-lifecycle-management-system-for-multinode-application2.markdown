title: Release lifecycle management system for multi-node application
abstract: A deployment system provides the ability to deploy a multi-node distributed application, such as a cloud computing platform application that has a plurality of interconnected nodes performing specialized jobs. The deployment system may update a currently running cloud computing platform application according to a deployment manifest and a versioned release bundle that includes jobs and application packages. The deployment system determines changes to the currently running cloud computing platform application and distributes changes to each job to deployment agents executing on VMs. The deployment agents apply the updated jobs to their respective VMs (e.g., launching applications), thereby deploying an updated version of cloud computing platform application.
