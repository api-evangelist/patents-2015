The specified ACLR is specified statistically or experimentally. Alternatively the specified ACLR is obtained experimentally by testing an entire channel with respect to a communication system and a communication module that are applied when the electronic device is manufactured.

For example an ACLR in a weak electric field situation is 37 dBc and an ACLR in a strong electric field situation may be 34 dBc. Correspondingly the controller processes to supply a greater bias current of the amplifier in a weak electric field situation than a strong electric field situation. The aforementioned ACLR is designed to be greater than an ACLR that federal transit administration FTA defines or an ACLR that an electronic device manufacturer defines even in a strong electric field situation in a relatively excellent channel or in the most excellent channel.

If the occurred event does not relate to communication channel establishment the electronic device performs a function corresponding to an event type in operation . For example the electronic device process a file playback function a file search function and an image collection function in correspondence to an event type.

If the occurred event relates to communication channel establishment the electronic device performs the ACLR measurement of the current channel based on feedback information obtained from the coupler in operation .

If an unrelated event occurs the electronic device processes a function performance corresponding to an event type in operation . If an event relating to communication channel establishment occurs the electronic device measures an ACLR in operation and checks whether the measured ACLR satisfies a set condition in operation .

If the measured ACLR satisfies the set condition the electronic device changes an amplifier current in correspondence to a specified size in operation . For example when the measured ACLR is greater than the specified ACLR the electronic device detects a deviation value. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the electronic device detects an amplitude value difference between the amplitude value of the measured ACLR and the amplitude value of the specified ACLR. Then the electronic device differently applies the size of an amplifier current value to be adjusted corresponding to the difference value. Alternatively when the measured ACLR is greater than the specified ACLR the electronic device performs an adjustment to reduce an amplifier current by a specified size. Then in operation the electronic device checks whether there is an event occurrence relating to a function termination. If there is no function termination related event the electronic device branches into operation and perform subsequent operations again.

In correspondence to the aforementioned operation performance the electronic device supplies the bias current of the amplifier having a size that satisfies a set condition by repeatedly adjusting the bias current of the amplifier by a specified size. For example after performing the amplifier current adjustment by a specified size the electronic device performs a size comparison between a newly measured ACLR and a specified ACLR. Then when the measured ACLR is greater than the specified ACLR the electronic device re performs an amplifier current adjustment by a specified size. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure when the deviation between the measured ACLR and the specified ACLR is within a predetermined range the electronic device stops the amplifier current adjustment.

If the measured ACLR is less than the stored ACLR the electronic device processes a stored ACLR update at step . During this operation the electronic device performs a control to supply a bias current of the amplifier corresponding to the measured ACLR. In aforementioned operation if there is no previously stored ACLR the electronic device writes the currently obtained measured ACLR as a stored ACLR in a memory.

At step the electronic device checks whether the measured ACLR satisfies a specified condition selected corresponding to a wireless environment. In relation to this the electronic device includes at least one specified condition according to a wireless environment. For example the electronic device stores and manages a specified ACLR in a strong electric field environment and a specified ACLR in a weak electric field environment. The electronic device checks the wireless environment information collected at step and obtains a specified ACLR such as a strong electric field corresponding ACLR or a weak electric field corresponding ACLR corresponding thereto. The electronic device checks whether a difference occurs or what degree of a difference occurs by comparing the obtained specified ACLR and the measurement ACLR.
