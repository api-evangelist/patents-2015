The present disclosure relates in general to information handling systems and more particularly to systems and methods for providing for customizable indicator codes behavior of visual indicators of any information handling system.

As the value and use of information continues to increase individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes compiles stores and or communicates information or data for business personal or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled how the information is handled how much information is processed stored or communicated and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed stored or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing airline reservations enterprise data storage or global communications. In addition information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process store and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems data storage systems and networking systems.

Many information handling systems and components thereof may include one or more visual indicators e.g. light emitting diode liquid crystal display other source of light or other visually perceptible mechanism for communicating information e.g. status alert warning etc. regarding the information handling systems or a component thereof. Despite the utility of such visual indicators different generations of information handling systems different generations of components information handling systems from different vendors and or components from different vendors may provide different indicator code behavior e.g. visual indications on the visual indicators for identical or similar alerts. For example a blinking green indicator code behavior for a light emitting diode LED on one generation of an information handling system may indicate the occurrence of one event while the same indicator code on another generation of the information handling system may indicate the occurrence of another event. Similarly as another example a blinking amber indicator code behavior for a light emitting diode LED on an information handling system manufactured by one vendor may indicate the occurrence of one event while the same indicator code on an information handling system manufactured by another vendor may indicate the occurrence of another event. In a large data center or enterprise environment having dozens hundreds or thousands of heterogeneous information handling systems and components understanding indicator code behaviors may be cumbersome even to the point that it is difficult to make practical use of visual indicators.

In accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure the disadvantages and problems associated with existing approaches to providing visual alerts associated with an information handling system may be reduced or eliminated.

In accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure an information handling system may include a processor and a management controller communicatively coupled to the processor for out of band management of the information handling system. The management controller may be configured to receive an event relating to an information handling resource of the information handling system and communicate a command to the information handling resource for applying a customized indicator code behavior to a visual indicator associated with the information handling resource.

In accordance with these and other embodiments of the present disclosure a method may include receiving an event relating to an information handling resource of an information handling system and communicating a command to the information handling resource for applying a user customized indicator code behavior to a visual indicator associated with the information handling resource.

In accordance with these and other embodiments of the present disclosure an article of manufacture may include a non transitory computer readable medium and computer executable instructions carried on the computer readable medium the instructions readable by a processor. The instructions when read and executed may cause the processor to receive an event relating to an information handling resource of an information handling system and communicate a command to the information handling resource for applying a user customized indicator code behavior to a visual indicator associated with the information handling resource.
