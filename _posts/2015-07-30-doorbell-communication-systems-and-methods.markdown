Various embodiments disclosed herein relate to doorbells. Certain embodiments relate to communication between a person near a doorbell and a person in another location.

Homes offices and other buildings sometimes include communication and surveillance systems to enable friendly visitors to summon occupants of the buildings and to deter unwanted visitors. Communication and surveillance systems can include video cameras and doorbells.

Doorbells can enable a person located outside of an entry point such as a door to alert a person inside of an entry point that someone outside would like to talk to someone inside. Doorbells sometimes include a button located near a door such as a front door side door or back door of a home office dwelling warehouse building or structure. Doorbells are sometimes used near a gate or some other entrance to a partially enclosed area. Pushing the doorbell sometimes causes a chime or other alerting sound to be emitted. In some cases this alerting sound can typically be heard within a short distance from the entry point or sound source. For example a homeowner located remotely from her home likely would not be able to hear the alerting sound and thus would not be aware that someone is ringing her doorbell. Thus there is a need for devices and methods to alert remotely located individuals that someone seeks the attention of the homeowner tenant building guardian or steward.

Doorbells can be used to wirelessly communicate with a remotely located computing device to enable a visitor to communicate remotely with a user of the remotely located computing device. The remotely located computing device can be a cellular telephone a smartphone a tablet a laptop computer a desktop computer and or a computer configured to use software. The remotely located computing device can be placed very close to the doorbell to configure the doorbell but then can communicate with the doorbell from remote locations e.g. from another portion of the building to which the doorbell is attached from across a city from across a country from across the globe . In some embodiments the remotely located computing device is communicatively coupled to the doorbell via a wire to enable the remotely located computing device to help configure the doorbell. In several embodiments the remotely located computing device creates a wireless network to help configure the doorbell while the doorbell is within a communication range of the wireless network. Once the doorbell is configured the wireless network created by the remotely located computing device may no longer be necessary because the doorbell can communicate with the remotely located computing device via another wireless network which can include the Internet and cellular networks.

Some embodiments include using a doorbell that is configurable to wirelessly communicate with a remotely located computing device. Embodiments can include obtaining the doorbell that comprises a speaker a microphone a camera and a button. The doorbell can be configurable to enable a visitor to sound a chime. Several embodiments include detecting a first indication of the visitor using the doorbell to send a wireless notification to the remotely located computing device regarding the visitor and entering a network connection mode prior to sending the wireless notification. The first indication and other indications can be detected using the doorbell e.g. via a sensor of the doorbell via data sent to the doorbell .

In several embodiments the network connection mode comprises using the doorbell to detect a first wireless network. Using the doorbell to detect the first wireless network can include the doorbell sensing the first wireless network e.g. by searching for wireless networks that are within range of the doorbell . The doorbell can also detect the first wireless network via data sent to the doorbell e.g. from the remotely located computing device . In some embodiments the doorbell detects the first wireless network when the doorbell connects to the first wireless network. Thus the term detect is used herein in a very broad sense and can include direct detection and indirect detection e.g. via another computer .

The first wireless network can comprise a first name and a first password. The network connection mode can comprise the remotely located computing device creating a second wireless network. In some embodiments the network connection mode comprises the remotely located computing device transmitting the first password of the first wireless network directly from the remotely located computing device to the doorbell via the second wireless network to enable the doorbell to communicate with the remotely located computing device via the first wireless network. The doorbell can directly communicate with the remotely located computing device via the second wireless network prior to the doorbell indirectly communicating with the remotely located computing device via the first wireless network. In some embodiments the doorbell indirectly communicates with the remotely located computing device via a server the Internet a cellular communication network and or a wireless router that is not physically coupled to the doorbell or to the remotely located computing device.

Some embodiments include using the doorbell to detect a proximity indication of the remotely located computing device determining if the proximity indication meets a predetermined proximity threshold such that the proximity indication indicates that the remotely located computing device is sufficiently close to the doorbell and connecting the doorbell to the second wireless network in response to the proximity indication meeting the predetermined proximity threshold. The proximity threshold can be a certain value or characteristic. In several embodiments a proximity indication can meet a predetermined proximity threshold if the remotely located computing device is within a predetermined distance of the doorbell. The distance can be 100 feet 50 feet 20 feet 10 feet and or 5 feet.

In several embodiments a proximity indication can meet a predetermined proximity threshold if a measurement of signal quality is above a certain value or below a certain value . In several embodiments a proximity indication can meet a predetermined proximity threshold if a signal to noise ratio is above a certain threshold. In some embodiments determining if the proximity indication meets a predetermined proximity threshold requires that the proximity indication indicates that the remotely located computing device is sufficiently close to the doorbell e.g. is sufficiently close to enable the remotely located computing device to communication with the doorbell via the second wireless network .

Various embodiment use diverse proximity indications including measurements of signal quality signal strength upload speed and or download speed. The upload speed and the download speed can be measured between the doorbell and the remotely located computing device. Determining if the proximity indication meets the predetermined proximity threshold can comprise a signal to noise analysis of the second wireless network.

Some embodiments include using the remotely located computing device to run software configured to transmit the first password from the remotely located computing device to the doorbell using the software to transmit data to the doorbell that enables the doorbell to realize that the remotely located computing device is configured to communicate with the doorbell and accepting the first password from the remotely located computing device in response to the doorbell receiving the data from the remotely located computing device.

Several embodiments include using the doorbell to detect the second wireless network while the second wireless network does not require a password to connect to the second wireless network e.g. the second wireless network can be configured to enable the doorbell to connect to the second wireless network without using a password . Embodiments can also include connecting the doorbell to the second wireless network prior to connecting the doorbell to the first wireless network in response to the second wireless network being configured to enable the doorbell to connect to the second wireless network without using a password.

In some embodiments the doorbell can search for wireless networks. Then the doorbell can automatically connect to a wireless network that does not require a password. Then the doorbell can detect whether the wireless network transmits data that comprises a password to another wireless network. Then the doorbell can use the password to connect to the other wireless network e.g. in response to searching for a wireless network that allows communication access based on the password .

Embodiments can include prompting a user of the remotely located computing device to enter the first password of the first wireless network into the remotely located computing device e.g. by typing the password into an app running on a smart phone or by speaking the password into the smart phone . Then embodiments can transmit the first password of the first wireless network directly from the remotely located computing device to the doorbell via the second wireless network. Then embodiments can include using the first password to enable indirect communication between the doorbell and the remotely located computing device via the first wireless network. This indirect communication can occur via an intermediary device such as any suitable computer or wireless router that is not attached to the doorbell or to the remotely located computing device. The direct communication does not require an intermediary device that is not attached to the doorbell or to the remotely located computing device because the second wireless network can transmit data directly from the remotely located computing device to the doorbell.

In several embodiments the system is configured to select a wireless network for indirect communication between the doorbell and the remotely located computing device due to the remotely located computing device being configured to connect to the wireless network e.g. the remotely located computing device previously connected to the wireless network .

Several embodiments include using the doorbell to detect multiple wireless networks and then selecting the first wireless network from the multiple wireless networks in response to the remotely located computing device being configured to connect to the first wireless network. The remotely located computing device can be configured to connect to the first wireless network such that the remotely located computing device has the first password of the first wireless network and such that the remotely located computing device is arranged to connect to the first wireless network when the remotely located computing device is located with a wireless range of the first wireless network. If the computing device is outside the wireless range then the computing device cannot connect to the first wireless network. The doorbell can automatically connect to the first wireless network in response to detecting that the remotely located computing device is connected to the first wireless network and in response to receiving the first password from the remotely located computing device.

In some embodiments a doorbell system comprises the doorbell and a remotely located computer that is connected to the Internet. Embodiments can also include connecting the doorbell to the first wireless network using the first password of the first wireless network transmitted from the remotely located computing device to the doorbell via the second wireless network that was created by the remotely located computing device . Then at least a portion of the doorbell system can prevent the doorbell from connecting to a third wireless network in response to the doorbell previously being configured to connect to the first wireless network. Then the remotely located computer can enable the doorbell to connect to the third wireless network. Preventing connecting to a new wireless network after connecting with a previous wireless network can discourage theft by making a stolen doorbell unusable e.g. without intervention from the doorbell manufacturer or customer service representative .

The doorbell system can prevent the doorbell from connecting to the third wireless network by placing the doorbell in a connection lock mode that prevents the doorbell from connecting to a new wireless network. The remotely located computer can enable the doorbell to enter a connection unlock mode that is configured such that the doorbell can connect to the new wireless network.

Referring now to in some embodiments multiple computing devices are candidates to receive information from a security system. For example a person might initiate a communication request by pressing the doorbell button shown in or triggering a motion or proximity sensor. The security system can notify multiple remotely located computing devices at once. The security system might simultaneously notify a smartphone of a first homeowner a tablet of a housekeeper and a laptop located inside the building to which the security system is connected. In some embodiments once the doorbell ring is answered by one computing device communication between the security system and the other computing devices is terminated maintained or kept open so another user can also participate in the communication. For example if a housekeeper answers the communication request initiated by the doorbell ring the homeowner might be unable to join the communication because communication with her computing device was terminated or might have the option to join the communication. In some embodiments computing devices are assigned a priority and computing devices with a higher priority can terminate the communication of lower priority devices. For example the homeowner could answer the communication request later than the housekeeper but the homeowner could terminate the communication between the security device and the housekeeper s computing device. In some embodiments users can forward communication requests from one computing device to another computing device.

In some embodiments multiple computing devices are notified in series regarding a communication request. For example the communication request might initially go to a first remote computing device but if the communication request is not answered within a certain period of time the communication request might go to a second remote computing device. If the communication request is not answered the communication request might go to a third remote computing device.

In some cases the users utilize the communication system to communicate with visitors who are in close proximity to the users . For example a user located inside her home can communicate with a visitor located just outside the home via the communication system .

Referring now to some embodiments include a location detection system e.g. GPS to determine if the computing device is located inside the home near the home within 100 feet of the home within 100 feet of the security system within 50 feet of the home and or within 50 feet of the security system in which case the computing device is considered in Close Mode. In some embodiments the computing device is considered in Close Mode if the computing device is connected to a wireless network of the building to which the security system is coupled. In several embodiments the computing device is considered in Close Mode if the computing device and the security system are connected to the same wireless network . If the computing device is not in Off Mode and not in Close Mode then the computing device is in Away Mode in which the computing device is considered to be located remotely from the building .

In several embodiments the computing device can behave differently in Close Mode than in Away Mode. In some embodiments the computing device will not notify the user of visitors if the computing device is in Close Mode.

In the Network Disabled Mode the security system cannot communicate via the wireless network with a remote server and or computing device .

In the Network Enabled Mode the security system can send video and or audio from the visitor to the user instantaneously nearly instantaneously immediately within 15 seconds of capturing the video and or audio and or within 60 seconds of capturing the video and or audio. In the Network Enabled Mode the security system can preferentially send data e.g. video audio traits identification regarding the visitor to the computing device rather than storing the data in the memory of the security system . In the Network Disabled Mode the security system can act as a typical doorbell by for example causing a chime inside the building to emit a sound. In some embodiments of the Network Disabled Mode the security system emits a visible error signal e.g. flashing light red light records images and audio to the security system s memory asks the visitor to leave a message for the user and or alerts the user regarding the lack of wireless communication.

In some embodiments the security system can maintain a visitor log which can capture information such as the date time audio video and or images of the visitor. The user interface can display this information in a guest book format as a timeline or calendar as a series of images videos and or audio files or as a log file.

The stored visitor information can also include recorded conversations and whether the visitor notification was answered by the user. Some methods include charging a periodic e.g. monthly subscription fee for storing and retrieving visitor history information. The visitor history information can include statistical analyzes and other high level visitor metrics e.g. average visits per month average age of visitors average visit duration percentage of notifications that were answered percentage of welcome visitors percentage of solicitors .

The user can accept or decline a communication request from a visitor. In some embodiments the user can push a button e.g. on the user interface shown in to decline a communication request or accept a communication request. The user can decline a communication request without the visitor knowing that the user received the communication request. Prior to accepting a communication request the computing device can allow the user to click a button such as an icon on a graphical user interface on a touch screen to see and or hear the visitor. In some embodiments accepting a communication request includes opening a two way line of communication e.g. audio and or video between the visitor and the user to enable the user to speak with the visitor.

A visitor can initiate a communication request by ringing the doorbell of the security system triggering a motion sensor of the security system triggering a proximity sensor of the security system and or triggering an audio alarm of the security system . In some embodiments the audio alarm includes the microphone of the security system . The security system can determine if sounds sensed by the microphone are from a knocking sound a stepping sound and or from a human in close proximity to the security system . The security system can detect important sounds such as knocking talking and footsteps by recording the sounds and then computing features that can be used for classification. Each sound class e.g. knocking has features that enable the security system to accurately identify the sound as knocking talking stepping or extraneous noise. Features can be analyzed using a decision tree to classify each sound. For example in some embodiments a visitor can trigger an audio alarm and thus initiate a communication request by knocking on a door located within hearing range of a microphone of the security system . In several embodiments a visitor can trigger an audio alarm and thus initiate a communication request by stepping and or talking within hearing range of a microphone of the security system .

Methods can include exiting a Shipping Mode and or entering a Sleep Mode in response to detecting external power e.g. power from outside of the security system .

Step can include entering a Sleep Mode. In some embodiments Sleep Mode has lower power consumption than Standby Mode and or Alert Mode. In several embodiments Sleep Mode turns off powers down and or reduces the activity of one or more components and or assemblies. In some embodiments the camera is off not recording and or in Low Power Mode while the system is in Sleep Mode. In some embodiments the speaker is off not recording and or in Low Power Mode while the system is in Sleep Mode.

In some embodiments button contact is necessary to enter an Alert Mode. In some embodiments a system will exit the Sleep Mode and enter a Standby Mode upon detecting motion detecting motion within 10 feet or detecting motion within 20 feet. In some embodiments a system will exit the Sleep Mode and enter a Standby Mode upon detecting sound upon detecting sound louder than 10 decibels upon detecting sound louder than 25 decibels upon detecting sound louder than 50 decibels upon detecting sound louder than 80 decibels or upon detecting sound louder than 90 decibels.

In several embodiments Standby Mode turns on powers up and or increases the activity e.g. electrical activity detection activity detecting of one or more components and or assemblies relative to Sleep Mode . In some embodiments the camera is on recording and or in an Intermediate Power Mode while the system is in Standby Mode. In some embodiments of Standby Mode the camera is configured to quickly start recording but is not recording. In several embodiments of Standby Mode the microphone is on in Detection Mode and or detecting sounds to help the system determine if it should change to Alert Mode.

In several embodiments the system takes a picture when the system enters Standby Mode. In some embodiments the system takes a picture each time a visitor is detected even if the visitor does not ring the doorbell.

In some embodiments of Alert Mode the system has determined that a visitor is present and or attempting to contact a person in the building e.g. the visitor is ringing a doorbell waiting by the doorbell knocking on a door . Some embodiments go into Alert Mode even if the visitor is not trying to contact a person in the building e.g. the visitor could be a person trying to break into the building . The system can be configured to enter Alert Mode if the system detects a visitor within 20 feet within 10 feet or within five feet. The system can be configured to enter Alert Mode if the system detects a sound greater than 50 decibels 80 decibels and or 90 decibels. The system can be configured to enter Alert Mode if a visitor presses a doorbell button and or triggers a proximity sensor.

The system can be configured to block or allow a communication request as shown in Steps and . The user might want to block communication requests because she is busy or asleep. The user can configure the system to autonomously and or automatically block communication requests e.g. a visitor ringing the doorbell would not initiate a communication request to the user . In several embodiments the system that blocks or allows a communication request can be the doorbell e.g. in a computing device e.g. in or a remote server e.g. in .

If the communication request is allowed the system can send the communication request via Simultaneous Mode as illustrated in Step . Simultaneous Mode can include sending the communication request simultaneously to at least two computing devices e.g. computing devices in . The request can be sent simultaneously even if the communication requests are not initiated at the same moment as long as the communication requests overlap in at least one moment of time. In some embodiments if a first user does not respond to a first communication request to a first computing device the system can send a second communication request to a second computing device while the first communication request is still underway. As a result the system starts by sending the communication request to the first user but then simultaneously sends communication requests to both the first user and a second user.

Step can include assigning priorities to remote computing devices. In some embodiments a computing device with a higher priority will receive a communication request before a computing device with a lower priority. In several embodiments a computing device and or user with higher priority will have privileges that are not available to a computing device and or user with a lower priority. These privileges can include administrative abilities and the ability to alter settings.

Step can include sending the communication request to a first remote computing device with the first highest priority. Step can include determining whether to send the communication request to a second computing device with the second highest priority. Step can include sending the communication request to the second remote computing device with the second highest priority.

Step can include determining whether to enter an Autonomous Answer Mode. Autonomous Answer Mode can include methods of the security system server and or remote computing device interacting with the visitor without user action. For example if a user does not respond to a communication request the system can play a recorded message provide pre recorded instructions from the user to the visitor and or request the visitor to leave a message for the user e.g. an audio message a video message .

A notification regarding the presence of a visitor can be sent e.g. simultaneously to multiple remote computing devices that have been authorized to communicate with a security system shown in . A first user can answer a push notification regarding the presence of a visitor to start two way communication with the visitor at door e.g. located near the security system . Then another user who also received the push notification regarding the visitor can also join the conversation e.g. without any interaction from the first person . Thus all three parties can talk simultaneously and the two users can simultaneously see the visitor. This three way communication can be enabled via administrative settings by authorizing multiple specific remote computing devices to communicate with one security system . In some embodiments the users who can join the communication are limited to the users of remote computing devices on the account associated with the security system .

In some embodiments the Autonomous Answer Mode includes sending the communication request to an answering service such as a call center. An operator at the answering service can speak with the visitor provide instructions to the visitor and or take a message from the visitor.

In several embodiments the user can select a pre recorded message for the security system to play for the visitor. The security system can play the pre recorded message for the visitor by emitting the audio message from the speaker. Once the visitor has responded to the pre recorded message the user can initiate two way communication with the visitor. In one embodiment the pre recorded message asks the visitor to identify herself and or to describe her reason for being at the building. The user can listen to the visitor s response before opening two way communication with the visitor and or letting the visitor know that the user is listening to the visitor and or watching the visitor.

The doorbell identification code can be any number of characters such as 9 characters or at least 24 characters in length. Therefore entering the doorbell s identification code via typing can be cumbersome and prone to user error. Each security system or any other type of smart device can come with a barcode e.g. a matrix barcode such as a Quick Response Code .

The barcode can be packaged with the security system . For example the barcode can be located on a box or inside of a box that contains the security system such that a person who buys the security system will have access to the barcode when she is ready to install the security system .

The barcode can be on a sticker on the security system e.g. on the backside of the security system as shown in can be laser etched onto device and or can be included in materials shipped with the security system e.g. in an instruction manual or on a surface of a packaging in which the security system is shipped in . The remote computing device e.g. shown in can include software e.g. an app configured to scan the barcode to receive the doorbell identification code and or other setup data.

The remote computing device can be configured to receive the barcode . In some embodiments the remote computing device can prompt a user to retrieve the barcode through various display screens as shown in .

In process the security system may detect a triggering event at . A triggering event is any event that indicates that a potential visitor may be present. Some non limiting examples of a triggering event may be the ringing of a doorbell on the security system activation of a motion sensor or detection of a sound. In order to prevent excessive notifications it may be necessary to determine whether a person is actually present at . This may be done by comparing the triggering event against a threshold such as only identifying that a visitor is present when a motion is within a given distance or a sound is over a given decibel level or by using a specified technique. For example the service provider may determine through facial recognition and or computer vision that a person is present. If no visitor is detected then the security system may continue to monitor for a triggering event at .

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 463 548 filed Aug. 19 2014 describes various image analysis systems and methods. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 463 548 is incorporated by reference herein.

If a visitor is detected at then the service provider may at send a notification to one or more remote computing devices or mobile devices based on current settings. At the process will determine whether a user of a particular remote computing device has responded to the notification. If there has been no response then the process at may send a notification to a second device. If a user has responded then communication may be allowed between the user of the remote computing device and the potential visitor at . The user may be granted some or all of the functional features previously discussed in this disclosure during the communication at or at any other time . Some of this functionality is further described in the following figures.

A record button provides a user with the capability to take video recordings of the FOV. A picture button provides a user with the capability to take still pictures of the FOV. The videos and pictures may be stored on the security system the remote computing device and or the service provider . Where a user wishes to watch a previously recorded video the user may be given the ability to select the playback speed.

Several embodiments include on demand service. For example a user can initiate communicate via a doorbell and or can initiate live video from the doorbell by pressing a button e.g. on demand on a user interface. Pressing the on demand button again can terminate the communication and or the live video.

In several embodiments detection of a visitor e.g. by the doorbell results in a static image of the visitor being sent to the remote computing device of at least one user. Once the user selects to accept the communication request from the doorbell e.g. from the visitor the system can show a video rather than a static image of the visitor on the remote computing device. If the communication request is sent to multiple users computing devices each computing device can display the static image of the visitor. Once one of the users answers the communication request e.g. selects to communicate with the visitor the computing device of the user who answers the communication request can display a video of the visitor. In some embodiments detection of a visitor results in a video rather than a static image of the visitor being sent to at least one remote computing device to enable users to answer the communication request.

In some embodiments a user interface is configured to enable a user to select what sound a visitor hears from the security system e.g. when the visitor rings the doorbell . Selecting a first button can configure the security system to emit a traditional chime sound when a visitor presses a doorbell button. Selecting a second button can configure the security system to emit a dial tone sound or ringing sound when a visitor presses a doorbell button. Selecting a third button can configure the security system to emit a custom sound when a visitor presses a doorbell button e.g. a sound recorded as described in the context of . Selecting a fourth button can configure the security system to not emit sound from a speaker when a visitor presses a doorbell button. Selecting a fifth button can enable the user to record a new custom sound as described previously select another sound from a list or download a sound.

Methods to address network congestion e.g. in the context of and methods of selecting video settings e.g. in the context of are taught herein. Optimizing the delivery of videos to the computing device can be important because increasing video resolution can cause the amount of data that must be delivered to the computing device to grow exponentially. In addition some computing devices e.g. smartphones have such small screens that high resolution video is not necessary in order to provide a satisfying viewing experience to a user. Sending high resolution videos from security systems to computing devices e.g. as shown in can lead to inconsistent intermittent or choppy video delivery.

As described previously some embodiments include delivering still images rather than videos. Some embodiments include delivering still images at less than 50 frames per second FPS and or greater than 25 FPS less than 25 FPS and or greater than 5 FPS less than 10 FPS and or greater than 0.2 FPS or less than 5 FPS and or greater than 0.1 FPS.

Some embodiments include delivering a single still image of the visitor taken when the visitor presses the doorbell button. Some embodiments include delivering more than one still image but include delivering an image of the visitor pressing the doorbell button to help the user determine if the user wants to answer the communication request. To avoid the visitor s hand being in the way and thus blocking a clear view of the visitor s face some embodiments include delivering an image of the visitor taken at least 1 second and or less than 25 seconds after the visitor presses the doorbell button at least 2 seconds and or less than 10 seconds after the visitor presses the doorbell button or at least 1 second and or less than 5 seconds after the visitor presses the doorbell button.

Some embodiments include delivering a video taken of the visitor to the user. In several embodiments the video can have a resolution of less than or equal to 640 pixels wide by less than or equal to 480 pixels high. In several embodiments the video can have a resolution of less than or equal to 320 pixels wide by less than or equal to 240 pixels high. In some embodiments the delivered video is at least 30 pixels in width and or less than 400 pixels in width at least 80 pixels in width and or less than 250 pixels in width or at least 100 pixels in width and or less than 200 pixels in width. Some embodiments include very high resolution video e.g. 2560 2048 .

In several embodiments video of a user is delivered to a screen of a security system shown in . The video of the user can be taken via a camera of a remote computing device.

Referring now to the camera assembly has a field of view FOV . Sometimes the FOV is inadequate because it does not include a desired area e.g. outside of a building . For example a user might want to adjust the FOV to better see a particularly tall or short visitor. A user might want to move the FOV to see other activities near the security system such as the progress of a lawn care crew. If the user is not at home or if the user wants to adjust the FOV without going outside e.g. where a visitor might be present the user might want to adjust the FOV remotely.

In some embodiments the user interface illustrated in does not physically move a camera assembly of a security system but instead changes the portion of the camera s FOV that is displayed in the image . Referring now to and moving the sphere or otherwise selecting a direction e.g. the dashed arrows in can cause the displayed portion to change while the camera s FOV remains constant. In several embodiments the user interface illustrated in is used to physically move a camera assembly of a security system to enable a user to see different areas.

In some embodiments user interfaces are configured to enable use with touch screens such as the screen of a smartphone or tablet. User interfaces can also be used with non touch screens e.g. via mouse and or keyboard input .

Referring now to the user interface can also include a means to adjust the camera s viewing angle and thus adjust the FOV . The user interface can include arrows shown in dashed lines that act as buttons to adjust the viewing angle. In some embodiments the user interface has a virtual sphere or circle . The user interface can be a touch screen that enables the user to manipulate the sphere in any direction including the directions shown by the dashed arrows . Moving the sphere can cause the camera assembly shown in to move to adjust the viewing angle. In several embodiments the camera assembly moves less than 70 as far as the movement indicated by the user via the sphere . For example moving the sphere 50 degrees might only cause the camera assembly to move 25 degrees. In several embodiments the camera assembly moves at least 1 and or less than 70 as far as the movement indicated by the user via the sphere and or arrows at least 5 and or less than 50 as far as the movement indicated by the user via the sphere and or arrows or at least 10 and or less than 30 as far as the movement indicated by the user via the sphere and or arrows. This approach can enable the user to precisely adjust the viewing angle.

The camera assembly can be otherwise contained within a housing e.g. the cover shown in to prevent the camera assembly from falling out or being inappropriately displaced. In some embodiments the motor assemblies are located on the side of the PCB that is closest to the outer face and doorbell button shown in .

In some embodiments two motor assemblies are oriented at an angle relative to each other. The angle can be approximately 90 degrees at least 45 degrees and or less than 135 degrees at least 70 degrees and or less than 110 degrees or at least 80 degrees and or less than 100 degrees. A first motor assembly can be configured to rotate the camera assembly in a first direction and a second motor assembly can be configured to rotate the camera assembly in a second direction. The second direction can be oriented approximately 90 degrees relative to the first direction at least 45 degrees and or less than 135 degrees relative to the first direction at least 70 degrees and or less than 110 degrees relative to the first direction or at least 80 degrees and or less than 100 degrees relative to the first direction.

Any of the embodiments described herein can also include an identity scanner which can be configured to identify the visitor. In some embodiments the identify scanner can classify the visitor. Classifications can include unwanted visitor wanted visitor family member owner employee and authorized service provider.

For example this data can be used to determine which neighborhoods receive the most visitors and or visits. This data can also be used to track a particular visitor as the visitor moves from one building to another building or neighborhood. Aggregated and or combined data regarding visitors can be searched and or analyzed to determine if a particular individual has visited a particular area neighborhood or building.

Some embodiments include creating a log that records the date and time of opening and closing of a door. Referring now to the door log can include locking and unlocking data. Several embodiments include a log that records whether a door was unlocked by a physical key or via an automated system e.g. a security system . The security system can lock and unlock a door lock . Data regarding whether a physical key or an automated system unlocked a door can aid criminal investigations. The door log can also include a picture of visitors who unlock a door and or pass through a door. A camera assembly shown in can take the picture. The door log can also include the identity of the visitors.

In some embodiments security systems e.g. doorbells are disabled if they are stolen. This approach can deter theft once potential thieves know stolen systems will not function properly e.g. once disabled .

In several methods the owner e.g. a user of a stolen security system can contact a remote administrator e.g. the manufacturer of the stolen security system . Based on the request of the owner the remote administrator can disable the stolen security system remotely e.g. without physically touching the security system . The remote administrator can use wireless communication and or a server to disable the stolen security system .

In some embodiments the remote administrator the owner and or the user can detect the location of the stolen security system . The remote administrator can tell the owner the location of the stolen security system . For example if a person connects the stolen security system to a communication network e.g. the Internet the administrator can locate the stolen security system .

In several embodiments once a security system is connected to a wireless network the security system cannot connect to another wireless network without being unlocked. Thus if the security system is stolen the security system could be nearly worthless because the thief likely will not be able to connect the security system to another wireless network e.g. the wireless network at the thief s home . In this context unlocked means that the security system is capable of connecting to another wireless network and capable of sending notification requests to a remote computing device via the other network. Thus in some embodiments once a security system is connected to a first wireless network the security system cannot be connected to another wireless network without being unlocked e.g. from the first wireless network . Once the security system is unlocked then it can be connected to a second wireless network.

A remote administrator and or the owner can unlock the security system by for example entering a password and or logging into a website configured for unlocking security systems .

In some embodiments once the security system scans a barcode to enable identifying the package methods include sending a notification to a person associated with the package such as the person to whom the package is addressed . The notification can include an email to the person a text message and or an automated phone call. The notification can communicate that the package has arrived. The notification can also communicate the contents of the package. As used herein package is used in a broad sense and can include letters and boxes delivered to a building.

Referring now to the security system can include a light which can be a laser. The light can emit a beam of light which can be a laser beam. Some embodiments include using the laser beam to detect is a visitor is present near the security system . The security system can be configured to detect whether a visitor is present based on whether the beam is broken e.g. interrupted by the visitor. In some embodiments the security system determines an average beam behavior and then identifies deviations from the average beam behavior as indications of a visitor. For example if a beam typically travels 10 feet without being broken but suddenly the beam only travels two feet without being broken then the system can interpret the change in the beam signal as an indication of the presence of a visitor. Some security systems are configured to detect light reflected back to the security system .

Many types of computing devices can be used to receive notifications regarding the presence of a visitor and to communication with a visitor. For example a car and glasses can be configured to receive alerts regarding the presence of a visitor.

In some embodiments the display screen is part of a television which can be configured to receive alerts regarding the presence of visitors. The television can be configured to receive push notifications from a security system shown in . Televisions can be embodiments of computing devices shown in . Some embodiments include answering visitor alerts via televisions.
