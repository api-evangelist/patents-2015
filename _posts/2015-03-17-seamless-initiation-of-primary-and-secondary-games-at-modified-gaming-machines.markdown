In one prior art configuration the gaming machine may utilize a Slot Accounting Standard or SAS protocol in order to implement various gaming machine accounting functions such as tracking of wagers game wins and other information as is known in the art . Due to the interface with the external server the gaming machine accounting information may be obtained or tracked externally to the machine.

In addition the gaming machine may include a player tracking feature. The player tracking feature may be implemented via components such as a keypad a card reader for reading cards or other media other peripheral devices such as a display . The player tracking devices or components may interface with the SMIB and thus with the external server . In this manner information regarding a particular player s play may be tracked. For example a player may insert a player card having player identification information associated therewith and that information may be provided to the server . Thereafter game play information may be provided to the server as known to be associated with the particular player identified by the provided identification information.

As just described such an existing or legacy gaming machine is a fully integrated and pre configured device for presenting one or more wagering games to a player. As indicated above however such a legacy gaming machine has a number of drawbacks owing to the specific configuration of the device.

As one example the SCI may capture gaming functionality information and route such information to a casino server which server may be connected to the Internet and or another network may communicate with the player s presentation device and or a wager based game provider. Similarly the casino server may receive gaming functionality information from the player s presentation device and or a wager based game provider via the Internet and or another network and forward such information to SCI .

A player might communicate with the SCI of a casino gaming machine via a casino server which server supports a website comprising one or more web pages for display at a presentation device . The website allows the player to play primary and or secondary games provided by a particular casino gaming machine by for example communicatively linking a computing device such as a presentation device to the selected machine in such a way as to interact with the gaming functionality provided by the selected machine. Once linked the SCI of the selected machine may provide output generated by the gaming functionality of the selected machine to a presentation device being used by the player and to receive input provided by the player via the presentation device .

While in the preferred embodiment a player s input to a gaming machine which is used to start a primary game is used to also initiate a secondary game it is possible for a player s input at a remote presentation device to be used in a similar manner. As indicated herein a player s presentation device and a casino gaming machine may be linked such as via an SCI or other device system. In one embodiment a player might provide a start game input at their presentation device and via that single input a primary game may be implemented at a linked gaming machine and a secondary game may also be initiated such as presented at the player s presentation device .

SCI may communicate with player tracking server to provide player tracking information. As is discussed herein user player identification information may provided in the course of a player s interaction with a casino gaming machine which information may be communicated by SCI to player tracking server .

As indicated herein in one or more embodiments aspects of a player s activities may be tracked. In one embodiment a player s casino gaming activities may be tracked by a player tracking system such as via the player tracking server . Such systems are well known in the art and are thus not described in detail herein.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a multi game experience may be provided at the modified gaming machine . SCI may be configured to display a multi game user interface in response to player input. By way of one non limiting example the user interface may comprise multiple sections or areas each corresponding to a game being provided as part of the multi game experience. provides an example of a user interface which may be displayed on display of machine in accordance with one or more embodiments. User interface may display output for a primary or original game which game may be provided via the primary gaming functionality of machine . In the example of user interface includes access to additional secondary games. Access comprises a button which is selectable by the user.

As indicated herein the one or more secondary games may be enabled or presented via the SCI and or via an external game server . For example a casino may build a database of secondary games from one or more game providers and those games may be accessed via the SCI associated with each gaming machine . This allows a casino to use existing gaming machines to present an essentially limitless number of different and ever changing secondary games to players.

In accordance with one or more embodiments user interface may be subdivided to display output for each of the primary and secondary games. provides an example of user interface that includes four areas each of which corresponds to a wager based video game in accordance with one or more embodiments. In the example shown in user interface is split into multiple sections or areas each of which displays output for a given wager based video game e.g. a primary or secondary game instance. In the example display area may display output of a primary game which may be a legacy wager based video poker game provided by gaming machine and each of secondary game areas may display output of a secondary wager based video game provided by a video game provider for example.

Of course it should be apparent that the multi game experience shown in is exemplary and many variations are conceivable. By way of one example the multi game experience may comprise more or less video game display areas and or a display area may be positioned such that some or a portion of the display areas may be overlaid or superimposed on some or all of another one or more display areas. It should be apparent that any windowing option may be used in displaying output in connection with the multi game experience.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a user may synchronize wagering or betting across all of the games instances and . By way of a non limiting example the user might select a bet icon or press a wager button to submit wager or bet in each of the game instances. In accordance with one or more embodiments a single wager bet input may provide a signal to start the primary and secondary games e.g. the primary and secondary games may start at the same time triggered by the wager bet input. In accordance with one or more embodiments a multi game experience such as that shown in provides a player with additional play possibilities simultaneously. In the example of the player is given the impression of playing four separate games simultaneously.

In accordance with one or more embodiments the player might be given an opportunity to bet in each game using a single bet input and reach an outcome in a game in response to providing the bet input wherein each outcome may be reached independent of the outcome of the other games and may comprise a losing outcome or a winning outcome wherein a winning outcome may have an associate payout or winning award to the player . Where the player is given an opportunity to place a bet across all of the game instances and the game outcomes may be played simultaneously for all of the instances. For example when one or more additional games e.g. one or more instances are triggered the player may be given the option of playing the one or more additional games by placing a single wager that is made in each of the instances and .

While in one embodiment a player may select one or more games for play by input at the gaming machine it is possible for the player to select games for play via a remote device such as a remote presentation device . For example a player might use a remote computer PDA or the like to select secondary games for play. A player s selections might be stored for example in a player account. When the player plays the gaming machine the SCI may access the stored selections so that each time a player elects to play a primary game the one or more pre selected secondary games are also initiated.

Of course various criteria might be applied to the player s ability to play or select secondary games. For example secondary games might only be available for simultaneous play at certain times or based upon certain criteria. As one example a player might only be permitted to play a secondary game upon placing a maximum wager to play a primary game or the primary game and the secondary game. As another example a player might only be permitted to play secondary game if the player has met certain game play criteria such as levels of primary game play. Also secondary game play might only be enabled by a casino during certain promotional events or the like.

As discussed herein secondary gaming functionality provided via SCI may involve presentation of one or more additional games which additional games may be experienced at machine or at a computing device other than machine via machine . User interface shown in might be output at a presentation device for example.

The primary and secondary game could also be presented at different display devices of the gaming machine . For example an existing legacy gaming machine may include a plurality of spinning reels to present a primary slot game. That gaming machine may also include a video display for presenting a slot bonus game. In accordance with the invention the primary game may comprise the slot game presented via the gaming machine reels while the secondary game s may comprise video games video slots poker keno bingo etc. presented via or upon the video display of that same gaming machine such as via the SCI interfaced with that display . The secondary game information could also be presented on different layers or windows of the same display of a gaming machine .

It will also be appreciated that the primary game and one or more secondary games may have the same or different features such as the same or different pay tables game rules or the like. As one example the primary game may be a game of Deuces Wild video poker while the one or more secondary games may be implemented as games of Double Double Bonus video poker. In one embodiment the one or more cards which are used in the primary game may the same or different from those used in the one or more secondary games. For example one virtual deck of cards may be used in the play of the primary and secondary game i.e. all cards displayed to the player in all hands are drawn or selected from a single virtual deck or the cards in each game might be selected from different virtual decks. As another example a primary game may comprise a slot game while the secondary game instance might comprise video or a keno game.

As discussed herein in a multi game experience in accordance with one or more embodiments a single wager may be used for all of the games. In accordance with one or more embodiments the SCI might forward the bet input to the master gaming controller of machine for betting in connection with the primary instance and the SCI might track the bet for each secondary instance .

By way of a non limiting example a double up or other betting multiple may be provided via the secondary gaming functionality provided by SCI . A player might opt to try to double triple etc. an amount. The actual multiple might be selectable by the player. By way of a further example the player may opt to try to double their winnings such as in a case that a Four of a Kind FOK or Royal Flush event occurs with the player s hand in the original game. By way of a further non limiting example where the player makes a side bet such as this and a FOK or Royal Flush is dealt to the player the player might win the multiple of the pay table amount.

As discussed herein in one configuration the primary game and the secondary game may be entirely different and unrelated. In another configuration the secondary game might link to or be based upon the primary game. As one example the primary game may be a video slot game and the secondary game may be a different video slot game e.g. an externally sourced video slot game provided by a game publisher and at least one symbol from the primary game is used in the secondary game. As yet another example the primary game may be a video poker game and the secondary game may be an externally sourced video poker game and at least one card e.g. a hold card from the primary game is used in the secondary game.

As yet another example the secondary game may be a lottery game and the secondary controller may use the outcomes of one or more instances of a primary game to determine the lottery game outcome. Thus the multi game experience provided in accordance with one or more embodiments may comprise primary and or secondary game instance s being used in combination with a lottery type game. In accordance with one or more embodiments the lottery type game may be a secondary game instance. Thus a player can play a lottery type game in the multi game experience adding to the excitement of game play and also adding to the player s chances of obtaining a winning outcome.

In accordance with one or more such embodiments the primary and or secondary game instance s may enable a lottery type game in a manner such as for example that disclosed in U.S. Application Ser. No. 61 703 914 entitled Lottery Type Game Based Upon Casino Games filed on Oct. 15 2012 which is incorporated herein by reference.

In traditional lottery games a player picks or is provided a set of numbers from a larger set of numbers. A set of game numbers is then randomly selected from that same set of numbers. If the player s numbers match the game numbers then the player is declared to be the winner.

In accordance with one or more embodiments the lottery game is played in connection with one or more other wager based video games e.g. keno video poker slot etc. There is a set or pool of numbers which may comprise actual numbers cards slot symbols etc. that may be used in each of the one or more other wager based video games. Prior to the start of play of the other wager based video games the player may make picks or selections from the set of numbers to create the player s set of numbers to play with in the lottery game. A set of lottery numbers may be picked based on play in the one or more other wager based video games and compared to the player s picks to determine the outcome of the lottery based game. As described in more detail below in some non limiting examples the lottery picks might be the game numbers selected in one or more keno game instances or the lottery picks might be cards dealt in a hand in each of one or more poker game instances for example.

In accordance with one or more embodiments each wager based video game that is played with the lottery type game may comprise any type of two wager based video game made available via embodiments of the present invention.

By way of a further non limiting example the one or more other wager based video games played along with the lottery type game might be one or more instances of a keno game which one or more instances may be a primary game provided by the legacy gaming machine and or a secondary instance provided via SCI the lottery type game might be a primary game or a secondary game. The player selects a set of player numbers to play the lottery type game. The lottery numbers are picked from the numbers generated for the keno instance s . If the player s numbers are matched with the lottery numbers picked for the keno game instance s the player is awarded a lottery type award. Such an award may be a progressive jackpot. Each keno game instance is independently presented and the outcome of each game is also determined.

In accordance with an embodiment as discussed above the player is a winner of the lottery type game if all of the player s selected numbers are matched by the game numbers for the keno game instance s . In a most preferred embodiment the player s numbers must be matched in sequence with the selected game numbers for each game. Thus as one aspect of the invention when a player selects a set of player numbers the player s selections are preferably designated in a sequence or order. In addition the game numbers are drawn or selected for the set of lottery numbers in a particular sequence. If the player s numbers are matched in sequence to the set of lottery numbers or on a position by position basis then the player is declared to be a winner of the lottery type game.

By way of another non limiting example the game instance enabling the lottery type game might be one or more video poker game instances e.g. the primary game and or the secondary game might comprise a wager based video poker game and a primary or secondary game instance might comprise the lottery type game. A player selects a set of cards from the set of cards from which cards are dealt for a hand in each one of the one or more video poker game instance s to be the player s set of numbers for playing the lottery type game. The player then plays each video poker game instance. If the player achieves a winning hand in a video poker game then the player may be awarded winnings for the winning outcome s . In addition if the player s selected cards are matched by the cards which are dealt to the player in the play of the video poker game instance s preferably in the exact same sequence the player is awarded a lottery type award. By way of some non limiting examples in accordance with at least one embodiment the player is a winner of the lottery type game if all of the player s selected cards are matched by the cards which are dealt in the video poker game instance s . In a most preferred embodiment of the invention the player s selected cards must be matched in sequence with the cards which are dealt to the player for each game instance.

In accordance with one or more embodiments SCI may track wagers and credits associated with each secondary game instance. Information identifying a player s wagers and credits for one or more of the secondary game instances may be forwarded by SCI to an external data store. By way of a non limiting example the external data store for a given wager based video game might be maintained by the provider of the game. By way of a further non limiting example the external data store might store wager credit information for wager based video games provided by different providers such as in a centralized data store. In any case the wager credit information stored in an external data store may be used by a player via legacy machine or another legacy machine and the wager credit information may be used by the player playing a game instance at a computing device other than a legacy gaming machine e.g. a mobile device or other computing device.

In this regard different credits or the like may be used and tracked relative to play of primary and secondary games. For example primary games may be played with monetary credits which are tracked by the controller of the gaming machine . Secondary games might be played using other monetary credits secondary credits or even monetary or non monetary value points or the like in this regard it is possible for the secondary game s to be other than wager based games such as games which are played with non monetary points or the like such as where points are wagered for the chance to win monies points or even prizes . For example a player might input funds a value ticket cash coins etc. to the gaming machine to register primary credits for use in playing primary games. A player might place funds into a player account such as tracked via the casino accounting server which credits can be accessed and tracked via the SCI to play secondary games. Also a player might instead wager and win points or the like relative to secondary games.

The player may designate wager amounts of play of primary and secondary games. Such may be accomplished for example via an on screen menu. When the player provides a game play or wager input to the game machine the appropriate wagers are lodged. For example upon such a single player input the player may wager 5 monetary credits upon a primary game which may be tracked by the gaming machine and may wager 2 points or 2 secondary credits upon a secondary game which wager may be tracked by the SCI . In this manner the wagers on the secondary games are tracked without interfering with the primary game functionality and accounting. In such a configuration a player might be awarded secondary credits or points even on a promotional basis which the player could access and use at any modified gaming machine.

As discussed herein in connection with one or more embodiments secondary gaming functionality provided using SCI may involve providing at least a portion of a multi game experience using a social media system server based gaming system another gaming machine to a player s presentation device etc. In accordance with one or more embodiments SCI may connect with a social media server directly or indirectly to provide secondary gaming information to the social media server. By way of a non limiting example secondary gaming information may comprise game content information identifying one or more seed cards wagering information etc. By way of a further non limiting example some or all of the secondary gaming information might be used to share at least a portion of a player s multi game experience with the player s social media friends. In some embodiments of the invention the player s friends may participate in the secondary game and or make decisions which relate to the player s play of the secondary game. Likewise information or content which is generated externally such as at a social media server may be provided to the gaming machine . For example information about the multi game experience shared with the player s social media friends may be transmitted from a social media server to the SCI of the gaming machine thus permitting that information to be utilized at and or displayed by the gaming machine .

In a case that a server based gaming system is used in providing at least some portion of a multi game experience SCI may connect with a system server directly or indirectly to provide secondary gaming information e.g. game content seed card information wagering information etc. to the server. By way of a further non limiting example some or all of the secondary gaming information might be used by the server based system to provide at least a portion of a player s multi game experience at a presentation device . Likewise information or content which is generated externally such as at a system server may be provided to the gaming machine . For example information about the multi game experience provided by the server based system may be transmitted from a system server to the SCI of the gaming machine thus permitting that information to be utilized at and or displayed by the gaming machine .

As discussed herein in accordance with one or more embodiments SCI provides secondary functionality comprising wager based video games from various game providers or externally sourced wager based video games which games may be available in some form to a player via the web and or as an application executable on the player s computing device. In accordance with one or more embodiments an externally sourced wager based video game might be provided for use with a machine via SCI and an interface component coupled to SCI . diagrammatically illustrates communication between components of a gaming system and external components using an interface . Interface may comprise hardware and or software. In accordance with one or more embodiments interface of may comprise an application programming interface API that may be used by a provider to configure SCI to implement an externally sourced wager based video game from a provider game content on machine . By way of a further non limiting example interface may be used to communicate wager credit information from SCI to server and or provider and vice versa. Server may be an accounting social media gaming player tracking casino etc. server for example.

In the example of SCI is in communication with primary game controller as discussed herein in accordance with one or more embodiments. In the example the primary game controller is coupled to display via SCI however it should be apparent that primary controller may also be able to communicate directly with display . In any case display may be configured via primary controller and secondary controller to display multiple game instances with the primary game controller being configured to provide primary game instance and secondary game controller or SCI being configured to provide secondary game instances . In the example shown in display displays output for the primary game instance and the three secondary game instances 

In the example shown in and discussed herein a modified gaming machine and in particular the SCI may communicate with one or more external devices some or all of which may be remote with respect to the machine via one or more network including without limitation network shown in . The one or more external devices might be one or more server computers of providers which server computers are in communication with SCI via network and interface .

In an embodiment network may couple devices so that communications may be exchanged such as between servers and casino gaming machine presentation devices server a server computer of provider and or other types of devices including between wireless devices coupled via a wireless network for example. Network may include the Internet one or more local area networks LANs one or more wide area networks WANs wire line type connections wireless type connections or any combination thereof.

A wireless network may couple client devices with a network. A wireless network may employ stand alone ad hoc networks mesh networks Wireless LAN WLAN networks cellular networks or the like. A wireless network may further include a system of terminals gateways routers or the like coupled by wireless radio links or the like which may move freely randomly or organize themselves arbitrarily such that network topology may change at times even rapidly. A wireless network may further employ a plurality of network access technologies including Long Term Evolution LTE WLAN Wireless Router WR mesh or 2nd 3rd or 4th generation 2G 3G or 4G cellular technology or the like. Network access technologies may enable wide area coverage for devices such as client devices with varying degrees of mobility for example. For example a network may enable RF or wireless type communication via one or more network access technologies such as Global System for Mobile communication GSM Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS General Packet Radio Services GPRS Enhanced Data GSM Environment EDGE 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE LTE Advanced Wideband Code Division Multiple Access WCDMA Bluetooth 802.11b g n or the like. A wireless network may include virtually any type of wireless communication mechanism by which signals may be communicated between devices such as a client device or a computing device between or within a network or the like.

As indicated herein the features of the invention may be implemented at legacy gaming machines which offer various games including video poker video slots or various other games now known or later developed. For example relative to a legacy game of video slots secondary functionality may be added which allows a player to play additional wager based video games such as without limitation video slots other than the legacy slot game s wager based poker keno lottery type etc. video games. It is also noted that the one or more secondary games could comprise a wide range of other games. For example as detailed herein the secondary games could comprise prize winning games such as entertainment based games. It is also possible for the secondary games to comprise table games such as roulette craps or the like where data or information regarding the table game may be converted to data which can be presented at the gaming machine or a user s presentation device or which might comprise video of the secondary game or the like.

While in a preferred embodiment the invention is implemented in the manner described above aspects of the invention could be implemented in various other manners. For example in one embodiment instead of interposing a secondary controller between the processor controller of an existing legacy gaming machine and one or more of its peripherals a secondary controller could be directly associated with the primary controller such as to directly communicate therewith. In one embodiment a secondary controller or similar device might be used to simply monitor the output of a primary gaming machine . As one example an existing legacy gaming machine may have one or more output ports which output game play information. A secondary controller might be used to simply monitor those outputs such as to detect a primary game start input or state player inputs or other actions at the gaming machine in order to present a secondary game. As one example upon detection of such an output a secondary controller associated with the gaming machine or a group of gaming machines could simultaneously initiate a secondary game at a player s presentation device . In such a configuration the secondary controller does not need to be interposed in the gaming machine but the outputs or actions at the gaming machine can simply be externally monitored yet as a result of a player initiating a primary game at the gaming machine that input action causes the automatic initiation or presentation of a secondary game to the player such as via their presentation device .

One advantage of the present invention is that an existing or legacy gaming machine which is configured to present one or more primary games can be modified so that one or more secondary games other than the primary games can be presented at or via that machine. In a preferred embodiment although the gaming machine was only configured with primary gaming functionality both the primary and secondary games can be initiated seamlessly via one single player input at the gaming machine. For example once a player has selected one or more secondary games each time a player provides a designated input to the gaming machine to play a primary game the one or more secondary games may be initiated or presented without additional or separate input. In this manner game implementation is greatly simplified for the player and the modified gaming machine operates very similar to a gaming machine that is custom configured in its base form to present multiple games.

It will be understood that the above described arrangements of apparatus and the method there from are merely illustrative of applications of the principles of this invention and many other embodiments and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the claims.
