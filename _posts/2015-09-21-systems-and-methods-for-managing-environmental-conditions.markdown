This application claims priority from Indian patent application 4855 CHE 2014 filed on Sep. 29 2014 and European patent application 14195346.3 filed on Nov. 28 2014 the entirety of which applications is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

The present invention is directed generally to the management of environmental conditions within physical structures. More particularly various inventive systems and methods disclosed herein relate to adjusting environmental conditions such as lighting conditions temperature and humidity based on automatically and manually generated requests. Some inventive systems and methods disclosed herein also relate to monitoring energy consumption and the utilization of resources within physical structures and adjusting system behavior accordingly.

Digital lighting technologies i.e. illumination based on semiconductor light sources such as light emitting diodes LEDs offer a viable alternative to traditional fluorescent HID and incandescent lamps. LEDs offer many advantages including controllability high energy conversion and optical efficiency durability and lower operating costs. Recent advances in controllable LED technology have provided efficient and robust full spectrum lighting sources that enable a variety of lighting effects in many applications.

Alongside the development of controllable LEDs rapid developments have been made in the area of sensor technologies. Sensors todays are not only able to effectively measure natural illumination and occupancy but have also become significantly smaller and therefore able to easily fit inside small devices including devices housing controllable LEDs and cameras. For example existing natural illumination based lighting control systems are able to employ individually controllable luminaires with dimming ballasts as well as one or more natural illumination photo sensors to measure the average workplane illumination within a naturally illuminated space. In such systems one or more controllers in order to respond to daylight egress and maintain a minimum workplane illumination may monitor the output of one or more photosensors and control illumination provided by the luminaires.

More recently innovations in the realms of wireless communication and smart mobile devices have launched a generation of smart phones and tablet computers with unparalleled mobility and computational power. For example mobile smart phones with access to applications on cloud servers are able to gather and process data from their immediate environments in real time. Additionally location based services allow for the customization of information delivered to mobile devices. Smart mobile devices used in conjunction with controllable LEDs and appropriate sensors can therefore be used to customize illumination in physical spaces in real time.

Today two other significant technological developments present even greater opportunities for innovations in the area of environmental management and control Power over Ethernet PoE and Coded Light CL . PoE allows for the delivery of electrical power along with data over a single cable to devices such as lighting devices IP cameras or wireless access points. The advent of PoE technology makes it feasible to power devices in remote locations within building structures by significantly reducing the need for electricians to install conduit electrical wiring and outlets. Unlike other devices the potential location of a PoE device is not limited based on the placement of AC outlets within a structure. For example PoE allows wireless LAN access points to be placed on ceilings for more optimal RF reception.

CL technology can be used to embed unique identifiers or codes into the light output from different light sources. Using these identifiers the light emanating from a specific light source can be differentiated even in the presence of illumination contributions from multiple other light sources. CL can therefore be used to identify and locate individual light sources and devices relative to other such sources and devices. The use of light as a means for device identification location and communication opens the door to innovative systems and methods for managing environmental conditions by allowing fine grained interactions between devices such as individually controllable LEDs sensors and control devices such as smart phones that were not previously feasible.

Existing systems and methods for managing environmental conditions within physical structures do not simultaneously leverage the benefits of the aforementioned technologies. Some existing systems merely utilize controllable LEDs and sensors to automatically control lighting in areas such as offices and living rooms in response to changes in for example occupancy and natural illumination in the area. Other existing systems provide mobile applications that allow users to remotely control the behavior of lighting devices within such spaces. But no existing system provides the hardware and software infrastructure necessary to effectively manage the complex interaction of a multitude of PoE and CL enabled devices e.g. lighting devices and HVAC appliances smart mobile controllers wall mounted controllers and sensors monitoring the activity and environmental conditions in large facilities such as office buildings. The effective management of environmental conditions within such spaces poses several unique technological challenges discussed below. The embodiments disclosed herein offer solutions to these and other challenges.

Large office buildings or other large commercial buildings usually have areas that are used for a variety of purposes. An office building may have conference or meeting rooms large open plan spaces with a multitude of cell offices hallways cafeterias and auditoriums. Some of these areas may be generally used for group discussions or large presentations e.g. conference rooms and auditoriums while others may be used for individual work e.g. cell offices . Given their different purposes some modes of controlling environmental conditions e.g. personalized control may therefore be better suited to some areas e.g. cell offices rather than other areas auditoriums and cafeterias . Unlike single family homes or apartments large office buildings also accommodate sizable numbers of individuals often in close quarters. These individuals may have differing and often conflicting interests regarding environmental conditions they wish to create in the spaces they occupy. When the same space is being used by different individuals therefore it is crucial to resolve conflicting requests to adjust environmental conditions in a meaningful rather than arbitrary way. Moreover the amount of control a user may be allowed to exert in any space may depend on his or her role within an organization. It may be problematic for example if an employee attending a presentation in a large auditorium is able to use an application on his her smart phone to change lighting conditions in the whole auditorium at any time.

Managing environmental conditions inside large structures therefore involves effectively prioritization and coordinating the potentially numerous concurrent control requests arising from a large number of stationary and mobile controllers representing a variety of users. These requests would need to be successfully routed to appropriate lighting devices and HVAC appliances in order to produce the requested changes within a time frame that also reasonably meets user expectations.

The variety of lighting and HVAC devices appliances that typically operate in large buildings presents another fundamental challenge to any system for controlling environmental conditions. These devices do not all produce data in the same format nor do they all support communications over the same protocols. Yet under many circumstances it may be necessary for these devices to communicate with each other directly or through intermediate modules. To ensure that devices are able to communicate with each other either direct or indirectly when necessary systems for managing environmental conditions will need to provide the means necessary for such communication to occur.

Yet another challenge facing systems for managing environmental conditions is that once the numerous sensor control and other devices and system components are installed and operational within a large structure new devices designed to produce or receive data in formats not supported by the system become available. For systems for managing environmental conditions in large structures this problem is even more acute since these systems likely utilize many more types of devices as compared to simpler systems for managing environmental conditions in smaller spaces such as residential homes. Such larger scale systems will need to be adaptable enough to accommodate the use of such new devices in order to be able to take advantage of improvements in technology. As a result it is very important that these systems are designed to be easily extensible to accommodate new devices and technologies so that they may be integrated into the system with minimal effort and without undue disruption to the operation of the system.

Although existing systems for managing environmental conditions in relatively smaller spaces such as in apartments or homes may monitor device usage for a variety of reasons the amount of such usage data generated by such systems is relatively small. By contrast a large building or structure will likely generate large amounts of usage data due to the large numbers of devices lighting and HVAC devices and sensors in these structures. This data will need to be gathered categorized and analyzed in order for the system to gain any useful insights for use in for example fine tuning existing energy conservation strategies. In order to make good use of the data without overwhelming or degrading the performance of the system as a whole a system for managing environmental conditions in a large structure needs to be designed to accommodate the potentially large influx of usage data. Some such systems may be designed such that the management of usage data is significantly decentralized. For example device usage data gathered from different floors of a building may be managed by separate modules using separate data storage facilities.

Lastly while there are privacy issues surrounding the management of usage data in smaller settings the issues are not comparable in scale to the privacy issues that must be dealt with in much larger settings. For example an environment management system designed for a residential setting such as an apartment may only have a few individual users whose personal information needs to be handled in a manner that does not create risk of disclosure to unintended parties. By contrast a large entity occupying a large office space may have hundreds of users who frequent the space accessing various system components via a multitude of user interfaces on a variety of devices including their personal mobile devices. For example the use of personal mobile computing devices as controllers for CL enabled lighting and other devices can result in for example useful but sensitive associations between a user s identity and particular frequented spaces. Accordingly the design of environment management systems for deployment in large structures needs to provide for the implementation of strategies to prevent both unauthorized access to such sensitive information from within the system itself e.g. one system user accessing information on the whereabouts of another and from outside the system e.g. cyber security breaches exposing such sensitive information to the outside world .

No existing system for managing environmental conditions provides solutions to at least the aforementioned challenges. The systems and methods presented below provide solutions designed to address these and other challenges.

As used herein for purposes of the present disclosure the term LED should be understood to include any electroluminescent diode or other type of carrier injection junction based system that is capable of generating radiation in response to an electric signal and or acting as a photodiode. Thus the term LED includes but is not limited to various semiconductor based structures that emit light in response to current light emitting polymers organic light emitting diodes OLEDs electroluminescent strips and the like. In particular the term LED refers to light emitting diodes of all types including semiconductor and organic light emitting diodes that may be configured to generate radiation in one or more of the infrared spectrum ultraviolet spectrum and various portions of the visible spectrum generally including radiation wavelengths from approximately 400 nanometers to approximately 700 nanometers . Some examples of LEDs include but are not limited to various types of infrared LEDs ultraviolet LEDs red LEDs blue LEDs green LEDs yellow LEDs amber LEDs orange LEDs and white LEDs discussed further below . It also should be appreciated that LEDs may be configured and or controlled to generate radiation having various bandwidths e.g. full widths at half maximum or FWHM for a given spectrum e.g. narrow bandwidth broad bandwidth and a variety of dominant wavelengths within a given general color categorization.

For example one implementation of an LED configured to generate essentially white light e.g. a white LED may include a number of dies which respectively emit different spectra of electroluminescence that in combination mix to form essentially white light. In another implementation a white light LED may be associated with a phosphor material that converts electroluminescence having a first spectrum to a different second spectrum. In one example of this implementation electroluminescence having a relatively short wavelength and narrow bandwidth spectrum pumps the phosphor material which in turn radiates longer wavelength radiation having a somewhat broader spectrum.

It should also be understood that the term LED does not limit the physical and or electrical package type of an LED. For example as discussed above an LED may refer to a single light emitting device having multiple dies that are configured to respectively emit different spectra of radiation e.g. that may or may not be individually controllable . Also an LED may be associated with a phosphor that is considered as an integral part of the LED e.g. some types of white LEDs . In general the term LED may refer to packaged LEDs non packaged LEDs surface mount LEDs chip on board LEDs T package mount LEDs radial package LEDs power package LEDs LEDs including some type of encasement and or optical element e.g. a diffusing lens etc.

A given light source may be configured to generate electromagnetic radiation within the visible spectrum outside the visible spectrum or a combination of both. Hence the terms light and radiation are used interchangeably herein. Additionally a light source may include as an integral component one or more filters e.g. color filters lenses or other optical components. Also it should be understood that light sources may be configured for a variety of applications including but not limited to indication display and or illumination. An illumination source is a light source that is particularly configured to generate radiation having a sufficient intensity to effectively illuminate an interior or exterior space. In this context sufficient intensity refers to sufficient radiant power in the visible spectrum generated in the space or environment the unit lumens often is employed to represent the total light output from a light source in all directions in terms of radiant power or luminous flux to provide ambient illumination i.e. light that may be perceived indirectly and that may be for example reflected off of one or more of a variety of intervening surfaces before being perceived in whole or in part .

The term spectrum should be understood to refer to any one or more frequencies or wavelengths of radiation produced by one or more light sources. Accordingly the term spectrum refers to frequencies or wavelengths not only in the visible range but also frequencies or wavelengths in the infrared ultraviolet and other areas of the overall electromagnetic spectrum. Also a given spectrum may have a relatively narrow bandwidth e.g. a FWHM having essentially few frequency or wavelength components or a relatively wide bandwidth several frequency or wavelength components having various relative strengths . It should also be appreciated that a given spectrum may be the result of a mixing of two or more other spectra e.g. mixing radiation respectively emitted from multiple light sources .

For purposes of this disclosure the term color is used interchangeably with the term spectrum. However the term color generally is used to refer primarily to a property of radiation that is perceivable by an observer although this usage is not intended to limit the scope of this term . Accordingly the terms different colors implicitly refer to multiple spectra having different wavelength components and or bandwidths. It also should be appreciated that the term color may be used in connection with both white and non white light.

The terms lighting fixture and luminaire are used interchangeably herein to refer to an implementation or arrangement of one or more lighting units in a particular form factor assembly or package. The term lighting unit is used herein to refer to an apparatus including one or more light sources of same or different types. A given lighting unit may have any one of a variety of mounting arrangements for the light source s enclosure housing arrangements and shapes and or electrical and mechanical connection configurations. Additionally a given lighting unit optionally may be associated with e.g. include be coupled to and or packaged together with various other components e.g. control circuitry relating to the operation of the light source s . An LED based lighting unit refers to a lighting unit that includes one or more LED based light sources as discussed above alone or in combination with other non LED based light sources. A multi channel lighting unit refers to an LED based or non LED based lighting unit that includes at least two light sources configured to respectively generate different spectrums of radiation wherein each different source spectrum may be referred to as a channel of the multi channel lighting unit.

The term controller is used herein generally to describe various apparatus relating to the operation of one or more light sources. A controller can be implemented in numerous ways e.g. such as with dedicated hardware to perform various functions discussed herein. A processor is one example of a controller which employs one or more microprocessors that may be programmed using software e.g. microcode to perform various functions discussed herein. A controller may be implemented with or without employing a processor and also may be implemented as a combination of dedicated hardware to perform some functions and a processor e.g. one or more programmed microprocessors and associated circuitry to perform other functions. Examples of controller components that may be employed in various embodiments of the present disclosure include but are not limited to conventional microprocessors application specific integrated circuits ASICs and field programmable gate arrays FPGAs .

In various implementations a processor or controller may be associated with one or more storage media generically referred to herein as memory e.g. volatile and non volatile computer memory such as RAM PROM EPROM and EEPROM floppy disks compact disks optical disks magnetic tape etc. . In some implementations the storage media may be encoded with one or more programs that when executed on one or more processors and or controllers perform at least some of the functions discussed herein. Various storage media may be fixed within a processor or controller or may be transportable such that the one or more programs stored thereon can be loaded into a processor or controller so as to implement various aspects of the present invention discussed herein. The terms program or computer program are used herein in a generic sense to refer to any type of computer code e.g. software or microcode that can be employed to program one or more processors or controllers.

In one network implementation one or more devices coupled to a network may serve as a controller for one or more other devices coupled to the network e.g. in a master slave relationship . In another implementation a networked environment may include one or more dedicated controllers that are configured to control one or more of the devices coupled to the network. Generally multiple devices coupled to the network each may have access to data that is present on the communications medium or media however a given device may be addressable in that it is configured to selectively exchange data with i.e. receive data from and or transmit data to the network based for example on one or more particular identifiers e.g. addresses assigned to it.

The term network as used herein refers to any interconnection of two or more devices including controllers or processors that facilitates the transport of information e.g. for device control data storage data exchange etc. between any two or more devices and or among multiple devices coupled to the network. As should be readily appreciated various implementations of networks suitable for interconnecting multiple devices may include any of a variety of network topologies and employ any of a variety of communication protocols. Additionally in various networks according to the present disclosure any one connection between two devices may represent a dedicated connection between the two systems or alternatively a non dedicated connection. In addition to carrying information intended for the two devices such a non dedicated connection may carry information not necessarily intended for either of the two devices e.g. an open network connection . Furthermore it should be readily appreciated that various networks of devices as discussed herein may employ one or more wireless wire cable and or fiber optic links to facilitate information transport throughout the network.

The term user as user herein refers to any entity human or artificial that interacts with systems and methods described herein. For example the term includes without limitation occupants of a space such as an office worker or visitor remote users of a space a facility manager a commissioning engineer a building IT manager a service engineer and an installer.

It may also store area monitoring information. In some embodiments gateway module monitors all DyNet and EnvisionIP traffic in a part of the system. It may store and or cache this information and forward it to the environment manager module so that the environment manager module has an exact overview of the state of all the commissioned devices at any given time. With respect to scheduling time critical events may be forwarded by gateway module to the environment manager module immediately while events that are not time critical may be locally cached and uploaded to the manager module in batches. In cases where the manager module cannot be reached all events may be locally cached and uploaded to the manager module when it becomes reachable again. Gateway module may also interface with an HVAC system associated with system A and discover new devices. In many embodiments multiple gateway modules such as gateway module may be communicatively linked with a single environment manager module where each gateway module acts as a floor controller for a particular floor of a building. In many embodiments gateway module may also log and store all or a subset of received environment control commands log and report all events and state changes within the system back to the environment manager module send commands coming from the commissioned units that this gateway module controls and or monitors to another gateway module that controls and or monitors another part of the system common area send responsibility send commands coming from another gateway module that controls and or monitors another part of the system to the commissioned units that this gateway module controls and or monitors common area receive responsibility transparently bridge between EnvisionIP networks and DyNet RS485 networks allowing the system to be extended for example with all existing DyNet RS485 products actively monitor log and store the availability of all commissioned units and devices and report any change in their availability to the environment manager module .

As depicted in gateway module is able to exchange information with IP luminaires and via link L and with environment manager module via link L and commissioning module via link L. L and L were previously described in connection with manager module and commissioning module respectively. In many embodiments L may represent an EnvisionIP or an xCLIP interface.

IP luminaire is associated with sensor light source and control module . In some embodiments sensor and light source are located within the same device or housing. In some embodiments control module comprises computer code e.g. software or microcode executing on one or more processors housed within the same device or housing as sensor and or light source . Light source may be capable of performing one or more light actuating functions such as turning on off dimming and tunable white light or colored light production. Sensor is a sensor capable of sensing for example one or more of daylight occupancy IR carbon dioxide humidity and temperature. Control module provides one or more control functions for controlling the behavior of other modules and devices such as one or more of light source sensor commissioning module environment manager module gateway module and IP luminaire .

IP luminaire may provide one or more external interfaces for communicating with other modules of system A. For example IP luminaire may provide an EnvisionIP interface e.g. links L and L for use in commissioning light source and or for use by control module to influence the behavior of other area luminaires and sensors communicatively connected to itself e.g. light source and sensor light source or sensor . IP luminaire may also provide an xCLIP interface for use by control module to access and control basic capabilities of light source or other light sources communicatively connected to IP luminaire . The xCLIP interface may also be used by other system modules e.g. gateway module for accessing sensor data generated by sensors accessible to IP luminaire e.g. sensors and and energy consumption and diagnostic data available to light source and or IP luminaire . and its associated description provide further details regarding the components of an IP luminaire and the various interfaces used by these components.

Environment control device may be any device for controlling environmental conditions in a space. Such devices include without limitation smart phones such as the iPhone tablet or handheld computing devices such as the iPad laptop computers touch sensitive and or voice activated input and or display devices communicatively connected to one or more processors and desktop computing devices.

In some embodiments the components of system A depicted in may interact in the following way. Environment control device receives a user s input indicating his her desire to change an environment condition in his or her vicinity. For example control device may be a smart phone and the user may indicate using a graphical user interface displayed on the smart phone his her desire to increase the level or intensity of light in a work zone such as a table top in the room where the user is physically present. The graphical user interface may also be used to control other lighting parameters such as color color temperature and direction. Meanwhile IP luminaires and which control illumination in the aforementioned work zone each generate coded light signals comprising codes identifying for example themselves and or light sources and respectively. IP luminaire transmits the coded light signal comprising the code identifying itself and or light source to environment control device via link L and IP luminaire transmits the coded light signal comprising the code identifying itself or light source via link L. Via link L environment control device transmits one or more signals comprising an environment control request. The environment control request contains information regarding changes the user of the environment control device wishes to make in his or her environment as well as information on the devices such as IP luminaires which may be used to carry out the user s wishes. For example the environment control request may encode the user s desire to increase the level of light in a work zone such as a table top as well as identification information from the coded light signals received by environment control device . The environment manager module executing on one or more processors receives the one or more signals comprising the environment control request from the environment control device and generates an environment control command. In many embodiments the environment control command comprises the information encoded in the environment control request but in a format understandable by the gateway module or commissioned units e.g. IP luminaire to which it is transmitted. Furthermore while the environment control request may contain more general information regarding desired environmental changes in a particular room or work zone the environment control command is more specific with regard to the implementation of the requested changes encoded in the environment control request. For example the environment control command may contain specific instructions that when processed by a group of IP luminaires cause the IP luminaires to effect specific changes in illumination. Environment manager module thereafter may transmit via link L the environment control command to gateway module . Gateway module may store data associated with the environment control command such as identification information associated with the IP luminaire s that will respond to the user s desired change in lighting level. Gateway module may then communicate via link L to instruct IP luminaire and or IP luminaire to adjust their illumination to produce the light level requested by the user.

IR remote control is any device that uses infrared light to issue commands to receiver devices. IR remote control may use link L to issue control commands to IP luminaire or its components such as sensor and light source . In many embodiments of system B link L may represent the RC 5 protocol.

In some embodiments the components depicted in may interact in the following way. Environment control device receives a user s input indicating his her desire to change an environment condition in his or her vicinity. For example control device may be a smart phone and the user may indicate using a graphical user interface displayed on the smart phone his her desire to increase the level of light in a work zone such as a table top in a room where the user is not physically present. Meanwhile IP luminaires and which control illumination in the aforementioned work zone each generate coded light signals comprising codes identifying luminaires and respectively. IP luminaire transmits the coded light signal comprising the code identifying light source to environment control device via link L and IP luminaire transmits the coded light signal comprising the code identifying light source to environment control device via link L. Via link L environment control device transmits one or more signals comprising an environment control request. The environment manager module executing on one or more processors receives the one or more signals comprising the environment control request from the environment control device and generates an environment control command. Details on the environment control request and environment control command were specified previously in the context of . Environment manager module may thereafter transmit via link L the environment control command to IP luminaire and or IP luminaire to adjust the illumination produced by light source and or light source in order to achieve the level of illumination requested by the user of environment control device . The same or a different user may also use IR remote control while located proximally to IP luminaire to directly issue a command to IP luminaire in order to adjust the illumination produced by light source .

In LEDs as voltage increases current tends to increase rapidly. Accordingly even small fluctuations in voltage tends to cause large fluctuations in current which in turn causes damage to LEDs. Due to the risk of damage to LEDs owing to such voltage fluctuations LED drivers are used to connect LEDs to a voltage source such as a mains power or a battery. LED drivers control input power to the LEDs so that they may be safely operated. LED drivers C and C are electronic circuits which convert input power into a current source in which current is constant despite voltage fluctuations. Control modules C and C may communicate with other system modules over xCLIP interfaces and with each other over the EnvisionIP interface. ILB sensors C and C receive control signals from IR remote controls C and C respectively over RC5 interfaces. PoE switch C receives data over EtherNet IP interfaces and transmits the received data as well as electrical power to IP luminaire C via PoE and EtherNet IP interfaces.

Commissioned unit D may comprise one or more devices that are associated with each other within a system such as system A or D and that behave according to particular configurations of internal triggers triggers arising from within the commissioned unit and external triggers triggers arising outside the commissioned unit . Triggers may include for example sensor data or a manual or central control. A single device may be part of multiple commissioned units. Commissioned units such as commissioned unit D may also be hierarchically organized. For example a commissioned unit may comprise other commissioned units and may influence the behavior of these commissioned units. In some embodiments sensor D is a sensor in a designated zone within the physical structure. Sensor D is configured to produce data indicative of for example motion occupancy sound the presence of one or more gases illumination humidity and temperature. In such embodiments commissioned unit D which is communicatively connected to sensor D through link LK and to environment manager module through link L is configured to receive the data produced by sensor D. Commissioned unit D may also be configured to determine whether or not the sensor data represents a status change associated with the designated zone. In many embodiments commissioned unit D is also configured to update through link LK at least a memory D in accordance with the sensor data representing the status change.

The distribution layer may consist of one IP switch per floor of the structure and per core layer router depicted as Switch Floor Left Switch Floor Right Switch Floor Left Switch Floor Right . . . Switch Floor N Left Switch Floor N Right . In many embodiments these IP switches support the spanning tree protocol. The edge layer consists of a number of rings depicted as a single curved arrow through side edge layers per distribution layer switch and a gateway module per floor for providing floor level lighting control. Each ring consists of a number of PoE switches daisy chained and connected to two ports of the respective distribution layer switch in a ring. Such an arrangement provides the advantage that if a ring of PoE switches is broken at any point in the ring configuration all of the PoE switches may still be reached over the network.

Router is any networking device that forwards data packets in a computer network. It is connected to PoE power supplies and and area controller via link L which provides an xCLIP interface for accessing data from the depicted clusters of luminaires as well as sensor energy consumption and diagnostics data available from the luminaires. Power over Ethernet or PoE refers to any systems standardized or ad hoc for providing electrical power and data on Ethernet cabling. PoE allows a single cable to provide both a data connection and electrical power to devices such as wireless access points IP Phones IP luminaires or IP cameras. Although other standards such as USB can provide power to devices over data cables PoE allows for far longer cable lengths. In PoE systems data and power may be carried on the same conductors or on dedicated conductors on a single cable. PoE therefore eliminates the need for power supplies at the Ethernet IP device.

Area controller may be implemented in hardware any combination of hardware and computer code e.g. software or microcode or entirely in computer code executing on one or more processors. Area controller may be used to perform various area control functions for a defined area e.g. a floor of a building . In many embodiments area controller provides an interactive graphical user interface for system users to manage the control functions. Other such control functionality may be additionally or alternatively be performed by devices such as luminaires or IP luminaires with which area controller interacts. According to some embodiments area controller may for example a control multiple commissioned units or zones within a building b be used to group devices and or commissioned units during the commissioning process c determine area occupancy and adjust lighting for an area accordingly d adjust background light levels or regulate lighting levels based on changes in available natural light for a group of commissioned units e collect and analyze sensor and or energy consumption data from one or more luminaires and sensors and f participate in scheduling environmental changes such as changes in lighting levels within an area. Software downloads may also occur through the area controller. In many embodiments the area controller may play an intermediate role where it fetches a software download from a central server and distributes the update to respective luminaires and other devices appropriately. Area controller may also act as a security bridge between the luminaire clusters operating within a private lighting network and a third party private network such as a network comprising a building management system BMS . In some embodiments area controller operates within a private IP network and software tools such as a maintenance tool being executed on an authorized system user s hand held device may exchange data with area controller by temporarily connecting to the IP network.

Luminaires through and through may be IP luminaires such as IP luminaire or luminaires comprising light sources such as light source described in the context of . Luminaire networks in embodiment A may be compliant with IP standards and may be able to operate in an IP network. The luminaires are each connected to PoE power supply through either link L or L. Link L may provide a PoE interface an xCLIP interface or an IP interface for communications between PoE Power Supply and the luminaires.

Lighting controller dashboard may be for example computer code displaying a user interface that is a part of or executing on one or more processors communicatively connected to system modules such as environment manager module of . The user interface of lighting controller dashboard may be displayed on any environment control device discussed in the context of such as environment control device . For example lighting controller dashboard may be an application executing on a handheld device such as an iPhone or iPad . Dashboard is communicatively connected to area controller router and PoE power supplies and through links L and L which may provide an xCLIP or IP interface for the exchange of data. Lighting controller dashboard may also be used for monitoring purposes e.g. monitoring energy consumption and system health and for deployment of lighting schedules. Dashboard may also collect and aggregate information such as energy consumption system health and occupancy information from multiple area controllers to provide its users a complete and current view of the functioning system.

Building controller dashboard floor controller and HVAC controller may be implemented in hardware any combination of hardware and computer code e.g. software or microcode or entirely in computer code executing on one or more processors. These components of embodiment B may be used to perform various functions related to the management of a building s HVAC system such as monitoring and control of a building s temperature and air flow. In many embodiments building controller dashboard may display a user interface that is a part of or executing on one or more processors communicatively connected to system modules such as environment manager module of . The user interface of the building controller dashboard may be displayed on any environment control device discussed in the context of such as environment control device . For example building controller dashboard may be an application executing on a handheld device such as an iPhone or iPad . There may be multiple floor controllers that provide dashboard information regarding environmental conditions on different floors of a building which the dashboard may then display on its user interface.

In the configuration of embodiment B the lighting subsystem e.g. luminaire clusters PoE power supplies area controller and router may be communicatively connected to a 3party IP network infrastructure which may also be connected to the Internet. In these embodiments the building controller dashboard floor controller HVAC controller HVAC active airflow controller and temperature controller may be integral components of a 3party building management system operating within the 3party IP network infrastructure. The 3party IP network may share building information such as HVAC information with the lighting subsystem and the lighting controller dashboard when necessary. For example the lighting controller dashboard may display HVAC information such as temperature in particular areas close to commissioned units with large numbers of luminaires. This temperature information may be obtained by the lighting controller dashboard via a connection to the 3party IP network infrastructure.

The front end of the environment manager module may be a web based application that executes on top of an Indoor Service Presentation Framework ISPF . In the front end of the environment manager module may be displayed on the device e.g. laptop computing device indicated by the monitor icon and located next to the icon depicting a facility manager. ISPF is a software framework that enables the creation of web based applications for lighting control status monitoring and energy management for HVAC and lighting management systems. It is a cloud based and enterprise wide software solution that is capable of interfacing with controllers in a system for managing environmental conditions such as system of . An environment manager module web based application that interfaces with the end user e.g. facility manager provides in many embodiments an application frame a portal application a login module and help functionality. The ISPF framework on top of which the environment manager module executes provides the environment manager module with the information necessary to provide the application frame and portal application as described in further detail below.

The presentation layer of the environment manager module depicted in is based on the Model View Controller MVC design paradigm. A layer is a common logical structuring mechanism for various elements that constitute a software solution. The presentation layer mainly consists of standard portlets such as a control portlet a scheduler portlet a macro portlet a user settings portlet and a notifications portlet. Portlets are pluggable software user interface UI components that are displayable in a web portal. A portlet also typically comprises a set of JavaScript objects. They produce fragments of markup code e.g. HTML XHTML WML which are then aggregated into a complete UI for the web portal. In many embodiments a web portal may comprise a plurality of non overlapping portlet windows. In such embodiments each portlet window may display the UI component s of a specific portlet. The presentation layer may be implemented for example using Liferay portal server DOJO MxGraph JqChart and JavaScript .

In many embodiments the presentation layer invokes the service layer using the REST SOAP interface as the ISPF exposes available services as REST and SOAP interfaces. These services typically utilize the business objects defined in the business layer to realize their functionality. The service layer may also expose the REST APIs in XML and JSON format as input and output. Client web applications may interact with the environment manager application executing as a server by invoking the REST SOAP interface over HTTP HTTPS using XML JSON.

The business layer manages business objects that interface with one or more database servers and controllers in its associated system for managing environmental conditions via the data access layer and communication gateway. In many embodiments business objects are modularized such that multiple services associated with the service layer may invoke the same business object to realize its exposed functionality. In many embodiments one service may use multiple business layer objects to realize its functionality. The business layer may also invoke the message bus for communicating with controllers in its associated system for managing environmental conditions.

The data access layer provides a way to reduce the degree of coupling between business logic and persistence logic. Application business logic often requires domain objects which are persisted in a database. The data access layer allows for the encapsulation of code to perform create read update and delete CRUD operations against persistence data without affecting the rest of the application layers e.g. the presentation layer . This means that any change in the persistence logic will not adversely affect any other layers of the environment manager module. The data access layer therefore enables applications such as an environment manager module web based application to seamlessly integrate with a new database provider.

The mediation engine provides rule based routing of data within the environment manager module. In some embodiments the mediation engine may comprise a Java object based implementation of enterprise integration patterns that uses an API to configure routing and mediation rules. For example the rule based routing of the mediation engine may ensure that all alarm events encountered by the environment manager module are routed to a database for persisting and all network events are persisted in another database.

The message bus provides queuing functionality and is used for processing all communications from controllers that are received by the environment manager module. Particularly the message bus provides queuing functionality for the prioritizing of information received from the business layer and from the communication gateway. For example all information e.g. requests received by the communication gateway e.g. from commissioned units are routed through the message bus using the mediation engine. Any responses to such requests from the communication gateway are routed through the message bus. In many embodiments the message bus may be used for example for a prioritizing and forwarding communication gateway requests received from the business layer notification emails and SMS messages b pushing status and alarm messages to the presentation layer for display on a UI c executing asynchronous processes d synchronous and asynchronous messaging and d dispatching messages in serial and in parallel to multiple modules.

In many embodiments the message bus comprises a synchronization manager component used for publishing real time updates from controllers and commissioned devices to front end applications. Applications e.g. a central dashboard presenting information processed by the environment manager module may subscribe to real time updates from controllers e.g. alarms lighting events energy updates . Whenever a real time update is received for example by the communication gateway the synchronization manager may notify all subscribers.

The NoSQL database an in memory database is used for storing the most recent 24 hours of trend data. In many embodiments all the data in the in memory database shall be stored in a cache and shall not be persisted. In many embodiments this database is executed in a separate process as compared to the environment manager module itself and the database may be accessed using SQL.

The database server is used to store control management and monitoring data. The database server may be local or remote to the environment manager module. If local the database server may be created during product installation. A remote database may be a new or existing database that may be customer managed. The database server may access multiple schemas to manage the variety of information it stores. For example an OpenFire schema may contain XMPP server related tables. These tables may contain information related to users rooms and permissions. A Liferay schema may contain tables for managing portals portlets users and UI personalization data. An alarm schema may comprise tables for schedule and alarm management.

Communication gateway provides a means for the environment manager module to communicate with devices and commissioned units. In various embodiments the communication gateway subscribes to device events using COM Java wrapper classes it uses to communicate with a Field Service Layer FSL accessible to the devices and commissioned units FSL not shown in . When events such as lighting events are registered by commissioned units the communication gateway is notified of the event by the FSL. The communication gateway thereafter transmits the event information as appropriate to the upper layers e.g. message bus business layer services layer presentation layer . The communication gateway communicates with the upper layers of the environment manager module in two ways 1 through REST services accessible only by the business layer components and 2 using the message bus e.g. using the XMPP protocol for all requests and responses . Both these mechanisms are configurable. When the environment manager module has been deployed on a cloud such that the communication gateway is hosted on a private network the message bus communication option may be enabled.

In many embodiments to transmit data to the upper layers from the FSL the communication gateway converts FSL objects received from the FSL layer to an ISPF common object model. To transmit data from the upper layers of the environment manager module to the FSL which is how the communication gateway interfaces with commissioned units the communication gateway converts ISPF common object model objects to FSL objects. In some embodiments the communication gateway uses the ComfyJ library to communicate with the FSL. The ComfyJ library provides the JNI wrapper classes for the FSL COM objects. In such embodiments the communication gateway may be executed in a separate JVM process for which a minimum of 2 GB of heap space may be allocated.

In many embodiments the communication gateway comprises a communication gateway API code for converting domain specific objects to the ISP common object model and ComfyJ generated wrapper classes e.g. ComfyJ generated wrapper classes of the FSL for control and monitoring purposes . The communication gateway API is typically used for sending and receiving messages from the message bus.

ISPF ETL Extract Transform and Load is used to extract data from the NoSQL Audit Schema and transform the data into a star data model for loading into the trend schema of the database server. In many embodiments ETL is a separate process in ISPF which runs in a separate execution context. The ETL process also runs on a scheduled basis which is configurable. A default schedule may be to execute the ETL process once every 12 hours.

The analytics layer analyzes data produced by commissioned units and produces textual and graphical reports for display on front end applications. The analytics layer may utilize a report design or publishing toolset to control the look and feel of the reports generated and may also use an analysis toolset e.g. Pentagon Mondrian for data analysis. The analytics layer may also provide an online analytical processing OLAP solution where data such as lighting network log data is collected into a central repository and analyzed for use by multiple end user applications.

In the embodiment depicted in the environment overlord server C analytic engine C cache server C database C message bus C and mediation engine C are all execution environments executing on the cloud machine which is a hardware device. The analytic engine C may comprise a Pentaho Mondrian engine the cache server C may be an EhCache server the database C may be an MS. SQL database server and the mediation engine C may be an Apache Camel engine. Gateway modules C and C may be any type of gateway modules described in the context of . The overlord server may utilize or otherwise incorporate technologies such as Liferay v6.1 JRE 1.6 Apache CXF DOJO v1.8 MXGraph Spring 3 Strophe JQChart JasperReports True License InstallAnyWhere and or JPivot.

As initially discussed above in the context of commissioning module participates in a commissioning process performed for example by system A for managing environmental conditions within a physical structure. According to some embodiments the commissioning process comprises the steps depicted in . In various other embodiments the steps in the process need not be performed in the order shown one or more steps may be omitted and one or more steps not depicted may be added to the process shown in . The steps include step in which one or more devices are localized step during which commissioned units are created step in which commissioned units are bound to devices e.g. sensors or other commissioned units step in which commissioned units are linked step in which commissioned units are configured for use within a system such as system A and step in which commissioned units are programmed as necessary.

In step of devices to be associated with a system such as system A are localized. Localization is the mapping of devices such as luminaires sensors and controllers to a physical location within a physical structure such as a building. Physical structures such as buildings are generally associated with a hierarchy. For example a campus may comprise multiple buildings a building may comprise multiple floors and a floor may comprise multiple rooms. During step a device such as a sensor may be localized by being associated with a particular corner or a room within a building. Additionally devices as well as spaces within structures may be associated with functions during the localization process. For example a room may be assigned the function of a cell office a corridor a restroom a meeting room or an open plan office. A device may be assigned the function of for example occupancy sensing light sensing light production or control. During the commissioning process a digital floor plan of a structure such as a building may also be created. According to some embodiments the floor plan may comprise all the details regarding the hierarchy of the structure e.g. floors functional spaces within floors devices and their locations within the functional spaces . A floor plan may also contain information on functional links between control devices and commissioned units. The floor plan may be interactively created by an authorized user accessing a commissioning tool executed by one or more processors associated with the commissioning module wherein the commissioning tool visually illustrates the various levels of hierarchy associated with the structure. An exemplary digital floor plan is depicted in . The floor plan may also visually identify all localized devices and their properties.

Localization may also involve devices such as luminaires or commissioned units comprising luminaires being triggered to flash and visually identify their location. Localization may also be accomplished using coded light technology. Generally coded light technology involves a non visible modulation of light to contain information about the light source such as a unique identifier and location information. Examples of devices that may be localized using coded light technology includes without limitation area controllers gateway modules luminaires ILB sensors PoE sensors PoE manual control user interfaces and PoE switches. During and or following the localization process devices may report their properties to a commissioning tool associated for example with commissioning module of . A luminaire may report for example information indicative of its type e.g. CCT max output available sensors hardware version software version and a unique ID. As a result of the localization step of the digital floor map may graphically reflect the various localized devices at their appropriate locations along with their properties e.g. type unique ID .

In step commissioned units are created. A commissioned unit comprises one or more devices that are associated with each other within a system such as system A and that behave according to particular configurations of internal triggers triggers arising from within the commissioned unit and external triggers triggers arising outside the commissioned unit . Triggers may include for example sensor data or a manual or central control. A device may be part of multiple commissioned units. And commissioned units may be used to define a hierarchy within a physical structure such as a building. For example a commissioned unit may be 1 a group of devices such as luminaires and sensors 2 one or more individual devices or 3 a combination of one or more commissioned units and individual devices. A commissioned unit may also be an area e.g. a work space room corridor comprising one or more groups of devices such as luminaires sensors and controllers.

In many embodiments a commissioned unit may be assigned one or more templates. Templates are a collection of predefined system settings or device parameter configurations designed to adjust the behavior of one or more devices so as to produce a set of environmental conditions. A system for managing environmental conditions such as system A operating within a large space may need to create different lighting and other environmental conditions in different parts of the space that face different circumstances e.g. high foot traffic low occupancy . Templates provide an efficient mechanism for capturing the preferred behavior of devices in these different spaces under commonly occurring circumstances. Templates may specify for example minimum light levels in a corridor of an office building during work hours.

In some embodiments commissioning of units in step may be rule based. In rule based commissioning multiple devices may be commissioned as a single commissioned unit based on predefined rules. In some such embodiments the rule may indicate the size of the commissioned unit in terms of the number of devices that may be included as part of the unit. Moreover other dynamic parameters such as the position of a system user in an area and the dimensions and mounting positions of the devices around the user a temporary or permanent commissioned unit may be formed. depicts an embodiment of rule based commissioning where the central dark spot represents a system user. In this embodiment devices that are at least partially located within the first circular area surrounding the user the task area may form one commissioned unit and devices primarily located in the outer circular area that lies outside the first circular area surrounding the user immediate surrounding area may form another commissioned unit. Each commissioned unit may be controlled separately and lighting rules may apply differently to the same device depending upon which commissioned unit it is associated with.

In other embodiments commissioning of units in step may be fixed. In fixed commissioning pre commissioned units or groups are created for example by logically dividing a zone such as an open plan office into dedicated zones e.g. task zones corridors decorative zones and creating one or more commissioned units comprising devices that are localized to these dedicated zones. depicts several commissioned units e.g. Task Groups A B and C Decorative Group A and Corridor Group A formed based on the logical division of an open plan room into dedicated zones three task zones a decorative zone and a corridor zone and on the location and spatial configuration of luminaires within each dedicated zone. The creation of commissioned units of step may also involve the addition of devices e.g. luminaires controls and sensors to previously commissioned units and linking newly commissioned units to existing commissioned units. Linking is discussed below in the context of step .

Grouping multiple devices into a single commissioned unit allows for efficient management of environmental conditions. For example multiple IP luminaires and their associated sensors may be responsible for illuminating a particular task zone such as a table top. Rather than separately issuing commands to each IP luminaire in the commissioned unit or separately monitoring sensor data for each of the different sensors systems such as system A may issue one command for each commissioned unit when necessary to adjust an environmental condition such as illumination which may be applied after any necessary processing to all the lighting units within the commissioned unit. Similarly sensor data from multiple sensors within the commissioned unit may be reported in the aggregate to system A modules such as the environment manager module rather that repeatedly reporting sensor data from each individual sensor.

In step commissioned units comprising lighting or HVAC devices are bound to control and sensor devices or commissioned units comprising such devices. The commissioning tool described previously will in many embodiments allow an authorized user e.g. a commissioning engineer to select sensors e.g. occupancy sensors light sensors for association with commissioned units. Binding commissioned units to particular sensors or types of sensors allows for the creation of commissioned units that are suitable for participating in occupancy based or daylight based environmental control. These control mechanisms are described in the context of below.

In many embodiments of the process depicted in an authorized user e.g. commissioning engineer may bind multiple occupancy sensors to the same commissioned unit. In such an arrangement the commissioned unit when under occupancy based control may be directed to display occupied behavior if just one of the bound sensors senses occupancy and may be directed to display unoccupied behavior only if all of its bound sensors fail to sense occupancy. The user may also bind multiple daylight sensors to the same commissioned unit. In such a configuration the aforementioned commissioning tool may also enable the authorized user to configure how multiple light related events arising from the multiple daylight sensors are aggregated and or processed. The commissioning tool may in various embodiments allow an authorized user to bind manual and personal controllers both fixed and mobile to commissioned units. This allows for the creation of manually controllable commissioned units and allows for the assignment of a scope of control for each controller device. This in turn results in the efficient management of control requests received from the various controllers in a building and an overall increase in the efficient management of environmental conditions within the building.

In step commissioned units are linked. Linking commissioned units generally requires associating the commissioned units in a memory. Once linked a commissioned unit may affect the behavior of the other commissioned units with which it is linked. For example whether or not a first commissioned unit switches off its lights when the only remaining occupant of the area leaves may depend upon whether or not another linked commissioned unit providing illumination in an adjacent area is switched off. In many embodiments if a first commissioned unit comprising luminaires is linked to a second commissioned unit comprising luminaires and the first unit detects occupancy the light produced by the second unit may transition to a preconfigured interlinked light level in response to the detected occupancy. Linking commissioned units therefore allows the system to appropriately control environmental conditions in larger spaces e.g. large open office spaces by coordinating the response of multiple commissioned units scoped to various areas within these spaces when changes e.g. changes in occupancy are detected in just one area.

Under some circumstances coordinating the behavior of multiple commissioned units may be necessary to provide a comfortable environment for occupants of a large open space within a building. For example when few occupants are remaining in cell offices within an open plan office space it will be energy efficient to turn off lighting in unoccupied areas of the office space. At the same time it may be beneficial to ensure that illumination in areas adjacent to the occupied cell offices as well as some common corridor areas is maintained in order to avoid a sense of isolation for the remaining occupants of the open plan office space.

In step the commissioning tool may also allow an authorized user to link commissioned units to one or more HVAC grids or areas. In many embodiments a single HVAC area or grid may comprise multiple lighting groups. In such embodiments sensors associated with the multiple lighting groups may be associated with an HVAC area identifier for the single HVAC area or grid. When such a configuration is operational sensor information from commissioned units within the multiple lighting groups may be forwarded to HVAC area controllers associated with the single HVAC area or grid.

Step is a configuration step during which various configurable parameters of commissioned units are specified using for example the commissioning tool. Such parameters may control a commissioned unit s default behavior under various conditions. During the configuration step templates may be assigned to or disassociated from commissioned units a commissioned unit s power up behavior may be specified control options may be enabled and disabled timing parameters e.g. fade time dwell time hold time grace fade time smart time may be specified occupancy related parameters e.g. maximum light level when occupied minimum light level when occupied may be specified general lighting parameters e.g. background light level task light level may be specified user control parameters e.g. dim step dim speed retention time may be specified and priority levels associated with different control options e.g. occupancy based control daylight based control manual control personal control and central control may be set. During this step the commissioning tool associated with for example the commissioning module of system A or the central dashboard associated with for example with the environment manager module of system A may selectively disallow a user e.g. a facility manager from specifying and or adjusting certain parameters for commissioned devices or units that are likely to be outside of the user s level of competency. During this step an authorized user may also be able to associate an application behavior template with any commissioned unit. An application behavior template is a collection of parameter or other configuration values suitable for a particular application.

To make the commissioning process more efficient the commissioning tool and or the central dashboard also permits the simultaneous configuring of multiple commissioned units. For example a user may elect to have two or more commissioned units receive the same configuration settings as previously selected for another commissioned unit. The user may also use the commissioning tool to copy and paste configuration settings from one device or commissioned unit to another. In various embodiments the commissioning tool or central dashboard may also be used to revert configured parameters of any device or commissioned unit to previous settings such as factory default settings. Moreover the commissioning tool may be used to remove links to sensors and controls. The commissioning tool may also enable an authorized user to manually or automatically calibrate sensors e.g. daylight sensors . While a sensor is calibrating it may not be able to communicate with the rest of the system. A calibrated sensor may provide visual or other feedback once calibrated successfully.

Step is a programming step during which the user may create and assign a template to one or more commissioned units such that the commissioned units are able to behave in accordance with the template if required. For example the user may use the commissioning tool to create a template of a particular lighting scene for a commissioned unit by specifying lighting parameters for various luminaires included within the commissioned unit. Such a lighting scene may thereafter be used as a default scene in a meeting zone associated with the commissioned unit when the meeting zone transitions from an unoccupied to an occupied state. In some embodiments the commissioning tool may allow the user to save current light settings of a commissioned unit as a new scene. A commissioned unit may have multiple associated scenes for application under different circumstances such as under specific occupancy conditions daylight conditions and or at specific times of the day.

In some embodiments the central dashboard may allow an authorized user to remotely re commission previously commissioned units. In order to perform the re commissioning the central dashboard may provide user interface means for searching for and locating the units to be re commissioned on a displayed digital floor plan of the physical structure in which the device is housed. Users may be able to search for the commissioned units using the unit s type location within the structure identification number or other information. Commissioned units matching the user s search criteria may thereafter be displayed and selectable by the user. Once a commissioned unit or device is selected or otherwise identified for remote re commissioning the user may be allowed to view and edit various parameters associated with the unit or device. The central dashboard may also allow the user to disassociate the unit or device for one commissioned unit and re associate the device or unit with a different device or unit.

According to many embodiments environmental conditions within a structure such as a building are monitored and managed to provide occupants optimal conditions e.g. lighting temperature airflow while at the same time conserving energy. This section focuses on occupancy and daylight based control of environmental conditions. While many of the embodiments described below rely on pre programmed logic and system parameters other embodiments function by monitoring conditions such as light levels and temperature in real time receiving feedback and or instructions from occupants or remote users of the spaces and adjusting environmental conditions accordingly.

Occupancy based control of environmental conditions occurs automatically in reaction to changes in occupancy within a space. Occupancy based control mechanisms may however in many embodiments apply in conjunction with manual central or personal control mechanisms. In the sections below details regarding configurable parameters referred to in the descriptions of each figure below appear prior to the figure descriptions themselves.

Using the commissioning tool an authorized user such as a commissioning engineer may configure parameters indicative of maximum and minimum light output by a commissioned unit associated with an occupied space. In some embodiments the parameters indicative of the maximum light that should be output when an associated area is occupied MaxWhenOccupied and the minimum light that should be output when the associated area is occupied MinWhenOccupied may each be set to a percentage value between 0 and 100 of output ability. However the parameter MaxWhenOccupied may not in some embodiments using Coded Light technology be set to a value above 90 . Likewise in some embodiments using Coded Light technology the parameter MinWhenOccupied may not be set to a value below 25 . These restrictions may be required in some embodiments to account for requirements of Coded Light technology and or physical limitations of luminaires.

Light Level 1 and Light Level 2 are configurable parameters associated with occupancy based control of environmental conditions. In many embodiments Light Level 1 signifies the light level for providing a lower background level of illumination and Light Level 2 signifies the light level for providing a higher task level of illumination. A default value for the Light Level 1 parameter may be 300 lux while a default value for the Light Level 2 parameter may be 500 lux. An authorized user may be able to use a tool such as the commissioning tool the central dashboard or other manual or personal controllers to set and or alter these parameters. In various embodiments these parameters may track values associated with MinWhenOccupied to MaxWhenOccupied.

In step a plurality of luminaires associated with the designated zone produce a swarm lighting effect. A swarm lighting effect is produced when a plurality of luminaires each switches to a higher level of light but the time at which each luminaire performs the transition occurs in accordance with its distance from a first luminaire performing the transition. Luminaires that are closer to the first luminaire perform the transition to a higher light level earlier than luminaires that are further away from the first luminaire. This creates the effect of light spreading throughout a space from a particular originating point. In some embodiments the swarm effect once started may take place without further coordination from system modules such as environment manager module or gateway module . For example an IP luminaire such as IP luminaire may not only cause its own light source e.g. light source to switch to producing a higher level of light but may also communicate with another IP luminaire located proximally but further away from the first luminaire e.g. IP luminaire via for example its control module e.g. control module and link L such that IP luminaire then switches its own light source e.g. light source to produce a higher level of light. In other embodiments other system modules such as environment manager module or gateway module may coordinate the swarm effect by for example selectively instructing luminaires or to turn on or produce a higher level of light.

Interlinked Light Level is a configurable parameter associated with occupancy based control of environmental conditions. In many embodiments it signifies the level of light produced by a commissioned unit when occupancy is detected not by the commissioned unit itself but by one or more linked commissioned units. In many embodiments the Interlinked Light Level parameter ranges from 0 to 100 of a luminaire s output and may be configured at a 1 granularity. The commissioning tool may be used to configure the Interlinked Light Level for any commissioned unit and the central dashboard or a manual or personal controller may be used to reset this parameter for one or more commissioned units.

In step A sensor input is received. The sensor input may be from one or multiple sensors and the sensor s may be any type of occupancy sensor such as a motion sensor. The sensor input may be received for processing by the sensor itself or by one or more modules depicted in e.g. environment manager module or gateway module . In step A the sensor input is processed and a determination is made that a designated zone has transitioned from an occupied state e.g. with at least one occupant to an unoccupied state e.g. with no occupants . In step A one or more memories accessible to luminaire controllers or commissioned units associated with luminaire controllers in at least the designated zone are updated to reflect that the designated zone has transitioned to an unoccupied state. In many embodiments the one or more memories may also be accessible to other system modules such as environment manager module and gateway module .

In step A a plurality of luminaires or lighting units associated with the designated zone is transitioned to providing illumination at an Interlinked Light Level. The association with the designated zone may arise due to the plurality of luminaires or lighting units belonging to one or more commissioned units linked to a commissioned unit scoped to the designated zone. In many embodiments the plurality of luminaires or lighting units is accessible to at least one IP luminaire or at least one commissioned unit in the designated zone. The plurality of luminaires or lighting units may be part of the same commissioned unit or different commissioned units that are linked during the commissioning process. In some embodiments the command or instruction to transition to an Interlinked Light Level may be propagated from one IP luminaire e.g. IP luminaire of system A to another communicatively linked IP luminaire e.g. IP luminaire of system A without coordination from more central system modules such as environment manager module or gateway module . In some other embodiments environment manager module or gateway module may instruct each commissioned unit linked to a commissioned unit in the designated zone to produce an Interlinked Light Level and each IP luminaire that is part of the commissioned unit may thereafter cause its own luminaires to transition to the Interlinked Light Level. In some embodiments a second commissioned unit linked to a first commissioned unit scoped to the designated zone may switch its luminaires or lighting units to the Interlined Light Level only if the second commissioned unit is not scoped to another zone that is occupied.

In step B occupancy sensors produce data indicative of a designated zone transitioning to an occupied state from an unoccupied state. In step B at least a first luminaire associated with a first linked commissioned unit produces a background level of illumination within a predetermined reaction period following the production of the sensor data. The first linked commissioned unit may be linked to a plurality of commissioned units and may be components of a system for managing environmental conditions described herein. In step B the first linked commissioned unit transmits data indicative of the state change of the designated zone. In some embodiments the data indicative of the state change may be transmitted by the first linked commissioned unit directly to another commissioned unit to which it is linked or to a system module such as environment manager module or gateway module . The first linked commissioned unit may also transmit the data by updating a memory accessible to other system modules or commissioned units with the data indicative of the state change. In step B a second commissioned unit linked to the first commissioned unit receives the data indicative of the state change and causes a second luminaire or lighting unit to alter its illumination. In some embodiments the second commissioned unit itself retrieves the data indicative of the state change from for example a memory or system module that the first linked commissioned unit updated with the data indicative of the state change. The second luminaire or lighting unit may alter its illumination by for example increasing or decreasing the light level or intensity of light it produces changing the color or color temperature of the light it produces or changing the direction of the light it produces. The desired alteration of its illumination may be stored on the second commissioned unit itself or received from other system modules such as environment manager module or gateway module .

The grace fading parameter indicates whether or not a fading effect taking place within a fade time will be performed by a commissioned unit when transitioning between one environmental condition e.g. light level to another. The parameter may be enabled or disabled for any commissioned unit that is capable of performing the fade effect. The commissioning tool or central dashboard may be used to configure the grace fading and fade time parameters for any commissioned unit and the central dashboard or other manual or personal controller may be used to reset the parameter for commissioned units.

In step sensor input is received. The sensor input may be from one or multiple sensors and the sensor s may be any type of occupancy sensor such as a motion sensor. The sensor input may be received for processing by the sensor itself or by one or more modules depicted in e.g. environment manager module or gateway module . In step the sensor input is processed and a determination is made that a designated zone has transitioned from an occupied state e.g. with at least one occupant to an unoccupied state e.g. with no occupants . In step one or more memories accessible to IP luminaires or commissioned units in at least the designated zone are updated to reflect that the designated zone has transitioned to an unoccupied state. In many embodiments the one or more memories may also be accessible to other system modules such as environment manager module and gateway module .

In step a plurality of luminaires or commissioned units associated with the designated zone is switched off in compliance with a fade effect. The plurality of luminaires or commissioned units may be scoped to the designated zone directly or indirectly by being linked to one or more commissioned units that are scoped to the designated zone. The plurality of luminaires may be part of the same commissioned unit or different commissioned units that are linked during the commissioning process.

The fade effect may involve gradually transitioning one or more luminaires or lighting units to producing lower levels of light until the luminaires or lighting units effectively produce no illumination. In some embodiments a commissioned unit may only comply with the fade effect if a particular parameter e.g. grace fading is enabled for that unit. Other details with respect to the fade effect e.g. the amount of time required to transition from providing the present level of light to a level of light associated with a switched off state may be configured per commissioned unit. Accordingly each commissioned unit participating in step to transition the plurality of luminaires or lighting units to a switched off state may perform its own version of the fade effect. In some embodiments the command or instruction to transition to switching off may be received from a central system module such as environment manager module or gateway module by each commissioned unit scoped to the designated zone. The command may thereafter be processed and propagated from one IP luminaire e.g. IP luminaire of system A to another communicatively linked IP luminaire e.g. IP luminaire of system A of each commissioned unit without further coordination from system modules such as environment manager module or gateway module .

Hold period is a configurable parameter associated with occupancy based control of environmental conditions. In many embodiments hold period is the period of time needed for the system to ensure that a determined condition is correct or still applicable. It helps avoid situations where temporary changes in occupancy lead to frequent and unnecessary adjustments to environmental conditions. For example after sensors initially indicate that a zone has become vacant and if the sensors still indicate vacancy after the hold period has elapsed this implies with a greater likelihood that the monitored zone is truly vacant and that the vacancy is not the result of occupants temporarily stepping outside the monitored zone. In many embodiments the hold period may range from 1 to 35 minutes with a default value of 15 minutes. Manual controllers may allow a user to alter the hold period with a granularity of 1 minute. The commissioning tool may be used to configure the hold period for any commissioned unit and the central dashboard or other manual or personal controller may be used to reset the hold period for one or more commissioned units.

Grace period is a configurable parameter associated with occupancy based control of environmental conditions. In many embodiments it signifies the time needed for the system to ensure that a determined detected environmental condition still persists after the passage of a particular period of time. In some embodiments the grace period is an additional time period initiated after the hold period has expired to provide an additional duration of time during which sensor output is monitored to determine if a detected change in occupancy is persistent for an even longer period of time. In many embodiments the grace period may range from 0 to 25 seconds with a default value of 5 seconds. Manual controllers may allow a user to alter the grace period with a granularity of 1 second. The commissioning tool may be used to configure the grace period for any commissioned unit and the central dashboard or other manual or personal controllers may be used to reset the grace period for one or more commissioned units.

Prolong period is a configurable parameter associated with occupancy based control of environmental conditions. In many embodiments it signifies the time needed for the system to ensure that a determined detected environmental condition still persists after the passage of a particular period of time. In some embodiments the prolong period is an additional time period initiated after a first grace period has expired to provide an additional duration of time during which sensor output is monitored to determine if a detected change in occupancy is persistent for an even longer period of time. In many embodiments it is used as an added precautionary measure to ensure an area s unoccupied status just prior to turning luminaires or lighting units in the area off. Manual controllers may allow a user to manually alter the prolong period with a particular granularity. The commissioning tool may be used to configure the prolong period for any commissioned unit and the central dashboard or other manual or personal controller may be used to reset the prolong period for one or more commissioned units.

If the determination in step is positive e.g. designated zone was unoccupied throughout the hold period then control transfers to step . In step a plurality of luminaires lighting units or light sources associated with the designated zone each begin a transition to a lower light level in compliance with a fade effect and a grace period is initiated during which sensor input associated with the designated zone is monitored. In many embodiments the plurality of light sources is each accessible to at least one IP luminaire in the designated zone. The plurality of luminaires lighting units or light sources may also be part of the same commissioned unit or different but linked commissioned units. At the conclusion of the grace period a determination is made in step as to whether for the entire grace period the sensor input indicated that the designated zone remained unoccupied. If the result of the determination is negative e.g. designated zone became occupied during the grace period then control transfers to step and the plurality of luminaires lighting units or light sources that began their transitions to a lower light level in step begin transitioning back to their previous higher light levels in compliance with a fade effect. In many embodiments during any point in the grace period sensor input indicating occupancy in the designated zone would result in the designated zone s occupied status failing to be confirmed i.e. in these embodiments there would be no need for the determination of step at the conclusion of the grace period . These circumstances indicate that the designated zone s unoccupied status is not confirmed.

If the result of the determination in step is positive e.g. designated zone remained unoccupied for the duration of the grace period then in step the plurality of luminaires are allowed to complete their transition to the lower light level if the transition has not yet completed. Once the plurality of luminaires lighting units or light sources have transitioned to the lower light level a prolong period is initiated.

At the conclusion of the prolong period a determination is made in step as to whether for the entire prolong period the sensor input indicated that the designated zone remained unoccupied. If the result of the determination is negative e.g. designated zone became occupied during the prolong period then control transfers to step and the plurality of luminaires lighting units or light sources that began their transitions to the lower light level in step begin transitioning back to their previous higher light levels in compliance with a fade effect. In many embodiments during any point in the prolong period sensor input indicating occupancy in the designated zone would result in the designated zone s occupied status failing to be confirmed i.e. in these embodiments there would be no need for the determination of step at the conclusion of the prolong period . If the result of the determination in step is positive e.g. designated zone remained unoccupied for the duration of the prolong period then in step the plurality of luminaires lighting units or light sources begin their transition to a light level associated with a switched off state in compliance with a fade effect and a second grace period is initiated. In many embodiments the amount of time associated with the fade effect e.g. the time it takes for a luminaire to transition to a different light level in accordance with the controlling fade effect may be automatically reset so that the luminaires lighting units or light sources of a commissioned unit do not transition to a light level associated with a switched off state prior to the completion of the second grace period initiated in step . Alternatively if luminaires lighting units or light sources of a commissioned unit are close to completing the fade effect and the grace period has not yet elapsed the luminaires lighting units or light sources may wait to complete the transition until the grace period initiated in step has elapsed.

At the conclusion of the second grace period initiated in step a determination is made step as to whether for the entire second grace period the sensor input indicated that the designated zone remained unoccupied. If the result of the determination is negative e.g. designated zone became occupied during the grace period then control transfers to step and the plurality of luminaires lighting units or light sources that began their transitions to a light level consistent with a switched off state in step begin transitioning back to their original higher light levels in compliance with a fade effect. In many embodiments during any point in the second grace period sensor input indicating occupancy in the designated zone would result in the designated zone s occupied status failing to be confirmed i.e. in these embodiments there would be no need for the determination of step at the conclusion of the second grace period . If the result of the determination in step is positive e.g. designated zone remained unoccupied for the duration of the prolong period then in step the plurality of luminaires lighting units or light sources proceed to complete their transition to a light level consistent with a switched off state.

Dwell period is a configurable parameter associated with occupancy based control of environmental conditions. In many embodiments it signifies the time needed for the system to ensure that a user is situated at a space rather than simply passing through it. When an area in question is occupied for the duration of the dwell period this indicates that commissioned unit s in the area in question may assume the likelihood of more prolonged occupancy within the space and may transition to providing a higher level of lighting. In many embodiments the dwell period may range from 0 to 30 seconds with a default value of 10 seconds. Manual controllers may allow a user to alter the dwell period with a granularity of 1 second. The commissioning tool may be used to configure the dwell period for any commissioned unit and the central dashboard or other manual or personal controllers may be used to reset the dwell period for one or more commissioned units.

In some embodiments occupancy events are ignored for the duration of the dwell period following the detection of a first occupancy event. In such embodiments occupancy events may be monitored only are the dwell period expires. In such embodiments only if occupancy is detected between the moment the dwell period expires and a hold period expires after the dwell period will the area in question transition to the occupied state. Otherwise the area will go back to being in the unoccupied state when the hold period expires.

Smart time is a configurable parameter associated with occupancy based control of environmental conditions. In many embodiments if movement is detected during a grace period after a hold period following a detection of vacancy the system assumes that the hold time was set to be inadequately short i.e. vacancy was concluded too soon after the last movement detection and the hold time is extended once by the duration indicated by the smart time parameter. In many embodiments if motion is detected after an extended hold time the hold time is not further extended. In some embodiments the smart time period may range from 0 to 15 minutes with a default value of 10 minutes. The commissioning tool may be used to configure the smart time period for any commissioned unit and the central dashboard or other manual or personal controller may be used to reset this parameter for one or more commissioned units. In many embodiments smart time cannot accumulate.

In step sensor input from within the cell zone is processed to determine if a work zone within the cell zone has transitioned from an unoccupied to an occupied state. If the determination is negative e.g. no transition of the work zone from an unoccupied to an occupied state then control remains at step until a later processing of sensor input indicates such a transition. If the determination in step is a positive one e.g. sensor input indicates transition of the work zone from an unoccupied to an occupied status then a dwell period is initiated occupancy in the work zone is monitored and control transitions to step . Step involves monitoring occupancy in the work zone and determining whether at any time during the dwell period sensor input indicates that the work zone is unoccupied. If the work zone is found to be unoccupied at any time during the dwell period then no environmental changes are made in the work zone the dwell period is ended and control transfers back to the step . If throughout the dwell period the work zone never became unoccupied then control transfers to step and at least one luminaire or lighting unit or light source within the work zone transitions to a task level of light e.g. Light Level 2 within a pre configured reaction time.

In step a determination is made as to whether at least one zone adjacent to the corridor zone is occupied. This determination may be made by one or more commissioned units in or otherwise associated with the corridor zone. For example in some embodiments a commissioned unit in the corridor zone may identify commissioned units in adjacent zones using its own location information and the location information of other commissioned units. Once at least one commissioned unit in each adjacent zone is identified their occupancy statuses may be retrieved in some embodiments by querying or otherwise retrieving the information from the commissioned units directly. In other embodiments a commissioned unit in the corridor zone may access the occupancy statuses of the adjacent commissioned units from one or more remote memories associated with other system modules such as the environment manager module or gateway module of system A. The location information of commissioned units may be stored locally on one or more memories of the commissioned unit in the corridor zone e.g. cached or stored remotely on one or more memories remotely accessible to the commissioned unit in the corridor zone e.g. at one or more memories associated with environment module or gateway module of system A . If the result of the determination in step is positive e.g. at least one zone adjacent to the corridor zone is occupied then in step no change is made to the illumination in the corridor zone. If the determination in step is negative e.g. no zone adjacent to the corridor zone is occupied then in step a switch off sequence is initiated in order to transition luminaires or lighting units or light sources in the corridor zone to producing no illumination.

In step a determination is made as to whether or not the level of illumination within the corridor zone is at a predetermined minimum level. In some embodiments this determination is made with respect to the entire corridor zone and in other embodiments this determination is made with respect to an area proximate to the sensor s producing the sensor input indicating in step that a change occurred in the corridor zone s occupancy status. In some embodiments this determination may be made by hardware firmware or computer code associated with one or more commissioned units in the corridor zone by hardware firmware or computer code associated with one or more modules of system A or any combination thereof. If the result of the determination in step is positive i.e. illumination level of corridor zone is at or above the predetermined minimum level then in step no change is made to the illumination in the corridor zone. If the result of the determination in step is negative i.e. illumination level of corridor zone is below the predetermined minimum level then in step one or more commissioned units in the corridor zone causes the illumination level provided by one or more associated luminaires or lighting units or light sources to be increased such that the level of illumination within the corridor zone is increased to the predetermined minimum level within a predetermined reaction time.

Using the commissioning tool an authorized user such as a commissioning engineer may configure parameters indicative of maximum and minimum light levels that may be achieved in an area under daylight based control. In some embodiments the parameters MaxRegulationLightLevel and MinRegulationLightLevel may each be set be equal to the occupancy based control parameters MaxWhenOccupied and MinWhenOccupied respectively.

Daylight harvesting is a configurable parameter associated with daylight based control of environmental conditions. In many embodiments if enabled for one or more commissioned units it allows daylight based regulation of light levels in an area scoped to those commissioned units. In many embodiments daylight harvesting when enabled works to maintain light levels in a space within a particular range e.g. MinimumRegulationLightLevel to MaximumRegulationLightLevel .

When a user manually configures or adjusts the illumination set point of a commissioned unit a parameter of the configured unit e.g. CalibratedMaximum is set to the new set point value. The commissioned unit may still be regulated based on daylight based controls but the new set point value will be used to regulate environmental conditions associated with the commissioned unit.

In step the requested scene is accessed. A scene may be a collection of predetermined environmental parameters that transforms the environmental conditions in a particular zone is a prescribed way. The environmental conditions affected may be for example lighting conditions temperature humidity and air flow. Each environmental condition prescribed in a scene may be tied to particular one or more commissioned units or to particular types of commissioned units. Moreover scenes may comprise very specific environmental conditions e.g. requiring a particular commissioned unit or type of commissioned unit to produce light of a particular color at a particular intensity or they may be specified more generally allowing commissioned units involved in producing the scene some discretion to choose specific values e.g. specifying a range of colors or a range of light levels in a particular region in the meeting room and allowing an implementing commissioning unit to choose values within the prescribed range . A collection of pre configured environmental scenes may be stored on one or more memories accessible to for example the environment manager module or gateway module of system A or any commissioned unit associated with the meeting zone referenced in step . For example an area controller such as area controller may be such a commissioned unit capable of accessing a requested scene. In many embodiments such a commissioned unit may be communicatively coupled to one or more IP luminaires that control lighting conditions in various portions of the meeting room.

In some embodiments in step the environment control module or gateway module of the system may access one or more memories to retrieve details associated with the requested scene e.g. the collection of specified environmental conditions to be recreated in particular areas of a space . Different predetermined scenes each associated with a unique identifier may be stored in a database and accessing a requested scene in step may involve matching the unique identifier of the scene requested in step with the unique identifier of a scene stored in the in the aforementioned one or more memories.

In step the requested scene is applied. In some embodiments respective details of the requested scene are transmitted from a system module e.g. environment manager module or gateway module of system A to respective commissioned units e.g. IP controller and of system A for application. For example a scene may require that all walls in a room be washed in red light of particular dimness and all task lights in the room be dimmed up to a particular level. In some embodiments these details may be codified in an environment control command and transmitted by the environment manager module to an area controller e.g. area controller controlling the room in question. The area controller may thereafter transmit the commands for changing the wall wash color to one or more IP luminaires that provide decorative wall washes in the room and the commands for changing the task lighting to one or more IP luminaires controlling task lighting in the room. The area controller may in some embodiments also process the commands received from the other modules such as the environment manager module prior to communicating them to the appropriate IP luminaires or other commissioned units so that the commands are compatible with a format or communication protocol understood by the particular IP luminaires or commissioned units .

In step a determination is made as to whether the change in illumination is greater than a pre configured amount. In some embodiments this determination may be made by a commissioned unit e.g. area controller IP luminaire that is located proximate to the sensor s producing the sensor input and or a commissioned unit that is bound to the work zone during the commissioning process. In other embodiments this determination is made more centrally by one or more processors associated with an environment manager module such as module of system A or a gateway module such as module of system A. If the result of the determination in step is a negative one e.g. change in illumination is not greater than a pre configured amount then no adjustment in illumination in the work zone is made. However in some embodiments each change in illumination that is not acted upon following step is aggregated and temporarily saved in a memory accessible to the module or modules performing the determinations in steps and . In such embodiments step may involve using the running aggregate of changes in illumination over multiple previous determinations in step that led to negative determinations in step in order to make the present determination in step .

If the result of the determination in step is a positive one e.g. change in illumination is greater than a pre configured amount then control transfers to step and a determination is made as to whether the level of illumination in the work zone is at or above a pre configured level. In some embodiments the determination of step may be made by a commissioned unit e.g. area controller IP luminaire that is located proximate to the sensor s producing the sensor input and or a commissioned unit that is bound to the work zone during the commissioning process. In other embodiments this determination is made more centrally by one or more processors associated with an environment control module such as module of system A or a gateway module such as module of system A. If the determination in step is a positive one e.g. level of illumination in the work zone is at or above the pre configured level then the illumination from at least one luminaire or lighting unit or light source in the work zone is adjusted to provide a pre configured minimum level of illumination in step . If on the other hand the determination in step is a negative one e.g. level of illumination in the work zone is below the pre configured level then the illumination from at least one luminaire in the work zone is adjusted to provide a pre configured maximum level of illumination. When adjusting illumination in steps and many embodiments may employ fading in accordance with a configured fade time and or fade speed if the fade feature is enabled for the one or more commissioned units whose at least one luminaire in the work zone is adjusted in steps or .

In step a determination is made with respect to whether the change in natural illumination is part of an increasing or decreasing trend. An increasing trend may be identified after multiple consecutive increases in natural illumination are detected in step for the zone in question. Likewise a decreasing trend may be identified after multiple consecutive decreases in natural illumination are detected in step for the zone in question. The number of consecutive increases or decreases needed in order for a series of changes in natural illumination to qualify as a trend may be a configurable parameter in many embodiments which may be set and or reset using for example the central dashboard of the environment manager module of system A.

In many embodiments the determination of step may be made by a commissioned unit e.g. area controller IP luminaire that is located proximate to the sensor s producing the sensor input and or a commissioned unit that is bound to the zone in question during the commissioning process. In other embodiments this determination is made more centrally by one or more processors associated with an environment manager module such as module of system A or a gateway module such as module of system A. If no trend is identified then control reverts to step and input from the sensor s may again be processed subsequently. If an increasing trend is found then the illumination from at least one luminaire or lighting unit or light source in the designated zone is adjusted to provide a lower level of illumination within a first duration step . If on the other hand a decreasing trend is found then the illumination from at least one luminaire or lighting unit or light source in the designated zone is adjusted in step to provide a higher level of illumination than currently provided by the luminaire within a second duration that is shorter than the first duration of step . When adjusting illumination in steps and many embodiments may employ fading in accordance with a configured fade time and or fade speed if the fade feature is enabled for the one or more commissioned units associated with the at least one luminaire referred to in steps and .

While many of the embodiments described in the previous sections on occupancy and daylight based controls focus on methods for monitoring and or identifying patterns with respect to changes in occupancy and lighting conditions and optimally adjusting environmental conditions to respond to these changes this section focuses on the controls available to users for causing changes in environmental conditions. In many embodiments the user may be able to override the automatic behavior described in the above sections on occupancy and or daylight based light management.

In any given zone all available control types e.g. automatically triggered and user triggered may be enabled or disabled. Commissioned units may be configured such that one or more control types are enabled or disabled. Additionally for each zone and or commissioned unit a priority may be associated with each type of control. When a control type is enabled in an area or for a commissioned unit the enabled type of control e.g. manual personal control central control occupancy based control may be used to issue control requests for the enabled area or for the commissioned unit. Different control types may be enabled and operational in the same area or for the same commissioned unit. Priorities are used to resolve any conflicts or ambiguities given all received control inputs and to determine the environmental conditions of any space at any given time.

In many embodiments mobile controllers e.g. smartphones tablet computers and other hand held computing devices may be used by users to request changes in environmental conditions. Mobile controllers may be configured to provide visual auditory and or tactical feedback to its users when connecting to the environmental management system and or a visual auditory and or tactical feedback to its users within a period of time e.g. 0.3 seconds from the time users request a change in environmental conditions. Mobile controllers may be used for personal manual and central control of commissioned units based on their location within a physical structure. For example a smartphone may behave as a personal controller allowing control of environmental conditions only in its user s personal or work zone when it is operated in an open zone such as an open office space. However when the smartphone is in a meeting zone such as a conference room it may behave as a manual controller allowing its user to control environmental conditions in the entire meeting zone.

Method comprises steps through . Step involves determining whether or not a device or unit in question is commissioned. The process of commissioning was previously described for example in the context of . In some embodiments during the commissioning process one or more memories may have been updated to reflect the commissioning status of the device or unit in question. Determining whether the device or unit in question is commissioned may therefore involve accessing the one or more memories. In some embodiments a device or unit itself may store information regarding its commissioning status. In such embodiments determining whether or not a device or unit is commissioned may involve the device itself or computer code executing outside of the device accessing the device s stored commissioning status or information reflective of its commissioning status.

If it is determined that the device is commissioned then control transfers to step . Otherwise control transfers to step . Both steps involve determining whether or not the device or unit in question has network connectivity. In some embodiments this can be carried out by a device or unit performing a test to determine if connectivity exists. In other embodiments this may be determined for example by computer code associated with a system module such as environment manager module or gateway module of system A performing the necessary test s .

If it is determined in step that the commissioned unit has network connectivity then control transfers to step . Step involves retrieving and applying system power up configuration parameters for the commissioned unit. The parameters may be stored centrally on a server or other device accessible to the device or system module performing step or at the commissioned unit itself. If power up configuration parameters are stored in multiple places step may also involve determining which set of parameters take precedence. In some embodiments if the commissioned unit is a luminaire a default behavior at power up may be produced. For example within 0.3 seconds the luminaire or lighting unit or light source in question may produce a light level equal to the light level the luminaire or lighting unit or light source is configured to produce shortly before power down.

If it is determined in step that the commissioned unit does not have network connectivity then control transfers to step . In step locally available system power up configuration parameters are applied for the commissioned unit. For example there may be a set of power up configurations stored at the commissioned unit itself which are accessible to the commissioned unit without the need for network connectivity.

If it is determined in step that the non commissioned unit has network connectivity then control transfers to step . In step default power up configuration parameters are applied if no overriding power up configuration is available via the network. Default power up configuration parameters may reside on the network outside of the non commissioned unit or on the unit itself. For example if the non commissioned unit is a luminaire or lighting unit or light source the default power up configuration may require a light level at 100 of the luminaire s capability to be produced within 0.3 seconds of power up.

If it is determined in step that the non commissioned unit does not have network connectivity then control transfers to step . In step default power up configuration parameters stored locally on the non commissioned unit or otherwise available to the non commissioned unit without network connectivity may be applied to the non commissioned unit.

According to some embodiments involving non commissioned luminaires that are installed and powered but not connected to an IP network the following behavior may be realized. Each luminaire or lighting unit or light source may go to producing light at 100 of its capability within 0.3 seconds from the moment of powering on and each such luminaire may ignore any control commands from control devices that instruct otherwise. In some embodiments if the non commissioned luminaires are installed powered and connected to an a communication control line of an IP network all luminaires of the IP sub network may go to producing light at 100 of their capabilities within 0.3 seconds from the moment of powering of the sub system. These luminaires may ignore sensor information e.g. occupancy and daylight sensor information but react to manual control e.g. from area IR controllers as well as to central control commands e.g. from the environment manager module commissioning module or gateway module of .

According to some embodiments involving commissioned luminaires or lighting units or light sources the following behavior may be produced at power up. To demonstrate functionality such units may go to producing a configured maximum light level within some time interval e.g. 2 seconds after the system has been powered on. In such embodiments if there is no presence detected in the area of the commissioned luminaires subsequent to the powering on the commissioned luminaires will switch off within another time interval e.g. 1 second following a determination that no presence was detected. In some other embodiments involving commissioned luminaires such luminaires may not produce any light after being powered up until occupancy in the area of the luminaires is detected for some configured period of time.

Different reaction times are related to users expectations when requesting an environmental change such as a change in lighting conditions. If a fade parameter associated with a commissioned unit or the user herself e.g. a user preference parameter indicating whether or not the user prefers a fade effect is disabled then the requested change in the environmental condition e.g. light level adjustment should be immediate. If fade is enabled then the requested change in environmental conditions may start within a time interval e.g. 0.3 seconds from the moment of the change request.

Another configure related to reaction times is fade time or the time interval during which a first environmental condition e.g. a present light level fades to a second environmental condition e.g. a new requested light level . In many embodiments Fade time is a value set between 0.5 and 90 seconds. Manual controllers that allow a user to control fade time may allow the user to increase or decrease the fade time with a particular granularity e.g. increases or decreases of fade time allowed in 1 second granularity . The fade and fade time features are comfort features designed to result in changes in environmental conditions that are smooth less jarring and therefore less noticeable and less distracting.

Step involves determining whether the requested control option is enabled. In many embodiments all available control options e.g. occupancy based control daylight based control manual personal and central control may be disabled enabled and or prioritized per commissioned unit. In the example being used for illustrative purposes step involves determining whether the manual control is enabled for the commissioned unit linked to the manual controller being used to request a change in lighting conditions.

If step results in a negative determination i.e. the control option is not enabled for the associated commissioned unit then control transfers to step and the received control request is ignored. If step results in a positive determination i.e. the control option is enabled for the associated commissioned unit then control transfers to step .

Step involves determining whether or not there is a competing control request of higher priority that should override the received control request. If step results in a negative determination i.e. no competing control request of a higher priority is found then control transfers to step and the requested control is performed. Otherwise if step results in a positive determination i.e. a competing control request of a higher priority is found then control transfers to step and the received control request is ignored. For example an automatic request arising out of daylight based monitoring of space surrounding the commissioned unit may indicate a request to adjust the luminaires or lighting units or light sources associated with the commissioned unit to provide a lower light level than that requested by the user s request arising out of his her use of a manual wall mounted control. In such a case if the commissioned unit has a higher priory for manual control as compared to daylight based control then the luminaires associated with the commissioned unit will adjust the illumination they provide to produce the manually requested level of illumination.

Manual control refers to the means available to a user for manually altering environmental conditions. During the commissioning process depicted in units may be commissioned to be manually controlled. The commissioning and configuration may include linking of user interfaces for manual control to commissioned units linking of user interface elements e.g. buttons sliding bars to presets e.g. scenes light levels . During commissioning manual control may be enabled or disabled for a unit being commissioned and or manual control may be assigned a priority level as compared to other types of controls. Commissioned units that have manual control enabled may also have other forms of control enabled e.g. daylight based and occupancy based controls .

Manual control enables a user to manually turn on or off commissioned units. For example an end user may enter an indoor space such as a room and using a wall mounted display or switch or a user interface on a hand held device turn on luminaires associated with one or more luminaires in the room. Such a manual request may result in the luminaires producing a pre configured level of light e.g. going to a switch on level of light . If prevailing environmental conditions such as the level of lighting in a space are not what a user desires he or she may manually adjust the lighting using a manual control by indicating that the lighting in the space be dimmed up or down. Such a manual request may result in luminaires in the space adjusting their light output by a pre configured percentage. Many embodiments may require that fixed manual controllers be placed in a visible location within the space it controls and that the manual controller shall not be able to control environmental conditions in a space where the user requesting the manual changes would not be able to physically sense e.g. see feel or hear the changes requested using the controller.

In some embodiments manual changes that are requested from a mobile controller e.g. a smartphone are required to be activated within a longer duration of time e.g. a scene change in a meeting room that is requested from an iPhone need only be activated within 3 seconds of the request as compared to manual changes requested from a fixed mobile controller e.g. a wall mounted controller . For example a scene change in a meeting room requested from a wall mounted control device may need to be activated within 0.3 seconds of the request in order to create a sense of instantaneous response to the request. This difference may be instituted in a system such as system A or B in order to satisfy users expectations that environmental changes initiated in a space using manual wall mounted controls be instantaneous.

In many embodiments commissioned units may store multiple presets that may be manually requested. In other embodiments these presets may additionally or alternatively be stored at one or more remotely located memories. For example one preset may be a lighting scene which causes multiple commissioned units to each produce a preset level of light. Such a preset may result in a lighting effect in a space such as dim lights in various parts of the room and bright lights in others. In some embodiments a preset light level may be configured by specifying absolute light levels or relative light levels e.g. 5 dimmer than the switch on light level or by an algorithm that takes into consideration a variable parameter such as the amount of natural light available.

In various embodiments a user may be able to undo a manually selected environmental condition and cause the conditions to revert back to a previous or default setting. For example a user may use a manual controller to de select or cancel a previously requested light level or lighting scene. This feature enables the user to switch off a personal lighting or other environmental condition at any time. One or more commissioned units participating in providing the requested light level or scene may then return to a previous configuration or a default state.

In many embodiments the configuration of a manual retention time parameter allows for the resetting of environmental conditions to be in compliance with manually requested conditions even after commissioned units previously applying the conditions have stopped complying with the manually requested conditions. The need for this parameter may occur in various circumstances. For example in some situations a user may enter a previously unoccupied room where lighting conditions were being automatically adjusted based on the presence of natural light. The user may thereafter utilize a manual controller to request that commissioned units in the space produce a particular level of light in the space regardless of the amount of natural light present thereby effectively overriding the automatic daylight based control of the space. Under such circumstances when the user leaves the room automatic daylight based control of the room may resume or the lighting in the room may transition to a switched off state after an appropriate amount of time has elapsed. In embodiments where a manual retention time is being applied the commissioned units in the room may return to providing the light levels manually requested by the user if the user is detected to have re entered the same space within the manual retention time period. In many embodiments the manual retention time period begins elapsing immediately following the time when the commissioned units in question transition to providing environmental conditions that differ from the user s manually requested conditions. In many embodiments the manual retention time may be automatically set at 15 minutes.

Dimming step is a configurable parameter that is associated with user based light control. Each commissioned unit may have an associated dimming step parameter and manual and personal controllers may also have associated dimming step parameters. In many embodiments this parameter is expressed as a percentage and may range from 5 to 30 .

A user may choose to set the dimming step at 10 for a commissioned unit. In such a case when the commissioned unit is dimmed once e.g. by one step the light output of the commissioned unit is reduced by 10 of its previous output. In some embodiments the dimming step is set to 5 by default. Many embodiments may also permit the user to alter the dimming step but by only a particular level of granularity e.g. 5 . This parameter may be used as a mechanism to control the speed with which a user may manually dim lighting in a space.

Person control refers to the means available to a user for controlling the environmental conditions in their personal space or work zone. Devices providing personal control may be linked to one or more commissioned units during the commissioning process of . Personal control devices may be stationary e.g. wall mounted devices or be mobile e.g. smart phones or other hand held devices . In many embodiments a personal control device that is stationary may only be linked to commissioned units that are located within a limited radius of the personal control device. Mobile personal control devices may be linked to multiple commissioned units that are more geographically dispersed throughout a space. In some embodiments when a user uses a personal control device to control environmental conditions such as lighting in their work zone the personal control request may affect the behavior of only the commissioned units that are both linked to the personal control device and present in a work zone associated with the user s present location. A personal control request to alter environmental conditions in a user s work zone may arise automatically e.g. from occupancy based control methods or manually e.g. from a user using a manual or personal control device to request a change in environmental conditions . Daylight based and occupancy based control of environmental conditions may affect and or be affected by the personal control of commissioned units that are also configured to able to respond to personal control requests for environmental changes.

For example if a user wishes to increase the light level in a work zone to a particular level but the ongoing daylight based control of the lighting in the work zone does not permit increasing the light level in the work zone to the particular level the light level in the work zone may only be permitted to increase to a different lower level. In many embodiments whether or not a user is able to use a personal controller to control lighting in his her work zone depends on whether or not the user has permissions to affect environmental conditions in the work zone. Permissions for authorizing users to control conditions in their work zones may be stored at commissioned units and or more centrally at one or more memories accessible for example to system modules such as environment manager module or gateway module of system A.

Commissioned units may be configured to behave in particular ways in response to personal control requests. For example all luminaires or lighting units or light sources associated with a commissioned unit may be configured to provide 500 lux on a reference surface when a personal control device is used to request a particular scene for a particular work zone. There may also be one or more personal control modes associated with commissioned units and or personal control devices. For example a limited set point mode may prevent a user from dimming beyond a maximum calibrated light set point. An unlimited set point mode may not impose such restrictions.

Commissioned units that typically adjust behavior based on control requests may be commissioned to enable or disable personal control requests. Such units may also assign a priority level to personal control requests. Additionally and or alternatively personal control devices themselves or users using the devices to create personal control requests may assign priority levels to personal control requests.

Personal control devices such as smart phones running personal control applications may be used by users to graphically view the zones and or commissioned units that are under the control of the device. In some embodiments any response to such requests may be required to be made within a configured amount of time e.g. 3 seconds . Failure to respond within the allotted time may result in an error being reported by the personal control device itself to one or more modules of the system e.g. environment manager module or gateway module of system A . Alternatively in various embodiments if a response to a user request made via a personal controller takes longer than a configured amount of time then the user may be given feedback on the progress of the request e.g. a progress bar or other visual or auditory notification .

Using personal controls users may select preconfigured scenes for their work zones. For example a user may select a standard scene where all lighting units associated with a commissioned unit providing light for the user s work zone switch to a particular light level. A user may also use personal controls to control the dim level of luminaires or lighting units or light sources associated with commissioned units. Commissioned units may be configured to provide illumination within a determined range e.g. between a minimum light output and maximum light output and a user s ability to control the dim level of such units may be confined to controlling output within such a range.

In some embodiments manually made environmental change requests may result in changes in environmental conditions which are thereafter controlled automatically. For example if a manually made personal request results in providing a fixed level of light in a space automatic controls may regain control of the space after certain events occur e.g. the space is determined to be vacant . In some embodiments the manually made change in conditions may be thereafter managed by automatic controls even without requiring that a particular event occur prior to transfer of control to the automatic means.

In step a determination is made on whether the user issuing the request is authorized to make the requested changes in environmental conditions. In some embodiments this determination is made by one or more system modules such as environment manager module or gateway module of system A. The determination may be based on the user s location and or identification e.g. user ID and password information. In embodiments that use a user s login information e.g. user ID and password to verify authorization the user may have to provide his her credentials only once unless he she has been logged out since the last time the user s credentials were verified. If the user is not authorized to alter environmental conditions in accordance with the request control transfers to step in which the personal control request is ignored. In the user is not authorized to alter environmental conditions in accordance with his her request he she may be notified of this fact. If user authorization is additionally or alternatively dependent on the user s location the location information may be cached for a configurable period of time thereby avoiding the need to update the same user s location every time he she requests a change in environmental conditions.

If the user is authorized to make the requested environmental changes one or more commissioned units may be instructed to adjust environmental conditions in accordance with the personal control request in step . For example luminaires or lighting units or light sources associated with one or more commissioned units controlling lighting conditions in the user s work zone may transition to producing a requested level of light in the user s work zone e.g. reference surface in accordance with a configured fade time. In many embodiments control then transfers to step in which the control of environmental conditions reverts back to automatic controls. For example the light output produced by the one or more commissioned units associated with the user s work zone may thereafter revert to being controlled in accordance with previously used daylight based and or occupancy based algorithms.

In many embodiments personal controllers may allow authorized users to select or otherwise specify the geographic scope of their personal control. If the user making this scope selection is using his her own personal controller device e.g. a smartphone information identifying the user may be linked to the scope selection and or other profile settings of the user automatically without requiring further input from the user. If on the other hand the user making the scope selection is using a publicly accessible personal controller device e.g. a controller affixed to a wall in a space accessible to multiple users the user may have to identify him herself in order to link his her scope selection to his her identity within the system for managing environmental condition. Once a user successfully selects or specifies a geographic scope of personal control environmental control requests affecting an area within the same geographic area but received from users outside the geographic area may be ignored.

Many embodiments enable a user to recall light settings or other environmental conditions previously requested. These settings or conditions may have been previously requested by the same user requesting the recall or by other users of the same space. Commissioned units may store previously requested settings themselves and or settings may be stored more centrally in one or more memories accessible to for example system modules such as environment manager module gateway module and or commissioning module of the system A. Previously requested environmental conditions may be associated with particular users zones and or commissioned units.

Central control refers to the means available to a user for preforming scheduled or real time adjustments to system parameters that may affect environmental conditions within a space in a more global or pervasive way. Central control also refers to the control of environmental conditions using a user interface executed by a system module such as the environment manager module or gateway module of system A. Central control may be manual e.g. a user manually adjusting light settings using a displayed user interface or automatic e.g. adjustments to environmental conditions occurring as a result of system reactions to detected events . In many embodiments to centrally control one or more commissioned units within an area the commissioned units need to be communicatively connected to a central dashboard. The central dashboard comprises computer code executing one or more user interfaces that allow authorized users to control various commissioned units groups of commissioned units and or entire zones within a physical structure. In many embodiments the central dashboard may also be communicatively connected to and or executed by one or more modules central to the operation of the systems for managing environmental changes described herein. For example in many embodiments the central dashboard is executed by or in conjunction with the environment manager module or gateway module of system A. In various embodiments the central dashboard may be used to re commission and or re configure commissioned units. In some of these embodiments the user interface s of the central dashboard may display the reconfigurable parameters along with their present values or statuses and prevent the user of the central dashboard from configuring parameters that are not re configurable or setting parameters of commissioned units to values that are outside of permitted ranges.

A user may utilize a centralized utility such as the central dashboard to alter settings of commissioned units in order to affect environmental conditions in real time or in a scheduled manner. Real time requests are processed such that resulting changes in environmental conditions are made within a configurable amount of time following the request. The central dashboard may also be used by appropriately authorized users e.g. a facility manager to alter parameters that affect overall system behavior such as the configurable amount of time within which real time requests need to be serviced.

The central dashboard may be used to create edit and schedule tasks embodying changes in environmental conditions. Tasks may be scheduled to be triggered at specific times e.g. at specific time intervals at a time relative to an event or at an absolute time or upon the occurrence of a specific event. A task may specify changes that are more global in nature by for example resetting a parameter that affects multiple areas or commissioned units e.g. changing a fade time hold time enabling or disabling a type of control . A task may also specify changes that are more local in nature by for example reducing the light output of a commissioned unit that only affects a particular work zone. During the commissioning process an authorized user such as a facility manager may create and schedule default tasks. For example a night task may be triggered to be executed after work hours and may change hold times and default light levels in order to conserve energy.

A scheduled task may comprise a series of tasks that are themselves scheduled to be performed at certain times upon the occurrence of certain events and or in compliance with certain logic. Users may select existing schedules for application. The same schedules may be repeatedly applied. Accordingly the central dashboard may provide user interface means for selecting one or more schedules for application specifying the scope of schedules e.g. the commissioned units or zones on which the selected schedules will be active what events will trigger schedules e.g. time of day environmental condition user activity and or the frequency with which the schedules are to be applied e.g. one time only a few times a day whenever a triggering event occurs .

Schedules may also be activated immediately. In such cases tasks in the schedule in question may take effect within a predetermined amount of time e.g. within 5 seconds . Examples of tasks include changing the light output for a luminaire or commissioned unit e.g. dimming up down from a current light level going to a particular dim level recalling light scenes switching off on reconfiguration of control parameters e.g. enable disable a control option change a sensor hold time change a fade time changing the temperature in an area running an emergency lighting test and performing auto calibration of selected sensors. In many embodiments scheduled tasks may also involve database related tasks such as rolling data from commissioned units e.g. diagnostics logging energy consumption data sending reports or notifications to different system modules and backing up specific data or categories of data.

In many embodiments only one schedule may be active with respect to the same commissioned unit at any given time. Transitioning between settings of two consecutive tasks in a schedule may involve a fading transition within a fade time. Accordingly creating and or selecting schedules may involve specifying or selecting parameters such as a fade time and or enabling or disabling a fade transition between tasks in a schedule.

The central dashboard or a user interface associated with the commissioning module may allow an authorized user such as a facility manager to create and configure alarms. An alarm may be any means by which one or more modules controllers or devices associated with the system for managing environmental conditions within a structure is notified of system statuses that are abnormal or may otherwise require action. An alarm may be associated with various configurable parameters. These parameters may be manually set or altered by an authorized user or automatically updated during system operation. An alarm may have an associated type e.g. an error or a warning . An alarm may indicate its source or the event or condition that generated the alarm. Examples may include a change in a system status a particular system status or a scheduled or unscheduled event occurring. An alarm may also have an associated destination e.g. a user account that must be notified about the alarm a scope e.g. commissioned units the alarm potentially affects a format e.g. SMS e mail audio visual tactical a trigger e.g. a schedule or task that the alarm invokes and a trigger condition that causes the alarm to be invoked e.g. time system status change in system status or a scheduled activity . Alarms may also cause particular data to be displayed on the central dashboard in order to visually present alarm data to responsible personnel. Examples include the location of the commissioned unit device or environmental condition causing the alarm an indication of the severity of the alarm and an indication of the status of the alarm e.g. whether or not it is being handled .

In some embodiments an authorized user may use the central dashboard to issue an overriding central control command or otherwise configure the system for exclusive central environmental control such that all other automatic or user generated environmental control requests are blocked or ignored until the particular overriding central command or other event completes or is manually ended. Such a central control override may be used during emergencies such as during a building fire or a breach of security.

Central control may also take into account manually requested environmental conditions that are in effect in various areas. For example although the central dashboard may allow a facility manager to easily alter lighting conditions in a large open plan office area the facility manager may wish to skip over areas that are under personal control of other users. In some embodiments this is accomplished by using information about the different lighting conditions in various parts available in real time to system modules such as the environment manager module or gateway module .

In many embodiments a centrally issued environmental control request that comes before or after a personal or manual control request may not affect the system s response to the personal or manual control request. For example a central control request to switch a commissioned unit to a lower light level may result in the commissioned unit producing the lower light level. However a personal or other manual control request may thereafter successfully switch the commissioned unit to produce a higher light level.

In many embodiments a central control request may be issued to take effect in a space and prevent other control requests from taking effect in that space until it is manually deactivated. To prevent a situation where a facility manager may inadvertently fail to deactivate such an overriding central control automatic controls may override such central controls under some limited circumstances such as when the system recognizes that the space is vacant. Under such circumstances occupancy based control may replace the central control of the space and environmental changes in accordance with the occupancy based control may take effect.

In many embodiments the central dashboard allows an appropriately authorized user e.g. a facility manager to cause the system to switch to a predefined load shedding mode. Such modes may be designed to save power by automatically causing various system wide parameters to be altered as well as causing various commissioned units to react in particular ways. For example all personal controls may be disabled all luminaires or lighting units or light sources in selected areas may be dimmed or switched off and all hold times and grace periods for automatically triggered controls such as occupancy based controls may be shortened.

The environmental control systems described herein provide a variety of different graphical user interfaces GUIs for facilitating interaction with users. Exemplary embodiments of three categories of such GUIs are described below. In additional a customization graphical user interface customization GUI is provided that allows a user to create customized GUIs. A user may use the customization GUI to create GUIs for use in particular tasks e.g. dimming luminaires associated with commissioned units in different rooms or in particular areas the user frequents e.g. a GUI that displays monitoring information for commissioned units in three rooms that the user is interested in . The customization GUI may also be used to create different views based upon the user s role e.g. a user with a role that requires monitoring power consumption may be provided a set of graphical views of a room where the power consumption information is highlighted or otherwise accessible with fewer clicks or interactions from the user. Based on the user s role and or preconfigured profile of preferences the customization GUI may suggest various custom views e.g. overhead view of the user s cell office and surrounding area comprising various details e.g. temperature and humidity conditions in the cell office . While preparing one or more custom GUIs using the customization GUI the user may choose to add or remove various details in order to achieve a custom GUI representative of the user s own preferences.

System modules may also allow a user to customize the GUI of the Central Dashboard Home Page according to the user s needs. For example it may be possible for a user to create different views based on his her role e.g. end user of office space or facility manager . A facility manager may be presented with maintenance data as well as energy consumption data while an end user may only be presented with energy consumption data and data on current environmental conditions e.g. temperature light levels but not maintenance data.

The Dashboard GUI may also present e.g. on the floor plan itself or on a side panel operational statuses of various commissioned units e.g. if an unresolved error has been reported for a unit if a unit is turned on or off . In many embodiments data regarding devices such as their functions or status data is presented to the user within 0.5 seconds of being requested by the user e.g. by placing the cursor over the device on the floor plan . The devices may also be visually highlighted on the floor plan. The Dashboard GUI may also visually depict different categories of devices or commissioned units on the floor plan differently. For example different icons may be used to visually depict lighting devices HVAC devices sensors and control devices. The choice of icons may be customizable to the user s preferences. Different information may be presented for a commissioned unit depending on its category. For commissioned units used for lighting the information may comprise the current light level and energy usage and whether or not occupancy based or daylight based control is enabled. For sensors the measurement of the last sensed data or an average of measurements over a particular recent time period may be presented.

The Central Dashboard GUI may also provide the user the ability to change parameters for commissioned devices. When the user selects a commissioned device its parameters may be displayed and the editable parameters based on the user s permissions and or role may be visually displayed as being editable. Parameters that the user is not allowed to edit may be visually presented as being non editable e.g. greyed out . The acceptable range of a parameter may also be indicated and parameter values outside of the range may not be accepted by the central dashboard GUI. Help tips may also be available through the central dashboard GUI. For example help tips may be presented as an overlay when the user s cursor hovers on a commissioned unit. Some embodiments of the central dashboard GUI may be available in languages other than English. The Central Dashboard GUI may also provide graphical means for a user to manage schedules. An authorized user may use the Dashboard GUI to create edit delete prioritize and otherwise manage schedules.

The central dashboard GUI may also provide graphical means to centrally control operational settings of commissioned units throughout the system. For example users may control light settings for a group of selected commissioned units or individual commissioned units in real time e.g. by using graphical means to select multiple commissioned units and or individual luminaires and select new light levels or dim light output by one or more steps . The new operational states e.g. new illumination levels may thereafter be visually reflected on the central dashboard as feedback to the user that the changes have taken place.

System modules or commissioned units themselves may also conduct analysis of available monitoring data to provide system modules such as the environment manager module of system A recommendations on parameter settings that lead to optimal system performance e.g. energy efficient performance . These recommendations may be presented to the user at the time he she is presented with user interface means for adjusting operational parameters for commissioned units. Real time analysis of estimated energy usage and energy savings may be conducted and presented to the user along with cost estimates to help the user determine optimal parameter settings.

The Central Dashboard GUI may also comprise a Monitoring Dashboard GUI that displays data collected by various components of the system e.g. environment manager module gateway module IP luminaire or area controller . The data collected referred to herein generally as monitoring data may be data reflecting for example space usage occupancy presence energy consumption temperature humidity carbon dioxide levels usage of automatic controls and manual controls and detected operational errors. Energy consumption data may be captured as actual energy measurements or notional energy measurements. Energy consumption may be measured in KWh. Each collected data sample may be associated with a time stamp and a device identification or physical location. Presence may be recorded as a yes no per commissioned unit s or areas in question and occupancy may be recorded as a percentage of the time the commissioned unit s or areas in question are occupied. Occupancy status may be concluded based on multiple sensors associated with a commissioned unit. The generation of maintenance and diagnostic messages or reports may also be monitored and recorded. For example alarms or alerts generated by commissioned units in the form of messages reporting operational errors or warnings may be monitored to predict potential future malfunctions.

The monitoring data may be presented in graphical form and may be analyzed using any combination of standard and proprietary analytical methods. In many embodiments the monitoring data may allow users such as facility managers to gain valuable insights into trends in the data make comparisons with previously gathered data e.g. historical data and to implement strategies such as energy consumption strategies based on the data.

Commissioned devices being monitored may store monitored data on the device itself or the data may be stored in one or more memories e.g. a database accessible to system modules such as the environment manager module commissioning module or gateway module of system A. Monitoring data may be logged at specified configurable time intervals. Additionally the occurrence of events e.g. detection of occupancy may cause monitoring to stop or resume. When monitoring occurs can be expressed by one or more configurable parameters on a system wide basis e.g. by the setting of system wide parameters or rules affecting multiple areas and commissioned units or on a device by device basis.

The Monitoring Dashboard may allow an authorized user to select the information to be monitored the spatial and temporal granularity with which the monitored data should be collected the space s that should be monitored analytical tools that should be applied to the data and or the visual presentation of the raw or analyzed data. Some users e.g. facility managers may have the authorization to select new areas for monitoring or to stop gathering data in other areas. Other users e.g. office users may be able to specify what types of monitoring data they view on the Monitoring Dashboard or whether or not they view raw or analyzed monitoring data but may not be able to affect the collection of the monitoring data itself.

Users may select areas e.g. the campus the building particular floors rooms or work areas or particular commissioned units or types of commissioned units for monitoring from an interactive floor map. Users may also specify or select how much monitoring data they would like to access e.g. a whole year 6 months 1 month 1 week 1 day and how recent the data should be e.g. in the past month week day hour . Depending on the type of monitoring data the temporal granularity of the available data may vary.

The user may also be able to configure the presentation of the monitoring data. For example the Monitoring Dashboard may allow users to select the type of graph s used to present raw or analyzed data e.g. heat maps or choose other details affecting visual presentation. For example a user may configure their own monitoring view to use a particular color code to indicate occupancy status e.g. red for areas that are occupied more than 90 of the time during working hours green for areas occupied less than 20 of the time during working hours . The user may also be able to generate reports based on collected monitoring data. Reports may be customizable and exportable in many formats such as pdf doc xls and XML.

As user comfort is very important to the systems herein for managing environmental conditions within a structure the monitored data includes key indicators of this metric. For example the number of manual or personal overrides of prevailing environmental conditions associated with commissioned units or areas may be tracked over time. This includes manual changes in light levels and manual changes in temperature humidity and air flow. These changes may be analyzed in the aggregate to reveal trends when all manual or personal overrides are considered over a period of time. Based on logged temperature data over a period of time heat maps for commissioned units may be created and overheated commissioned units and under heated commissioned units may be identified. Because temperatures in one zone may affect the temperature in adjacent zones some zones may be over or under heated based on the temperature in adjacent zones. Analysis of logged temperature data may reveal such trends. Mathematical models may then be used to suggest changes in temperature and air flow parameters for commissioned units in order to counteract any identified negative trends.

All monitoring data that relates to maintaining the system in working condition may be presented on one or more related user interfaces. In many embodiments these UIs presented as one or more windows panels or linked websites present data such as diagnostic messages alarms warnings and other events associated with commissioned units emergency lighting activations reports and notifications on device failures and planned and completed device replacements. Unlike an alarm which signifies that a device may not be operating as intended a warning signifies that the system may be running near or outside its operating bounds e.g. signifying a device nearing end of life overvoltage or overcurrent circumstances . Different visual characteristics e.g. different icons and colors may be used to visually indicate different categories of device malfunction such as communication failure and lack of power.

In some embodiments when a faulty device or commissioned unit is replaced a user with appropriate maintenance credentials may use the Central Dashboard to re commission the device in accordance with the method depicted in . The replaced device may be discovered by the system and its location marked on the floor plan. Commissioning data about the device involved may be shared between system modules such as commissioning module and environment manager module in order to effectively re commission a device after replacement. The process of binding a replaced device to sensors may be begun for example by an authorized user simply dragging and dropping an icon representing the discovered device onto icons representing one or more sensors on the digital floor plan displayed by the Central Dashboard.

System modules such as environment manager module may perform system wide or localized self checks. The self checks may be initiated automatically at regular intervals or manually by an authorized user. Reports and diagnostic messages may be generated by system modules or commissioned units on the health of various commissioned units or system modules and presented on the Central Dashboard. For manually requested self checks the system may provide feedback to the user on the progress of the self check. Additionally system modules may log and make available TCP IP network messages related to various commissioned units.

The Central Dashboard may also comprise a User Management GUI that allows an authorized user to create edit and delete user accounts for users of the system. The user accounts may be accounts for users of the structure in question e.g. office workers as well as accounts for use by administrators with permissions to configure user accounts. Each user and administrator account may have an associated user ID and password for authentication purposes. In some embodiments administrator accounts are able to configure for example what types of data is monitored which users are able to view the monitored data and at what granularity which system parameters are configurable and which users are able to alter the values of such parameters which users receive system notifications and which commissioned units are used for various system level tasks e.g. gathering monitoring data .

Aside from providing means for manually creating new user and administrative accounts the User Management GUI may also facilitate the creation of user accounts by importing previously existing user accounts from existing user account infrastructures e.g. LDAP RADIUS active server . In some embodiments user accounts may have an assigned role e.g. the role of a maintenance engineer . All users assigned to a certain role may have the same level of access to information and the same level of control over various aspects of the system. For example all users assigned the role of maintenance engineer may be allowed to view at a certain level of detail or granularity monitored usage information e.g. illumination levels in various locations of the building pertinent to maintaining the system s functionality. Accordingly a role may act as a template with certain permissions being enabled and others being disabled. Assigning roles to user accounts is consequently an efficient way to restrict users from accessing potentially sensitive information about other users activities within the structure in question while still allowing users to access to the appropriate types of information for performing functions related to their assigned roles.

The User Management GUI may also allow for the creation and management of customer accounts where administrative and user accounts are each associated with a customer account. The system may support multiple customer accounts such that administrator accounts for each customer account may be authorized to edit user accounts associated only with its own customer account. Such an arrangement allows for the management of environmental conditions in the same physical space by separate entities. For example the same office building may be occupied by one entity from Monday through Wednesdays and another entity on Thursdays and Fridays. Each entity may have a different customer account with user accounts associated with its own employees.

System modules e.g. environment manager module or gateway module may in various embodiments allow software upgrades of commissioned units. During various stages of the software upgrade process devices undergoing the upgrade may not be operational. Software upgrades may be conducted on a scheduled basis they may be started remotely using user interfaces such as the Central Dashboard or on site by a qualified user e.g. field support engineer using system tools such as the Commissioning tool. They may be conducted for select devices or on a class of devices and the Central Dashboard may reflect on going scheduled and completed software upgrades for commissioned devices in the system.

During a software upgrade the behavior of devices such as lighting devices may be different from their configured behavior prior to the upgrade. For example commissioned lighting units involved in a software upgrade and subsequent reboot may provide a particular level of illumination e.g. at a background level of illumination and ignore any lighting control requests that are received. System modules involved in preparing and or forwarding automatically or manually generated environment control commands e.g. environment manager module or gateway module to commissioned units may stop forwarding the commands to commissioned units that are presently undergoing a software upgrade. After a software upgrade has been completed the upgraded device may in some embodiments return to its behavior just prior to the upgrade. In many embodiments a software upgrade of a device does not overwrite or delete configuration parameters that were set prior to the upgrade.

In many embodiments to protect against security breaches only approved versions and types of firmware and computer code will be accepted by devices for upgrade purposes and only authorized users will be able initiate software upgrades. The transmittance of upgrade related data files may only be permitted through secure communication channels.

In some embodiments the commissioning tool provides an interactive floor map depicting the actual physical placement of devices such as sensors PoE switches luminaires area controllers and gateway modules. During hot plugging and hot un plugging of such devices e.g. placement and removal of devices while the overall system is powered and operational the floor map may reflect in real time the removal and addition of devices.

In some embodiments re commissioning and re configuring of a previously commissioned unit such as a luminaire or sensor after it is replaced may be automatic. A report with details regarding the replacement commissioned unit the replaced unit and or any errors or warnings resulting from the re commissioning and or re configuring process may thereafter be created and forwarded to the Central Dashboard. The report may comprise the device and location where the exchange took place. In many embodiments a replaced luminaire may resume its behavior as part of a commissioned unit within 5 seconds from the moment of connecting to power and communication lines.

Sensors like other commissioned units are also upgradeable and replaceable while the system is operational. For example one or more carbon dioxide humidity and temperature sensors may be added even after the system has been commissioned and is operational. In many embodiments system modules such as the environment manager module or the gateway module may recognize a replacement sensor s capabilities and automatically commission the sensor by linking it to an appropriate commissioned unit. Additionally the replacement sensor s capabilities may be reported to the Central Dashboard.

In many embodiments when a lighting system controller or actuator device is replaced sensor luminaire control UI area controller an authorized system user e.g. commissioning engineer may need to commission and configure the device to enable proper functioning. In many cases this may be achieved using the commissioning tool. In some instances when a commissioned unit is replaced a system module such as the environment manager module or gateway module may discover the device on the network and present the device for commissioning on the commissioning tool.

Localizing a replaced device may be performed automatically or semi automatically where an authorized user e.g. commissioning engineer is asked for confirmation of a successful localization. In case a single device is replaced in the system the commissioning module may automatically re configure the device with the configuration details of the malfunctioning one it replaced. An authorized user may also be able to request the latest version of the configuration data associated with the replaced device using for example the Central Dashboard.

An authorized user may use the Central Dashboard to manually re commission commissioned units and to re configure parameters of selected commissioned units. For example a user may select devices for adding to a commissioned unit or split a commissioned unit into sub units and specify various parameters used to control the behavior of the new commissioned unit s .

In situations where there is a power outage or an un switched mains line is switched off the system may activate a system wide emergency mode. During the emergency mode commissioned units may not react to any daylight based or occupancy based controls or to any control requests from individual users. In various embodiments emergency luminaires or lighting units dispersed throughout the structure may be activated to produce sufficient light for purposes such as building evacuation. Such emergency luminaires may each have one or more indicator LEDs with various light states indicating related system states. For example a permanent green light may indicate that the system is functioning as required a blinking green light may indicate that the system is performing a function or duration test and a blinking red light with a four blink period may indicate battery failure.

In some embodiments luminaires of different light effect e.g. temperature and color may be used and the system may support lighting devices with the following specifications Ra greater than 80 Uniformity for Task Lighting greater than 0.7 Uniformity for Background Lighting greater than 0.4 UGR Unified Glare Rating of 19 for office spaces and 28 for circulation areas and CCT of 4000K.

In situations where there is no network connectivity available system wide the system may behave in a predetermined way until network connectivity has been reestablished. For example occupancy based controls may be available in a limited capacity to provide a minimum level of illumination in areas where occupancy is detected and daylight based control and personal controls may be unavailable. In situations where an individual luminaire or lighting unit detects that it is no longer connected to the network it may also behave in a prescribed way. For example it may continue to provide the same level of illumination as before the network failure was detected and if it is switched off it may switch to providing a minimum level of illumination if occupancy is subsequently detected in its vicinity. Such behavior ensures that even in the event of network failure a minimum level of illumination will be present in areas that are occupied.

If the defect is not fixed then control proceeds to step and the commissioned unit reports the error to another system module e.g. environment manager module commissioning module or gateway module . The error report may have an urgency level associated with it which may be set by the commissioned unit itself. The urgency level may influence how and when the module notified responds to the error. When reporting the error the commissioned unit may also transmit information identifying itself to the module s it reports the error to. In response to the error report one of the modules receiving the error report may respond by sending self recovery instructions to the commissioned unit. The self recovery instructions may be for example computer code or information identifying the location in one or more memories of computer code or instructions for self recovery. In some embodiments a system module such as the environment manager module may send a known bug fix in the form of computer code executable by the commissioned unit if the reported error relates to a known bug associated with the commissioned unit. In step the commissioned unit checks to determine if self recovery instructions were received. If no instructions were received control remains in step and the commissioned unit awaits receipt of such instructions or other action by an authorized system user such as a hardware replacement. If self recovery instructions are received then control transfers back to step in which the commissioned unit attempts self recovery using the newly received instructions.
