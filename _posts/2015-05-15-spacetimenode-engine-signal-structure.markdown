The present disclosure relates generally to an in memory organization or architecture and more particularly to a space time node engine signal structure for use in or with an in memory organization or architecture.

Information is everywhere. A wide variety of information such as for example business information social information service information scientific information environmental information or the like is continually being generated accessed shared collected communicated stored or analyzed. Information databases or warehouses including for example relational multi dimensional transactional hierarchical or other like information repositories are becoming more common place as well as related communications networks or computing resources that provide access to various types of information.

Today a variety of information from a variety of sources may be used in some manner to analyze visualize forecast leverage etc. various social political geographical regulatory business or like segments to facilitate or support intelligent approaches for business decision making performance management market research situational awareness or the like. For example information may be used by project or performance management applications to deliver tailored approaches helping to gain a competitive advantage by improving work flow or operating procedures acquiring business insights assessing risks or opportunities creating or maintaining regulatory compliance infrastructure or the like.

With an overabundance of diverse information being available or otherwise accessible information processing tools or techniques continue to evolve or improve. At times however processing or organizing information may prove to be a computationally complex time consuming or otherwise resource demanding task which may present a number of challenges such as increased processing time complexity cost or the like. Accordingly how to process or organize diverse information in an effective or efficient manner continues to be an area of development.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of claimed subject matter. However it will be understood by those skilled in the art that claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances methods apparatuses or systems that would be known by one of ordinary skill have not been described in detail so as not to obscure claimed subject matter.

Some example methods apparatuses or articles of manufacture are disclosed herein that may be implemented in whole or in part to facilitate or support one or more operations or techniques associated with a space time node engine signal structure. As described below a space time node engine signal structure may be implemented using one or more signal processing operations or techniques such as for example one or more space time node engine facilitated or supported signal processing operations or techniques. In this context a space time node engine may refer to a special purpose computing environment platform or construct capable of formulating or executing tailored approaches that may be based at least in part on processing signals as a function of spatially temporally or nodally dominant metrics or attributes associated with these signals. In some instances space time node engine facilitated or supported approaches may comprise for example hardware firmware or software implemented approaches or any combination thereof and signals may comprise for example multi source signals though claimed subject matter is not so limited.

As used herein multi source signals may refer to one or more digital signals including multi speed digital signals for example that may be sampled or otherwise acquired in real time or otherwise from a variety of information sources in a variety of formats. In this context real time may refer to an amount of timeliness of content or information which may have been delayed by an amount of time attributable to electronic communication as well as other information or signal processing. A format may refer to any suitable representation medium type form protocol or the like of any quantity value property phenomenon condition etc. associated with a signal and capable of being captured converted communicated conveyed or otherwise sampled in some manner in connection with one or more space time node engine facilitated or supported signal processing operations or techniques. Multi source signals may be representative of any type or category of information such as for example electric grid information smart meter information social media information environment information business intelligence BI information navigation or positioning information radio frequency identification RFID or credit card information resource planning or asset management information enterprise performance information traffic congestion or toll collection information or the like. As will be seen multi source signals may be sampled or acquired using any suitable communications framework that may employ one or more special purpose computing platforms software application programming interfaces API communication protocols subscriptions or feeds such as Open Database Connectivity ODBC interface Real Simple Syndication RSS or Atom Syndication Atom based subscription feeds or the like. Of course details relating to multi source signals are merely examples and claimed subject matter is not limited in this regard.

As described below multi source signals representative of various information of interest may be used in whole or in part to facilitate or support better decision making business related or otherwise to perform desired practice analyses assess regulatory exposure risks leverage or manage enterprise uncertainties improve supply demand economics develop dynamic pricing mechanisms or the like. To illustrate in the renewable energy sector utility companies independent system operators ISO regional transmission organizations RTO or the like may at times face deadlines to integrate mandated amounts of renewable energy such as wind or solar energy for example into an electricity transmission grid. Integration difficulties may include for example unpredictability or intermittency of renewable power such as changing wind or solar patterns balancing conventional and renewable energy sources or the like. This may for example produce supply demand shortfalls or lead to regulation reliability or market stability issues among others.

To address these or other potential issues information of interest such as for example environment or enterprise related information or the like may be gathered or acquired in some manner. In some instances it may be desirable to gather or acquire information from a variety of sources in a variety of formats for example so as to broaden or expand an assessment field analytical or business insights sector or domain applicability or the like as previously mentioned. Information of interest may be gathered or processed in a certain manner and may be used for example to provide location specific contextually intelligent or otherwise tailored approaches so as to reduce imbalances attributed to environmental intermittency increase predictability of renewable energy production enhance renewable energy reliability or the like. In addition in some instances it may be desirable to provide a timely analysis so as to facilitate or support for example preventive maintenance condition based or otherwise selecting suitable environmental sites for future wind or solar energy farms or the like. It should be noted however that claimed subject matter is not limited to these particular examples of course.

As was indicated sampling or processing multi speed signals originating from a variety of sources in a variety of formats may however present a number of challenges. In some instances challenges may include for example increased complexity or processing time computational or storage cost requisite processing power or the like. As a way of illustration locating or retrieving information to address multi dimensional or analytical queries having for example n dimensional attributes may typically although not necessarily involve performing a number of relatively complex or otherwise time consuming calculations. For example at times processing n dimensional query attributes may involve Boolean pruning by drilling rolling operators in connection with distance calculations for multi dimensional space. By way of example but not limitation a query may include How much revenue from greeting cards was generated last Christmas around the San Francisco Bay Area In this illustrated example greeting cards may represent one dimension e.g. node related or nodal etc. Christmas may represent another dimension e.g. time related or temporal etc. and San Francisco may represent yet another dimension e.g. location related or spatial etc. within a multi dimensional relationship characterized by the query. User preferences are typically although not necessarily dynamic meaning that user specified dimensions may not be known until a query time thereby pre computing or pre organizing information from potential user preferences may be an expensive task computationally or storage wise. Accordingly it may be desirable to develop one or more methods systems or apparatuses that may implement efficient or effective processing or organizing of information so as to at least partially anticipate user preferences for example which may facilitate or support faster information analysis retrieval reporting presentation etc. or any combination thereof. Of course description of various dimensions is merely an example and claimed subject matter is not so limited.

As illustrated at operation one or more signals representative of information of interest may be acquired or sampled from a variety of sources in a variety of formats using one or more signal acquisition devices schematically represented herein as Sensor Sensor Sensor and so forth up through an Nth Sensor as referenced generally at . As used herein the term sensor is to be interpreted broadly and may refer to any type of a device or system including a special purpose computing platform for example capable of measuring or registering a signal sample value quantity phenomenon condition state or like property that may be associated with a signal or signal acquisition point. In some instances a sensor may for example condition or convert an incoming or sampled signal into one or more digital numeric signal sample values for processing or manipulating in some manner by an associated computing platform. Also at times a sensor may be capable of communicating a measured or registered signal sample value quantity phenomenon condition state etc. to another sensor for further communicating processing conditioning converting or the like in a suitable or desired manner. By way of example but not limitation a sensor may comprise any signal acquisition point associated with for example an electricity transmission system or grid Global Positioning System GPS supervisory control and data acquisition SCADA system environmental system BI system asset or work order management system etc. as well as various instrumentations associated with structured or unstructured information such as electronic documents RSS or Atom feeds social media platforms or blogs customer or service systems smart cards or meters etc. or any combination thereof. It should be appreciated that a signal acquisition point may also include an embedded reference or hyperlink to images audio or video files or other documents. For example one type of reference that may be embedded in a document and used to identify or locate other documents may comprise a Uniform Resource Locator URL . As a way of illustration a signal acquisition point may sample or communicate a signal in connection with a status update an e mail an Extensible Markup Language XML document a web page a blog a media file a page pointed to by a URL just to name a few examples.

It should be appreciated that in certain implementations one or more signal acquisition devices may comprise for example post signal acquisition devices meaning that one or more continuous sampled signals if any may be momentized in some manner or broken into discrete or finite moments prior to acquisition using appropriate techniques. One or more signal acquisition devices may also feature a time keeping unit such as a GPS enabled atomic clock for example to facilitate or support suitable or desired event synchronization just to illustrate one possible implementation. For example event synchronization may help to identify when or where a sampled signal was created processed acquired etc. thus allowing for relatively accurate information acquisition in time space or node. In some instances such as in the absence of a synchronization capability between a source and a recipient for example a time or place of signal acquisition may be considered as the time or place of actual event to be analyzed forecasted leveraged reported or the like.

At operation one or more sampled signals may be processed in some manner by a signal pre processor for example to produce a suitable or desired signal input output form if desired. For example one or more sampled signals may be converted compressed time synchronized or the like so as to reduce or eliminate noise transmission errors distribution load etc. with respect to one or more signal acquisition channels or links associated with devices such as channels or links . It should be appreciated that even though one pre processor is illustrated herein any number of pre processors may be utilized to facilitate or support one or more processes at operation . It should also be noted that pre processor may be optional in certain example implementations.

With regard to operation sampled multi source signals may be collected or aggregated in some manner. As alluded to previously sampled signals may be communicated from a variety of sources in a variety of formats using any suitable or desired communication protocols such as for example HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS Inter Control Center Communications Protocol ICCP User Datagram Protocol UDP File Transfer Protocol FTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP etc. or any combination thereof. It should be noted that in certain implementations such as in implementations where a sequence or chronology of incoming information samples e.g. packets etc. if at all may be relatively important or otherwise useful the Internet Protocol Suite such as for example Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP or like multi layer protocol may be employed. Accordingly to account for particularities of signals originating from a variety of information sources in a variety of formats example process may include an aggregation or concentration point realized herein as a signal aggregator or concentrator for example. Signal aggregator may collect summarize normalize de normalize etc. incoming multi source signals to facilitate or support suitable or desired signal processing such as same or similar signal structure or format recognition for example or may perform other formatting or filtering operations depending at least in part on an application. Of course a description of signal aggregator is merely an example and claimed subject matter is not so limited.

Having aggregated multi source signals in a suitable or desired manner at operation a sampled signal may be partitioned in some manner so as to facilitate or support further processing such as for example processing based at least in part on a particular metric or attribute associated with a signal as will be seen. For example a sampled signal may be formatted in some manner to arrive at one or more information structures having one or more attributes. In some instances signal attributes may be stored at least in part as signal sample values in associated registers though claimed subject matter is not so limited. Signal attributes may be representative of one or more characteristics or aspects associated with a sampled signal such as for example spatial temporal nodal communication security or like characteristics or any combination thereof as will also be seen. In certain implementations a register may for example comprise an 8 bit wide register having signal sample values represented via a byte code indicative of how a particular information structure is to be processed or otherwise may be processed so as to be useful. Particular examples of various information structures associated attributes as well as sample register signal values will be described in greater detail below. Register signal values may be assigned to a sampled information structure formatted or otherwise using any suitable or desired techniques such as for example by utilizing a function or class type driver or adapter. An adapter may provide for example a suitable or desired interface between different levels or layers of an architecture or a part of an architecture associated with example process . In some instances an adapter may be primarily utilized in connection with a signal acquisition layer for example so as to facilitate or support a common format protocol or the like though claimed subject matter is not so limited. An adapter may be written or implemented in whole or in part by a vendor associated with a signal acquisition point such as one or more sensors for example or by a special purpose computing platform associated with a recipient of a sampled signal or any combination thereof as illustrated below. A vendor may comprise for example an individual person or entity e.g. a customer etc. that may be capable of participating in one or more operations associated with example process or may benefit directly or indirectly from such participation. In some instances a vendor may provide a suitable level of interoperability between one or more systems platforms device etc. associated with example process such as a source system a recipient system a target system etc. or any combination thereof.

An incoming or sampled signal may be partitioned using any suitable or desired signal decomposition process or technique. For example a sampled signal may be partitioned by a system of registers for packet decomposition based at least in part on one or more attributes associated with the signal. In one implementation system of registers may comprise a set of digital logic gates such as digital OR gates for example implementing a number of logical disjunction operations though claimed subject matter is not so limited. In some instances logical operations may be expressed by a truth function utilizing a valuation type true false logic or operator based at least in part on a binary representation of register signal values associated with incoming information structures. For example a sampled information structure comprising a certain register signal value e.g. 00001001 or 9 etc. which may be pre assigned or otherwise dynamically specified or characterized in some manner may indicate that the structure includes a payload information and a nodal attribute. Based at least in part on this register signal value a particular operator such as a 9 OR 8 true operator for example may be triggered or invoked to process an incoming structure accordingly such as by respective payload and nodal registers. Likewise if a sample register signal value corresponds to 2 it may be logically determined that an incoming signal may benefit from spatial type processing as another possible example. It should be noted that in certain implementations a relation instead of or in addition to an actual signal sample value e.g. binary real etc. may be used. For example a relation may be expressed as a literal like t t 1 min to indicate that a temporal stamp is to be increased by 1 minute thus allowing a system to parse an initialization file or read contents accordingly.

Sample register signal values may for example be assigned or specified in some manner such as by a suitable or desired adapter specifying classes or properties to be loaded to run e.g. programmatically execute etc. a particular process or operation. In certain implementations applicable classes or properties may be written into or otherwise dynamically specified or characterized in some manner in any suitable or desired configuration or initialization type file. By way of example but not limitation the way a particular signal may be processed in connection with a certain operation may be specified at least in part in a manifest file e.g. MANIFEST.MF etc. or INI type file e.g. .INI .CFG .conf .TXT etc. though claimed subject matter is not so limited. A particular example of a manifest file that may be utilized in connection with example process may include one illustrated in . Of course details relating to signal decomposition techniques register signal values or manifest classes or properties are merely examples and claimed subject matter is not limited in this regard. Also while illustrated in this example as being separate from sensors it should be appreciated that system of registers may be provided as part of a signal acquisition point or optionally or alternatively as part of a computing platform or environment associated with a recipient of a sampled signal such as a space time node engine for example.

At operation one or more training models may be built or applied for example so as create one or more trained signal datasets. Trained signal datasets may be advantageously utilized in connection with one or more signal processing layers or platforms such as analysis organization presentation etc. for example to facilitate or support more effective or efficient information indexing analyzing retrieving etc. or any combination thereof. As will be seen training approaches may include for example clustering based training correlation based training evolutionary or genetic algorithm or process based training just to name a few examples. In some instances training may employ one or more stochastic learning techniques such as regression clustering frequency or population distribution etc. using at least in part historical samples derivatives of historical samples degree of separation models or the like. In one particular implementation prior to or concurrently with training sampled information structures may be pseudo randomized in some manner such as via an application of a Brownian motion type process for example to obtain one or more statistically suitable sample sets of signal data or information points.

As will also be seen information points may for example be descriptive of one or more dominant attributes associated with sampled signals and may help to assess or learn relationships strengths of relationships or lack thereof across information structures of interest. In certain implementations one or more dominant attributes of sampled signals may for example be determined based at least in part on an application of a dominance principle. As used herein dominance principle may refer to a process or technique of determining a degree of cardinality with respect to one or more attributes of one or more information structures associated with one or more sampled signals. By way of example but not limitation one or more dominant attributes may comprise for example spatially temporally or nodally dominated value based metrics that may influence one or more characteristics of sampled signals and as such may affect signal processing organizing storing or the like. Particular examples of an application of a dominance principle will be described in greater detail below with reference to .

With respect to operation information structures representative of various sampled signals acquired or obtained from a variety of sources in a variety of formats may be organized in some manner so as to allow for example for more effective or efficient information accessing analyzing retrieving etc. or any combination thereof. For example information structures reflecting possible or potential preferences e.g. user preferences etc. in connection with providing analytics or addressing multi dimensional analytical queries among other approaches may be organized as a function of proximity or mutually relative distance in a linearized in memory array in at least one embodiment. This may facilitate or support faster information accessing retrieving presentation etc. or any combination thereof as previously mentioned. More specifically in an implementation multi dimensional aspects of sampled signals may be represented for example via a number of n dimensional signal vectors that may be mapped or transformed to or otherwise conditioned in some manner for a two dimensional space as an example embodiment. Subsequently sample signal values may be linearized based at least in part on distance by performing a memory sweep with respect to one or more dominant attributes of a sampled signal identified or determined for example in accordance with a dominance principle. Accordingly based at least in part on space time node facilitated or supported signal processing information structures may be intelligently organized so as to comprise for example a space time node engine signal structure as previously mentioned. Particular examples of one or more operations in connection with a memory sweep will be described in greater detail below. In addition although not shown at operation information structures may be communicated to one or more high speed computing clusters or massive storage entities such as general purpose graphics processing units GP GPU MapReduce clusters or the like. Of course details relating to linearization memory sweep or possible approaches are merely examples and claimed subject matter is not so limited.

At operation results with respect to information of interest such as trend analysis performance management market research situational awareness supply demand economics or the like may be presented in a suitable or desired visual representation form. For example information of interest obtained from a variety of sources in a variety of formats may be correlated in some manner to provide an ergonomic or easy to use interface experience in the form of an analytical tool or framework helping to visualize various spatio temporal nodal relationships. In some instances results may be provided so as to visually represent certain spatio temporal nodal relationships in a manner that may facilitate or support deriving or drawing particular inferences conclusions or the like that may assessed in whole or in part in connection with such a relationship just to illustrate one possible implementation. By way of example but not limitation various map based interfaces such as geo spatial flow charts or diagrams dashboard based presentations or like may be employed in connection with operation . Of course claimed subject matter is not limited to these presentation techniques.

Accordingly in certain implementations example process may be conceptually represented as comprising for example a number of space time node engine facilitated or supported signal processing layers which may correlate with or correspond to one or more operations described above such as signal information acquisition layer training or preparation layer internal organization layer or result presentation layer . Of course details relating to various layers layer sequences as well as the number of layers shown in connection with example process are merely examples and claimed subject matter is not limited in this regard.

With this in mind attention is now drawn to which comprises a flow diagram of an example process that may be implemented in whole or in part in connection with a space time node engine signal structure. Again it should be appreciated that even though one or more operations are illustrated or described with respect to a certain sequence other sequences including for example concurrent operations may also be employed. In addition although the description below references particular aspects or features illustrated in certain other figures such as or for example one or more operations may be performed with other aspects or features.

As illustrated example process may begin at operation with sampling or acquiring one or more digital signals representative of information originating from a variety of sources in a variety of formats. As previously mentioned sampled signals may be momentized or broken into discrete or finite moments prior to acquisition using appropriate techniques. As will be seen momentized signals may be characterized by a number of n dimensional signal vectors that may be used at least in part to determine a cardinality of one or more dominant attributes associated with the signals. As was also indicated a sampled signal may be formatted in some manner such as by utilizing a function or class type driver or adapter for example to facilitate or support a certain type of formatting such as a space time nodal type formatting though claimed subject matter is not so limited. In certain implementations such an adapter may comprise for example a space time nodal adapter and an information structure may comprise for example a space time nodal grain STING .

As previously mentioned a STING adapter may be implemented in whole or in part by a vendor associated with a signal acquisition point utilizing a class or Unified Modeling Language UML type diagram that may be made available. Optionally or alternatively a STING adapter may be implemented for example by a special purpose computing platform associated with a recipient of a sampled signal such as a space time node engine. For this example various classes or properties may be statically or dynamically specified or characterized in some manner such as via an ecosystem file created by an ecosystem configuration manager. More specifically a designer type entity such as an ecosystem designer for example which may or may not be associated with a recipient of a sampled signal e.g. a space time node engine etc. may define or characterize via an applicable ecosystem file one or more types of sources or attributes that may be used or supported business objects or artifacts that may be formatted constraints or indexing strategies that may be considered etc. or any combination thereof. Claimed subject matter is not so limited of course. For example a STING adapter may comprise a product of collaboration between any suitable parties associated with a source or recipient of a sampled signal for example or any suitable third party depending at least in part on implementation. By way of example but not limitation a class or UML type diagram that may be utilized in whole or in part in connection with a space time nodal type formatting may include an example as illustrated in . It should be appreciated that one or more classes properties attributes relationships etc. shown are merely examples to which claimed subject matter is not limited.

Turning now to a schematic illustration of an implementation of an example information structure in a space time nodal grain or STING format is shown. In this context STING STING cell STING signal structure or the plural form of such terms may be used interchangeably and may refer to an information structure comprising one or more attributes related to or associated with a sampled signal. In one particular implementation an information structure such as STING cell for example may be conceptually represented as comprising a number of stores or sections with signal related aspects or attributes. As illustrated STING cell may comprise for example spatial or locational attributes temporal attributes nodal attributes payload or information section communication attributes or security attributes . It should be appreciated that even though a certain number or types of signal related aspects or attributes are illustrated herein any number or type of signal related aspects or attributes may comprise STING cell .

For this example spatial or locational attributes may represent one or more space or location related characteristics associated with a sampled signal. In some instances spatial attributes may include for example one or more latitude or longitude signal sample values identifying a source or origin of a sampled signal a geo coded reference or literal descriptive of a signal acquisition point or source or the like. One possible format for a geo coded reference may include for example Fremont Calif. 94555 and an example of a literal may comprise a geo hash like 9q8yyk8yuv5xw. In an implementation where a literal may be used to spatially annotate an information structure such as STING cell for example a pre negotiation operation between a sender of a signal and its recipient may establish a geocode factory using appropriate techniques for example so as to obtain source related geographic coordinates. One possible example of a geocode factory may include for example a gazetteer service though claimed subject matter is not so limited of course. Geocode factories are known and need not be described here in greater detail.

Temporal attributes may comprise for example one or more time related characteristics associated with a sampled signal. For example temporal attributes may comprise a time stamp denoting a time date etc. at which a signal was created which may typically although not necessarily be in the form of a range. Here a temporal attributes may be relatively fine grained meaning that associated sample signal values may support for example up to a microsecond granularity though claimed subject matter is not so limited. As previously mentioned a source and a recipient of a sampled signal such as a space time node engine for example may utilize atomic clocks to facilitate or support time related synchronization to eliminate or reduce sampling ambiguity. In one particular implementation a source and a recipient may feature GPS enabled clocks capable of maintaining for example microsecond level synchronization at least approximately.

Nodal attributes may comprise for example one or more node related characteristics associated with a sampled signal. For example nodal attributes may comprise one or more signal sample values descriptive of a relationship that is typically although not necessarily relational rather than dimensional. By way of example but not limitation a nodal relationship may comprise for example a sociogram or graph type relationship. Accordingly nodal attributes may describe or identify a particular node in a graph associated with a sampled signal. For purposes of explanation a nodal relationship between information sources of interest may be conceptualized for example via an analytical query like How many greeting cards were sold by Hallmark Cards Inc. stores in San Francisco and San Jose For this example different Hallmark stores in San Francisco and San Jose may represent different nodes in a linked relationship e.g. Hallmark stores etc. that may be advantageously captured by an information structure such as STING cell for example. Nodal attributes may comprise for example a signal sample value identifying a particular node e.g. a particular store in San Francisco etc. in an interlinked hierarchy of nodes e.g. different Hallmark stores in different cities etc. associated with a sampled signal. Of course details relating to particular nodes are merely examples and claimed subject matter is not so limited.

Payload may comprise for example one or more signal sample values representing information of interest such as information to be analyzed visualized forecasted leveraged etc. or any combination thereof associated with a signal acquisition point or source. As previously mentioned payload may include for example various performance market management operations business related information or the like.

Communication attributes may comprise for example one or more signal sample values representative of communication or network related aspects of a sampled signal. For example communication attributes may be descriptive of an underlying communication infrastructure associated with a signal acquisition point may provide source or destination addresses bandwidth latency error detection checksums transmission loss channel noise sequencing information or the like.

Security attributes may comprise for example one or more signal sample values representative of security related aspects associated with a sampled signal. For example security attributes may be descriptive of sensitive or personal information with respect to a signal acquisition point such as an identity of a source source or signal ownership information whether information is to be protected access privileges or the like. In other words security attributes may facilitate or support protection of information associated with an information structure such as STING cell for example from unauthorized access use disclosure modification interception destruction or the like.

As was indicated one or more attributes associated with STING cell may be optional in certain example implementations which may depend at least in part on a signal acquisition point or source. As a way of illustration if a source of a sampled signal is associated with a navigation or positioning system such as a GPS device that may change its location sporadically frequently or periodically a STING cell may omit a nodal attribute to comprise for example a spatial or temporal attribute among others e.g. a payload security etc. . Likewise as an example a signal acquisition point realized as a thermostat may be useful for sampling information with respect to space or time for example but less useful with respect to node related attributes since thermostats are typically although not necessarily stationary devices. As another possible example since typically although not necessarily there is no spatial dimension with respect to a signal acquisition point associated with a BI system for example locational or spatial attributes of a STING cell may be omitted depending at least in part on an embodiment.

In addition as will be described in greater detail below such as in connection with an application of a dominance principle for example one or more attributes associated with a STING cell may dominate over one or more other one or more attributes. Dominant attributes of sampled signals may for example be dependent upon or attributable to at least in part a rate of change in a payload of a sampled signal with respect to time space or node as will be seen. Accordingly size or so called granularity of a store or section e.g. temporal nodal spatial etc. associated with a STING cell may be adjusted in some manner. By way of example but not limitation for slower moving signals such as GPS type signals for example at times a nodal attribute may be less useful than for example one or more spatial or temporal attributes as indicated above. As such GPS related STING cells may omit nodal attributes to continually communicate spatial or temporal attributes or both in which case granularity of a nodal store or section may be increased to reflect one or more dominant attributes. As another example higher speed signals such as a fast Fourier transform FFT of an alternating current AC signal for example may exhibit temporal dominance thus reserving or allocating higher granularity for a store or section with time related characteristics. Examples of STING cells having one or more dominant attributes are illustrated in . As seen stores or sections with a higher number of bytes may be reserved for or allocated towards a particular dominant attribute if any as schematically represented via a larger area of a section or store. Of course details relating to one or more dominant attributes are merely examples and claimed subject matter is not so limited. In addition although not shown STING cells of may comprise other signal related attributes such as security attributes for example.

In an implementation sampled STING cells may be linked in some manner so as to facilitate or support more efficient or effective processing of a continual signal stream of STING cells. For example STING cells may be committed to one or more STING clusters based at least in part on a payload to byte ratio average number of STING cells per payload or the like. Any suitable or desired format may be utilized. As a way of illustration a STING cluster may be formatted for example as an information or signal data string e.g. coma separated etc. in connection with an Extensible Markup Language XML document or the like depending at least in part on an implementation. By way of example but not limitation one possible format suitable for commitment of STING cells to a cluster may comprise an example represented in Table 1 below. Consider for example 

As seen a suitable format may comprise for example a string of STING cells clustered via a notation wherein a string may comprise one or more signal sample values acquired or sampled in connection with a signal acquisition point. For purposes of illustration a signal acquisition point may be realized as a thermostat though claimed subject matter is not so limited. For example a STING cell may comprise a spatial attribute characterized via a register signal value 2 with latitude longitude signal values of 67.0009 117.67 a temporal attribute characterized via a register signal value 4 of 7.00 am a payload characterized via a register signal value 1 represented as a string of signal values with respect to a temperature e.g. 65 etc. operating state e.g. OFF etc. or energy efficiency e.g. 77 etc. of a thermostat or 

and a communication attribute comprising an IP address e.g. 117.14.56.34 etc. and an information transfer rate e.g. 67 kb sec etc. .

As previously mentioned instead of a signal value e.g. binary real etc. to indicate a type of processing to be applied e.g. spatial temporal etc. such as for example at operation of a format may reference a relation such as a parabolic trajectory formulation y x 2. This or other suitable relations may be utilized at least in part in instances where aspects of an incoming signal are sufficiently predictable such as signal deviations associated with a sine wave of an AC for example which may be captured by an appropriate relation. If a sampled signal is sufficiently predictable a relation may be used instead of or in addition to signal sample values thus eliminating or reducing sampling a signal stream of STING cells in a continual fashion. This may provide benefits in terms of reducing a processing time or complexity improving performance etc. or any combination thereof.

In addition a script such as for example may also be utilized to indicate a suitable processing increment in connection with sampling a signal as illustrated. A script may be useful for processing temporal attributes for example so as to invoke or trigger processing in accordance with time increments such as 1 2 3 etc. seconds minutes etc. as was also indicated. To illustrate a temporal attribute such as time stamp for example may be increased by 1 second minute etc. based at least in part on a t t 1  formulation that may be specified for an information stream. Accordingly instead of or in addition to 1997 07 16T19 20 01 00 notation other formats may also be considered 1997 07 16T19 01 00.

As mentioned above size of a STING cluster may be characterized at least in part in a manifest file by specifying for example a payload to byte ratio of sampled STING cells just to illustrate one possible implementation. illustrates an example manifest file that may be utilized or otherwise considered in whole or in part in connection with one or more operations associated with example process . It should be appreciated that manifest file which is self explanatory is provided herein by way of a non limiting example and may comprise for example information specifying or characterizing one or more classes extensions packages etc. or any combination thereof. Briefly in this illustrated example manifest file may comprise a number of field name entrances which may be referenced to facilitate or support one or more operations with respect to signal structures training indexing processing or the like. For purposes of explanation one or more classes extensions packages etc. may be specified in some manner such as by a vendor device ecosystem configuration manager e.g. in the ecosystem file etc. or any combination thereof as previously mentioned. In addition manifest file may specify a type or format that may be used in connection with one or more operations description of corresponding functions types of signal characteristics that may be supported as well as signal values that may be allowed for respective processing which may of course depend at least in part on a particular application. In one implementation a payload to byte ratio of 400 10 or 40 may be used such that a STING cluster would be created if a ratio has been quantified or otherwise observed for example. Of course descriptions relating to payload to byte ratios or manifest file are merely examples and claimed subject matter is not limited in this regard.

Referring back to at operation it may be determined whether negotiation between a signal acquisition point or source and a recipient of a sampled signal is appropriate. Typically although not necessarily negotiation may comprise a process in which a computing platform associated with a source for example may inform or negotiate with a computing platform of a recipient on processing of one or more attributes of an incoming or sampled signal such as one or more attributes discussed above in connection with . If it is determined that negotiation is appropriate at operation one or more negotiation tasks may be performed. For example a source may negotiate with a recipient using applicable terms of negotiation by referencing any suitable file supporting a negotiation related process such as manifest file of for example. Negotiation related fields may correspond or be mapped in some manner to a Universal Unique Identifier UUID embedded in an information structure such as STING cell for example so as to identify a structure. By way of example but not limitation terms of negotiation may include those listed in negotiation related fields in manifest though claimed subject matter is not so limited. Source recipient negotiation techniques are generally known and need not be described here in greater detail.

At operation a determination may be made regarding whether one or more sampled STING cells are to be trained. As described below based at least in part on training one or more trained signal datasets may be created and subsequently applied to facilitate or support more effective or efficient information indexing organization processing visualization reporting or the like. In an implementation whether training is appropriate may be determined at least in part by referencing training related fields for example in a manifest file such as manifest file . As was alluded to previously training related fields may be specified by a vendor associated with a signal acquisition point or source for example or otherwise dynamically specified or characterized in some manner e.g. by an ecosystem configuration manager etc. . If it is determined that training is appropriate or otherwise may be useful example process may continue to operation . On the other hand if training is omitted a process may proceed to operation .

With regard to operation a Gaussian filter may be applied in some manner to a sampled stream of STING cells so as to reduce or eliminate noise by attenuating removing or otherwise ignoring for example one or more STING cells with spurious sample signal values representative of incorrect or corrupted signals for example. As previously mentioned a sampled signal may be represented as 12. . . where v1 v2denote value vectors and i is a whole number. Signal sample value vectors may account for properties of a sampled signal associated with a signal acquisition point or source and may comprise for example signal sample values representative of temperature pressure etc. or any combination thereof. To reduce or eliminate noise a Gaussian filter may be applied such that signal sample values with certain standard deviations e.g. variations from average signal sample values may be considered as noise or error and as such may be eliminated cut off or attenuated. More specifically for a signal value vector standard deviations may be computed as 

At operation one or more sample sets of information points may be obtained or extracted for training. It should be noted that any suitable extraction techniques may be employed. In some instances extraction techniques may for example depend at least in part on a manner of how STING cells may be organized stored processed etc. or any combination thereof. For example in one implementation a sample set may be extracted via a pseudo randomization technique though claimed subject matter is not so limited. A stream of STING cells may be directed into any suitable in memory appliance such as a database file memory system or like information repository for example and may be stored as one or more sets of STING clusters such as one or more STING clusters illustrated in Table 1 above. A number of points that may be extracted may depend at least in part on a total number of available signal structures such as for example STING cells in a cluster. In some instances a number of pseudo random points useful for training may for example be specified or characterized in a manifest file as a percentage of a total sample set. For example based at least in part on a total number of rows in a particular STING cluster a number of sample information points in a set may be computed by dividing a percentage of points available for training by a number of rows in a cluster. By way of example but not limitation if there are 10 million in memory rows 5 of a total sample set may indicate that 500 000 rows may be utilized for training. In one implementation a database extraction technique via pseudo randomization may be performed by way of a SELECT statement executed against a sample set stored in a database such that 

Accordingly as an illustrated example 10 000 random STING cells would be extracted for training. Of course this is merely one possible example. Many extraction techniques other than pseudo randomization may also be utilized in connection with operation .

With regard to operation a dominance principle may be applied in some manner to a set of STING cells representative of a sampled signal. As previously mentioned a dominance principle may refer to a process of determining a degree of cardinality with respect to one or more attributes associated with one or more sampled STING cells. In some instances a dominance principle may be applied for example to understand the nature or relationships between various incoming information structures associated with sampled signals. In one implementation a dominance principle may be applied for example to determine which one or more attributes among a number of attributes associated with sampled STING cells such as attributes discussed above in connection with for example may be dominant.

Attention is now drawn to illustrating an implementation of an example application of a dominance principle. As previously mentioned an incoming stream of STING cells representative of a sampled signal may be momentized for example into a number of n dimensional signal vectors. For an example implementation momentized signal vectors may comprise for example signal vectors S through S as illustrated generally at . As seen a signal vector may be specified for example by a number of dimensions or planes indicated generally at corresponding to one or more attributes associated with a sampled signal. For example X Y and Z dimensions may correspond to locational or spatial attributes such as latitude longitude and altitude respectively T dimension may correspond to temporal or time related attributes and N dimension may correspond to nodal attributes. As previously mentioned a nodal relationship may typically although not necessarily comprise relational features rather than dimensional features meaning that a nodal relationship may be plotted or represented graphically for example as a sociogram or graph type relationship. Nodal attributes thus may be specified or characterized for example in connection with a nodal domain such as nodal domain N rather than a nodal dimension. However it should be noted that in this context the term nodal dimension may be used interchangeably with the term nodal domain so as to provide similar meaning. In an example a momentized sampled signal may be represented via a number of n dimensional vectors S n X Y Z T N. It should be noted that Z or an altitude dimension may be optional in some example implementations. Of course these are merely examples of various signal vectors dimensions or attributes that may be utilized in connection with an application of a dominance principle and claimed subject matter is not so limited.

It may be observed that for S S and S signal vectors X Y Z and N dimension or plane related moments may not change or may change little. On the other hand T plane related moments may change from t1 to t10 which may indicate that one or more time related attributes of one or more STING cells may dominate or exhibit a higher degree of cardinality. Typically although not necessarily a cardinality of a set may refer to a measure of a number of elements of a set. For purposes of explanation a set A 2 4 6 includes 3 different elements and has a cardinality score of 3. As also seen signal vectors S to S may change in X plane by a cardinality of a count of 3 e.g. x1 x3 x4 x3 and may also change twice or have a cardinality score of 2 e.g. t10 t15 along T plane. Thus a cardinality of a sampled vector in space time or nodal dimensions may be determined at least in part by counting a number of different elements represented via changing moments in a set represented via dimensions or planes. Accordingly based at least in part on an application of a dominance principle it may be determined that signal vectors S S and S may be at least temporally dominant e.g. along T plane and that signal vectors S S S and S may be at least spatially dominant along X plane. Of course this is merely one possible example of an application of a dominance principle to which claimed subject matter is not limited. Any suitable approaches such as for example approaches utilizing bijective injective surjective functions cardinal numbers etc. may also be employed.

If it is determined that one or more attributes of a sampled signal are dominant at operation a cardinality map in any suitable format may be produced. Although claimed subject matter is not so limited a cardinality map may for example be initially represented via a table such as illustrated in above. Based at least in part on a representation a suitable format for a map to determine a degree or cardinality by identifying one or more dominant attributes along for example spatial temporal or nodal dimensions may include an example as illustrated in Table 2 below.

As previously mentioned a nodal relationship may typically although not necessarily comprise relational features rather than dimensional features and may be represented for example via a sociogram or graph having a number of nodes connected together by associational links or ties. To determine one or more dominant attributes of a node or N cardinality samples of signals originating from identifiable nodes of an existing graph such as for example a particular Hallmark store in San Francisco as discussed above may be used. As seen in Table 2 above in one implementation the notation graph relationship N may be used to specify a canonical relationship between nodes of a graph for an N related domain. In this context a canonical relationship may refer to some established or existing relationship in which nodes are known non arbitrary or otherwise identifiable. It should be appreciated that a nodal relationship may be represented via a directed graph undirected graph or any combination thereof. Of course details relating to determining N related cardinality are merely examples and claimed subject matter is not limited in this regard.

Referring now back to at operation it may be determined whether a particular type of training such as a clustering based training utilizing a k means type process for example may be appropriate or may be useful. As previously mentioned training may be implemented so as to characterize or understand the nature of one or more relationships between sampled signals which may facilitate or support more effective or efficient signal processing indexing organization or the like. As was also indicated whether training is appropriate or may be useful type of training training intervals or other training related processes may for example be characterized or specified in whole or in part in a suitable configuration or initialization type file such as manifest file just to illustrate one possible implementation.

Continuing with example process if training may be appropriate or otherwise may be useful at operation a process may implement for example a clustering based training. In some instances a clustering based training may include for example k means clustering of STING cells to arrive at spatially temporally or nodally dominated cluster zones or clusters derived from a sampled signal stream. For example in an implementation a k value of 3 may be used meaning that a cluster map of three clusters such as spatially temporally and nodally oriented clusters for example would be created. Clusters may be created for example by partitioning STING cells represented via n dimensional signal vectors such as vectors discussed above in connection with based at least in part on one or more dominant attributes. By applying k means type clustering a sampled n dimensional signal vector with one or more dominant attributes may belong to a respective cluster with a nearest mean. Relationships between sampled signal vectors may be determined based at least in part on vector proximity which may be computed as a function of mutually relative distance between information points comprising k means clusters. As described below distance may be representative of for example one or more spatial temporal nodal etc. relationships between sampled signals or any combination thereof. In some instances distance between sampled signals may be representative via a Hamming distance for example as will also be seen. However these are merely examples of a particular application of clustering based training and claimed subject matter is not limited in scope in these respects.

If clustering based training is omitted then at operation it may be determined whether correlation based training may be appropriate or otherwise may be useful by referencing for example training related fields in manifest file . If it is determined that correlation based training may be appropriate or useful example process may continue to operation . In an implementation correlation based training may employ for example a Pearson s correlation coefficient to determine or learn one or more relationships between incoming STING cells representative of one or more sampled signals. For example how sampled signals may be related may be evaluated by identifying statistically relevant trends or overarching similarities in signal trending with respect to time. Accordingly an approach may employ for example a rate of change of sampled signal vectors over time or so called signal vector derivatives. More specifically a Pearson coefficient for an actual or forecasted signal stream may be respectively computed by utilizing values of corresponding sampled n dimensional signal vectors and associated first second and third order derivatives to evaluate how signals correlate in time. In this context a second order derivative may refer to a derivative of a first order derivative a third order derivative may refer to a derivative of a second order derivative and so forth. Sample signal values with higher degrees of correlation may be stored in memory as a trained signal dataset for example and may be subsequently applied in connection with one or more operations associated with example process .

If is it determined that correlation based training may be less useful example process may proceed to operation for determination whether to implement evolutionary training. If yes at operation evolutionary training may be performed. For example here a concept of a genetic algorithm or process may be advantageously leveraged or applied so as to facilitate or support more effective or efficient characterization of a fitness function to arrive at a faster less arbitrary or otherwise more successful or useful conversion. In some instances a fitness function may be characterized for example by one or more proximity based parameters such as a distance between signal vectors representative of STING cells. As described below a distance between STING cells may be determined based at least in part on one or more applicable distance calculators. More specifically during initialization one or more chromosomes and their component genes for example may be identified or generated. A gene may be represented via one or more signal sample values in a binary string numeric etc. format and may be associated with a STING cell s payload. By way of example but not limitation a chromosome may comprise an automatic temperature control system realized as a thermostat having component genes specifying a thermostat s operating state temperature ambient condition or the like. An initial set of STING cells e.g. sampled from a thermostat etc. may be collected as a population and organized in memory. A parent set may be selected for reproduction in some manner. For example a parent set may be selected based at least in part on knowledge assessed or evaluated from one or more training operations such as for example clustering based training at operation correlation based training at operation or the like. Based at least in part on an application of a proximity based fitness function one or more new or child STING cells may be reproduced in a manner so as to approach an improved or ideal state or reach an improved or optimal goal. One or more determinations may be made for example by assessing or evaluating distance between a child STING cell and an improved or perfectly fit or previously trained e.g. clustering based correlation based etc. STING cell. Of course these details are merely examples relating to evolutionary training and claimed subject matter is not so limited.

If evolutionary training is omitted a process may continue to operation . Here as a result of one or more training operations such as operations or described above for example one or more trained signal datasets may be created. It should be noted that a trained signal dataset may be stored in any suitable in memory appliance such as for example a database file memory system or like information repository. As schematically illustrated by dashed arrows at a trained signal dataset may be used or applied in connection with one or more operations associated with example process . For example in an implementation a trained signal dataset may be utilized in whole or in part by an ecosystem configuration manager or like application programming interface API so as to facilitate or support more effective or efficient processing indexing presentation visualization etc. or any combination thereof.

Although claimed subject matter is not limited in this respect a trained signal dataset may be utilized for example in connection with delta processing at operation outgoing signal processing at operation indexing at operation or possibly other operations associated with example process . For example if a trained signal dataset indicates that particular signals correlate sufficiently well over time similarly or like trending incoming signals may be indexed or processed more intelligently. Namely if it is observed that two particular signals are trending in a certain way for example then signal sample values for one signal may be indexed or processed so as to conserve computational resources such as memory space number of processing operations or the like since signal values for a second signal would be predictable or otherwise ascertainable e.g. from training etc. . Of course this is merely one possible example of an application of a trained signal dataset and claimed subject matter in so limited.

With regard to operation it may be determined whether one or more intermediate signals are missing or corrupted. Missing or corrupted signals may for example lack an informational component that may useful in evaluating sampled signals and may lead or result in less effective or efficient analysis performance processing presentation or the like. At operation a Gaussian filter may be applied in some manner to eliminate or reduce noise such as for example in a manner described above in connection with operation . Example process may proceed to operation at which point an error approximation operation may be performed. For example if one or more space time node etc. related signal sample values associated with one or more STING cells of a sampled signal are missing or otherwise corrupted signal sample values may be interpolated to arrive at a statistically acceptable approximated values. In one implementation a Shepard s method may be utilized for example to approximate missing signal sample values by applying weighted functions assigned to points in a scattered set of sampled signal values based at least in part on one or more dominant attributes associated with sampled STING cells.

If no on the other hand example process may proceed to operation for a determination regarding indexing for information structures such as for example sampled STING cells. Indexing may typically although not necessarily be used to facilitate or support more effective or efficient signal processing by providing indexing options for faster look up access performance retrieval or the like using appropriate techniques. If indexing is omitted a process may by pass operation and may continue at operation . However if it is determined that indexing may be appropriate or useful at operation STING cells associated with a sampled signal may be indexed in some manner based at least in part on one or more available indexing options. By way of example but not limitation indexing options or strategies may be specified or characterized in a manifest file such as manifest for example as previously mentioned. It should be appreciated that any suitable indexing techniques or processes such as k means indexing spatial query indexing tree based indexing type process etc. may be used at operation . Various indexing techniques are known and need not be described here in greater detail. For example in an implementation indexing may be performed using one or more commercial statistical libraries. Indexed information structures may be stored in any suitable information repository such as for example in memory cache file cache or the like. It should also be noted that in an implementation operation may be optional in which case example process may proceed from operation to operation .

At operation n dimensional information structures associated with a sampled signal may be organized in some manner into a system of STING cells. In some instances a system of STING cells may comprise for example a space time node engine signal structure organized linearly in a suitable in memory array. For example n dimensional STING cells may be organized based at least in part on one or more dominant attributes linearized as a function of mutually relative distance by performing a memory sweep with respect to one or more STING clusters having spatially temporally or nodally dominant information points. Examples of a memory sweep so as to arrive at a linearized in memory array will be described in greater detail below with reference to .

As referenced at example process may implement a delta processing operation so as to compress one or more signal sample values associated with sampled information strictures such as STING cells for example communicated over any suitable communication channel or link in connection with example process . Delta processing operation may be implemented in whole or in part to reduce consumption of one or more process related resources such as for example memory space transmission bandwidth storage size or the like. It should be appreciated that even though delta processing operation is illustrated in connection with a certain processing sequence such as following operation for example delta processing operation may be implemented in connection with any suitable operation associated with example process . Here one or more types of compression such as lossy compression lossless compression or the like may be employed. Compression techniques may help to eliminate or reduce statistical or perceptual redundancy facilitate or support signal consolidation etc. and may be based at least in part on an application of approximation thresholds loss of tolerance ratios or the like. By way of example but not limitation types of delta compression to be implemented or other compression related operations may be characterized or specified at least in part in a manifest file as was indicated.

With regard to operation one or more STING cells associated with a linearized in memory array may be processed in some manner so as to help for example with presentation of one or more spatio temporal nodal relationships of interest. More specifically an outgoing signal processing may comprise for example a process of a relatively rapid pass on linearized memory locations for spontaneous de serialization into a suitable output format. In some instances an output format may comprise for example a raster or vector output format which may aid in visualization reporting presentation as mentioned above. Accordingly outgoing signal processing may facilitate or support for example a number of visual options for delivering real time location intelligent context relevant analytics capable of being intuitively displayed using one or more interfaces associated with computing platforms or devices such as GPUs animation controllers dashboards or the like.

Referring now to illustrating an example implementation of a memory sweep that may be performed at least in part in connection with operation of . To simplify discussion features or aspects of that may correspond to same or similar features or aspects for example or otherwise may be referenced in a similar fashion are given the same reference numbers where applicable. As previously mentioned a memory sweep may facilitate or support effective or efficient in memory organization in general and a space time node engine signal structure in particular depending at least in part on an implementation. A space time node signal structure may for example enhance or improve information analysis retrieval reporting presentation or the like as previously mentioned.

Example process may begin at operation with organizing one or more input STING clusters in an in memory array. As described below one or more input clusters may be organized based at least in part on any suitable indexing strategy depending at least in part on an implementation. As illustrated in some instances KD tree type indexing or R tree type indexing may be employed though claimed subject matter is not so limited of course. Indexing strategy may be characterized or specified in whole or in part in any suitable manifest or INI type file such as for example manifest file as referenced at operation . Accordingly at operation a particular type of an indexing strategy such as whether to perform an R tree type indexing or KD tree type indexing for example may be determined based at least in part on referencing manifest file . As previously mentioned one or more indexing strategies may be performed using one or more techniques such as by accessing for example a particular web site associated with a suitable commercial statistical library e.g. http javadoc.geotools.fr 2.2 org geotools index rtree RTree.html http www.java2s.com Open Source Java Document Database DBMS perst org garret perst impl KDTree.java.htm etc. 

If a determination has been made in favor of a KD tree type indexing for example a process may proceed to operation and further to operation so as to generate a number of STING clusters based at least in part on a KD tree type indexing. If a KD tree type indexing approach does not converge however example process may proceed to operation for example so as to be terminated in some manner such as without performing a memory sweep. On the other hand having an R tree type indexing as a strategy may provide for example an advantage in the form of a stronger mode of convergence thus allowing a process to continue to operation without being terminated.

Based at least in part on an R tree type indexing KD tree type indexing or any other suitable type of indexing for example at operation one or more STING clusters may be generated or created as mentioned above. In certain simulations or experiments STING clusters included those illustrated in though claimed subject matter is not so limited. Thus using at least in part an R tree type indexing or KD tree type indexing for example STING cells associated with sampled signals may be organized in one or more clusters such as clusters or . As alluded to previously a STING cluster may comprise for example a number of information points as indicated generally at or units of spatio temporal nodal information sampled with respect to an information source. By way of example but not limitation an information point may be representative of a signal sample value with respect to temperature pressure or the like which may be referenced in connection with a certain point in time particular location etc. though claimed subject matter is not so limited.

At operation a bounding box for a STING cluster may be created in some manner. For example bounding boxes or may be created for clusters and respectively by enclosing minimum perimeter or volume areas around a cluster. As such here for a cluster a bounding box may comprise for example an area with the smallest perimeter or volume within which all or most information points may fit or otherwise lie though claimed subject matter is not so limited. For example in some instances a bounding box may be created by taking particular reference lines in a certain order such as the minimum X maximum Y for the upper left corner and the maximum X minimum Y for the bottom right corner. Of course this is merely an example and claimed subject matter is not limited.

Referring back to at operation a loop for a cluster may be specified such that a certain sequence or construct e.g. creating a bounding box memory footprint etc. may be carried out or repeated for any suitable number of clusters. With regard to operation a memory footprint for a cluster may be created. For example n dimensional signal vectors having spatially temporally or nodally dominated attributes as described above may be processed or transformed in some manner so as to arrive at two dimensional representations of these vectors and may be subsequently linearized or stored in one dimensional memory as a function of mutually relative distance. A particular example of creating a memory footprint will be described in greater detail below with reference to . At operation it may be determined whether example process has been performed or completed for a suitable number of STING clusters such as for example for all or most clusters created or generated at operation . Otherwise then process may return to operation to repeat one or more functions associated with operations and . On the other hand alternatively process may terminate a memory sweep.

Continuing with process a cluster of STING cells such as cluster or of for example indexed in some manner such as in the manner described above in connection with operations of may be used as input signals as indicated at operation . With regard to operation example process may reference any suitable manifest file e.g. manifest file etc. so as to determine one or more dominant metrics of a sampled signal. In some instances a dominant metric may comprise for example a default dominant metric that may be specified by a pointer referenced in a manifest file as Default Dominant Metric Pointer though claimed subject matter is not so limited. For example a dominant metric may refer to a dominant attribute associated with a sampled STING cell. As previously mentioned a dominant attribute may comprise an attribute that may be determined based at least in part on an application of a dominance principle and may influence one or more characteristics of an associated signal vector. By way of example but not limitation a signal sampled with respect to a certain signal acquisition point such as a thermostat for example may have a temperature as a dominant metric. As described below a dominant metric may be represented via a dominant signal value vector v for example and may influence various process related strategies such as indexing memory sweep organization or the like. If a signal value for a dominant metric is not declared e.g. by a vendor etc. or otherwise not specified e.g. in a manifest file etc. for example a signal value of 1 may be used. Of course details relating to a dominant metric are merely examples and claimed subject matter is not limited in this regard.

At operation a centroid or center of mass for a cluster of STING cells may be computed in some manner. For example as illustrated in a centroid of a cluster of STING cells for a bounding box may be computed by specifying for example one or more dominant metric weighting factors. In some instances a dominant metric weighting factor may be characterized for example by a dominant signal value vector v just to illustrate one possible implementation. Thus consider 

As such n dimensional signal vectors such as signal vectors described above with reference to for example may be advantageously transformed so as to be represented in a two dimensional space or matrix by specifying one or more dominant metric weighting factors that may be based at least in part on a function of mutually relative distance between STING cells associated with a sampled signal. In some instances one or more distance calculators may be utilized to facilitate or support a representation. Particular examples of one or more spatial temporal nodal etc. distance calculators will be described in greater detail below. Accordingly based at least in part on distance related calculations centroid may comprise for example a two dimensional center of mass for cluster .

With regard to operation it may be determined which STING cell of STING cluster is the closest to centroid and which STING cell is the farthest from centroid . As particularly seen in such a determination may be made based at least in part on computing the minimum Rmin and the maximum Rmax distances as indicated at and respectively. In some instances a Euclidian based distance metric may be utilized for example to calculate respective Rmin and Rmax though claimed subject matter is not so limited. For example other distance calculators such one or more distance calculators described below may also be used. At operation an incremental sweep angle and an incremental radius Rmay be computed using for example following respective relations 

At operation computed sweep angle and radius may be specified as signal inputs so as to produce or generate for example a transitioning curve . Transitioning curve may comprise a central point corresponding to centroid for example and which curvature may increase by a value of an angle increment as curve unwinds in a spiral like fashion as illustrated. It should be noted that curve may be specified to emanate from centroid in any suitable direction such as counter clockwise or optionally or alternatively clockwise for example as referenced by arrows at . For example a sweep angle or radius may be incremented in some manner such as by an angle counter for example utilizing a value computed via Relations 4 or 5 above. While sweeping and as a curvature of curve increases such as due to a specified angle increment for example a leading or endpoint of curve may encounter a number of information points representative of STING cells such as a point and so forth. Accordingly using curve in a spiral like fashion information points within a bounding box such as bounding box for example may be identified or located.

Having located an information point such as point for example process may continue to operation so as to identify or locate all or some information points within a certain distance from point . For example as illustrated in to identify information points a circle may be generated or formed around information point by specifying the distance Rmin just to illustrate one possible implementation. All or some information points inside circle may be linearized based at least in part on in circle distance calculations with respect to these points utilizing for example Euclidian distance metrics. Optionally or alternatively distance may be calculated by utilizing applicable distance calculators referenced or characterized in memory sweep related fields in a manifest file. Applicability of a distance calculator may depend at least in part on types of one or more dominant attributes associated with respective in circle information points of interest for example. One or more distance calculators will be described in greater detail below. By way of example but not limitation linearized in memory array may include one referenced by arrow at . Information points X X may be representative of signal sample values linearized based at least in part on in circle distance calculations such as for example distance calculations utilizing Euclidian distance metrics for a two dimensional plane. Points P P may represent signal values linearized via an application of Euclidian Temporal distance calculations as another possible example. It should be appreciated however that signal values distance calculators or in memory array shown are merely examples to which claimed subject matter is not limited.

At operation it may be determined if a certain identified information point representative of a particular STING cell such as a STING cell P P or P within circle for example has already been linearized. Encountering a linearized information point may indicate that one or more memory sweep parameters such as an incremental sweep angle or radius for example may be less than adequate or somewhat insufficient which may prompt example process for suitable parameter evaluation as referenced at operation . In certain simulations or experiments a computed increment angle or radius were evaluated as follows 

As previously mentioned one or more distance calculators may be utilized in whole or in part to facilitate or support transforming n dimensional signal vectors associated with a sampled signal into one dimensional representations including for example a linearization operation discussed above. In some instances distance calculators may be realized as a set of APIs that may help to identify relationships or strengths of relationships between sampled signals based at least in part on proximity between information points of interest. As described above a sampled signal may be represented for example via one or more n dimensional signal vectors such that S x y z t N v1 v2. . . . Thus a distance between two sampled signals S x y z t N v1 v2. . . and S x y z t N v1 v2. . . may be characterized for example as D distance S S . In one implementation distance calculators may be specified or characterized in any suitable configuration or initialization type file such as for example manifest file as was also indicated. For example distance calculators may include those listed below though claimed subject matter is not so limited.

SPATIAL2D. Spatial Euclidean distance for a two dimensional or X Y plane. Distance Dmay be calculated using for example the following Relation square root over 6 

SPATIAL3D. Spatial Euclidean distance for a three dimensional or X Y Z plane. Dmay be calculated for example as square root over 7 

SPATIO TEMPORAL. Spatio Temporal Euclidean distance in a X Y Z T plane or dimension. Distance Dmay be calculated as square root over 8 where K denotes a dimensional factor conversion notated in a unit that is a distance measure time measure. In one implementation K 1 may be used though claimed subject matter is not so limited.

SPATIO NDIMENSIONAL. Euclidean Distance in an N dimensional plane or domain. Distance Dmay be calculated for example using the following relation 

TEMPORAL. Difference in time related moments. For a calculator distance Dmay be defined for example as 10 

NODAL DISTANCE AFFNITY. Distance between nodes based on the affinity of nodes. For two sampled signals such as for example signals S x y z t N v1 v2. . . and S x y z t N v1 v2. . . having sample value vectors representative of pressure temperature etc. distance Dmay be computed at least in part by utilizing the Hamming distance measure or D just to illustrate one possible implementation. Thus by way of example but not limitation the following approach may be used 

Loop through value vectors. For example a value vector may be compared against similar value vector of another signal such that v1 v1 v2 v2 v3 v3 v4 v4 

Compute the Hamming distance for example as HammingDistance Bitmap Bitmap Hamming distance may be utilized for example to identify related nodes e.g. democratic leadership etc. that are close to relatively stronger nodes e.g. the President the Vice President etc. in a sociogram or graph type relationship e.g. the Democratic Party etc. . Hamming distance computations are known and need not be described here in greater detail.

NODAL DISTANCE DEGREE OF SEPARATION. Distance between nodes is based at least in part on degree of separation within a graph. A degree of separation distance Dmay refer to a distance between two nodes in a graph calculated using a smallest number of links connecting nodes. An example Nodal Distance Degree of Separation calculator may be illustrated with reference to . As previously mentioned nodes in a graph such as a graph may be representative of sampled signals having signal values descriptive for example of canonical relationships within a graph. For graph two nodes such as nodes and for example may be represented via signal vectors as S x y z t N v1 v2. . . and S x y z t N v1 v2. . . respectively. For example node may be traversed to node by following links to nodes and respectively. However node may also be traversed to node by following one link or edge. Accordingly a distance calculator may follow or navigate the smallest number of links to arrive from node to node which is 1. As such the degree of separation between signals Sand Sis 1 or d 1 .

Further a mean of all distances for graph may be computed. For example for a node compute the minimum degree of separation with respect to other nodes. By way of example but not limitation for Node or Signal the minimum degree of separation with respect to other nodes e.g. signals in graph may include those illustrated in Table 3 below though claimed subject matter is not so limited.

By way of example but not limitation for a canonical relationship of graph an approach for determining the minimum degree of separation with respect to other nodes e.g. signals in may include one illustrated in Table 3 below though claimed subject matter is not so limited. Thus consider 

Accordingly a distance Dbetween two signals or nodes of interest e.g. information points etc. may be calculated as a degree of separation between signals divided by a mean of all distances for a particular graph associated with these signals or degree of separation between signals mean of all distances 11

For example second device may include one or more computing devices or platforms capable of communicating with for example a laptop computer a desktop computer a tablet PC a cellular telephone an access point a transceiver chip an e book reader a workstation a server device a data storage unit a file system a sensor or the like. In certain implementations first device or second device may take the form of one or more integrated circuits circuit boards or the like that may be operatively enabled for use in another device.

It should be appreciated that all or part of various components shown in connection with computing environment or the processes or operations as described herein may be implemented using or otherwise include hardware firmware or any combination thereof along with software. It should also be noted that computing environment may include more fewer or different components from those that are illustrated. Although not shown optionally or alternatively there may be additional devices operatively coupled to first device second device etc. to facilitate or otherwise support one or more processes or operations associated with computing environment . Thus unless stated otherwise to simplify discussion various functionalities elements components etc. as described below with reference to second device may also be applicable to other devices such as first device for example or devices not shown so as to facilitate or support one or more processes associated with example computing environment .

As illustrated second device may include at least one processing unit memory communication interface and one or more other components indicated generally at for example so as to facilitate or support one or more processes or operations in connection with a space time node engine signal structure. Processing unit may be implemented in hardware or a combination of hardware and software. Processing unit may be representative of one or more circuits configurable to perform at least a portion of information computing techniques or processes. By way of example but not limitation processing unit may include one or more processors controllers microprocessors microcontrollers application specific integrated circuits digital signal processors programmable logic devices field programmable gate arrays etc. or any combination thereof.

Memory may store comprise or otherwise provide access to computer readable instructions such as a program an application etc. or portion s thereof including for example initialization or configuration files information structures processor executable instructions or code or the like that may be accessible or executable by processing unit . Execution of such instructions by processing unit may transform second device into a special purpose computing device apparatus platform etc. or some combination thereof. Memory may represent any information or signal storage medium or mechanism. For example memory may include a primary memory and a secondary memory . Primary memory may include for example a random access memory read only memory or the like and may comprise information with respect to one or more training signal datasets cardinality maps indexing options manifest classes or properties linearized values STING cells or clusters various thresholds e.g. sweep angle radius etc. dominant attributes or other suitable or desires information to facilitate or support one or more processes or operations in connection with a space time node engine signal structure. While illustrated in this example as being separate from processing unit it should be appreciated that all or part of memory may be provided within or otherwise co located coupled with processing unit .

Secondary memory may include for example the same or similar type of memory as primary memory. In certain implementations secondary memory may comprise for example one or more information storage devices or systems such as for example a disk drive an optical disc drive a tape drive a solid state memory drive or the like. Secondary memory may be operatively receptive of or otherwise enabled to be coupled to a computer readable medium . Computer readable medium may include for example any medium capable of storing or providing access to information code or instructions e.g. an article of manufacture etc. for second device or any other device associated with computing environment . It should be understood that a storage medium may typically although not necessarily be non transitory or may comprise a non transitory device. In this context a non transitory storage medium may include for example a device that is physical or tangible meaning that the device has a concrete physical form although the device may change state. For example one or more electrical binary digital signals representative of information in whole or in part in the form of zeros may change a state to represent information in whole or in part as binary digital electrical signals in the form of ones to illustrate one possible implementation. As such non transitory may refer for example to any medium or device remaining tangible despite this change in state.

Computer readable medium may be accessed by processing unit for example. As such in certain example implementations the methods or apparatuses may take the form in whole or in part of a computer readable medium that may include computer implementable instructions stored thereon which if executed by at least one processing unit or other like circuitry may enable processing unit or the other like circuitry to perform all or portions of a memory sweep operation or any operation or process to facilitate or otherwise support a space time node engine structure. In certain example implementations processing unit may be capable of performing or supporting other functions associated with computing environment such as signal acquisition training presentation communication routing or the like.

Communication interface may allow for communication with one or more devices or systems associated with computing environment over one or more wired or wireless communication links. In certain implementations communication interface may comprise for example a function or class type driver or adapter e.g. a STING adapter etc. that may provide for or otherwise support communicative coupling between different levels or layers of an architecture or a part of an architecture associated with computing environment as previously mentioned. Although not shown second device may include a power source to provide power to some or all of the components or circuitry. A power source may be a portable power source such as a battery for example or may comprise a fixed or stationary power source such as an outlet e.g. in a building electric charging station car etc. . It should be appreciated that a power source may be integrated into e.g. built in etc. or otherwise supported by e.g. stand alone etc. second device . A power source may also be a transportable power source such as a solar panel carbon fuel based generator or the like. Also components or circuitry of second device may include an analog to digital converter ADC for digitizing output signals for example.

Second device may also include one or more buses or connections e.g. connectors lines conductors optic fibers etc. to operatively couple various circuits or components together including for example one or more other components . As also seen second device may comprise for example an input output device . Input output device may represent one or more devices or features that may be able to accept or otherwise input human or machine instructions or one or more devices or features that may be able to deliver or otherwise output human or machine instructions. By way of example but not limitation input output device may include for example a user interface such as display touch screen keypad buttons knobs microphone speaker trackball data port or the like. Other components if present may comprise one or more other device features functionalities or the like capable of facilitating or supporting one or more operations or processes implemented by second device such as operations in connection with a space time node engine signal structure for example.

According to an implementation one or more portions of a device associated with computing environment such as first device second device or the like for example may store one or more binary digital electronic signals representative of information expressed as a particular state of a device. To illustrate an electrical binary digital signal representative of information may be stored in a portion of memory of second device by affecting or changing a state of particular memory locations for example to represent information as binary digital electronic signals in the form of ones or zeros. As such in a particular implementation of a device such a change of state of a portion of a memory within a device such a state of particular memory locations for example to store a binary digital electronic signal representative of information constitutes a transformation of a physical thing such as memory for example to a different state or thing.

Thus as illustrated in various example implementations or techniques presented herein in accordance with certain aspects a method may be provided for use as part of a special purpose computing device or other like machine that accesses digital signals from memory or processes digital signals to establish transformed digital signals which may be stored in memory as part of one or more information files or a database specifying or otherwise associated with an index in memory or otherwise.
