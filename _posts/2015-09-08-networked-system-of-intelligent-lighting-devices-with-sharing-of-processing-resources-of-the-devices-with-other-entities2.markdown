title: Networked system of intelligent lighting devices with sharing of processing resources of the devices with other entities
abstract: A system of network-connected lighting devices also offers a distributed processing function that utilizes processor and/or memory resources if/when available in some or all of the lighting devices. In the examples, a resource manager receives a job for distributed processing using shared available resources. The resource manager identifies lighting devices having resources of the processors and/or the memories available for the distributed processing function. The resource manager distributes tasks and/or data of the received job through a communications network to identified lighting devices, for distributed processing. The resource manager also receives results of distributed processing for the received job, from the identified lighting devices through the communications network. The received results are processed to produce a composite result for a response to the received job.

This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 463 586 filed May 3 2012 now U.S. Pat. No. 9 125 255 issued Sep. 1 2015 entitled NETWORKED ARCHITECTURE FOR SYSTEM OF LIGHTING DEVICES HAVING SENSORS FOR INTELLIGENT APPLICATIONS the disclosure of which also is entirely incorporated herein by reference.

This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 463 594 filed May 3 2012 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 755 039 issued Jun. 17 2014 entitled LIGHTING DEVICES WITH SENSORS FOR DETECTING ONE OR MORE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS AND NETWORKED SYSTEM USING SUCH DEVICES the disclosure of which also is entirely incorporated herein by reference.

The present subject matter relates to techniques and equipment such as a networked system of intelligent lighting devices for example that utilizes the network to communicate information as to detected device or ambient conditions and or information for controlling the devices where the system also provides a distributed processing function that utilizes processor and or memory resources if when available in some or all of the lighting devices of the system.

Electrical lighting has become commonplace in modern society. Electrical lighting devices are commonly deployed for example in homes buildings of commercial and other enterprise establishments as well as in various outdoor settings. Even in a relatively small state or country there may be millions of lighting devices in use. Traditional lighting devices have tended to be relatively dumb in that they can be turned ON and OFF and in some cases may be dimmed usually in response to user activation of a relatively simple input device. Lighting devices have also been controlled in response to ambient light detectors that turn on a light only when ambient light is at or below a threshold e.g. as the sun goes down and in response to occupancy sensors e.g. to turn on light when a room is occupied and to turn the light off when the room is no longer occupied for some period . Often such devices are controlled individually or as relatively small groups at separate locations.

With the advent of modern electronics has come advancement both in the types of light sources and in the control capabilities of the lighting devices. For example solid state sources are now becoming a commercially viable alternative to traditional light sources such as incandescent and fluorescent lamps. By nature solid state light sources such as light emitting diodes LEDs are easily controlled by electronic logic circuits or processors. Electronic controls have also been developed for other types of light sources. Advanced electronics in the control elements have facilitated more sophisticated control algorithms as well as increased networking of lighting devices.

Sensing and network communications have focused on the lighting functions applications of the lighting devices. For example sensors may be provided in a lighting device to detect parameters relevant to control operation of the lighting device and the processor in the device controls the source s of the device in response to the sensor inputs. Alternatively or in addition a communication interface in each of a number of networked lighting devices may allow communication about the status of each lighting device to a system control center. A programmed computer or a person at the control center then may be able to send commands to individual lighting devices or to groups of lighting devices for example based on a decision responsive to one or more conditions sensed by some or all of the lighting devices.

However these advances in lighting devices and networked systems have mainly addressed aspects of the lighting provided by the lighting devices. For example lighting devices may be adjusted turned ON and or turned OFF based on monitored conditions either by processor logic within the device s or commands from a central control. It also has been suggested that networked lighting devices could provide transport for data communications to from other devices that may come within range of the lighting device and or its internal communication interface.

The increasingly sophisticated electronics associated with lighting often now include a central processing device as well as memory for program and data storage. Where the lighting devices are networked each device also includes some form of communication interface to enable the desired communication with other lighting devices and or with networked control computers. These elements of the lighting devices involve costs when purchasing and deploying the lighting devices. Building an installed base of such equipment with substantial numbers of lighting devices each having sophisticated electronics incurs a financial investment. In many cases the electronics are a substantial cost for each lighting device and that cost may be multiplied by a large number of such devices in an extensive networked implementation owned by or operated for a large enterprise. Despite the infrastructure cost the resources may be idle for substantial periods of time e.g. when lighting devices are OFF for extended periods or even during operations when individual devices are not actively communicating or not using full processing or memory resources for example during intervals between substantial device setting changes which may require execution of a processing intensive algorithm .

Hence there is room for improvement in the usage of the resources in lighting devices e.g. to increase the usage of costly processing and memory resources in networked lighting devices.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth by way of examples in order to provide a thorough understanding of the relevant teachings. However it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present teachings may be practiced without such details. In other instances well known methods procedures components and or circuitry have been described at a relatively high level without detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring aspects of the present teachings.

The concepts discussed in the detailed description that follows and illustrated in the accompanying drawings herein facilitate improved utilization of resources of networked lighting devices. The examples described here and illustrated in the accompanying drawings enable a lighting system to share processor and or memory resources for other distributed processing purposes or functions e.g. when the system resources in some or all of the lighting devices of the system are otherwise available for the ancillary processing function.

Reference now is made in detail to the examples illustrated in the accompanying drawings and discussed below. illustrates a high level example of a system of intelligent lighting devices and computers connected or otherwise coupled for communication via a network . The system is shown in high level block diagram form.

In this first simplified example each lighting device has similar elements indicated by the same reference numerals . Later examples include several more specific configurations of intelligent lighting devices that utilize additional and or somewhat different elements. Also the various devices elements and configurations thereof are examples only because other elements and configurations may be used in the same or different implementations of a system like system for different lighting applications for different monitoring applications for different related applications like external communications and the like.

With more particular reference to the example of each lighting device includes a light source . The light source may be formed by one or more of any type of light emitter device that is suitable to a particular application of the lighting device . As will be discussed later with regard to more detailed examples the light source and other elements of the device may form an integral unit such as a light fixture or light bulb the other elements of the device may be attached as a separate unit configured to control the light source or the other elements may form a somewhat separate module mounted in the vicinity of the light source

Each lighting device also includes a communication interface configured to enable communication through the communications network . The communication interface may be of any type suitable to provide the desired communication capabilities e.g. bandwidth or data rate for communication via the particular implementation of the network . The communications to and from the device using the communication interface for example can be radio frequency or optical type wireless communication or use optical or electrical hard wire technologies. The network may be partial or entirely private e.g. a local area network LAN or intranet or the network may be a wide area network such as the public Internet.

Each lighting device also includes a processor shown as a central processing unit CPU in the drawing. Specific examples discussed later utilize a microcontroller or a microprocessor. The CPU of the lighting device has access to the communication interface to control communications of the device to and from the communications network . The lighting device also includes a memory that is accessible to the CPU and one or more programs stored in the memory for execution by the CPU . In a microcontroller example the memory may be within the microcontroller whereas a microprocessor implementation will typically utilize memory separate from but accessible by the microprocessor.

The lighting devices in the example implement one or more core functions of the system that is to say functions that are essential to the design of the particular system and or the main business model of the entity operating the lighting devices . The core function of the light source is light emission. The other elements of a lighting device may implement one or more core functions that are related to lighting for example monitoring a light related condition and or controlling operation the light source . Instead of or in addition to the function s if any related to lighting the other elements of a lighting device may implement another core function of the entity such as monitoring of a condition that need not be directly related to operation of the light source . In the example each lighting device includes a sensor for detecting a condition although as noted above the condition may be related to operation of the light source or may be another type of condition external to the lighting device and or not directly related to the operation of the light source . If sensors are included the different devices may use different sensors or different combinations of two or more sensors for particular core functions of the device s .

Execution of one or more programs from the memory configures the processor CPU to perform a monitoring function and or a function related to operation of the light source for example for a core function of the lighting devices . Execution of the one or more programs from the memory also configures the processor CPU to communicate regarding the core function s performed by the lighting device via the communication interface and the communications network .

For the core functions the system also includes one or more computers operated by the entity that operates the lighting devices . A later more detailed example includes a number of higher levels of control system computers. In the simplified example of of the system a computer serves as a central control system CCS server. The system example also includes one or more user terminal or client computers for personnel of the entity operating the lighting devices represented generally by the tablet computer shown in the drawing. For resource sharing purposes the entity in this example also operates a resource manager . The resource manager receives jobs from and sends final results to other computers such as other computers of the same entity like the tablet computer as well as from third party computers represented by the desktop type terminal computer . The CCS computer and the resource manager computer are shown as using hardware platforms of any type as might be used for implementing network server or host functions. Although only one instance of each computer and is shown it will be recognized that the functions of these platforms may be implemented in a distributed fashion on multiple computers. Whether a single or distributed implementation the CCS and resource manager functionality may both run on the same computer s or on separate hardware as shown.

The tablet computer and the desktop computer are intended as general examples of the computer processing type devices commonly available for operation by individual users although in some cases functions attributed to those devices in this discussion can be implemented by other host or server computers. Alternatively devices having a form factor of a user device can be programmed to operate as servers for some purposes.

Although not shown in this first drawing each of the computers to has internal processors memories and programming and each of the computers to has a communication interface enabling the respective computer to communicate through the network. The communication interface in each of the computers to may be of any type suitable to provide the desired communication capabilities e.g. bandwidth or data rate for communication via the particular implementation of the network in a manner similar to that discussed above relative to the interface

One or more of the computers to communicate through the network with the lighting devices . In some cases the computers to communicate with each other through the network . In our example the CCS computer communicates through the network with the lighting devices so as to receive information from and or send information to the processors of the lighting devices with regard to the one or more of the core functions performed by the devices . For example the CCS computer may receive data communications from the intelligent lighting devices regarding the condition s sensed by each of the lighting devices . The CCS computer may also send commands through the network to control one or more operations of the lighting devices . The user terminal may similarly communicate through the network with the intelligent lighting devices or the user terminal may communicate with and interact with functions of the system via the CCS computer .

The resource manager in the illustrated example is another computer having and interface and programming to enable the commuter to communicate with other devices or computers through the network . In the example the resource manager is implemented on a hardware platform of a type typically used as a server or host computer. The resource manager is implemented by appropriate programming. Although the programming may run on a separate computer as shown the resource manager programming may run on any other computer such one or both of the computers and .

Program execution within the lighting devices to implement core functions like condition monitoring and or lighting control was outlined earlier in the discussion of this first example. However execution of the program s from memory also configures the processor CPU in each lighting device to make resources of the processor and or the memory available for a distributed processing function via the communication interface and the communications network . In the example these later communications include communications with the resource manager . For example the processor may provide information to the resource manager that enables the resource manager to determine availability of resources of the processor and or the memory in each of the lighting devices. The communications also include instructions to operate or use available resources for a distributed processing function and to return results of such processing.

The resource manager receives a job for distributed processing. The job may be received locally or via network communication. In one example the resource manager receives the job from another one of the computers via communication through the network . The job for distributed processing may come from either of the computers and but for purposes of a later specific example we will assume that the job is received from a third party computer such as the computer . The job will include information indicating the type of processing needed as well any data or links to data that is to be processed.

Upon receiving the job the resource manager identifies resources of the processors CPUs and or the memories that are or are expected to be currently available for the distributed processing function in identified ones of the lighting devices for processing of the received job. The determination may be based on substantially concurrent communications with the lighting devices and or the CCS computer to determine actual current availabilities or the resource manager may be capable of predicting processing requirements and associated availability of resources intelligently ahead of time based on information monitored or obtained earlier from the other elements of the system . The resource manager distributes tasks and or data of the received job through the communications network to the identified lighting devices for distributed processing in the identified lighting devices. In this way the system is poised to accept spontaneous or arbitrary job request inputs and allocating tasks to available resources within the system. In many cases the actual allocations will not utilize all of the available resources for a particular job.

The resource manager also receives from the identified lighting devices through the communications network results of the distributed processing for the job that have utilized the identified available resources to which tasks of the job were allocated. The resource manager processes the received results to produce a composite result for a response to the received job. In the current example the resource manager might send the composite processed final result through the network to the computer that submitted the job e.g. to the third party computer .

Although not shown the system will typically include an element or a function implemented on one or more of the computers to control access to core functions and to the resource sharing feature s of the system . Such access control e.g. to determine authenticity of users and or their terminals and possibly to determine authorization to utilize requested features or functions of the system may be implemented in a variety of different ways intended to insure a desired level of security and management control by the enterprise or other entity operating the system. There may also be operational control based on priorities. For example core functions may have priority over processing jobs utilizing the resource sharing features. As another example of priority handling a job received from one source or for one identified user may have priority over and therefore be serviced before a job from a different source or for a different user.

In the drawing the communications between the CCS computer and the lighting devices appear as an initial step S for convenience. In practice these communications will typically continue with some or all of the lighting devices even while other steps of the method relating to distributed processing via resource sharing in relation to a received job are being performed.

The resource manager receives information over the network which the resource manager can process to determine resource availability for a received job. The resource manager can obtain this availability information in a variety of ways. In the example the resource manager communicates back and forth with the intelligent lighting devices as represented by the two way arrows at step S in the drawing. For example the resource manager may periodically poll the various intelligent lighting devices through the communications network and in response the resource manager will receive data from the intelligent lighting devices that can be processed to determine the resource availability.

The received data may indicate available processor resources and or memory resources in each intelligent lighting device . However the system may provide other forms of data to the resource manager that may be translated into or otherwise processed to obtain the availability information. As an example of this later type of approach the data may indicate various loading factors with respect to each of the intelligent lighting devices from which the resource manager can determine unused capacities and or predict availability.

In the example discussed so far the resource manager communicates back and forth directly with the intelligent lighting devices . As noted earlier however other techniques may be used to collect availability related information. For example the CCS computer may accumulate load factor information regarding the resources in the intelligent lighting devices during normal communications with the intelligent lighting devices . With such an approach the resource manager communicates with the CCS computer either to obtain load factor information for processing or to obtain resource availability information already determined by the CCS computer .

For convenience the drawing shows a single instance of the step S in which the resource manager obtains the resource availability information regarding the intelligent lighting devices . If the system will process only a single job for some extended period a single collection of resource availability information might be sufficient. However if the system will offer distributed processing via shared resources for a more substantial number of jobs particularly if some jobs will be processed at least somewhat in parallel then the collection of resource availability information will typically continue with some or all of the lighting devices even while other steps of the method relating to distributed processing in relation to a particular received job are being performed.

In step S the resource manager receives a job for distributed processing by resources of the intelligent lighting devices that may be available in the system of . Typically the received job will include a request for example specifying the source computer and the type of processing requested. Although not shown for simplicity there may be a determination of authenticity of the user and or device sending the job request level of authorization to utilize particular features or functions of the system and or a determination of relative priority for the job. The job request will include or be accompanied with information as to the data to be processed. For example the resource manager may receive one or more files to be processed or the resource manager may receive one or more links to enable the resource manager or the intelligent lighting devices to retrieve the file s to be processed via network communication.

In step S the resource manager analyzes the job as well as the information regarding resource current or predicted resource availability to identify resources of the processors and or the memories available for the distributed processing function in identified ones of the intelligent lighting devices for processing of the received job. For a given job the analysis may identify some or all of the intelligent lighting devices for distributed processing on the particular job. In our example we will assume that the analysis by the resource manager identifies intelligent lighting devices having suitable resources available at the time although others of the intelligent lighting devices are not selected. Depending on circumstances for example some devices may not have appropriate or sufficient resources available at the time or a limited number of intelligent lighting devices may have sufficient resources to handle the particular job in a timely and efficient manner.

In step S the resource manager distributes tasks and or data of the received job through the communications network to the identified lighting devices for distributed processing in the identified lighting devices . For example the resource manager will send one or more messages to each of the identified lighting devices indicating the processing tasks that the respective device is to perform and either providing the data or a link to the data that the respective device is to process in accordance with its assigned task s . For example different devices may be assigned similar processing tasks but to be performed on respectively different sub components of the overall data. As another example one or more of the identified lighting devices may be assigned to process a result produced from processing by yet other s of the identified lighting devices . Even within any given device the allocation of resources to a particular task for the job may utilize some or all of the available resources of that device .

At step S in the illustrated process flow the identified lighting devices perform the respectively assigned processing tasks on the appropriate data utilizing the available resources of those devices to which the tasks for the job have been allocated. In each device the processing produces at least one result. In step S the processed data resulting from the distributed processing operations of the devices in step S are sent back from the identified lighting devices through the communications network to the resource manager . If each device is doing a separate piece of the overall distributed processing for the job the respective device may send its processed data result directly back to the resource manager . Alternatively or for other job processing configurations some of the lighting devices may act as intermediaries to receive and process data from sub groups of the identified lighting devices . Such an intermediary device would further process results received from its affiliated sub group and forward the combined results through the network to the resource manager .

A step S the resource manager processes the results that it received from the identified intelligent lighting devices in step S to produce a composite result from the distributed processing for the particular job. In the example step S involves the resource manager compiling an overall composite processing result obtained from the separate results received from the identified intelligent lighting devices . The exact nature of the processing in step S will depend on aspects of the particular job such as the type of data received for the job the type of processing of the data the manner of distributing the processing tasks among the devices and the desired overall result format.

The overall composite result is delivered in step S. Although the final composite result may be sent or distributed to one or more other devices or parties for ease of illustration the drawing shows the resource manager sending the composite result back to the third party terminal computer that initially requested distributed processing of the particular job.

The process flow and order of steps shown in and described by reference to are general and given as examples. Other steps or arrangement of steps may be used. For example the illustrated process flow collected information to enable the determination or prediction of availability of resources before the job was received and possibly while the job was processed e.g. for use in later resource availability determinations as later jobs are received . An alternative approach would be to obtain information to enable the resource availability determinations either from the intelligent lighting devices or from the CCS computer upon receiving each job. This later approach may reduce communications across the network to just those needed to obtain the information as required for each job and or may allow tailoring of the request for information and the responsive information transmission s to each particular job.

For that purpose for example shows a system that forms a network of intelligent lighting devices here configured as light fixtures by way of example. The lighting devices still are discussed here at a somewhat higher functional level however each of the devices can be implemented using any of several configurations discussed later and shown in drawings such as .

The system is logically organized in a hierarchical manner represented by Layers L to L separated by dashed horizontal lines in the drawing . In this example the lowest layer L of the hierarchy is the layer formed by the intelligent lighting devices in this case light fixtures . The system also includes a hierarchical arrangement of two or more layers of control computers represented by various types of host server computers and user terminal computers in the upper three layers L to L in the example of .

At the lower level L a number of light fixtures are organized into each of several groups and a first layer or local control system computer communicates with some number of respective groups. In the simple system example of several light fixtures are logically organized as a first group GA and another set of light fixtures are logically organized as a first group GB. These two groups of light fixtures GA GA communicate with a local control server host type computer A and possibly a local user terminal type computer A in the L layer via a communication network represented by way of example by the local area network A. Similarly several light fixtures are logically organized as a group GB and another set of light fixtures are logically organized as another group GB. These two groups of light fixtures GB GB communicate with a local control server host type computer B and possibly a local user terminal type computer B in the L layer via a communication network represented by way of example by a second local area network B.

The techniques discussed here are applicable to a wide range of lighting applications systems configurations. For example in some sets of groups the light fixtures may be outdoor lights such as street lamps or parking lot type lighting devices. In a street lamp example groups of lighting devices might be those for one or some number of city blocks. For purposes of further discussion of the example of we will assume that the lighting devices are devices within one or more buildings of one or more enterprises. So for example the lighting devices in each of groups GA and GA could be the devices for lighting a particular floor or floors of a first building and the lighting devices in each of groups GB and GB could be the devices for lighting a particular floor or floors of another building. In such an enterprise building example the local host server computer A might serve as a building control system BCS A for the first building whereas the host server computer B might serve as a building control system BCS B for the second building although for other types of local organizations of the fixtures the L layer computers may be referred to by other designations such a local control systems or local computer systems. The terminals A B would communicate via the network A or B with the respective BCS A A or BCS B B although in some instances the terminals may also communicate through a network directly with the light fixtures in the respective building or the like.

Although public networks could be used in the building example the networks A B for communications between the intelligent lighting devices and the respective control computers A A B and B in each premises are implemented as local area networks LANs within respective buildings. Each LAN may be wired e.g. metallic or optical fiber wireless e.g. radio frequency or free space optical or a combination of such network technologies. For example one building may use a wired Ethernet network whereas another may use a wireless network such as a wireless Ethernet WiFi network. A wired network may utilize the lines that supply power to the light fixtures and or the computers or a wired local network may use separate optical or electrical network wiring. Of course different buildings or other groups of intelligent fixtures may use different types of LANs. In an outdoor example e.g. for implementing intelligent fixtures as street lights the fixtures may utilize power line communication technology cellular network transceivers or a wireless mesh communication network topology.

The BCS type computer may be implemented with any suitable computer platform capable of running desired programming for monitoring and control functions and handling the desired work traffic load expected for the number of intelligent light fixtures with which the particular system A or B will be working. Each enterprise or building may have one or more of the user terminals A B. The user terminal equipment may be implemented with any suitable processing device that can also offer a suitable user interface. The terminal A for example is shown as a desktop computer with a wired link into the first LAN A and the terminal B is shown as a touchscreen type tablet computer with a wireless link into the second LAN B. However other terminal types such as laptop computers notebook computers netbook computers and smartphones may serve as the user terminal computers of layer L.

In the four tier hierarchy example computers A B A and B are the first layer computers in example layer L in communication with the light fixtures in layer L. Depending on the number of lighting devices and installations locations thereof there may be control computers in one two or more higher layers. In our building installation example of there are any number of buildings with installed light fixtures and associated building control system BCS computers within a geographic area or region. The BCS computers and possibly the terminal devices in layer L communicate with a computer or computers in the higher layer s via a network. Hence in the example each building installation includes a gateway and or firewall GTWY FW A B enabling communications of the various elements devices connected to the LANs A B via a wide area network WAN . A GTWY FW provides the requisite communication interfacing and security enforcement for communications between the routers implementing the LAN and routers of the WAN . The WAN may be the public Internet or a private intranet operated by an enterprise or a service provider. As in the lower layer network communications the links between the LANs and the WAN may use any available practical wired or wireless technology or any commercially advantageous cost effective combination thereof.

The WAN enables the computers in layer L to communicate with computers implementing one or more higher layers L L etc. of the networked architecture of system . For example some number of BCS computer systems within a particular region or area may communicate with a regional or area control system ACS computer at the L level. In the illustrated example the computers BCS A and BCS B B communicate via the WAN with a computer system ACS A A. Although the lower layer elements are not shown for convenience in another area BCS computers would communicate via the WAN with a computer system ACS B B serving as the L control computer for the second region or area. As represented generally by the tablet computer layer L may also include control computers in the form of various user terminal devices of any of the types discussed earlier relative to devices A and B in layer L. Depending on secure authorization policies a user of a terminal such as may interact with either or both of the ACS computers in layer L via the WAN . Other regions may be served by L and L host server computer systems and or user terminal devices in a similar manner. Each of the computers in layer L may be coupled or linked to the network via any suitable wired or wireless technology.

In an example like that shown that encompasses a number of different areas or regions the area computers ACSs in layer L in turn communicate with one or more computers in a still higher layer L of the networked system hierarchy. The communications may utilize a different network or as illustrated the computers of layer L may communicate with the computer s of the higher layer L via the WAN . As the system expands to cover wider geographic areas and to work with larger numbers of lighting devices the system may be expanded to add further layers to the hierarchy either in between the layers of the example or as still higher layers.

In the four tier example the L layer is the top logical layer. Hence the example includes a central control system CCS computer at that layer. Either in association with or as an alternative to the CCS the L layer may include a user terminal . Although shown as a desktop terminal the user terminal may be any appropriate type of computer device as discussed above with respect to terminal devices A B and in the L and L layers. Each of the computers in layer L may be coupled or linked to the network via any suitable wired or wireless technology.

For resource sharing purposes the entity that operates the system also operates a resource manager similar to or the same as the resource manager discussed above relative to . The resource manager receives jobs from other computers such as other computers of the same entity like the tablet computer as well as from and sends final results to third party computers represented by the desktop type terminal computer A and another tablet computer B in this example. Although shown at the L level for convenience of illustration the resource manager need not be associated with any particular level of the hierarchy of the system .

Although only a single instance of the resource manager is shown for convenience in a larger scale system like the system of there will typically be several instances of the resource manager . Multiple instances would share the load on the resource manager s functions in a distributed manner. Also for reliability reasons multiple instances of the resource manager in this example may be somewhat redundant so that if one instance is congested or fails or the like then some or all of the functions of the impacted resource manager can be shifted to one or more of the other instances.

The functions of the resource manager to predict or determine availability of resources allocate tasks of a job to identified lighting devices receive results from the identified devices and compile overall results are generally the same as those of the manager in the example of . Of note however in this example the resource manager may also communicate with the various BCS and ACS computers e.g. to obtain information about resource availability in the lighting devices . Depending on capacity and load at the various levels the distributed processing operations may also involve use of resources of at least some of the control computers in the distributed processing in addition to the resources of the intelligent lighting devices . The allocation of resources distribution of tasks and compilation of results where the resources are in the control computers would be similarly managed via the instance s of the resource manager in this example.

Returning to the lower L layer in our example we will next consider the high level aspects of the intelligent light fixture with specific reference to elements shown within one of the fixtures in the group GA.

As shown at a high level in each lighting device includes a light source a sensor coupling and a sensor for sensing at least one external condition not related directly to operations or communications of the light fixture. The networking and related monitoring and control operations discussed here can be utilized with any desired light source and different fixtures in the same or different buildings or outdoor locations can utilize different light sources to suit the needs of various lighting applications of the fixtures. Each light fixture may be configured with a single coupling and external condition sensor although the example in shows two such couplings and sensors in each fixture e.g. so that each fixture can sense two different external conditions or the same condition for example in different directions or locations around the fixture or to provide a combined reading and thereby improve overall accuracy .

A fixture may include one or more feedback sensors for sensing operational conditions such as source or circuit temperature light output intensity or one or more other characteristics of the light produced by the source which relate to operation of the fixture. Some or all of the fixtures may have light activation related sensors such as ON OFF switches room occupancy sensors ambient light sensors for controlling lighting in response to ambient light intensity and light dimmers. Feedback and light activation sensors are referred to collectively as internal sensors in that they sense aspects of and or user inputs to control the internal lighting operations of one or more of the fixtures. In the example the illustrative fixture in group GA includes a coupling and at least one internal condition sensor .

Each of the light fixtures is configured to sense at least one external condition not related directly to operations or communications of the light fixture. As discussed more later each fixture also has an interface for communications with other system elements. The condition or conditions detected by sensors are external in that they relate to some aspect observable in the environment around and near the fixture other than those relating to the feedback normal lighting control and or communications of the fixture . Although more examples will be discussed later a few examples of conditions that may be detected via external sensing include ambient temperature humidity air pressure and wind speed in the surrounding environment images of nearby objects motion outside the fixture gases and other substances in the atmosphere and temperature and moisture on objects within some distance range of the fixture . As such some of the external conditions like air temp air quality and vibration relate to ambient conditions around or near the fixture itself whereas other external conditions like reflected or directed light or like an image or a video of a distant object relate to external remote conditions that exist at some distance from fixture.

A wide variety of sensor devices may be used to sense any one or more of these or other types of external conditions. For example the sensor may be an optical device for sensing one or more characteristics of light in the ultraviolet visible or infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Optical devices may be used for example for sensing direction of light and determining position of an object as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 043 873 and 5 705 804 both by Ramer et al. Other examples of optical sensors include linear and two dimensional imaging devices.

By way of another example a lighting device may include a sensor in the form of a Micro Electro Mechanical System MEMS for sensing motion similar to gyroscopic devices used in smartphones and the like to sense orientation movement and direction. Here MEMS type sensors would sense magnitude and directions of vibrations of the fixtures due to external forces. Collective analysis for example might indicate an earthquake and the area and magnitude of the impact.

The external condition sensor coupling is configured to present a sensor connection interface standardized across at least some number of the lighting devices . The standardized connection interface is compatible with different types of external condition sensors . Each sensor is connected to the standardized connection interface of the sensor coupling . In this way one configuration of the coupling may be used with different types of sensors. Within any one fixture there may be one two or more couplings configured to the same standard as well as one two or more other couplings configured to one or more additional standards.

Each sensor is a device of one of the types compatible with the standardized interface provided through a standardized coupling . The location of each sensor enables sensing of a condition external to the respective lighting device although the condition is not directly related to operational performance of the respective lighting device. Each sensor is configured to output a signal responsive to the particular sensed external condition via the standardized connection interface of the associated sensor coupling .

Each lighting device in this case each fixture also includes processing and communications elements represented collectively in the high level functional block diagram of by the control communication Ctrl. Comm. board . These elements for example include a processor which is coupled to the sensor coupling s in the fixture for processing data responsive to the signal from each included external condition sensor . If internal sensing is provided the processor also is coupled to the sensor coupling s in the fixture for processing data responsive to the signal from each included internal condition sensor .

The elements on the control communication board also include a memory accessible to the processor which stores programming for execution by the processor and data for processing or that has been processed by the processor during program execution both for core functions of the system and for resource sharing in distributed processing operations. For example the memory stores a program corresponding at least in part to each type of included external condition sensor . Execution of the program controls at least one function of the processor of the light fixture responsive to the external condition sensed by the sensor such as collection of data regarding sensed external condition s and related communications with at least one of the higher layer computers of the system . The executable programming also includes one or more programs or modules that facilitate the resource sharing for distributed processing for example to interact with the resource manager receive processing task instructions and data to be processed perform assigned processing tasks and then communicate results back up through the system for compilation at the resource manager .

Each light fixture also includes a communication interface accessible by the processor. The communication interface is configured to enable the processor to communicate information resulting from performance of the function of the processor controlled by the program responsive to the sensed condition through the communications network in the example through a LAN A or B.

In the four tier hierarchy example computers A B A and B are first layer computers having communications interfaces enabling each of those computers to communicate through the communications networks A B with a different respective group of the fixture type lighting devices . In this way each first layer computer can receive information from the processors of its respective groups of lighting devices. At least one of the first layer computers in communication with each group of lighting devices is configured to process the received information regarding sensed conditions and or status of the intelligent lighting devices in its associated group to obtain resultant information.

In the example of a four tier hierarchy any of the computers in layer L and or computers in layer L would be a second layer computer having a communications interface to communicate through the communications network WAN to receive the resultant information from first layer computers. The second layer computer is configured to initiate at least one action in response to processing of the resultant information received from the first layer computers.

Although resource sharing may bypass one or more layers of the controlling computers the control computers may also support the resource sharing for distributed processing. For example each of the BCS computers A B may provide status and load information about the resources of the intelligent lighting devices in the respective group of devices either directly to the resource manager or via higher layer computers such as the ACS computers A B and or the CCS computer . Also as noted earlier some or all of the control computers may also share their resources during distributed processing.

Each of the various computers in the layers L to L will run programming to control respective operations thereof including operations for processing condition related data and or responsive communication and related actions. Although possibly somewhat different in each type of computerized device each will run an operating system OS and one or more applications programs APs related to the sensed condition communication and processing functions of the system . Depending on the system implementation some or all of the computers in the layers L to L may run programming to support aspect of the resource sharing for distributed processing as outlined herein.

The OS of a particular type of computerized device will provide an application programming interface API to allow various application programs to run on the computerized device via the respective OS and in that way utilize the various resources and functions of the computerized device. For example the API in computerized devices at one or both the higher layers L and L of computers enables application programming for processing the condition related data and initiating the responsive action can be written to the standardized API. In this way it becomes possible for various parties to write application programs for the higher layer programs to respond to different types of conditions sensed by the lighting devices and support different functions desired by the parties that utilize the system .

The computer or computers in layer L that receive the processed information from the layer L computers can initiate one or more responsive actions. The actions may involve any one or more of a variety of reporting functions such as sending alerts to terminal devices of users who may need to know or respond generating periodic reports or the like. The action or actions also may involve generating lighting related commands to send back down through the system to cause one or more of the intelligent lighting devices to modify their operations and or to sending commands through the system to cause one or more of the intelligent lighting devices to collect and send additional condition related information.

As outlined above the external condition monitoring collection of data obtained and processing of external condition data from lighting devices over a region or area of significant size admits of a wide range of possible applications for the data. The actions that may be initiated from the high level computer may be as wide ranging as the array of possible applications of the monitoring and data processing capabilities of the system . For example the high level computer s may generate maps or other forms of reports relating to conditions existing across the monitored region s . Where the sensed conditions include atmospheric conditions such as pollution a map might show the spread of a particular sensed pollutant allowing government personnel to identify the source track the spread and or initiate remedial actions. Weather related data collected at a multitude of street and highway lamps would provide much more granular information about weather conditions that is typically available from remote weather monitoring stations today. The maps or other reports generated at the higher level s of the system or portions or such information may be distributed through the network to terminal devices of users throughout the effected area including devices shown in the lower layers of the system . As another map example if sensing of position of objects near lighting devices or sensing vibration of the lighting devices is processed to determine the occurrence and magnitude of an earthquake a map might illustrate the relative magnitude of the quake throughout an area impacted by the quake.

To facilitate the data processing for the core functions of the system at least the computer s at layer L have access to information about the positions of the lighting devices to facilitate the relevant processing and related actions. Typically the position information is known in advance and maintained in a database. Maps of the area s or region s can be correlated with some or all of the position information. An alternative to the position database would be to include a position detection device such as a global satellite positioning GPS receiver and associated position calculation programming in the lighting devices. This later approach would allow for reporting of position changes e.g. in response to movement of the fixture if not permanently mounted and or if taken down and moved for some reason.

As another example of responsive action the action initiated in the high level computer may relate to further control of lighting operations of one or more of the lighting devices . For example in a situation where the sensed conditions indicate an emergency in a building the control action may involve sending commands back down through the system to selected lighting devices so as to initiate operations of any number of lighting devices in the effected building e.g. to help people to evacuate the building and or to help responders to find the source of the emergency condition.

As noted earlier another type of action initiated by the high level computer may involve generating commands to send back down through the system to cause one or more of the intelligent lighting devices to collect and send and additional condition related information. To help with damage assessment in the earthquake detection example these commands might cause lighting devices having image sensors to capture and send back images or videos for assessment.

The elements of the system may be owned and operated by one entity such an enterprise with multiple buildings distributed over a number of dispersed geographic regions. In a street light example a counsel of governments for a city and surrounding suburbs may jointly operate the light fixtures and computers to provide unified monitoring and response to one or more conditions in the regions served by the government entities in the council.

However some of the elements may be operated by different entities. In a building example for diverse building owners the monitoring service may be provided by an entity operating as a service bureau or provider. In this later case each building owner would own and operate the light fixtures and LAN in the respective building. The BCS computers and any terminals in layer L may be on the premises or remote and that equipment may be owned by the building owner or the service provider. However such L computers will be configured at least for the monitoring service by the entity that provides the monitoring service. The computer s at the higher levels would likely be owned and operated by the monitoring service provider although some may be owned and operated by other entities with whom the service provider has a cooperative agreement e.g. by a company or government entity that may agree to respond to conditions sensed on premises monitored by the equipment of the service provider.

The discussion here relates to monitoring of one or more conditions external to the lighting devices over a number of premises and or over a wide geographic area. The intelligence of the devices and the associated feedback sensing however allows for a wide range of control functions related to the lighting application as well. For example the same communication and computer resources can be used to monitor and control the lighting operations of the intelligent lighting devices. For example the fixtures may report conditions of the sources and fixture electronics to the control system computers and respond to commands from the control system computers to automatically adjust lighting operations. Condition reports generated by a high level computer can be used to advise appropriate personnel to service particular lighting devices e.g. to replace light source elements and or other device components when services is appropriate.

In several examples the intelligence and sensors are integrated with or attached to the fixture or other element that incorporates the light source. However for some installations there may be some separation between the fixture or other element that incorporates the light source and the electronic components that provide the intelligence and communication capabilities. Also in the examples the sensors are incorporated in the fixture or module that houses the electronic components that provide the intelligence and communication capabilities. However depending on the condition s to be sensed and or the particular installation the sensors and standardized couplings may be mounted somewhat separately and connected or otherwise coupled to the electronic components that provide the intelligence and communication capabilities.

The monitoring and communications elements may be applied to or combined with any type of light source. Hence the intelligent lighting devices may be any desirable type of indoor or outdoor lighting device signal lighting devices such as traffic lights lighted signage etc. A system like that of may include within the one system any number of these different types lighting devices. A system operated by a city or municipality for example might add intelligence to street lights of various types traffic lights and various types of indoor building lights in buildings used by the government. A system operated by a state or country might add intelligence to lights of the types mentioned with regard to the city in each city or town of the state or country as well as to highway lights and sign lighting along roads streets and highways between cities and towns in the jurisdiction. The broader the coverage the more varied the types of lighting devices that are likely to be included in the system.

A system run by a private enterprise either to monitor its own premises or to provide monitoring and the like as services to its customers might install intelligent lighting devices or add intelligent modules to existing lighting devices for indoor and outdoor lighting applications as various types of lighting devices on private property. If such an enterprise sells the services to a government then the enterprise would install and operate a system like that described earlier for a city state or country. One service provider enterprise might also sell the services both to government and to private parties essentially resulting in an overall system that includes both government and private installations of the intelligent lighting devices and could combine data from all of the intelligent lighting devices.

The processing and memory resources in the intelligent lighting devices represent a substantial part of the investment in purchasing and installing the system . However at times some or all of those resources may be under utilized or idle. The resource manager and programming of the lighting devices and possibly one or more of the control computers allow sharing of under utilized or idle resources of the system for distributed processing of data processing jobs that need not be directly related to the core lighting and monitoring functions of the system . The entity that operates the system may use the distributed processing service to enhance its own business or the entity may offer the distributed processing service to other parties to generate additional revenue from operation of the system . Although representing a larger scale deployment the resource sharing for distributed processing may be implemented in the system in a manner the same as or similar to any manner discussed above relative to .

Considering first the example of the lighting device includes a light source implemented as part of a legacy installation . For example the legacy installation may be an existing type of street lamp or light fixture utilizing an older more conventional type of source. In such a case some or all of the other elements of the lighting device may be configured as a module coupled to the light source in the legacy installation e.g. as added to a light fixture previously configured to support the light source . In the example the control elements control the light source . The light source in the legacy installation could be separately controlled e.g. by a legacy control system or element such as a switch . In this later situation the added elements of the device would mainly provide monitoring and communication functions from the location of the lighting device .

The lighting device includes one or more sensor couplings and one or more sensors as well as communication and control electronics. For the legacy installation of the source the other elements of the lighting device are configured as a module coupled to the light source e.g. as may be added to a light fixture previously configured to support the light source and coupled to the source via existing control and or power connections of the source.

In the example of device in the light source is integrated into the fixture or the like in a unified configuration together with the one or more sensor couplings one or more sensors and the communication and control electronics. Although the source in the device may be any suitable type of light source many such devices will utilize the most modern and efficient sources available such as solid state light sources e.g. LED type light sources.

In these examples each intelligent lighting device or is configured to sense at least one external condition not related directly to operations or communications of the lighting device. As discussed more later each device also has an interface for communications with other system elements. Hence a lighting device or may have as few as one coupling and one associated external condition sensor . In the examples discussed herein each lighting device or includes a number of sensor couplings and associated sensors .

The condition or conditions detected by sensors are external in that they relate to some aspect observable in the environment around and near the lighting device or other than those relating to the feedback normal lighting control and or communications of the device or . Although more examples will be discussed later a few examples of conditions that may be detected via external sensing include ambient temperature humidity air pressure and wind speed in the surrounding environment images of nearby objects motion outside the fixture gases and other substances in the atmosphere and temperature and moisture on objects within some distance range of the fixture . As such some of the external conditions like air temp air quality and vibration relate to ambient conditions around or near the fixture itself whereas other external conditions like reflected or directed light or like an image or a video of a distant object relate to external remote conditions that exist at some distance from fixture.

The examples thus include one or more sensors Sa of types for sensing or detecting an ambient external condition and one or more sensors Sr of types for sensing or detecting a remote external condition. Examples of external ambient condition sensors Sa include a fire detector a smoke detector an airborne chemical detector an airborne biological agent detector a carbon monoxide sensor an air temperature sensor an air pressure detector a humidity sensor a moisture detector an air speed detector and a micro electro mechanical system type sensor. By way of another example a lighting device may include an ambient sensor Sa in the form of a Micro Electro Mechanical System MEMS for sensing motion similar to gyroscopic devices used in smartphones and the like to sense orientation movement and direction. Here MEMS type sensors would sense magnitude and directions of vibrations of the fixtures due to external forces. Collective analysis of vibration measurements for example might indicate an earthquake and the area and magnitude of the impact. Examples of external remote condition sensors Sr include a directional light sensor a video or still image sensor and a sound detector. Some of the ambient and remote sensors may be optical devices each for sensing one or more characteristics of light in the ultraviolet visible or infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Optical remote condition sensor devices may be used for example for sensing direction of light and determining position of an object as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 043 873 and 5 705 804 both by Ramer et al. Other examples of remote condition optical sensors include linear and two dimensional imaging devices.

In these examples each external condition sensor coupling is configured to present a standardized sensor connection interface that is compatible with different types of sensors. In that way one standardized configuration of the coupling may be used with different types of sensors. Within any one fixture there may be one two or more couplings configured to the same standard as well as one two or more other couplings configured to one or more additional standards. Any sensor connection interface supported through a coupling is standardized across at least a number of different lighting devices or in that the different devices have similar couplings that support the same connection and associated electrical aspects of the coupling standard. However the standardized connection interface in the various lighting devices also is compatible with a plurality of different types of sensors. Each sensor connects to the standardized connection interface of one of the sensor couplings . Each sensor is a device of one of the types compatible with the standardized interface provided through a standardized coupling .

Although the couplings may support two or more standards for the sensors as noted for purposes of further discussion of the examples of all of the couplings in one device or provide the same standardized interface for various types of sensors . In either of the multi sensor examples Sr sensors may sense the same remote condition or different remote conditions. Similarly the Sa sensors may sense the same or different ambient conditions. Hence there is at least one first type sensor located so as to sense a first one of a number of conditions external to the lighting device not directly related to operation of the lighting device and at least one second sensor of a second one of the types different from the first type that is located so as to sense a second one of the conditions external to the lighting device not directly related to operation of the lighting device. Each Sa sensor connects to the standardized interface of one of the couplings and each Sr sensor connects to the standardized interface of another one of the couplings . Each of the sensors Sa and Sr is configured to output a signal responsive to the respective sensed condition via the standardized connection interface of the respective sensor coupling .

Intelligent lighting devices of the type discussed herein may have only the one or more external condition sensors . However the specific examples and illustrated in also include one or more couplings and sensors to detect a condition related to operation of the lighting device. A device or may include one or more feedback sensors for sensing operational conditions such as source or circuit temperature light output intensity or one or more other characteristics of the light produced by the source which relate to operation of the lighting device. Such sensors may provide a local or internal feedback loop at the lighting device or or may enable communication regarding the additional condition to another device over a network and associated light source control based on receiving responsive commands from the other device. Some or all of the lighting devices may have light activation related sensors such as ON OFF switches room occupancy sensors ambient light sensors for controlling lighting in response to ambient light intensity and light dimmers. Feedback and light activation sensors are referred to collectively as internal sensors in that they sense aspects of and or user inputs to control the internal lighting operations of one or more of the lighting devices. Examples of sensors to detect a condition related to operation of the lighting device or include a sensor for detecting temperature of one or more components of the lighting device a feedback light sensor for detecting intensity or other characteristic of light produced by the lighting device an occupancy sensor for detecting a condition indicative of occupancy of a region to be illuminated by the lighting device and an ambient light sensor for detecting ambient light near the lighting device. In the examples of the illustrative devices and each include one or more couplings and one or more internal condition sensors .

The couplings may be standardized in a manner similar to the couplings or the couplings may be uniquely configured for each respective type of sensor . In the example we will assume that the couplings present a standardized sensor connection interface that is compatible with different types of internal condition sensors. The standard may be the same as or different from the standardized interface s of couplings . Each sensor in turn is configured to connect to and provide condition responsive signaling via the standardized interface of the coupling . As discussed more later this third category of sensor provides signal s used to enable control of operation of the light source at least in part based on the condition s sensed by the sensor s .

A sensor may be as simple as a condition responsive transducer for generating an electrical signal bearing a known relationship to the amount or degree or the like of a particular condition that the transducer detects. However most implementations particularly those in the examples utilize sensors that include at least some circuitry for processing the output of the transducer s included as part of the sensor. The circuitry receives the signal from the transducer s in the sensor and produces an output via the coupling that conforms to the signaling aspects of the sensor coupling standard e.g. as a standard analog level signal on one or more pins designated for an analog connection and or as appropriately formatted data on the pins designated for data outputs. The electronics of such a sensor may also receive and respond to a signal received from the I O interface on the board.

Each lighting device or in the example also includes a processor coupled to the sensor couplings for processing data responsive to the signals from the sensors . However the two examples utilize different processor implementations.

Consider first the example of . There the lighting device also includes processing and communications elements in this case implemented on a control communication Ctrl. Comm. board . The lighting device includes a Micro Control Unit MCU which implements the control logic for the device that is to say controls operations of the device . The MCU may be a microchip device that incorporates a processor serving as the programmable central processing unit CPU of the MCU and thus of the lighting device as well as one or more memories accessible to the CPU . The memory or memories store executable programming for the CPU as well as data for processing by or resulting from processing of the CPU . The MCU may be thought of as a small computer or computer like device formed on a single chip. Such devices are often used as the configurable control elements embedded in special purpose devices rather than in a computer or other general purpose device. A variety of PIC16 and PIC32 type MCU chips for example may be used as the MCU in the lighting device .

As noted the lighting device includes a source which in the example of is part of a legacy type installation . Power is supplied to the source by an appropriate driver . The source driver may be a simple switch controlled by the MCU for example if the source is an incandescent bulb or the like that can be driven directly from the AC current. Although the driver could be an element on the control communication Ctrl. Comm. board in the example the source driver is a part of the legacy installation of the source for example the ballast in an otherwise conventional fluorescent light fixture.

Power for the lighting device is provided by a power supply circuit which supplies appropriate voltage s current s to the control communication Ctrl. Comm. board and provides appropriate power to the source driver to power the light source . Although shown separately for convenience the components of the power supply circuit may be mounted on the same board as the control and communication components depending on considerations such as board housing space heat generation etc. In the example the power supply circuit receives electricity from alternating current AC mains although the lighting device may be driven by a battery or other power source for a particular application. Although not shown the device may have or connect to a back up battery or other back up power source to supply power for some period of time in the event of an interruption of power from the AC mains .

The source driver circuit receives a control signal as an input from the MCU to at least turn the source ON OFF. Depending on the particular type of source and associated driver the MCU input may control other characteristics of the source operation such as dimming of the light output pulsing of the light output to from different intensity levels color characteristics of the light output etc. If the source and or driver circuit have the capability the driver circuit may also provide some information back as to the operation of the light source e.g. to advise the MCU of the actual current operating state of the source .

As outlined earlier the lighting device includes external condition sensors connected to standardized couplings as wells as sensors for sensing conditions related to operations of the source and associated sensor couplings . The couplings provide physical connections electrical signal connections and any power connections that may be necessary to the respective sensors . Physical and electrical connection aspects of each coupling will conform to relevant aspects of the applicable sensor coupling standard. The electrical power and electrical signal communication from and or to the sensors in accordance with the electrical aspects of the applicable sensor coupling standard are provided by appropriate input output I O circuitry connected between the coupling and the MCU . On the MCU side the I O circuitry provides a signaling link to a port of the MCU and conforms to the signaling standard for that port. Depending on the design implementation for a particular lighting device I O circuitry may include a separate circuit for each coupling two or more I O circuits for groups of two or more couplings or one I O circuit for all of the included sensor couplings. In the example of the I O circuitry for the sensor couplings is represented by the external sensor input output I O interface and the I O circuitry for the sensor couplings is represented by the source operations sensor input output I O interface .

Hence together the coupling and the external sensor I O interface circuitry provide physical and electrical connections as well as electrical power and signal communications for an external condition sensor that conform to the applicable sensor connection interface standard. The signal communications aspects of the standard at least allow the sensor to provide external condition responsive information to the MCU . Although the actual sensing element of a sensor may be analog the information passed to the MCU will typically be in a standardized digital format. The digital format however may vary somewhat as between sensor types based on associated application programming discussed more later. Preferably the MCU port connection the I O interface circuitry and the interface standard through the coupling also will allow the MCU to control one or more aspects of operation of the sensor e.g. to activate a sensor to sense the applicable condition at a time set by the MCU or to select one of several conditions to be sensed by a multi condition type of sensor or to adjust a sensitivity of the sensor etc.

As noted in the examples the couplings also support a standardized interface that may be the same as or similar to the interface of the couplings . Hence together the coupling and source operation related sensor I O interface circuitry provide physical and electrical connections as well as electrical power and signal communications for a source operation related sensor that conform to the applicable sensor connection interface standard. The signal communications aspects of the standard at least allow the sensor to provide source operation related condition responsive information to the MCU . Although the actual sensing element of a sensor may be analog the information passed to the MCU will typically be in a standardized digital format. The digital format however may vary somewhat as between sensor types based on associated programming. The MCU port connection the I O interface circuitry and the interface standard through the coupling may allow the MCU to control one or more aspects of operation of the sensor e.g. to activate a sensor to sense the applicable condition at a time set by the MCU or to select one of several conditions to be sensed by a multi condition type of sensor or to adjust a sensitivity of the sensor etc.

The lighting device also includes a communication interface coupled to a communication port of the MCU . The interface provides a communication link to a telecommunications network that enables the MCU to send and receive digital data communications through the particular network. The network may be wired e.g. metallic or optical fiber wireless e.g. radio frequency or free space optical or a combination of such network technologies and the interface in a particular installation of the device will correspond to the most advantageous network available based on considerations such as cost and bandwidth at the location of the installation. In network examples discussed later the network is a local area network LAN therefore the communication interface is of a type for linking to and communication through the available LAN. The communication interface is therefore accessible by the processor CPU of the MCU and the communication interface is configured to enable the processor to communicate information resulting from one or more functions that the processor performs in response to the various conditions sensed by the sensors and or through the LAN or other communications network.

As noted the MCU includes one or more memories . The memories store programming for execution by the CPU as well as data to be processed or that has been processed by the CPU . The programming is shown in block diagram or module form as a program stack at .

The programming includes various application programs and the like which are resident in the memory and execute on the CPU. The memory may be within the CPU or may be external memory as shown at in our example. The executable programming may also include an operating system .

Of note for purposes of this discussion the application software includes the software for implementing the control of the lighting device as well as the software for MCU interaction with the various connected sensors. For discussion purposes the example shows two application programs AP AP for controlling lighting device operations with respect to two different types of sensors. One type of sensor may be for one or more of the source operation related condition sensors but in this example we will assume that the sensor application program APcontrols operations in relation to a type of one of the ambient external condition sensors Sa and the sensor application program APcontrols operations in relation to a type of one of the remote external condition sensors Sr. Application programs such as AP AP are examples of programming for execution by the processor that corresponds at least in part to the type s of sensors and controls at least one function of the processor responsive to the condition s sensed by the sensor s . The CPU also will run one or more other application programs from memory to control various other functions of the lighting device such as control of the light source interaction with other types of sensors or and communications through the interface .

The programming implements a standard application programming interface API for at least the application s relating to external condition sensing. Although not separately shown the programming may implement the same or different APIs for applications related to the source operation related condition sensors and or other applications to be executed by the CPU . An API such as provides a standard software interface for exchanges between software components allowing components to communicate and interact. An API standard for example can specify command formats response formats data structures etc. In this case the standard sensor API offered or supported by the programming allows various parties such as different sensor manufactures to write application programs AP for the MCU to allow the device to utilize different external condition sensors .

The API for example may run on the CPU directly and if provided the OS would be on the CPU as well. Other programming may be in the CPU or it may be in external memory . The application programs AP APwould be found in memory .

The application programs AP and the API also enable the MCU to communicate information or data generated in response to processing of signals or outputs of the sensors so as to implement a standardized application programming interface with respect to the sensor related processing function s . The information resulting from processing functions of the MCU in turn is communicated through the interface and the network in a manner conforming to the standardized application programming interface. In this way various devices communicate data relating to various types of sensors through the network in a standardized format that can be readily processed by other equipment that is aware of the format supported by the application programming interface.

Hence each application program APor APcontrols one or more functions of the processor CPU responsive to the external condition or conditions sensed by the respective type of sensors . For example the programming may control how data regarding the sensed conditions is collected processed and formatted for communication e.g. so as to conform to relevant aspects of the standard interface specification and associated API. The programming may also configure the processor CPU to control the light source either based on internal logic or based on commands received at the device via the network communication. Each application program APor APmay control operation in relation to a single one of the sensors or in relation to some number of two or more of the sensors and or .

The application program corresponding to a particular type of sensor enables the processor to receive data representing the condition sensed by the sensor and controls at least one function of the CPU responsive to the condition sensed by the sensor such as processing of the data for communication via the interface and the network. The control function s implemented by execution of the application program for a particular type of sensor may involve other logic in addition or instead of processing for communications. For example the application program may determine timing for detecting a particular condition or for activating or responding to a particular sensor e.g. on a periodic basis so as to reduce processing load and or communication traffic. As another example the control function relating to a particular condition may involve a threshold either of a value or a change regarding the sensed condition. A program might cause the MCU to react to detection of more than some set amount of a chemical in the atmosphere as an indication of a harmful condition or to update a reported temperature when the temperature has changed more than a threshold amount. The open nature of the lighting devices provided by the sensor interface and associated API supports use of a wide range of sensor types and an even wider range of program logic for different networked applications of such devices.

Either as part of the OS if provided or part of the other programming the executable programming for intelligent lighting device includes programming that supports the resource sharing and distributed processing functions of the system . Such programming for example configures the processor CPU in the intelligent lighting device to make resources of the processor and or the memory available for a distributed processing function via the communication interface and the particular communications network. Such programming enables communications with other system elements to enable the resource manager to determine or predict resource availability and allocate one or more tasks to available resources within the intelligent lighting device . The programming also enables the device to receive instructions and data to be processed via the communication interface perform the allocated processing task s and return processed data back up through the system for compilation at the resource manager .

Consider next the alternative example of a lighting device shown in . The alternative example of a lighting device includes a somewhat similar source . As noted earlier the source is a new source integrated in a new installation type implementation of the device . Although the driver for the source could be separate in the example the source driver circuitry may be implemented as part of the control and communication board as shown. As discussed earlier the lighting device also includes the sensors and couplings as in the device of . Many of the functions operations of the device are similar to those of device however the lighting device utilizes a somewhat different control architecture than the MCU based arrangement of the device shown in .

Hence in the lighting device of the processing and communications elements on the control communication Ctrl. Comm. board include a microprocessor P which serves as the programmable central processing unit CPU of the lighting device . The P for example may be a type of device similar to microprocessors used in servers in personal computers or in tablet computers or other general purpose computerized devices. Such a device typically offers more and faster processing capabilities than the CPU of a Micro Control Unit like that used in the device . Unlike the Micro Control Unit program and data storage is external and instead of specially configured ports the P is typically configured to communicate data at relatively high speeds via one or more standardized interface buses represented generally by the bus arrow .

The lighting device includes one or more storage devices which are accessible by the P via the bus . Although the lighting device could include a hard disk drive or other type of disk drive type storage device in the example the device includes one or more memories . Typical examples of memories include read only memory ROM random access memory RAM flash memory and the like. In this example the memory or memories store executable programming for the P as well as data for processing by or resulting from processing of the P .

Although a single bus is shown for convenience some implementations of the device may include two three or more busses. A three bus implementation for example may include one bus for the communications one for the hardware drivers and one for the various sensors. Memory may have its own bus as well.

As noted the lighting device includes a source which in the example of is an integral part of the device . Power is supplied to the source by an appropriate driver in this example included as a component on the control communication Ctrl. Comm. board . Although represented as a single element in the drawing the driver may comprise a number of elements offering several control channels for different elements of the light source . For example a light emitting diode LED implementation of the light source may have individually controlled LEDs or strings of LEDs and for such an implementation the driver would consist of several driver circuits providing corresponding independent channels of control. The source driver provides a source of power and associated control by the CPU in this case by the P similar to the functions provided by the driver in the device of except that the driver includes a bus interface that enables the P to communicate with the source driver via the bus .

The lighting device includes a power supply circuit coupled to the AC mains like the supply circuit in the example of although the circuit and the board will be configured to supply diver voltage current to the source driver via the board instead of the separate path shown in the example of . As in the earlier example the lighting device may be driven by a battery or other power source for a particular application or an AC powered device may have or connect to a back up battery or the like to supply power for some period of time in the event of an interruption of power from the AC mains .

The source driver circuit receives control commands from the P via the bus to at least turn the source ON OFF. Depending on the particular type of source and the associated driver the P commands may control other characteristics of the source operation such as dimming of the light output pulsing of the light output to from different intensity levels color characteristics of the light output etc. If the source and or driver circuit have the capability the driver circuit may also provide some information back as to the operation of the light source e.g. to advise the P of the actual current operating state of the source .

As noted the lighting device includes external condition sensors connected to standardized couplings as wells as sensors for sensing conditions related to operations of the source and associated sensor couplings . The couplings provide physical connections electrical signal connections and any power connections that may be necessary to the respective sensors . Physical and electrical connection aspects of each coupling will conform to relevant aspects of the applicable sensor coupling standard s . The electrical power and electrical signal communication from and or to the sensors in accordance with the electrical aspects of the applicable sensor coupling standard are provided by appropriate input output I O circuitry connected between the coupling and the bus much like in the earlier example of .

Hence the lighting device includes external sensor I O circuitry and source operation related sensor I O circuitry . With respect to the respective sensors and couplings the I O circuits are similar to the circuits and in the example of . However each of the circuits and includes a bus interface that enables the P to communicate with the respective I O interface circuit or via the bus . Each of the circuits and may be configured to provide the electrical interface for one two or more of the respective sensors via the associated coupling s .

The lighting device also includes a communication interface which is similar to the communication interface in the earlier example in that the communication interface provides two way data communication via a network such as a LAN. In the example of the communication interface is of a type having a bus interface to enable the interface to communicate internally with the P via the bus .

As noted the lighting device includes one or more memories accessible via the bus and those memories store programming for execution by the P as well as data to be processed or that has been processed by the P . The programming in this example may be generally the same as or similar to the programming discussed above with regard to . Although optional in this second example the programming does include an operating system OS . Like the earlier example the programming includes an application programming interface API sensor type specific applications such as APand AP and other application programming. However here the programming particularly OS and API is of a type written for the particular type of P . The sensor type specific application programs APand APwould be written to conform to the API and to the particular types of sensors included in the lighting device .

Again application programs such as AP AP are examples of programming for execution by the processor that corresponds at least in part to the type s of sensors and controls at least one function of the processor responsive to the condition s sensed by the sensor s . The P also will run one or more other application programs from memory to control various other functions of the lighting device such as control of the light source interaction with other types of sensors or and communications through the interface .

At least for the external condition sensors and possibly for the source operation related condition sensors the API provides the standard software interface of the OS to the application programs AP as in the earlier example. The application programs AP and the API also enable the P to communicate information or data generated in response to processing of signals or outputs of the sensors so as to implement a standardized application programming interface with respect to the sensor related processing function s . The resulting information in turn is communicated through the interface and the network in a manner conforming to the standardized application programming interface. In this way various devices communicate data relating to conditions sensed by various types of sensors and or through the network in a standardized format that can be readily processed by other equipment that is aware of the format supported by the application programming interface.

Each application program APor APcorresponding to a particular type of sensor enables the P to receive data representing the condition sensed by the sensor and controls one or more functions of the P responsive to the external condition or conditions sensed by the respective type of sensors in a manner similar to the application programs AP in the earlier example.

Either as part of the OS if provided or part of the other programming the executable programming for intelligent lighting device includes programming that supports the resource sharing and distributed processing functions of the system . Such programming for example configures the processor CPU in the intelligent lighting device to make resources of the processor and or the memory available for a distributed processing function via the communication interface and the particular communications network. Such programming enables communications with other system elements to enable the resource manager to determine or predict resource availability and allocate one or more tasks to available resources within the intelligent lighting device . The programming also enables the device to receive instructions and data to be processed via the communication interface perform the allocated processing task s and return processed data back up through the system for compilation at the resource manager .

The examples of utilized monitoring control and communications elements that were substantially integrated with the fixture and fairly closely coupled to the light source of the fixture. In those examples elements were provided that sensed conditions related to light source operation and could respond based on internal logic and or commands from higher level control computers e.g. to control the light source . However other configurations are contemplated for example that may not utilize the elements on the board to control the light source may provide additional output or control capability based on internal logic and or commands from higher level control computers and or to provide communication connectivity to other devices in the vicinity e.g. for communication of other devices through the network s of . In many cases where there is an installed base of light fixtures it may be practical to add a module providing monitoring and communication capabilities to each existing fixture to add the desired intelligence etc.

The example of utilizes a cobra head type device as the light fixture . The cobra head fixture is attached to a beam or arm supported by a lamp post or light pole although other mounting structures may be used. Light fixture implementations and mounting arrangements like those shown in are common in street and parking lot applications. Of course the monitoring and communication module of and may be used with other types of legacy light fixtures and or in other types of applications.

The light fixture may include any light source that is appropriate for the intended lighting application. The fixture includes a housing that encloses the light source and other elements and provides the mechanical attachment to the supporting beam . The housing also supports a transparent or diffusely transmissive cover through which the source emits light.

As in earlier examples electrical power is obtained from alternating current AC mains although the light source may be driven by a battery or other power source for a particular application. AC power lines typically extend up through the pole and the beam and connect to the fixture although such lines are omitted for ease of illustration.

The lighting device also includes a controller for controlling operation of the light source . The controller could be external but in the example the housing also encloses the controller .

Although other more sophisticated control functions may be provided by an appropriate implementation of the controller for discussion purposes we will assume that the controller simply switches power to the source N and OFF. Depending on the type of light source the controller may include power conversion circuitry such as a ballast or the like to convert the power obtained from the AC mains to an appropriate voltage current power for the particular light source .

The ON OFF switching by the controller may be based on a simple input switch commands received from an external device via the power lines or another device etc. In the example the light fixture includes a light sensing transducer such as a photocell. The transducer provides a signal that is related to the intensity of daylight reaching the transducer on the exterior of the fixture . The controller in the example turns power to the light source ON when the intensity of light detected by the transducer falls to or below a threshold e.g. to turn ON the source as night is falling. Conversely the controller turns power to the light source OFF when the intensity of light detected by the transducer reaches a threshold e.g. to turn OFF the source as the sun rises in the morning. The source is kept ON in the dark of night and the source is kept OFF during the daytime when sunlight is fairly plentiful.

In this example the cobra head light fixture is configured and operates in a conventional manner. The fixture may be an existing device that need not be modified with respect to power and operational control.

In an implementation where the fixture is a legacy device the fixture is enhanced or upgraded by the addition of the monitoring and communication module . In the example the module is mounted by attachment to an underside surface of the housing of the cobra head fixture . However the module may be added and mounted in association with the fixture at any location and or in any manner that is suitable for a particular installation and or a particular application.

Existing light fixtures such as the fixture have connection to power represented by the AC mains in the drawing. The module could be supplied power in other ways from other sources but typically the module will utilize the existing source of power available at the light fixture eliminating the need for separate power and or wiring. Hence in the example the module connects to and obtains power from the AC mains already present in the lighting device for powering the light source . Although other connections may be used e.g. depending on the location and or mounting of the module in the example the module has a connection to the AC main lines power at a point in the housing of the cobra head light fixture .

The monitoring and communication module is a layer L lighting device and communicates through a network with L layer computers and data is processed and communicated with the higher layer networks computers in the hierarchical system of . Since the networks and control computers of the hierarchy are the same as or similar to those in the earlier example those system elements are omitted from the illustration and further discussion with respect to the example of . With respect to the simplified illustration shows a network link to from the monitoring and communication module . This link may be wireless although in the example it is a hard link such as a wire or optical network cable. Any suitable link may be used.

The monitoring and communication module may perform sensor responsive monitoring and related communications only. However for at least some system installations it may be desirable to add further functional elements on or near the fixture that operate in some manner via the monitoring and communication module . In the example of the additional elements include a local wireless transceiver such as a WiFi access point. The module provides connectivity for the WiFi local wireless data transceiver to the data network used by the module . In this way the lighting device may provide a hotspot for Internet access or the like in the vicinity of the lighting device . By providing modules and WiFi access points on various street lamps around a city or enterprise campus the city or campus can offer outdoor wireless Internet service e.g. as a public service and or for use by city or enterprise personnel.

The additional or ancillary devices provided in the vicinity of the light fixture may also include any of a wide range of devices that may be controlled via communications through the network and the monitoring and communication module of the lighting device . Just by way of one example such added equipment on one or more lighting devices may be used to provide information to people in the vicinity of the fixture . Messages could be provided via the WiFi access point to user data devices or by a Bluetooth transceiver not shown for example to equipment in passing vehicles.

In the illustrated example the additionally controlled equipment includes a visible message output device such as a video monitor or digital sign board represented generally by the video screen . The data network enables communications of commands and or data to the module to control information output via the video screen . The video screen for example may provide advertising or other information of general interest or as shown by way of example the screen may be used to provide a warning of danger or an announcement of instructions to the public in the vicinity of the lighting device .

The device may also offer audible information output and for that purpose the example device also includes one or more loudspeakers . Much like for operation of the video screen the data network enables communications of commands and or data to the module to control information output via the one or more loudspeakers for any particular purpose deemed suitable by the service provider operator of the system of .

Turing now to we next consider an example of an implementation of the monitoring and communication module . The module could be implemented using an MCU based architecture similar to that used in the example of . For purposes of an illustrative example for discussion here however shows an architecture for the module that is based on a microprocessor P and bus architecture similar to that of the example of . Hence elements shown in that are the same as elements shown in the example of use the same reference numerals and are discussed again here more briefly since the reader should be familiar with or able to refer back to the earlier discussion of such elements for additional information regarding such similar elements.

The monitoring and communication module includes a power supply circuit coupled to the AC mains like the supply circuit in the example of . As in the earlier examples the module may be driven by a battery or other power source for a particular application or an AC powered device may have or connect to a back up battery or the like to supply power for some period of time in the event of an interruption of power from the AC mains .

The power supply circuit provides appropriate power to drive the various elements on the control and communication board . The power supply circuit may be mounted on the board or a separate unit as shown.

The module could use an MCU type architecture and software similar to that of the device of . However the processing and communications elements on the control communication Ctrl. Comm. board in the illustrated example include a microprocessor P which serves as the programmable central processing unit CPU of the module and thus the upgraded lighting device . The P is configured to communicate data via one or more standardized interface buses represented generally by the bus arrow . The monitoring and communication module also includes one or more storage devices which are accessible by the P via the bus . Although the module could include a hard disk drive or other type of disk drive type storage device in the example the device includes one or more memories such as ROM RAM flash memory or the like. In this example the memory or memories store executable programming for the P as well as data for processing by or resulting from processing of the P . Although not shown in this latest drawing for convenience the programming stored in the memory or memories may include an operating system OS and includes an API application programs AP for use with specific sensors and the like similar to the programming of the device discussed above with regard to . As in the examples of the programming also configures the P so that the intelligent lighting device participates in the resource sharing for distributed processing service.

The monitoring and communication module also includes a communication interface which is similar to the communication interfaces in the earlier examples in that the communication interface provides two way data communication via an external network such as a LAN. In the example of like that of the communication interface is of a type having a bus interface to enable the interface to communicate internally with the P via the bus .

In this example the monitoring and communication module also supports local wireless communication. As noted in the discussion of the specific example uses a WiFi type wireless access point transceiver for local wireless data communication with data devices in the vicinity of the intelligent lighting device . Hence the monitoring and communication module includes a second communication interface . The interface would be of a standard type configured for local communications with the particular type of device . In the example WiFi type example of these drawings the second communication interface would typically be an Ethernet type LAN interface. An Ethernet capable would provide a connection from the interface in the module to the WiFi type wireless access point . Like the interface the second communication interface is of a type having a bus interface to enable the interface to communicate internally with the P and or the interface or other elements of the board via the bus . For example under control of the P when executing programming from the memory or memories the interfaces and may provide two way data communications for devices utilizing the WiFi type wireless access point to access the Internet. The WiFi type wireless access point and the second communication interface may also enable data devices in the vicinity with appropriate access privileges to access the P e.g. to obtain monitoring data module operational information or the like and or to provide control commands and or new programming to the module .

As in the lighting devices in the earlier examples the lighting device includes external condition sensors connected to standardized couplings . In this case the couplings are part of the module and the sensors are attached to and supported together with the module . The couplings sensors could be mounted separately and connected to the module . The couplings provide physical connections electrical signal connections and any power connections that may be necessary to the external condition sensors . Physical and electrical connection aspects of each coupling will conform to relevant aspects of the applicable sensor coupling standard s . The electrical power and electrical signal communication from and or to the sensors in accordance with the electrical aspects of the applicable sensor coupling standard are provided by appropriate input output I O circuitry connected between the coupling and the bus as in the earlier example of . The external sensor I O circuitry includes a bus interface that enables the P to communicate with the respective I O interface circuit via the bus . The external sensor I O circuitry may be configured to provide the electrical interface for one two or more of the sensors via the associated coupling s .

Although not shown in this example the monitoring and communication module may include one or more sensors and associated couplings the same as or the sensors and couplings for sensing one or more conditions that relate to operation of the light source. In such a case the communication module would also include source operation related sensor I O circuitry similar to circuitry in the example of . Although the module does not control the source operation of the fixture the information obtained by such additional sensing may be reported to the higher layer control computers as it may be useful in some system applications e.g. to report on how well or poorly particular light fixtures are operating.

As noted in the discussion of the intelligent lighting device may support communication with and or control of additional or ancillary devices provided in the vicinity of the light fixture . Although a wide range of such additional or ancillary devices may be provided for various applications of the device in the context of a particular service provided by the system of the specific example provided a video screen and loudspeakers for local information output. The monitoring and communication module of the device will include one or more drivers for communication with and or control of any additional devices included in or associated with device . Hence in this example monitoring and communication module includes one or more bus connected audio and or video A V drivers . Depending on the form standard of the link to the video screen and loudspeakers the module may use a single combined driver or two separate drivers. The A V driver s may be similar to drivers used in personal computers to drive an external monitor and speakers. Each driver is of a type having a bus interface to enable the interface to communicate internally with the P and or other elements of the board via the bus . For example the module may receive commands to provide audio and or video output as well as the desired information content in packetized form via the network. The P controls the driver s to cause the video screen and loudspeakers to provide outputs and the driver s convert the received content to appropriate format signals so that the content is output in a presentable form as audio and video via the video screen and loudspeakers .

The program memory for storing executable programming often is the memory on the control and communication board either within the MCU or coupled to the P via the bus in our three examples . As outlined earlier the examples of sensors include at least some circuitry for processing the output of the transducers included as part of the sensors. In such a sensor the circuitry receives the signal from the transducer s in the sensor and produces an output via the coupling that conforms to the signaling aspects of the sensor coupling standard e.g. as a standard analog level signal on one or more pins designated for an analog connection and or as appropriately formatted data on the pins designated for data outputs. The sensor circuitry may also receive standard control signals e.g. digital command signals over designated for data inputs to the sensor. Many implementations of such sensors will include a programmable processor and some sensor configurations may include memory. If included as part of the sensor the memory may contain the applications program AP for the relevant type of sensor. In such a case the CPU may directly access the program in the sensor memory or the application program AP may be uploaded from the sensor memory to the appropriate memory on the control and communication board.

The structure and operation of the intelligent lighting devices and as outlined above were described by way of example only.

As shown by the above discussion various higher layer control computer functions and resource manager functions may be implemented on various computers connected for data communication via the components of a local or wide area network as shown in . Although special purpose devices may be used such devices also may be implemented using one or more hardware platforms intended to represent any of the various available types of general purposes programmable devices albeit with an appropriate network connection for data communication and appropriate programming to implement the functions discussed herein.

A server see e.g. for example includes a data communication interface for packet data communication via the particular type of available network. The server also includes a central processing unit CPU in the form of one or more processors for executing program instructions. The server platform typically includes an internal communication bus program storage and data storage for various data files to be processed and or communicated by the server although the server often receives programming and data via network communications. The hardware elements operating systems and programming languages of such servers are conventional in nature and it is presumed that those skilled in the art are adequately familiar therewith. Of course the server functions may be implemented in a distributed fashion on a number of similar platforms e.g. to distribute the processing load and or improve system reliability.

Also a computer configured as a server with respect to one layer or function may be configured as a client of a server in a different layer and or for a different function. For example the intelligent lighting devices may operate as client devices of server functions implemented by L computers such as A and B whereas the same L computers A and B may function as clients with respect to at least some of the higher layer computers such as resource manager or a higher layer control computer A or B. Similarly computers such as A B that function as servers with respect to computers in the lower layer may be configured as client devices with respect to higher layer computer s such or configured as servers. If more effective for a particular system application client server arrangement outlined above could be inverted so that the higher layer computers would be configured as clients with respect to server configured computers in the next lower layer. Also terminal devices often are configured as client devices.

A computer type user terminal device such as a desktop or laptop type personal computer PC similarly includes a data communication interface CPU main memory such as a random access memory RAM and one or more disc drives or other mass storage devices for storing user data and the various executable programs see . A mobile device see type user terminal may include similar elements but will typically use smaller components that also require less power to facilitate implementation in a portable form factor. The example of includes a wireless wide area network WWAN transceiver XCVR such as a 3G or 4G cellular network transceiver as well as a short range wireless transceiver such as a Bluetooth and or WiFi transceiver for wireless local area network WLAN communication. The computer of is shown by way of example as using a RAM type main memory and a hard disk drive for mass storage of data and programming whereas the mobile device of includes a flash memory and may include other miniature memory devices.

The various types of user terminal devices will also include various user input and output elements. A computer for example may include a keyboard and a cursor control selection device such as a mouse trackball joystick or touchpad and a display for visual outputs see . The mobile device example in utilizes a touchscreen type display where the display is controlled by a display driver and user touching of the screen is detected by a touch sense controller Ctrlr .

The hardware elements operating systems and programming languages of such user terminal devices also are conventional in nature and it is presumed that those skilled in the art are adequately familiar therewith.

Of note for purposes of this discussion each type of computerized server or user terminal device will store and execute programming including an operating system OS appropriate to the particular device and one or more application programs APs . The programming may also implement an application programming interface API that allows the application programs to execute through the OS on the processor s that function as the device CPU. At least some of the application programs APs are specifically written to configure the respective computerized device to implement the functions of resource manager and or the L to L layer computers of the system as described herein.

In several examples the intelligence and sensors are integrated with or attached to the fixture or other element that incorporates the light source. However for some installations there may be some separation between the fixture or other element that incorporates the light source and the electronic components that provide the intelligence and communication capabilities. Also in the examples the sensors are incorporated in the fixture or module that houses the electronic components that provide the intelligence and communication capabilities. However depending on the condition s to be sensed and or the particular installation the sensors and standardized couplings may be mounted somewhat separately and connected or otherwise coupled to the electronic components that provide the intelligence and communication capabilities.

The monitoring and communications elements may be applied to or combined with any type of light source. Hence the intelligent lighting devices may be any desirable type of indoor or outdoor lighting device signal lighting devices such as traffic lights lighted signage etc. A system like that of or may include within the one system any number of these different types of lighting devices. A system operated by a city or municipality for example might add intelligence to street lights of various types traffic lights and various types of indoor building lights in buildings used by the government. A system operated by a state or country might add intelligence to lights of the types mentioned with regard to the city in each city or town of the state or country as well as to highway lights and sign lighting along roads streets and highways between cities and towns in the jurisdiction. The broader the coverage the more varied the types of lighting devices that are likely to be included in the system.

A private enterprise running a lighting system either to monitor its own premises or to provide monitoring and the like as services to its customers might install intelligent lighting devices or add intelligent modules like that of for indoor and outdoor lighting applications as various types of lighting devices on private property. If such an enterprise sells the services to a government then the enterprise would install and operate a system like that described earlier for a city state or country. One service provider enterprise might also sell the services both to government and to private parties essentially resulting in an overall system that includes both government and private installations of the intelligent lighting devices and could combine data from all of the intelligent lighting devices.

Aspects of the distributed processing using available resources of network of intelligent lighting devices as well as aspects of the core lighting and or monitoring functions as outlined above also may be embodied in programming for the resource manager and or other components of the overall system. Program aspects of such technology may be thought of as products or articles of manufacture typically in the form of executable code and or associated data that is carried programming on or embodied in a type of machine readable medium. Storage type media include any or all of the tangible memory of the computers processors or the like or associated modules thereof such as various semiconductor memories tape drives disk drives and the like which may provide non transitory storage at any time for the programming. All or portions of the programming may at times be communicated through the networks used by the system by the public Internet or various other telecommunication networks. Such communications for example may enable loading of the programming from one computer or processor into another for example from a management server or host computer of the entity operating the networked lighting devices into the computer platform of the resource manager the control computer s and or the intelligent lighting devices. Thus another type of media that may bear the software elements includes optical electrical and electromagnetic waves such as used across physical interfaces between local devices through wired and optical landline networks and over various air links. The physical elements that carry such waves such as wired or wireless links optical links or the like also may be considered as media bearing the software. As used herein unless restricted to non transitory tangible media terms such as computer or machine readable medium refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution.

Hence a machine readable medium may take many forms including but not limited to a tangible storage medium a carrier wave medium or physical transmission medium. Non volatile storage media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as any of the storage devices in any computer s lighting devices or the like shown in the drawings. Volatile storage media include dynamic memory such as main memory of such a computer platform. Tangible transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise a bus within a computer system. Carrier wave transmission media can take the form of electric or electromagnetic signals or acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio frequency RF and infrared IR data communications. Many of these forms of computer readable media store the programming within the particular system components and or may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to a processor for execution.
