This invention relates to a method for digital rights management DRM of electronic digital documents and in particular it relates to a method for automating the management and interpretation of digital documents and their owners rights metadata for generating DRM protected contents.

DRM are increasingly applied and used to control the access and prevent unauthorized use of documents generated distributed and accessed electronically in digital file formats such as the Portable Document Format PDF . For example when a user purchases a DRM protected document from a rights management system RMS a policy is added to the document which specifies the rights purchased by or granted to the user such as the rights to view copy and or print the document. The RMS will maintain a database of the document identification ID and the associated policy which contains the ID of the user and the rights purchased by or granted to the user. After the user downloads the documents as e.g. a PDF file the user may access and view the document on the user s computer through a reader program application such as for example the Adobe Reader application.

In order to manage user access to DRM protected documents the RMS will typically install and run on its server a DRM program application for example Adobe s LifeCycle application. When a user attempts to access and view a PDF document on the user s computer the Adobe Reader will communicate with the Adobe LifeCycle application on the RMS server and transmits the document ID and the user ID to the Adobe LifeCycle . The Adobe LifeCycle will check through the RMS database and see what policy is associated with the document and under such policy what rights have been purchased by or granted to the user. If the user has the necessary rights then the user access to the PDF document will be granted. Otherwise the user access will be denied or revoked.

The description herein of the structures functions interfaces and other relevant features such as digital rights policies application programming interface API for rights management and policies etc. of existing DRM applications such as the Adobe LifeCycle may at times incorporates references or otherwise uses certain information documents and materials from readily available and accessible public information e.g. Rights Management URL http help.adobe.com en US livecycle 10.0 Overview WS92d06802c76abadb2c8525912ddcb9aad9 7ff8.html Programmatically applying policies URL http help.adobe.com en US livecycle 10.0 Overview WSb96e41f8a4ca47a9 4882aeb5131190eddba 8000.html LiveCycle ES Java API Reference URL http livedocs.adobe.com livecycle es sdkHelp programmer javadoc index.html etc.

In addition there are existing service centers for rights owners of digital contents that maintain databases of metadata associated with digital documents containing rights information related to the rights owners wishes on how the respective digital documents are used and distributed etc. which are closely related to and useful for establishing and maintaining the policies associated with such documents.

There is a need to provide a method for automating the management and interpretation of digital documents and their owners rights metadata for generating DRM protected contents.

Embodiments of the present invention provide a method for automating the management and interpretation of digital documents and their owners rights metadata for generating DRM protected contents.

Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the descriptions that follow and in part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention.

The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims thereof as well as the appended drawings.

To achieve these and or other objects as embodied and broadly described one of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention provides a method for automating the management and interpretation of digital documents and their rights metadata to generate user access of a document protected by digital rights management DRM comprising the steps of a server obtaining a digital document and its associated rights metadata the server interpreting the metadata to ascertain DRM useful information including identifications IDs of the document and its users and associated digital rights and the server generating entries for a DRM database including policies associated with the document ID and users IDs based on the ascertained DRM useful information to enable DRM protection to the document.

In a further aspect another one of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention provides a computer software program product that causes a data processing apparatus to perform the above described methods. The computer program product includes a computer usable non transitory medium e.g. memory or storage device having a computer readable program code embedded therein for controlling a data processing apparatus the computer readable program code configured to cause the data processing apparatus to execute the above described processes.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

In one aspect as summarized above an exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides method for automating the management and interpretation of digital documents and their owners rights metadata for generating DRM protected documents and their respectively associated rights management policies.

Referring to there is shown a schematic block diagram illustrating an exemplary arrangement in which various embodiments of the present invention may be implemented. The exemplary environment includes a customer or user computer or terminal which may be remotely connected to a rights management system RMS server via a network The network may include a computer network such as the Internet or other communication links.

Also connected to the network are a learning management system LMS server and a rights owners center ROC server . The RMS server the LMS server and or the ROC server may be a content provider server as well as a DRM server.

When computer network such as the Internet is utilized a customer or user may use the user computer or terminal or similar suitable devices such as a laptop computer a tablet computer an e reader or a smart phone etc. to access the network and interact with the RMS server and or the LMS server etc.

An administrator or operator may operate the RMS server to access the network and interact with the customer or user through the user computer or terminal and also interact with the LMS server and or the ROC server . Likewise an administrator or operator may operate the LMS server to access the network and interact with the customer or user through the user computer or terminal and also interact with the RMS server and or the ROC server . In addition an administrator or operator may operate the ROC server to access the network and interact with the customer or user through the user computer or terminal and also interact with the RMS server and or the LMS server .

The RMS server may be operated by for example a DRM center or service provider an educational institution a print shop etc. and generally provides online DRM services to users who wish to access DRM protected documents such as articles books booklets publications and other materials in digital formats. The RMS server may provide an integrated online service platform such as an online authentication and authorization center that processes users requests to access DRM protected documents. The RMS server has a storage which may be an internal or external storage device for storing a DRM protected documents depository and a DRM database .

The digital files of electronic documents may be provided by the LMS server as indicated by the dotted arrow A in . When an electronic document is purchased by a customer or user in a digital file the RMS server may enable appropriate DRM protection to the document such that only the user who has purchased the document may have rights to access and view the document. A policy containing the user ID and the user s rights is added to the document which also has a globally unique ID GUID to enable DRM protection to the document. The DRM protected documents are stored in file depository and their associated policies may be found in DRM database . A customer or user who has purchased or otherwise granted rights to a DRM protected document may download a digital copy of the DRM protected document from the DRM protected document depository to the customer or user s computer as indicated by the dotted arrow B in . When the RMS server subsequently receives a customer or user request which contains the GUID of the document and the ID of the customer or user for accessing a DRM protected document as indicated by the dotted arrow C in the RMS server will search through the DRM database by looking up the document GUID or the user ID and check what policy is associated with the document and or user in order to determine whether the requesting customer or user has the appropriate rights to access the document. Based on the result of the determination the RMS responds to the customer or user s request by either granting or denying the requested access to the document as indicated by the dotted arrow C in .

The LMS server may be operated by for example an educational institution a library a bookstore or any digital content providers etc. and generally provides online electronic documents books booklets publications and other materials in digital files. The LMS server and the RMS server may be the same server operated by a same entity . The LMS server may provide an integrated online service platform such as an online course or web store that allows customers or users to search access upload or download and purchase electronic documents stored as digital files in its internal or the external storage .

The ROC server may be operated by a rights owners center or service provider and generally provides a database or information source of documents owners rights such as copyrights . Such information may be provided in the form of metadata associated with digital documents. For example the metadata associated with a course book may include title author publisher International Standard Book Number ISBN copyrights royalty price etc. In a sense the metadata contains the course book owner s wishes on how the course book may be used and or distributed. The ROC server has an internal or external storage for storing a metadata database .

The rights information contained in the metadata may be very useful for establishing and or maintaining the policies respectively associated with the DRM protected documents. The ROC server may provide the metadata to the RMS server or the RMS server may retrieve such metadata from the ROC server as indicated by the dotted arrow D in . The RMS server can use the metadata to generate and or update the policies associated with the DRM protected documents. As will be described in more detail below some embodiments of the present invention provide a method for automatically interpret of digital documents and their owners rights metadata to generate and or update the policies respectively associated with DRM protected documents.

It is understood that the server may be any suitable computer or computer system. Preferably for use for example as the RMS server the LMS server and the ROC server the server is a commercial server. However for use by a customer or a member of the general public the server may be a desktop computer a laptop computer a notebook computer a netbook computer a tablet computer a hand held portable computer or electronic device a smart phone or any suitable data processing apparatus that has suitable data processing capabilities.

Referring to and in conjunction with there is shown a flow chart diagram illustrating an exemplary process in accordance with to one of the embodiments of the present invention for automating the management and interpretation of digital documents and their owners rights metadata for generating DRM protected documents and their associated rights management policies.

The process begins at step S wherein the RMS server obtains a digital document from the LMS server as indicated by the dotted arrow A in as well as metadata associated with such document from the ROC server as indicated by the dotted arrow D in . This step may include a sub step S where the digital document is transmitted from the LMS server to the RMS server either by the LMS server providing the document to the RMS server or by the RMS server retrieving from the LMS server and also a sub step S where metadata of the digital document is transmitted from the ROC server to the RMS server either by the ROC server providing the metadata of the document to the RMS server or by the RMS server retrieving from the ROC server . It is understood that the digital document and its metadata may be obtained or retrieved from the same server such as the LMS server or the ROC server alone.

The digital document may be downloaded to the RMS server from the file storage of the LMS server or uploaded by a user from the user computer to the RMS server or otherwise retrieved from a third party server not shown e.g. by following a Universal Resource Locater URL provided by the user or the RMS service. For example if a digital course book pack or booklet is to be generated from the compilation of several digital files these digital files may be gathered from various sources.

The RMS server needs to search in and retrieve the metadata associated with the digital document from the metadata database of the ROC server . Sometimes the digital document comes with certain metadata e.g. title author publisher ISBN etc. which have already been associated with the digital document but oftentimes additional metadata e.g. copyrights owners royalty and pricing information may still need to be obtained from the ROC server .

Once the RMS server gathered the needed digital document and its associated metadata at step S the metadata will be interpreted for generating DRM policies for the digital document at step S. The interpretation of metadata is automated to yield a specific format of rights documents that the rights management system can then use to create specific rights for the document to be DRM protected with the original intent of the author creator submitter of the document some of them exemplified in the following descriptions. For example each policy may include a document GUID which may be generated from relevant metadata such as title author publisher ISBN etc. of the document. As one of the examples of the metadata interpretation the metadata is used to provide information needed for the policy database which often requires specific data format so part of the interpretation step S is to convert the information obtained from the metadata into data items that can be saved and used for the policy database. Another example of the metadata interpretation is that if the metadata indicates that a copyrights royalty is paid for printing e.g. reproducing in hardcopies a document then it may be interpreted as the print right of the document is granted by its owner so the policies associated with the document may include right to print the document.

In addition the interpretation process may add further enhancement or limitation to the DRM application based on certain particular rights contained in the metadata. For example the metadata may contain calendar or scheduler based right such as a document of a course material may be viewed on every Tuesday because e.g. the course is offered on every Tuesday . However the DRM application or its policy formats may not readily have the ability to define or limit the right in that manner as the DRM application may only allow an input of a start time and an end time once between which the right may be effective . In such situations the interpretation process according to the embodiments of the present invention may offer a solution by adding removing the view right to the course document repeatedly on a weekly basis. For example the view right to the document may be added at midnight Monday night and revoked at midnight Tuesday night and then added back at midnight next Monday night and revoked again at midnight next Tuesday night and so on. In more detail during the interpretation the RMS server generates an adding removing schedule of view right based on the calendar scheduled based right and stores the generated schedule as a file or an entry of a file in a storage area which can be an area separately managed from the DRM database . In one exemplary embodiment the RMS server may monitor the stored schedule to manipulate the DRM policy of the document stored in the database in later in accordance with the software module of the interpretation process or a separate software module installed in the RMS server .

Referring back to the interpretation process of from the metadata interpreted at step S DRM policies for the document are generated at step S. Each policy may include for example certain digital rights to access and use a document e.g. view copy or print the document. In the DRM database each policy is associated with a document and users and the users and the document may also be cross associated. For example in the DRM database a document GUID may be associated with a policy ID and a user ID allowing the user to view the document or a user ID may be associated with a document GUID and another policy ID allowing the user to view and print the document or still another policy ID may be associated with a document GUID and a user ID allowing the user to view and copy the document.

In addition at step S it may be necessary to obtain additional copyrights information or metadata from the ROC server . For example once a course booklet is compiled from several individual articles copyrights information e.g. permission royalty etc. may be needed for the compilation even though copyrights information for each of the individual articles has been obtained. If this is the case then at step S additional copyrights information or metadata may be provided by or retrieved from the ROC server . This will ensure that the compiled booklet is also copyrights protected.

As a result of the above steps DRM protection to the digital document is enabled which means that the digital document stored in file depository of the RMS server are now associated with respective DRM policy IDs and user IDs which are stored for example in the DRM database of the RMS server . In a sense this also means that a DRM protected document has been generated from the originally unprotected digital document. The DRM protected document is ready for purchase by users at step S. When a user purchases or otherwise obtains rights to the DRM protected document it may be downloaded to the user s computer and stored in a memory or storage device of the user computer at step S.

When the user subsequently needs to access the DRM protected document the user typically tries to open the DRM protected document by using a reader application software program installed on and executed by the user s computer . For example if the DRM protected document is in PDF then the reader application may be the Adobe Reader program. The reader application will initiate communication with a DRM application software program installed on and executed at the RMS server. For example for documents in PDF the DRM application may be the Adobe LifeCycle program. As mentioned earlier the description and or reference herein of the structures functions interfaces and other relevant features such as DRM policies and API of existing DRM applications such as Adobe LifeCycle are from readily available and accessible public information documents and materials e.g. Rights Management URL http help.adobe.com en US livecycle 10.0 Overview WS92d06802c76abadb2c8525912ddcb9aad9 7ff8.html Programmatically applying policies URL http help.adobe.com en US livecycle 10.0 Overview WSb96e41f8a4ca47a9 4882aeb5131190eddba 8000.html LiveCycle ES Java API Reference URL http livedocs.adobe.com livecycle es sdkHelp programmer javadoc index.html etc.

Referring back to and in conjunction with at step S the user computer sends an access request to RMS server for approval as indicated by the dotted arrow C in . The request transmitted from the user computer to RMS server will provide the document GUID and the user ID. When the RMS server receives the request at step S it will search its DRM database at step S to check whether the user has the necessary rights to the DRM protected document. The search may look up the document GUID in the database and find its associated policy ID and user ID or may look up the user ID to find its associated document GUID and policy ID. From the result of the search a determination of the user s rights to the DRM protected document can be made at step S. For example if no user ID is found to be associated with the document GUID then it can be determined that the user does not have any right to access and use the DRM protected document. If the user ID is found to be associated with the document GUID and a policy containing the rights to view and print the document is also found to be associated with the document GUID then it can be determined that the user has rights to view and print the DRM protected document.

As step S the RMS server transmits the result of this determination to the user computer as indicated by the dotted arrow C in . At step S the user can access the DRM protected document if the user s request is granted. For example if the user is determined to have rights to view and print the DRM protected document then the reader program on the user computer will open the DRM protected document for the user to view and will also allow the user to print the DRM protected document when the user desires. On the other hand if the user s request is denied then the reader program on the user computer will not open the DRM protected document but rather may inform the user that the request is denied and may further inform the user what steps may be taken to purchase or otherwise obtain rights to the DRM protected document.

As mentioned above during the process of enabling DRM protection to the digital documents additional information may be generated. For example when a course booklet is compiled additional data items or information may be created as a result of the compilation process. Examples of such additional data items or information may include course booklet cover information e.g. title compiler year semester in use etc. course booklet compiler information e.g. login registration username password contact information etc. LMS information e.g. course name serial sequential number institution department distribution information e.g. print e distribution delivery rights channel based on institution etc. granted rights information e.g. data of the users who have purchased rights to the booklet such as login registration username password contact information etc. . Such data information may be needed by the rights owners for their records and operation. So at step S the RMS server transmits the newly generated data information to the ROC server and at step S the ROC server may use the data information to update its metadata database .

The dotted boxes in indicate typically what steps are performed by or at which system. For example the dotted box on the middle indicates that steps S S S S S S S S and S are typically performed by the RMS server the dotted box on the upper left indicates that step S is typically performed by the LMS server the dotted box on the lower left indicates that steps S S and S are typically performed by the user computer and the dotted box on the right indicates that Steps S S and S are typically performed by the ROC server . However it is understood that alternative arrangement may be utilized to perform these steps.

Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the descriptions that follow and in part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims thereof as well as the appended drawings.

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modification and variations can be made in the method and related apparatus of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus it is intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations that come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
