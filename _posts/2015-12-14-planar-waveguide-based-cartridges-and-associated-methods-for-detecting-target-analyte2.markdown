This invention was made with government support under grant AI068543 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present disclosure pertains to diagnosis of disease. More particularly the disclosure relates to the manufacture and use of certain systems for rapid detection of multiple disease markers. A system for detection of analytes including those identified for immunodiagnostic applications is disclosed. The system includes a cartridge containing an optical waveguide and a reader instrument containing an imaging system and a light source for reading light signals from an analyte containing cartridge.

Early detection of a disease is often critical for successful control and treatment of the disease. Providing accurate high speed and low cost blood analysis infection diagnosis pathogen detection or other biological or chemical analyte detection remains a major challenge for health providers and hazardous response teams. This challenge is particularly acute for point of care POC environments where extreme or highly variable environmental conditions are common testers may have limited training and practice of test procedures may be significantly different between testers. Such variation is of particular concern for tests offering quantitative or semi quantitative results which can critically depend on standardized sample preparation and readout.

A case in point is the diagnosis of infectious diseases such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome AIDS which may be spread rapidly among the population if the infection is not detected early. Partly because of their compromised immune system AIDS patients are usually more vulnerable to a number of co infections which account for a significant fraction of human immunodeficiency virus HIV associated morbidity and mortality. Substantial amount of time and resources have been invested in developing a host of HIV screening and diagnostic techniques. However recurring challenges remain as to how to rapidly identify HIV infection and the various co infections. Existing diagnoses for multiple co infections typically require use of a number of different serological diagnostic tools which render the tests too costly and complex for a POC setting. This problem is exacerbated in countries where resources are limited and HIV prevalence is high.

As an example the ability to diagnose HIV and opportunistic infections simultaneously at the point of care should lead to more effective therapy decisions and improved linkage to care. System utility is demonstrated for a multiplexed HIV 1 syphilis hepatitis C virus HCV assay using a combination of clinical sample collections. The ability of the disclosed system to provide quantitative read outs may also lead to more effective data sharing among the various care providers commercial vendors government entities and non profit organizations.

Multi analyte testing for AIDS and its co infections is important for the development of individualized management of HIV 1 infections and its common co pathogens. At the time of HIV diagnosis the standard of care may include determination of common co infections such as HCV hepatitis B virus HBV causative organism of syphilis and cytomegalovirus CMV . Co infection information may be used for treatment as in the case of vaccinations as in the case of HBV and prophylaxis in the case of . The multiplexed system described here has the potential to offer a combination of critical tests which detect multiple pathogens in a single assay.

Increased access to anti retroviral therapy in resource limited settings and in particular sub Saharan Africa has had a major impact on morbidity and mortality from AIDS. By the end of 2009 over 5 million people living in low and middle income countries were receiving anti retroviral therapy. By most estimates even before treatment recommendations were revised to encourage the initiation of antiretroviral therapy at higher CD4 cell counts contemporary anti retroviral therapy was only reaching 30 40 of those needing therapy. In all likelihood there will continue to be a substantial gap between the number of people needing antiretroviral therapy and the resources available to treat them. In order to maximize the benefits from the resources available it is essential that anti retroviral therapy be delivered as efficiently as possible to those most likely to benefit. A multiplex platform that provides rapid and accurate information about critical co infections may help prioritize those who should be treated immediately and may also provide guidance on anti retroviral drug selection.

In addition to anti viral treatment decisions based on improved co infection information the ability to simultaneously detect markers for multiple pathogens in the same sample offers diagnostic advantages. It is well known that HIV infection complicates HCV serodiagnosis. An HIV HCV co infection test may help identify infections that were too difficult to characterize at the time of initial screening.

One widely adopted solution for use in primarily qualitative testing i.e. identifying whether or not an analyte is present at some threshold value is commonly referred to as a rapid diagnostic test RDT . While a RDT can provide the advantages of low per test cost simple operation and minimal or no required instrumentation there are also significant limitations. RDTs are often configured to test for only a single analyte so multiple devices are needed to support co infection testing which can be prohibitive from test cost personnel training and results management perspectives. Many RDTs are based on chromatographic or lateral flow technology in which whole or processed blood or other sample such as urine is introduced into an absorbent test strip that contains an immunologically responsive analyte detector. If the analyte is present a visually perceptible color change in a portion of the test strip can indicate presence of the analyte and in certain conditions user or automated review of the color change can provide a semi quantitative understanding of analyte concentration. However such RDTs are limited by the subjective nature of result interpretation by visual inspection and a narrow read time window both of which require rigorous staff training and quality assurance for result accuracy. Although RDTs that do not require read out instrumentation can present cost and simplicity advantages they also present disadvantages including lack of a link to electronic medical records or laboratory information management system no automated quality control no untrained user lockout and no expired lot rejection.

RDTs have had an enormous impact on infectious disease screening programs worldwide over the last decade and are the backbone of HIV screening efforts. Some in the global health field argue against any type of instrumented test in a point of care setting. Arguments against instrumentation hinge primarily on instrument procurement costs and servicing requirements that are not a factor in visually read tests. However while RDTs provide the advantages of low cost simple operation and no required instrumentation RDTs also have significant limitations. For example most RDTs require extensive personnel training and lack the capability to be linked to electronic medical records. The nuance of switching between different RDT protocols is also a challenge for care providers.

While more sophisticated analyte detection systems are available they can be bulky costly and require extensive training to calibrate operate and maintain. For example POC analyte testing machines that use microfluidics have been disclosed but many such machines have large numbers of moving parts and complicated structures including micropumps or pressure sources require expensive and difficult sample preparation and calibration or have low throughput. In addition such systems can require multiple sensors lasers or highly skilled technical operators all of which greatly increase the operation cost of the analyte detection system.

In an embodiment a cartridge for processing a sample includes a planar waveguide with upper and lower planar surfaces defining an optical axis therebetween wherein the optical axis is perpendicular to a normal vector of the upper and lower planar surfaces and the upper planar surface has a plurality of capture molecules bound thereto. The cartridge further includes a lens portion coupled to the planar waveguide for focusing and refracting a light beam propagating parallel to but offset from the optical axis such that the light beam couples into the planar waveguide and propagates therein along the optical axis at a non zero internal propagation angle relative to the upper planar surface. In addition the cartridge includes a sample chamber for positioning the sample in contact with the plurality of capture molecules such that a target analyte of the sample is detectable through a an assay involving the target analyte and the capture molecules and b evanescent illumination of the assay using the light beam within the planar waveguide.

In an embodiment a method for detecting a target analyte in a cartridge includes receiving a light beam propagating parallel to but offset from an optical axis for light propagation within a planar waveguide between upper and lower planar surfaces of the planar waveguide wherein the offset is in a direction parallel to normal vector of the lower planar surface. The method further includes refracting and focusing the light beam to couple the light beam into the planar waveguide such that the light beam is incident on the upper planar surface of the planar waveguide at a non zero internal propagation angle relative to the upper planar surface. Additionally the method includes evanescently illuminating with the light beam in the planar waveguide a plurality of capture molecules bound to the upper planar surface within a sample chamber such that a target analyte of a sample interacting with the plurality of capture molecules produces a light signal.

In an embodiment the refractive volume includes a lens. The planar waveguide may be made of a plastic material that is optically transparent and additionally exhibits low auto fluorescence. Examples of such optically transparent plastic material include but are not limited to cyclic olefin polymer cyclic olefin copolymer polyolefin polystyrene acrylic polymethylmethacrylate polycarbonate and combinations thereof.

In another aspect the planar waveguide may have at least two surfaces a first surface and a second surface wherein the second surface is opposite from the first surface. The plurality of capture molecules may be immobilized to the first surface of the planar waveguide. The device may have an inlet port for addition of sample onto the device and an outlet port for letting out the sample. The device and the planar waveguide may be configured such that after the sample is loaded onto the device through the inlet port the first surface is in contact with the sample.

In another embodiment the device has a channel to allow the sample to flow therein and to be in contact with the reaction sites and the control sites. The device may further contain a configuration for allowing the sample to be in contact with all reaction sites and control sites.

In another aspect at least a portion of the first surface may be modified to improve attachment of the capture molecules to the first surface. In another aspect the modification may provide means for covalently attaching capture molecules to the first surface exemplary attachment chemistries include but are not limited to organosilane or polymer formulations providing epoxy groups aldehyde groups amine groups thiol groups thiol reactive groups or succinimidyl esters. In another aspect the modification may provide a means for immobilizing capture molecules via hydrophobic interactions exemplary attachment chemistries include self assembled monolayers with long chain hyrdocarbons.

In another aspect the modification helps provide a water contact angle of between 60 and 75 degrees on the modified first surface. The modification of the first surface may be performed by using a number of different processes such as plasma activation chemical vapor deposition liquid phase deposition or surface polymerization of an activation chemistry. Many different chemicals may be used to modify the first surface of the planar waveguide. Examples of such chemicals include but are not limited to organosilane alkoxysilane chlorosilane alkylsilane epoxy silane glycidoxy silane aldehyde silane aminosilane or combination thereof. Specifically glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane or glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane may be used as the modifying chemicals. Example polymer surface modifications include those based on polyethylene glycols acrylate polymers dextran and combinations thereof.

The term capture molecule is used here to describe any of a variety of molecules that could be attached to the first surface for performing a useful assay. The capture molecules may be a peptide a polypeptide a protein an antibody an antigen an aptamer a polysaccharide a sugar molecule a carbohydrate a lipid an oligonucleotide a polynucleotide a synthetic molecule an inorganic molecule an organic molecule and combinations thereof. The terms polypeptide peptide and protein may be used interchangeably in this disclosure. The terms oligonucleotide and polynucleotide may also be used interchangeably in this disclosure. For the purposes of this disclosure when referring to a polypeptide or a polynucleotide molecule it is intended that either the full length molecule or a fragment of the full length molecule may be used. Moreover any mutated forms of a polypeptide antigen or a DNA molecule encoding such a polypeptide are also within the scope of the disclosure if such mutation or mutations do not reside within any epitope of the polypeptide antigen or if the mutation or mutations do not substantially decrease the binding affinity between the polypeptide antigen and a specific antibody against the polypeptide or a fragment thereof. Plural or singular forms of a noun may be used interchangeably unless otherwise specified in the disclosure. Capture molecules may also be in the form of a molecular mixture. For example a cell lysate preparation containing a mixture of molecules may be attached to the first surface.

In one embodiment the first surface of the planar waveguide may contain at least one reaction site e.g. spot or stripe wherein each of the reaction site may be formed by printing i.e. spotting or depositing a composition onto the first surface. In another embodiment the first surface of the planar waveguide may have an array also referred to as a microarray of two or more reaction sites. In another aspect the first surface may contain an array having four five six seven eight nine or ten reaction sites. In yet another aspect the first surface may contain an array having between two and thirty reaction sites. In yet another aspect the first surface may contain an array having between two and fifty reaction sites. In yet another aspect the first surface may contain an array having between two and three hundred reaction sites. Each of reaction sites on the array may be formed by printing a composition onto the first surface. Each composition that is printed onto each reaction site may contain one or more capture molecules. Typically different reaction sites have different capture molecules. However for the purpose of having replicate readings multiple reaction sites may contain identical capture molecules.

For the purposes of this disclosure the method and system described are based on assays that use fluorescence signal to quantify analyte s present in a sample. However the embodiments described herein may be applicable to assays beyond fluorescence based signal transduction. In addition the method and system may also be compatible with luminescence phosphorescence and light scattering based signal transduction. In exemplary embodiments excitable tags may be used as detection reagents in assay protocols. Exemplary tags include but are not limited to fluorescent organic dyes such as fluorescein rhodamine and commercial derivatives such as Alexa dyes Life Technologies and DyLight products fluorescent proteins such as R phycoerythrin and commercial analogs such as SureLight P3 luminescent lanthanide chelates luminescent semiconductor nanoparticles e.g. quantum dots phosphorescent materials and microparticles that incorporate these excitable tags. For the purposes of this disclosure the term fluorophore is used generically to describe all of the excitable tags listed above.

Additionally the first surface of the waveguide may include a pre formed feature to serve as for instance a reaction site such as an analyte detection site a negative control site a positive control site or a reference site. When two or more reaction sites are present the array may be arranged such that the reaction sites are spread out on the first surface in rows and columns with the distance between neighboring column and the distance between neighboring rows being relatively constant within the array.

It is to be recognized that each device may have one or more arrays and certain reaction sites may be placed on the same surface as the array but outside the array. For instance certain reference sites or fiducial features for positioning purpose may be placed outside of the normal array arrangement. In another aspect the first surface of the planar waveguide may also contain a reference site for calibrating the intensity or uniformity of the light provided into the planar waveguide from the light source. The reference site may contain an excitable molecule immobilized on a portion of the first surface and may be located proximal to the array or being part of the array. In another aspect the reference site may be formed during execution of an assay. By way of example a human IgG spot printed on the first surface may serve as the reference site in an assay that uses fluorophore labeled anti human IgG as the detection reagent.

In another embodiment of the disclosure the array on the first surface of the waveguide contains one or more negative control sites wherein at least one of such negative control site is formed by printing onto the first surface a composition that does not contain any molecule that detectably binds to any analyte in the sample. In one aspect a composition containing only the buffer or solvent may be printed onto the first surface to form a negative control site. In another aspect a negative control site may contain a molecule that is known to not interact with the analytes of interest in the sample. For instance for the detection of antibodies against HIV in a human blood sample a composition that does not contain any molecules known to interact with the human anti HIV antibodies directly or indirectly may be printed onto the first surface to form one of the negative control sites. Note that the composition for negative control sites also shall not contain molecules that interact with the detection reagent. In an example at least one of the negative control sites is located at a proximal end of the array that is closest to the inlet port.

In another embodiment of the disclosure the array on the first surface of the waveguide contains one or more positive control sites wherein at least one of such positive control site is formed by printing onto the first surface a composition that contains a molecule that detectably binds to one or more analytes in the sample. In one aspect the composition for the positive control site contains a molecule that consistently binds to one or more analytes in the sample. In another aspect the composition for the positive control site contains a molecule that binds to the detection reagent. In another aspect at least one of the positive control sites contains an antibody against human immunoglobulin. In yet another aspect at least one of the positive control sites contains a human immunoglobulin. In still another aspect at least one of the positive control sites contains a protein labeled with an excitable tag. In an embodiment at least one of the positive control sites is located at a distal end of the array farthest from the inlet port.

In another embodiment the array may have two or more reaction sites and some of the reaction sites may contain identical molecules selected from the plurality of capture molecules for purpose of duplicate reading. In one aspect each of the reaction sites may contain a different capture molecule selected from the plurality of capture molecules.

In another embodiment the plurality of capture molecules is a plurality of antigens wherein the antigens are peptides polypeptides or proteins. In one aspect each of the different molecules on different reaction sites may bind different markers characteristic of different diseases. Thus the presence or absence of signals from each reaction site may be indicative of whether or not the sample is positive for the particular disease. For example one reaction site may carry an HIV antigen that binds to anti HIV antibodies while another reaction site may carry a HCV antigen that binds to anti HCV antibodies. Signals from these two reaction sites may be indicative of whether or not the sample contains antibodies against HIV and HCV respectively.

Alternatively because one disease pathogen or other indication may have more than one marker different reaction sites may carry capture molecules that bind to these different markers characteristic of the same disease pathogen or indication. For instance glycoprotein 41 gp41 p24 gp31 gp160 and gp36 for HIV 2 are antigens commonly used in HIV 1 2 antibody assay. It may also be beneficial to have an array of reaction sites with one some or all of the HIV 1 antigens that are commonly used in the HIV 1 Western Blot p17 P24 p31 gp41 p51 p55 p66 gp120 and gp160. Subtype specific antigens such as gp41 Type O may also be applicable. Array reaction sites may carry antigens individually e.g. one site carrying gp41 another site carrying gp120 etc. Alternatively a reaction site may contain a combination of antigens such as one site carrying both gp41 and gp160. Signals from reaction sites may be detected and processed to indicate whether or not the sample contains anti HIV antibodies. Reaction site signals may be further processed to define overall reactivity status for HIV infection.

In another embodiment reaction site analysis algorithms may be defined within the assay system to define sample status. For example an analysis algorithm may be used to render a determination of reactive or positive for a given disease pathogen or indication if any one of a number of reaction sites yields a signal. Alternatively the analysis algorithm may use some combination of signals on multiple reaction sites to render a determination of reactive or positive for a given disease pathogen or indication.

In one aspect signal from each reaction site may be treated as a binary value such as positive or negative relative to a pre defined cutoff value of measured signal. In another aspect signal from each reaction site may be measured as a quantitative signal value.

In another embodiment the analysis algorithm for determining sample status for a particular disease pathogen or indication may be predefined in the firmware or software associated with the reader instrument. In another embodiment the analysis algorithm may be configurable according to information carried on a given assay device e.g. cartridge . For example a cartridge may carry information e.g. in a barcode affixed to the cartridge that defines the specific analysis algorithm to be used for that given cartridge. In another embodiment a given cartridge may carry a code for selecting a particular analysis algorithm that has been pre loaded on the reader instrument software.

In another embodiment the analysis algorithm may be based on a reactivity signature or pattern that has been defined by running multiple known samples on the reaction site array. For example a statistically significant collection of known samples may be considered a training set for defining an analysis algorithm.

In another embodiment the disclosed system may be used to detect infections by at least one microorganism e.g. virus bacteria fungus parasite etc. wherein the microorganism is the causative agent of at least one disease selected from the group consisting of AIDS syphilis hepatitis tuberculosis and combination thereof. In one aspect two or more antigens from the same microorganism may be immobilized to the first surface of the waveguide to form two or more reaction sites. The immobilized antigen may bind to antibodies produced by the host animal or human against the same antigen. Therefore signals from the two or more reaction sites may indicate the presence or absence of infection by the one microorganism. In another aspect two or more antigens from different microorganisms may be immobilized to the first surface of the waveguide to form two or more reaction sites. Signals from the two or more reaction sites may indicate the presence or absence of infection by the different microorganisms.

In another embodiment the first surface may contain two or more reaction sites and at least one of the reaction sites may contain an immobilized antigen while at least another one of the reaction sites may contain an immobilized antibody. The presence or absence of detectable interactions between the antigen and analytes in the sample may indicate whether or not the sample contains a detectable amount of an antibody against this antigen. In the meantime presence or absence of detectable interactions between the antibody and analytes in the sample may indicate whether or not the sample contains a detectable amount of an antigen that may bind the immobilized antibody. The combination of antigen and antibody in the same array may provide an assay with improved levels of accuracy and confidence. For example it may be beneficial in HIV 1 2 screening assays to measure both antibody reactivity and the presence or absence of viral antigen such as p24 antigen. Antibody reactivity may be used to identify individuals who have seroconverted to HIV infection. Viral antigen detection may be used to identify individuals in the pre seroconversion window phase of HIV infection also called the acute infection phase.

In another embodiment the array may have two or more reaction sites and each of the two or more reaction sites contains a different capture molecule selected from the group consisting of gp41 p24 gp120 and gp160 antigens of HIV 1 gp36 gp120 and p24 antigens of HIV 2 antibodies against p24 for HIV p17 p47 p15 and TmpA of core antigen NS3 NS4 and NS5 of HCV and fragments thereof antibodies against HCV antigens antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg core and surface antigens of HBV antigens of human herpes virus 8 HHV 8 and combinations thereof.

In another embodiment the array on the first surface contains a first reaction site and a second reaction site wherein the first reaction site contains gp41 antigen of HIV 1 while the second reaction site contains p24 antigen of HIV 1. In another embodiment the array further contains a third reaction site and a fourth reaction site wherein the third reaction site contains p47 of and the fourth reaction site contains p17 of . In yet another embodiment the array further contains a fifth reaction site and a sixth reaction site wherein the fifth reaction site contains HCV core antigen and the sixth reaction site contains an HCV antigen selected from the group consisting of HCV NS3 HCV NS4 HCV NS5 and combinations thereof. In another embodiment the array may contain at least five reaction sites wherein each of the reaction sites contains a different capture molecule selected from the group consisting of p41 antigen of HIV 1 p24 antigen of HIV 1 p17 of p47 of HCV core antigen and combination thereof.

As an alternative to visually read RDTs a disposable cartridge designed to be inserted into a reader instrument that provides qualitative semi quantitative or fully quantitative results may be considered. Such a cartridge may have a defined channel volume through which a sample fluid can flow and in certain embodiments analyte presence may be determined by changes in fluorescent properties of reaction in the cartridge. The cartridge may be further configured to support identifying indicia capable of being read in the same field of view as the fluorescent analyte sites. The depth of field of the reader instrument may be such that the fluorescent sites and identifying indicia e.g. bar codes or alphanumeric symbols may be simultaneously read.

Cartridge may include a channel optionally with an inlet port and an outlet port and may be formed as a single piece or separate pieces that cooperate to define the channel. Cartridge may optionally include multiple parallel channels. For example multiple channels on the same cartridge may be used to run replicates of the same assay on multiple samples providing increased throughput. Alternatively multiple channels on the same cartridge may be used to run different assays on the same sample.

Reader instrument may be configured such that a user is protected from exposure to any potentially dangerous light that is emitted by laser illumination module when a cartridge is fully inserted into an aperture or slot in housing partially inserted or not inserted at all. Reader instrument may include an interlock switch that electrically disengages light emitting circuitry when cartridge is not inserted or only partially inserted. Reader instrument may be fitted with an opaque door that automatically closes when cartridge is fully extracted from actuator providing a light tight enclosure. Additional baffles and light blocking elements incorporated into reader instrument or cartridge may further minimize the amount of stray light power that is emitted external to housing when cartridge is inserted.

An imaging system is used to capture images of light signal emitted from assay region . A sensor such as a two dimensional sensor charge coupled device CCD or complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS sensor as well as any imaging optics components may be rigidly mounted with respect to laser illumination module and to housing . Imaging system may also include one or more imaging optics such as lenses refractive or reflective elements phase modifying elements and spatial or intensity patterning elements having both sufficient field of view and depth of field to simultaneously image the entire assay region. Alternatively a variable focus lens may be used so as to enable adjustable focusing on various regions. In certain embodiments as shown in imaging system may be oriented with its optical axis perpendicular to the plane of planar waveguide . Furthermore imaging system may be configured so as to image assay region through planar waveguide . As later described in certain embodiments the field of view may be even larger than detection region allowing capture of fiducial markers cartridge tracking information or other desirable cartridge identification indicia e.g. barcodes .

In the illustrated embodiment planar waveguide is capable of transmitting laser light directly or through total internal reflection to a detection region . In one embodiment cartridge incorporates a microarray of biomarkers such as printed proteins e.g. natural purified or recombinant antigens antibodies and or controls in a fluidic channel and is capable of providing multiple parallel fluorescence assay results from a single sample. Cartridge may include a fluidic channel optionally with an inlet port and an outlet port and may be formed as a single piece or separate pieces that cooperate to define a channel.

For portable or semi portable operation a lightweight dimensionally small and low material cost disposable cartridge is useful. The following describes various aspects of one embodiment of such a portable cartridge that is useful in conjunction with a reader instrument such as that described in co pending U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61 468 659 entitled Improved Cartridge Reader filed 29 Mar. 2011 which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A smaller or larger cartridge or cartridges with other design elements may also be contemplated.

A cartridge is illustrated in perspective view in top view in in cross side view in and in bottom view in . As may be seen in a cartridge includes an upper piece in snap fit press fit weld glue or other attachment with a matching lower piece . Textured grooves in both upper and lower pieces and respectively improve ease of handling. Cartridge may be formed from a low cost moldable plastic that may be color coded or marked with tracking indicia. In certain embodiments adhesive strips with alphanumeric labeling one or two dimensional bar codes or other tracking indicia may be affixed to cartridge . Upper piece may be further configured to accommodate an inlet port . As seen in a window in lower piece allows imaging access therethrough.

A waveguide with an integral lens as shown in is held within cartridge . As visible in a flow plate with a sample inlet port rails and an outlet port is mated with waveguide using laser welding chemical or adhesive attachment or other suitable fluid tight mating arrangement to form an assembly . Assembly may be positioned within cartridge and may further incorporate a wick pad for waste containment as seen in top and bottom exploded perspective views of . A planar surface of waveguide and a groove in flow plate cooperate to define an empty fluidic channel for receiving sample therein. Advantageously use of waveguide that is separately manufactured from upper piece and lower piece may allow for reduced overall cost and or increased design flexibility than embodiments in which the waveguide and peripherals e.g. clamshell or equivalent protective elements are fabricated together.

The components include a variety of features such as notches and protrusions to assist with the alignment of the components with respect to each other. These alignment features may be modified from those shown in while remaining within the spirit of the present disclosure.

In certain embodiments the fluidic channel with inlet and outlet ports in the cartridge may be formed when molded components are bonded together. Exemplary bonding methods include but are not limited to laser welding ultrasonic welding solvent bonding other chemical bonding methods or adhesive bonding. In another embodiment the fluidic channel may be formed when an appropriately cut adhesive gasket joins two cartridge components as shown in . The size of the resulting fluidic channel may be partly determined for example by the width of a cut out for sample containment made in the gasket as well as the thickness of the gasket itself.

Usefulness and cost effectiveness of a cartridge may be improved by simplifying cartridge construction. In certain embodiments the cartridge may be constructed by thermally fusing adhesively attaching welding or otherwise connecting a planar waveguide with a hermetically sealed channel defining piece that allows a sample fluid into a channel through an inlet.

In certain embodiments the cartridge may be marked with identifying indicia such as cartridge parameters cartridge type print geometry and layout print lot serial number and expiration date either by direct printing onto the planar waveguide or by attachment of a sticker or the like printed with identifying information. This marking allows for accurate cartridge identification and tracking based on for example one or two dimensional bar codes RFID readers or other available tracking technologies. In other embodiments cartridge affixed RFID or other tracking technology may be contemplated.

In certain embodiments the cartridge may include a location for accepting sample specific identifying information. In another embodiment the cartridge may have a region for accepting hand written identifying information. In another embodiment the cartridge may have a region for applying a label including barcodes or other sample specific labels for identifying the sample being processed on that cartridge.

To further improve usability the cartridge may be further enclosed in a handling shell. The handling shell may be for example a low cost plastic clamshell composed of clamshell elements that snap fit together. The clamshell may be an opaque low cost plastic that blocks unwanted transmission of light out of the cartridge. In certain embodiments clamshell may be color or pattern coded to distinguish between diagnostic and or analyte test types.

The system presented here offers several potential technical advantages over existing technology. Most significant in an embodiment is the ability to perform quantitative multiplexed immunoassays on whole blood samples at the point of care in a cost effective manner. While some RDTs do offer a degree of multiplexing see for example the five band Dual Path Platform HIV 1 2 test in development by ChemBio Inc. the system disclosed herein may readily be configured to simultaneously measure 45 different markers or more. The system described here may also provide the advantages of multiple RDTs in a single protocol disposable cartridge with automatic quality control features. Further the system is capable of quantitative output more analogous to laboratory analyzers or enzyme immunoassays EIAs .

Referring again to in one embodiment cartridge supports a multiplexed fluorescence bioassay including a printed array of biomarkers immobilized on a waveguide contacting surface e.g. assay region that forms a portion of cartridge . Typically prior to insertion into reader instrument the sample and other assay reagents are added to cartridge according to an assay protocol. After processing which may take minutes or even hours the processed cartridge is then inserted into reader instrument which illuminates the waveguide at one or more different exposure times ranging from milliseconds to seconds. Emitted fluorescence from the biomarker array is optically collected imaged and analyzed within a few seconds to minutes. An embedded or external microprocessor may analyze the recorded image.

Advantageously separation of the slower cartridge processing steps from the faster reader instrument imaging steps allows for a high system throughput since dozens to hundreds of cartridges may be prepared in batches or parallel processes by one or more technicians and when ready may be read relatively quickly by a single technician operating one reader instrument .

Overall operation of reader instrument may be controlled through a user interface which may include a touchscreen barcode reader operable connection to a separate computer with its own interface not shown and or conventional button toggles switches keyboard voice audio control or other human machine interface. In diagnostic applications a cartridge may be processed with a sample according to clinical assay protocol specific to the cartridge being tested. The cartridge is then inserted into the reader instrument. Cartridge parameters e.g. type print geometry and layout print lot cartridge serial number and expiration date may be automatically read as cartridge parameters may be encoded on the cartridge in the form of a barcode or other information indicia. The sample identifier may be input via user interface into reader instrument . Alternatively the sample identifier may be read automatically. For example a user may write information on the cartridge by hand or apply identifiers such as barcode stickers to the cartridge which are in turn imaged or read by the reader instrument. In an embodiment a sample record which links cartridge parameters and sample identifier information may be automatically generated by the reader instrument. Simultaneous cartridge and sample identifier reading in the reader instrument at the time of a measurement provides quality assurance advantages over systems that rely on manual linkage of this information.

Upon insertion reader instrument may automatically acquire and analyze fluorescent images from imaging system and cartridge . This image derived data may be analyzed to determine qualitative presence of an analyte semi quantitative or quantitative evaluation of analyte concentration or even infection disease diagnoses. Analysis results may be displayed on user interface such as a front panel display printed stored in memory or transmitted to an information management system for later review.

In addition to operation simplicity reader instrument has other advantages based on its design. Generally it is easier to manufacture and maintain devices that have few or no moving parts. Advantageously reader instrument may be constructed to have few or no moving parts. Laser illumination module and imaging system may be constructed of non moving parts that are fixed with respect to each other in operation. Shock or drop performance of reader instrument is also improved by limiting the number of moving parts making reader instrument more suitable for use in field or portable applications.

Various other aspects and alternative embodiments of the described reader instrument may be better understood after consideration of the following non limiting examples. The reagents chemicals and other materials are presented as exemplary components or reagents and various modifications may be made in view of the foregoing discussion within the scope of this disclosure.

For portable or semi portable operation a lightweight dimensionally small and space efficient reader instrument is useful. The following paragraphs describe various aspects of one embodiment of such a portable reader instrument. It will be understood that this is a non limiting example and smaller or larger stand alone reader instruments are contemplated as well as reader instruments integrated as components of a larger sample processing device. A reader instrument is illustrated in perspective view with its housing partially removed in in cross section in and with respect to selected components as seen in .

One embodiment of such a portable reader instrument is illustrated in which illustrates a reader instrument similar to reader instrument of with its housing partially removed for better illustrating layout of internal components. Reader instrument is suitable for the operational needs and constraints of clinical environments. The reader instrument may weigh less than 10 kg and it typically weighs only 1 to 3 kg making it easily transportable. The reader instrument may have volume less than 5000 cm and typically has a volume of only 2000 to 3000 cm. The reader instrument footprint is similarly small being less than 500 cm and typically only 200 to 300 cm. The reader instrument is small enough to be easily transported and may be stackable on other equipment. To aid in transport an integral handle may be formed as seen in cross section in . The exterior finishing of housing may be constructed of stainless steel protectively coated metal high durability plastics or other suitable materials capable of withstanding regular cleaning with commercially available solutions including but not limited to clinical biocides e.g. Cavicide 70 solution isopropyl alcohol or 20 solution household bleach i.e. 2 sodium hypochlorite .

Continuing to refer to at least a portion of housing is angled to allow easy access to a cartridge insertion door and viewing of a user interface . As shown the user interface may include a flat panel touchscreen display a power reset button and a sound generator not shown . A user may engage a cartridge such as cartridge of or cartridge of into reader instrument by inserting it through an aperture protected by a door . Although door is shown in as a spring loaded flap door it may alternatively be implemented as a sliding door a loading tray manual or automatic a manual flap door or any other appropriate mechanism to protect aperture when reader instrument is not in use and or to prevent light leakage while the light sources internal to reader instrument are in operation. Additionally while show the cartridge partially protruding from the reader instrument during the operation of the reader instrument it may be desirable in certain applications for the cartridge to be fully enclosed within the reader instrument while the cartridge is being analyzed therein.

A cartridge holder assembly physically prevents cartridges from being inserted backwards. Cartridge holder assembly may include mechanical or electronic components that indicates to the user when a cartridge is fully inserted such as by audible sound tactile feedback display signal or some combination of above. Cartridge holder assembly and inserted cartridge are positioned above touchscreen display in a manner that does not interfere with the operation of touchscreen display or any other front panel components of user interface .

A user may interact with reader instrument by using touchscreen display . Touchscreen display may display analysis results to the user allow for input of sample and user identifiers to the reader instrument and allow the user to configure the operation of the reader instrument by choosing options presented on the display. The display may further display status and fault information to the user. The touchscreen may be compatible with a user wearing no gloves bare fingers a single layer of gloves a double layer of gloves nitrile gloves or latex gloves or any other hand protection available to a user.

In certain embodiments the display size measured diagonally is between 7 and 11 cm. Display resolution may be QVGA 240 320 pixels in landscape mode or greater. The display may include RGB color with 16 24 bit depth. The display may be backlit with white light emitting diodes LEDs cold cathode fluorescent tube lighting or may be internally lit using organic LED displays or externally lit using electronic ink micro electro mechanical system MEMS interference display or passively lighted display screens. The user may control the power state of the reader instrument by pushing a button located on front panel. For example momentarily pressing button may power the reader instrument to its normal operational state. The reader instrument may wake if in a low power sleep state or do nothing if already powered on. Pressing button for greater than five continuous seconds may cause the reader instrument to safely power off. Button may be located such that it does not interfere with operation of the touchscreen display or any other front panel components.

To increase throughput in an exemplary embodiment the reader instrument may be configured to produce analysis results after approximately 30 seconds from cartridge insertion to delivery of analysis results to user. These results may be displayed in whole or in part on touchscreen display . Additionally the reader instrument may store in internal memory storage two thousand or more analysis results. Such analysis results may include for example patient or sample identifier cartridge lot number date and time of test date and time of a linked quality control operation signal to cutoff ratio for all biomarkers and analysis result e.g. positive negative indeterminate for the presence of antibodies in the sample and a quantitative output for all tested analytes. Finally the user may have the option to store and download measurement results that include full image sequences of the cartridge microarray and any associated cartridge identification information.

Since a user may wish to use other input devices or support remote usage of the reader instrument communication with external peripheral devices may be enabled. The reader instrument may have for example a USB Type A port that supports an optional barcode reader compatible with one or both of standard 1 D and 2 D codes for inputting sample identifiers or user codes. A USB Type A connector may be located on a rear panel to support computer to computer communication as a slave device. The reader instrument may also allow networked communication with other computer systems connected by Ethernet and accordingly includes one RJ45 Ethernet connector located on rear panel.

Precise positioning and reliable engagement of a cartridge with reader instrument may be required for proper operation of the reader instrument. Positioning of cartridge holder assembly with respect to housing is illustrated in . While shows the cartridge holder assembly with respect to the housing an isolated cartridge holder assembly is indicated in perspective view in and side cross sectional views with cartridge absent and fully inserted are respectively seen in .

Cartridge holder assembly may be attached at least in part to housing by a front bracket and a side bracket . Cartridge holder assembly may include a door which may be spring loaded with a spring to block aperture in a normally closed position protecting users from inadvertent exposure to laser light potentially emanating from reader instrument and limiting admission of dust dirt or other contaminants into reader instrument .

Elements that assist in proper positioning of a cartridge are illustrated in . A cartridge may be mechanically held in proper position by cooperation of door spring loaded levers and rollers . Spring pressure from spring loaded levers and rollers holds a cartridge in position against laser illumination module . In the exemplary embodiment shown in cartridge holder assembly is formed of a lever plate onto which door spring loaded levers and rollers are mounted a guide plate which includes features for guiding an inserted cartridge into proper position and a base plate onto which laser illumination module and guide plate are fastened. Guide plate and base plate are configured with openings therein so as to collectively define an aperture through which the inserted cartridge may be viewed and imaged.

The correct positioning of the cartridge within the reader instrument activates a safety interlock switch which allows activation of the laser in laser illumination module . In other words safety interlock switch monitors when a cartridge is properly inserted into reader instrument thereby enabling laser illumination to occur. Proper positioning of the cartridge may be indicated to the user by for example an audible and or tangible click produced by a pin which is configured to produce the click when compressed by a cartridge placed thereon. When the cartridge is extracted switch physically disables the laser illumination circuitry preventing possible accidental laser radiation exposure to the operator. Upon removal of the cartridge door rotates back to a closed position.

The embodiments disclosed herein discuss use of a planar waveguide and optionally a refractive volume. illustrates a generalized configuration descriptive of exemplary embodiments. Configuration includes a light source a refractive volume and a planar waveguide . Light source can include a laser or any other source of collimated or near collimated light that provides light along a propagation vector . Refractive volume is positioned proximate to planar waveguide . Refractive volume and planar waveguide may lack a discontinuity in index of refraction therebetween. For example refractive volume may be adjacent to or abutted to waveguide with an index matching fluid not shown occupying any gap therebetween. Alternatively refractive volume may be integrated with planar waveguide as a single unit or article. Planar waveguide is oriented such that propagation vector is perpendicular to normal vector of planar waveguide . Furthermore planar waveguide has an offset in a direction parallel to the normal vector of planar waveguide .

It is noteworthy that fluidic sample chamber may include or be formed in part by a second planar waveguide similar to waveguide such that fluidic sample chamber is disposed between two planar waveguides. In such a configuration light may be coupled to both waveguide and the second planar waveguide as well as the volume formed by the fluidic sample chamber . The principles described herein are similarly applicable to configurations having multiple planar waveguides.

As a result of refraction explained by Snell s law collimated light beam refracts such that it strikes the top surface of waveguide at an angle relative to the optical axis of waveguide . The angle is defined as the internal propagation angle. The vertical distance y between the center of collimated light beam and the apex of integrated lens is chosen such that is less than the complement of the critical angle allowing total internal reflection TIR to occur. For a given radius R for the curved surface of integrated lens and index of refraction n for integrated lens the distance y and angle are related by the equation 

Since collimated light beam has a spatial extent the curved surface of integrated lens will act to focus collimated light beam . The radius R of the curved surface of integrated lens is chosen such that for a given beam diameter of collimated light beam the range of angles incident on the top surface of waveguide is appropriate to provide a uniform evanescent field strength within the detection region while remaining outside the critical angle for TIR. It may be desired that collimated light beam be focused on the top surface of the waveguide to allow for the greatest tolerance to misalignment. The total thickness t for the structure formed from waveguide and integrated lens that leads to a focused beam on the top surface may be given by 

When an appropriate thickness t is used collimated light beam will focus at a horizontal distance L from the center of the circle defining the curved surface of integrated lens . L may be related to the previously defined quantities by the equation 

The structure including waveguide and integrated lens may be manufactured in several different ways. One method is to have the entire assembly constructed in plastic by injection molding technology. An alternative method is to fabricate the planar waveguide and lens element separately from similar index materials. The two elements may then be joined permanently by a transparent optical cement optical contacting or temporarily with index matching fluid oil gel.

Geometries such as those described in connection with easily allow the adjustment of the internal propagation angle through a translation rather than a rotation of the incident laser beam. This allows for a less complicated mechanical design to couple the laser to the waveguide. Additionally a new injection molded waveguide is not necessary when it is desired to change the incident angle because the focal point of the lens using the disclosed geometry of is insensitive to the translation of a laser beam relative to the optical axis of waveguide . Further a desired change in the incident angle is accomplished without changing the readout instrument allowing variation of cartridge function without physical changes in the instrument. A barcode on the cartridge may be utilized to identify information used to interpret signals from a given cartridge.

To prevent light from leaking from the waveguide after the first reflection from the top surface the cylindrical lens is truncated such that it does not extend beyond the location of the focus. The area defined by the line connecting the apex of integrated lens and the point on the bottom surface opposite the focus see e.g. optical deadzone in will never have light propagate in it that successfully couples to the waveguide. As such the precise shape of the lens in the area designated optical deadzone can be any convenient shape provided integrated lens does not extend beyond the vertical line passing through the focus. For a single injection molded device where minimizing material costs is important removing all plastic in the area labeled optical deadzone may be desirable. If two separate components made through conventional optical manufacturing processes are fabricated integrated lens that has been diced to remove material beyond the focus can be easily manufactured. A material that has low autofluorescence properties may be desirable to minimize background contributions in the signal collection.

Because integrated lens is used in off axis geometry minor optical aberrations at the focus may be exhibited if the curved surface is circular. While a circular profile functionally works the use of an aspheric surface may be employed to extend the range of the vertical position of the incident beam for which the beam will be coupled to waveguide allowing a larger range of adjustment of the angle . The appropriate deviation from a circular profile can be calculated with optical ray tracing programs familiar to those skilled in the art.

The large area of the top surface of waveguide before the focus may allow for a sample chamber to be sealed. Gasket sealing surface may be absent from the optical path. Therefore a larger range of gasket materials may be possible that only need to be evaluated for their chemical biological compatibility and not their optical properties. For example an adhesive backed spacer can be utilized to form a sealed flowcell without a complicated clamping mechanism. Multiple flow cells can also be incorporated into a single biosensor by utilizing a gasket with multiple channels.

A lid attached to the gasket completes the flow cell. Fluid samples can be introduced through orifices in the lid and flow through the channels allowing the fluid to interact with the top waveguide surface. Fluid reservoirs exterior to the flow channel can also be included to allow the introduction of fluids into the flow channel and an overflow reservoir at the outlet port of the flow channel to contain the fluid after it has passed through the flow channel. With plastic components the gasket may be optionally eliminated by molding the channels into one of the plastic components and joining the two plastic components directly with methods known to those skilled in the art e.g. laser or ultrasonic welding .

The evanescent field created by the light within waveguide can excite fluorophores that have attached to the top surface of waveguide . As the fluorophores relax and emit frequency shifted radiation the emitted light may be captured by a lens or series of lenses e.g. collection and filtering optics to transfer an image of the surface to a plane that is imaged by a light capturing device e.g. imaging device such as a CCD or CMOS sensor. An optical filter may also be placed between the waveguide surface and the imaging device to eliminate scattered incident light that has not been frequency shifted by the captured fluorophores.

In a step light is provided from a light source along a propagation vector. The light source may include a laser or any other source of collimated or near collimated light.

In a step a refractive volume is illuminated with the light. The refractive volume is positioned proximate to and may be integrated with a planar waveguide. In exemplary embodiments the refractive volume may include at least a section of a plano convex cylindrical lens wherein the longitudinal axis of the refractive volume is oriented perpendicular to the optical axis and the normal vector of the planar waveguide.

In a step the light is coupled to the planar waveguide via the refractive volume. The waveguide is oriented such that the propagation vector is perpendicular to the normal vector of the planar waveguide and offset from the planar waveguide in a direction parallel to the normal vector of the planar waveguide.

In an optional step indicated by a dashed box the optical coupling of the light provided by the light source to the planar waveguide is tuned by translating the light source in a direction parallel to the normal vector of the planar waveguide.

In a step consistent optical coupling of the light provided by the light source to the planar waveguide is maintained while translating the light source parallel to the optical axis of the planar waveguide.

In a step a biological sample is positioned in a reservoir formed at least in part by a face of the planar waveguide.

In a step light emitted from a region proximate to a face of the planar waveguide is detected. In some embodiments a detector is positioned to detect light emitted from a region proximate to the face of the planar waveguide having a plurality of capture molecules bound thereto.

For some applications containment of the liquid layer within a sub wavelength extent as in the context of the applications described above may be unfeasible. For instance if the object of interest is a biological cell on the order of one to twenty microns in diameter then a different approach to analyte illumination and light guiding is required.

It would be desirable to use an optical waveguide to efficiently illuminate low n media and or objects embedded in such media where the media or objects extend beyond the penetration depth of the evanescent field generated at a high n to low n interface. A low n medium may be for example a material having an index of refraction lower than that of conventional solid materials e.g. a refractive index less than 1.5. An optical waveguide capable of effectively illuminating a core containing a low index of refraction medium is described herein. It is noted that the terms light and illumination are used interchangeably herein.

In an embodiment as illustrated in a planar waveguide includes a stack of layers formed from a first substrate and a second substrate sandwiching a low n medium . The low n medium is interchangeably denoted herein as the interrogation medium. First and second substrates and may be for instance optically clear so as to be transparent to light having a wavelength within a predetermined range. Low n medium is introduced between first and second substrates and such that first and second substrates and cooperate to confine low n medium therebetween. First and second substrates and and low n medium may have a variety of thicknesses as long as low n medium exhibits a lower refractive index in comparison to first and second substrates and . The present concept is compatible with numerous schemes of coupling light into the waveguide as well as different methods of containing the low n medium therein. The low n medium may be liquid gaseous and or solid.

One dimensional optical confinement i.e. in a direction indicated by a surface normal indicated by a thick arrow of the first and second substrates of light inserted into the waveguide may be provided by TIR at the interfaces between the optically clear substrates and the external surroundings. In the exemplary embodiment shown in a light source directs illumination into planar waveguide at an angle away from the substrate normal and out of the plane of the substrates such that one dimensional optical confinement of illumination is provided by planar waveguide by total internal reflection at the two substrate to surrounding medium interfaces.

A cross sectional view of planar waveguide is shown in . It should be noted that the figures are not drawn to scale. As shown in first substrate has a refractive index n second substrate has a refractive index n and low n medium has a refractive index n. Planar waveguide is surrounded by air or some other medium with a refractive index n. The indices of refraction fulfill the requirements Eq. 4 and Eq. 5 

Note that critical angle for for light propagation from a first material with refractive index n1 toward a second material with refractive index n2 where n2

As shown in light enters planar waveguide such that an incidence angle from first substrate with refractive index n into the surrounding medium with refractive index n is greater than the critical angle as defined from the lower of nand n i.e. Eq. 7 such that light is contained within planar waveguide by TIR. All angles are measured relative to surface normal . Consequently the substrates and the interrogation medium form a multi part waveguide together providing light confinement in one dimension i.e. in a direction parallel to surface normal . The interrogation medium can be of any type e.g. gaseous liquid and biological objects embedded in a liquid as long as the refractive index condition of Eq. 4 and incidence angle condition of Eq. 7 are satisfied.

For liquid and gaseous interrogation media the waveguide design may be modified for containing the interrogation medium. For example in the embodiment shown in low n medium is contained between first and second substrates and entirely by surface tension. show an alternative configuration for a planar waveguide in which first and second substrates and are spaced apart by first and second gaskets and . Still alternatively first and second gaskets and may be connected to form a single contiguous gasket. It is noted that the embodiments shown in accommodates the addition of inlet and outlet ports not shown for the low n interrogation medium. The open ends in may be plugged using another material thereby forming a completely sealed volume for containing the interrogation medium.

The containment configuration should be compatible with the method for coupling light into the waveguide. For instance the system may be configured such that the interrogation medium may be uniformly illuminated in the plane of the planar waveguide even if the light is not solely confined within the interrogation medium. In coupling of light through the substrates is generally unaffected by the low n medium containment schemes shown in . Interference effects or curved interface effects e.g. if light is incident from the surrounding medium directly onto low n medium which may include an interface curvature caused by surface tension may affect subsequent propagation of light through planar waveguide or .

Referring to the illumination strength inside low n medium depends on the angle of light propagation inside planar waveguide . Due to the spatial compression of the light reflection at the interfaces between the optically clear substrates and the external surroundings light propagating at angles close to the critical angle will result in greater illumination strength than light propagating at angles far from the critical angle. To a first approximation the average illumination strength within planar waveguide is inversely proportional to sin where is the incidence angle of propagating light at the substrate air interface such that the light is contained within the waveguide.

Referring to the manner of coupling light into the waveguide may be chosen in accordance with the given application. For example the incident light may be coupled into a single layer of the multi part planar waveguide any combination of layers or all layers. If the light is coupled directly into the low n interrogation medium for instance the light may be inserted into the planar waveguide at any angle such that Eq. 7 is fulfilled. This range of angles include normal incidence onto the waveguide end i.e. at an angle perpendicular to surface normal . On the other hand if the light is coupled in through one of the substrates the angle of incidence should further satisfy the conditions 

A simple version of the planar low n index waveguide may be formed from two identical substrates of a single type of material as shown in . Alternatively the two substrates may be non identical and even be composed of several disparate layers of optically clear materials possibly with different indices of refraction.

Note that if first or second substrate or is formed of a plurality of disparate layers the effective refractive index of the combination of the plurality of disparate layers may be expressed as n which is related to the refractive index nof the surrounding medium by the equation Eq. 10 .

Furthermore the two substrates may be in contact with different media such as if first substrate is exposed to air while second substrate is attached to a third substrate not shown . In this case multi part planar waveguide will still work as a waveguide as long as Eqs. 1 and 4 and the additional condition Eq. 11 are satisfied for both substrates and surrounding media.

The angle of light propagation should be such that the incidence angle for the substrate to interrogation medium interface as well as all interfaces between layers forming the substrate satisfy the condition Eq. 13 .

The embodiments illustrated in impose no constraints on the thicknesses of the interrogation medium or the two substrates as long as the refractive index and incidence angle requirements of Eqs. 1 and 4 are fulfilled. The disclosed embodiments may be particularly suitable for low cost volume production and may be combined with light coupling mechanisms of relatively low complexity. While planar waveguides and will function properly with virtually any choice of thicknesses of the interrogation medium and substrates the actual choice of layer thicknesses may be based on a number of factors such as the choices of materials manufacturing methods and cost.

The light propagation through thick and thin versions of planar waveguide is illustrated for both a collimated beam and a diverging beam as the light input. As shown in a collimated beam will make distinct passes through low n medium throughout the waveguide with high intensity. For a diverging beam on the other hand the reflected light eventually overlaps resulting in substantially uniform illumination within the planar waveguide. Consequently if only one or more appropriately placed small regions extending no more than the portion illuminated by a single pass require illumination then collimated beam can provide greater intensity than diverging beam within the small region. If the intent is to illuminate a larger region possibly in a uniform fashion then a diverging beam may be a better choice. It should also be noted that the pairs of figures i.e. and may be viewed as illustrations of the same planar waveguide but illuminated with collimated and diverging beams respectively of different beam diameters.

Efficient coupling of light into the waveguide is readily achieved with a combined waveguide thickness of macroscopic extent e.g. on the order of few hundreds of nanometers or greater. For instance a focused laser beam may be easily coupled into a planar waveguide of such dimensions. The mechanism for appropriately focusing the incoming light may be either integrated in the waveguide or constructed as a system separate from the waveguide. Examples of light coupling mechanisms are shown in .

In another approach the light may be coupled into one of the two substrates which is equipped with an integrated lens assembly for appropriately focusing and directing the incoming light. For instance shows an embodiment in which first and second substrates and respectively are spaced apart to contain a low n medium therebetween. Second substrate includes an integrated lens which is configured to receive light beam so as to couple light beam into second substrate and subsequently the multi part planar waveguide configuration. shows a similar embodiment in which first and second substrates and respectively is spaced apart to contain a low n medium therebetween. In this embodiment second substrate includes an integrated lens which is this time configured to receive light beam incident at an angle perpendicular to surface normal . Light beam received at integrated lens is directed into second substrate and subsequently the multi part planar waveguide as a whole. shows an alternative embodiment which includes first and second substrates and respectively separated by first and second gaskets and respectively so as to contain a low n medium therebetween. Second substrate includes an integrated lens which is configured to receive light beam at a portion of second substrate away from first gasket such that light beam is inserted into the multi part planar waveguide structure without being blocked by first gasket . Finally shows an embodiment including first and second substrates and respectively. This time rather than including a separate gasket first substrate includes first and second stand offs and respectively which are configured so as to be attachable to second substrate by for instance laser welding ultrasonic welding or other suitable bonding method. When bonded together first and second substrates and respectively defines a volume for containing a low n medium therebetween. Second substrate includes an integrated lens configured for receiving light beam incident at an angle perpendicular to surface normal such that light beam propagates into second substrate and subsequently into the multi part planar waveguide structure as a whole. Integrated lens may be for example an integrated lens as described in the aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 617 535 such that insertion of light beam into second substrate is substantially insensitive to translation of light beam with respect to integrated lens .

An exemplary embodiment of a cartridge system with interrogation medium containment in and outlet ports and light coupling means designed for light entry into the waveguide inside the contained region is shown in . A waveguide cartridge includes first and second substrates and respectively separated by a gasket so as to provide containment of a low n medium therebetween. Second substrate includes an integrated lens for receiving light incident thereon and directing light into waveguide cartridge so that after a few TIR bounces therein light uniformly illuminates at least a portion of low n medium . Waveguide cartridge further includes an inlet port and an outlet port through which one or more samples may be introduced into waveguide cartridge as low n medium .

The use of optically clear substrates may facilitate optical communication with the interrogation medium through the substrates. For instance additional image capture through the substrates may be utilized to detect light emitted from the interrogation medium and thereby extract information about the interrogation medium in e.g. microscopy and or fluorescence applications. Additionally by using a position sensitive detector spatial information regarding the interrogation medium may be obtained. Alternatively light emitted within the range of angles confined by the waveguide may be detected in the plane of the waveguide if an appropriate pathway is established for allowing this light to exit the waveguide not shown . For example a mechanism for out coupling of light may be incorporated into the substrate in a manner similar to that used for the in coupling of light.

As an alternative one or more of the substrate surrounding medium interfaces may be configured to be at least partially reflective. Additionally one or more reflecting surfaces may be utilized in the waveguide. For instance one or both of the substrate to interrogation medium interfaces may be configured to be partially or completely reflective in order to better contain the guided light within the interrogation medium. In the case of configurations wherein the light is coupled into the waveguide through one of the two substrates the other one of the two substrates may be configured to include a reflective surface e.g. at the substrate to interrogation medium interface thereby increasing the illumination intensity within the interrogation medium. An example of this configuration is shown in in which a waveguide cartridge further includes a reflective layer at the interface between first substrate and low n medium . The configuration as shown in still allows for optical communication through second substrate e.g. for detection of light emitted from the interrogation medium while improving the light containment within waveguide cartridge without affecting the in coupling of light therein. Another advantage of this configuration is a reduced distance from light entry to uniform illumination when guiding a diverging beam. Still another example is shown in in which a waveguide cartridge includes a reflective layer at the interface between the outer surface of first substrate and surrounding medium . The advantages imparted in the configuration of are similar to those discussed in relation to .

Other variations in which one or both of the substrates include one or more reflective regions may hold other advantages. For instance the configuration depicted in may be modified to include a reflective section located at a certain distance from the point of light entry thereby reducing the distance required to achieve uniform illumination while maintaining means for optical communication through both substrates. Additionally the at least partially reflective surfaces in may be used to direct light emitted by the interrogation medium e.g. fluorescence emission towards a detector placed underneath a waveguide.

While each of the illustrated embodiments shows a single light beam entering the waveguide the embodiments may be extended to accommodate multiple beams entering the waveguide. For example the waveguide may be constructed to accept multiple beams of light by in coupling several light beams through one port such as a lens integrated into one of the substrates and or by incorporating several in coupling ports. The beams may propagate in directions that are parallel to each other either in co or counter propagating configurations or in non parallel configurations.

Precise and accurate illumination control is an important element of reader instrument operation. In one embodiment illustrated in part with respect to laser illumination module produces illumination light capable of optically coupling to waveguide of cartridge after passing through the light transmission module which is cooperatively composed of housing mounted optical elements and cartridge mounted integral lens elements.

Laser illumination module may provide light with suitable optical power for example between 10 and 100 milliwatts. To maintain calibration and desired reader instrument sensitivity it may be advantageous for the optical power to have long term stability better than 15 drift per month along with a short term stability better than 1 RMS variation at a 5 second integration time. In some embodiments laser light may have wavelength equal to 660 5 nm. This wavelength specification may be changed e.g. to 642 nm 5 nm to accommodate different fluorescent tag systems and in some advanced reader instrument embodiments multiple or tunable laser light wavelengths may be used.

In an embodiment the laser light may be polarized orthogonal to plane of cartridge waveguide to better than 10 polarization extinction ratio. The laser light may be directed toward the cartridge so that it propagates in a direction inside the waveguide that is within 1 such as between 0.10 and 0.25 of being parallel to the long axis centerline in the plane of the assay surface of the waveguide. The laser light ordinarily propagates along the centerline of the waveguide. Ideally the relative average power difference between waveguide surface locations that are equidistant from the centerline is less than 10 such as between about 1 and 5 . When a cartridge is fully inserted into the reader instrument laser light may enter the coupling lens of the cartridge waveguide at a height and angle relative to top surface of waveguide that optimizes assay performance. The laser light is collimated e.g. to less than 2 to 5 degrees far field divergence angle so as to ensure uniformity of illumination throughout the length of the waveguide particularly in the assay region. Additionally collimation of the laser light may further reduce sensitivity of the reader instrument to longitudinal displacement i.e. in a direction indicated by double headed arrow in of the waveguide with respect to laser illumination module . Beam width 1 efull width is parallel to polarization axis and selected to be about 1.7 0.2 mm affects longitudinal uniformity . Beam width 1 efull width perpendicular to polarization axis may be for example 9 1 mm this parameter affects transverse uniformity . In operation far field spatial deviations in the imaging region negligibly contribute to site to site variations of the assay. RMS variations of the optical power at the surface of the waveguide with an averaging window of 60 m may be less than 10 . Finally RMS variations of the optical power at the surface of the waveguide with an averaging window of 600 m may be less than 10 typically between 1 and 5 .

Additional light sources may be used to illuminate portions of the cartridge when inserted into the reader instrument. For instance an LED may be used to illuminate features such as a barcode or a fiducial mark disposed on a bottom portion of the cartridge.

In an embodiment a rotating diffuser system may be used to further improve the uniformity of the laser light illumination. For example a diffuser such as rotating diffuser of may be used with rotation in which the diffuser itself is rotated about an axis parallel to but offset from the laser beam propagation direction. In this way the need for any wedge and or focusing lenses for the laser beam around the location of diffuser is eliminated hence greatly simplifying the optical path compared to existing art see for example Hard et al. Phase randomized laser illumination for microscopy J. Cell Sci. 23 335 343 1977 .

It is recognized that the method as disclosed herein removes undesirable non uniformities in the planar waveguide illumination and thus in the fluorescence images of microarrays including one or more reaction sites illuminated by the laser beam inserted into the planar waveguide thereby resulting in several positive benefits 1 improved image quality 2 reduced intra site coefficient of variation CV and 3 reduced inter site CV. The improved image quality is due to the fact that without speckle the fluorescence images give a very clear picture of the morphology of the reaction sites. The intra site intensity variation may be significantly reduced and better reflect the actual reaction site morphology thus eliminating the need for averaging over a large spatial area in order to obtain a reliable average reaction site signal intensity. Accordingly it may possible to reduce the size of the reaction site and pack more features into the microarray without suffering from speckle induced degradation in the data quality. Furthermore in the presence of speckle effects in the captured image the spatial averaging in a fluorescence imaged affected by speckle is not ideal even with a reaction site spot diameter of 0.6 mm. In an array with replicate features within a row the speckle therefore contributes to the inter site CV. Rotating diffuser may substantially eliminate the speckle induced contribution resulting in an improved inter site CV.

Referring again to diffuser is placed in the excitation beam in the abovementioned target imaging system. Diffuser may be rotated for example using a motor . In an example the diffuser has random structure which imposes structure on the laser beam by means of diffraction. The diffuser does not significantly degrade the coherence of the laser beam. However if the laser beam is passed through rotating diffuser rotating in the plane of the diffuser about an axis offset from the beam axis any speckle effect is virtually eliminated from the laser beam profile when time averaged over a sufficiently long time period. Consequently when the microarray imaging exposure time is much greater than the diffuser structure sampling time all signs of speckle in the excitation light disappear. This provides uniform excitation of the microarray which in turn yields speckle free fluorescence images.

Referring particularly to a diagrammatic illustration of an exemplary waveguide based sample imaging system is shown in accordance with an embodiment. A laser diode emits a diverging beam which is passed through a collimating lens so as to be transformed into a collimated beam . Collimated beam passes through a diffuser which is rotated about an axis parallel to the propagation direction of collimated beam so as to generate a uniform beam . Uniform beam is directed toward a waveguide arrangement . Waveguide arrangement includes an integrated lens a planar portion and an assay region which includes a plurality of reaction sites . Reaction sites may include immobilized biomolecules such as antigens antibodies proteins peptides glycans or nucleic acids. Various methods of preparing printed microarrays including contact printing inkjet printing piezoelectric printing and solenoid valve jet printing are available.

Continuing to refer to uniform beam is coupled into waveguide arrangement via integrated lens such that uniform beam is guided through planar portion by total internal reflection. Consequently the evanescent wave portion of uniform beam so guided through planar portion illuminates assay region . Any resulting signal such as fluorescence is captured at a sensor . This method may be applicable for both a waveguide with an integrated coupling lens as shown in and a waveguide with coupling optics that is separate from the planar portion of the waveguide arrangement.

The location of the rotating diffuser in the path of collimated beam is advantageous because rotating diffuser may be selected to impart only a small amount of divergence to collimated beam while generally preserving the coherence of collimated beam . In other words the diffuser may be disposed as close to planar portion such that any small potentially unavoidable divergence of collimated beam created by diffuser has minimal effect over the extent of waveguide arrangement . Also for combinations of a small laser diode and an inexpensive collimating lens space constraints may preclude the possibility of inserting a diffuser in the path of diverging beam .

Referring again to an imaging sensor such as a two dimensional CMOS or CCD sensor may be used in reader instrument . In one embodiment illustrated in part with respect to sensor may be mounted in reader instrument . Imaging optics may be positioned over the imaging sensor. Use of imaging optics fixed with respect to the imaging sensor may lower reader instrument cost eliminate a requirement for potentially expensive autofocus circuitry and increase tolerance of the sensor to shock.

The sensor may be for example MT9M001 from Micron Aptina which is a 1.3 Mpixel monochrome sensor with 1280 1024 pixels Pixel size 5.2 m 5.2 m . The objective system may be for example V13VM615 from Xiamen Leading Optics which is a closed circuit television CCTV lens with variable focus zoom iris with f 1.4 and focal length of 6 15 mm. The objective system may be used as is or alternatively separated into components and mounted into a custom made barrel. Due to the fact that the imaging system creates a demagnified image in performing the analyte detection the depth of field of the aligned system is approximately 2 mm. The object to image distance may be for example less than 100 mm. A fluorescence emission filter may be placed within the imaging system in an embodiment. The fluorescence emission filter serves to block light having approximately the same wavelength as the laser light illuminating the planar waveguide while transmitting fluorescence signal from the assay region. For example the fluorescence emission filter may be positioned between the objective system and the cartridge or between separated components within the objective system. The resulting magnification provided by the imaging system is approximately 1 7. The resulting pixel size in object space is approximately 35 m 35 m. The light signal is prevented from reaching a vertical belt short dimension along one side of the sensor such that this part of the sensor then gives a measurement of the dark noise i.e. readout noise . Furthermore a series of exposure times are used in the imaging process in order to extend the dynamic range to almost 4 orders of magnitude as enabled by the dark noise subtraction.

Accurate cartridge identification and tracking is useful for commercial reader instruments. Peripheral tracking modules based on one or two dimensional bar codes RFID readers or other conventional tracking technologies are contemplated. As may be seen in for example a peripheral device . Peripheral device may be for example a USB attached computer printer keyboard mouse barcode reader or other device to aid with information input or output from the reader instrument. As desired peripheral device may be configured to read bar codes color codings alphanumeric labeling RFID tags or any other suitable cartridge identification mechanism. In other embodiments internally mounted barcode RFID or other readers are contemplated.

As previously noted accurate cartridge identification and tracking may be useful in certain applications. In one embodiment the image sensor may also be used to identify the cartridge. This specification further minimizes the opportunity for human error and eliminates the need for auxiliary bar code RFID or other expensive attached or separately mounted cartridge identification mechanisms. In an embodiment instead of having a user scan a cartridge s optical encoding using a peripheral device as discussed with respect to the reader instrument may automatically scan the optical encoding after insertion of the cartridge into the analysis slot. This process is schematically illustrated in which shows a cartridge containing information indicators adjacent to reaction sites which are imaged by an imaging system having a field of view . Information indicators may be for example printed two dimensional bar codes. Various other features of cartridge such as an enclosure e.g. cartridge of are omitted from for illustrative clarity. The reaction sites may be printed on the cartridge in the same field of view of imaging system as information indicators . To maximize the amount of printable information field of view of imaging system may include edges of the cartridge and bar code printable portions of the cartridge surrounding reaction sites . In certain other embodiments bar code or other information may be separately printed and attached to a cartridge.

An exemplary layout of features on a cartridge is shown in . A cartridge again with various features omitted for illustrative clarity includes a plurality of reaction sites with small information indicators and a large information indicator . Reaction sites and small information indicators are shown to be within a field of view of an imaging system not shown while large information indicator is outside of field of view . Consequently small information indicators may be imaged and decoded by the same sensor within the imaging system that is used to perform the analyte detection while large information indicator may be read separately by another sensor a peripheral device or by a user. Small and large information indicators and respectively may be printed bar codes. Large information indicator may be for instance a note handwritten by a user or an ID code or sticker.

In an embodiment a prepared cartridge with identifying information may be inserted into the reader instrument for analysis. Before analysis occurs the imaging system images optical encoding bar code coded dot patterns OCR evaluated text or other suitable information symbols located on the underside of the cartridge. The read data is stored in a log file and may optionally be automatically associated with additional calibration or tracking material internally stored in the reader instrument or available by wired wireless or internet connection. The reader instrument proceeds to automatically analyze the sample and stores those results as well. After test completion the reader instrument indicates to the user the test is complete and the cartridge is automatically ejected or ready to be manually removed. Advantageously using this procedure and apparatus the pertinent information optically encoded in the cartridge is accurately read and stored every time a cartridge is analyzed without the need for an extra internal scanner or extra manual steps. Optionally an LED such as LED of or some other type of light source that is internal to the reader instrument may be used to illuminate the barcode during imaging.

One useful technique for certain applications involves plasma treatment to clean a surface by ion bombardment and physical ablation of contaminants particularly for elimination of organic contaminants. In addition plasma treatment can be used to modify surfaces for attachment or adsorption of functional groups such as for the printing of reaction sites. Furthermore plasma treatment of a surface may modify the flow behavior of fluids coming into contact with that surface.

In one embodiment a waveguide may be prepared for attachment of desired reaction sites by use of an argon oxygen plasma cleaning. Following cleaning epoxy silane may be deposited on the cleaned surface of the waveguide to functionalize and prepare the waveguide for further processing.

Additionally capillary flow within the cartridge may be enhanced by suitable coatings or treatments of both the flow plate and the waveguide. In one embodiment both the flow plate and the waveguide are subjected to a plasma cleaning step. When assembled capillary flow rate is greatly enhanced relative to cartridges having a flow plate that has not been subjected to a plasma treatment. Consequently smaller volumes of sample e.g. 50 microliters or less may be needed to perform the analyte detection process.

At the TIR interface an evanescent field is generated that decays exponentially into the aqueous medium. The decay length of the evanescent field is on the order of a hundred nanometers for visible light. For fluorescence assay applications the advantage is localization of the illumination source precisely at the solid liquid assay interface limiting negative effects such as the bulk solution line of sight light scattering.

The cartridge is based on a thick 1 mm multi mode planar waveguide fabricated by injection molding of a low auto fluorescence plastic e.g. cyclic olefin polymer . One of the major advantages of this cartridge configuration is the incorporation of a coupling lens into the molded waveguide . This lens design overcomes fundamental challenge of reproducible light coupling to the waveguide in prior designs. The lens design creates a diverging beam such that modes mix down the length of the waveguide eventually creating a spatially uniform illumination field along the axial length of the waveguide.

The plastic waveguides are activated with a surface chemistry treatment to render them amine reactive. Details of the surface activation are similar to methods described in the literature with proprietary modifications and improvements.

A protein array is printed to the activated surface of the planar waveguide prior to assembly into the cartridge. Details of the array features and layout are provided below. The arrays may be printed with a commercial arrayer such as Bio Dot AD3200 robotic arrayer equipped with Bio Jet print head dispensing 28 nanoliter droplets. Resulting reaction site diameters are approximately 0.5 mm and the arrays are printed on a grid with 1.25 mm centers. The length of the 30 feature i.e. 2 rows by 15 columns in the present example array is approximately 17.5 mm. After printing the waveguide arrays are rinsed with a protein based blocking agent spin dried and then coated with a sugar based stabilizer for storage.

Printed waveguides are assembled into an injection molded cartridge to form a 2 to 5 mm wide fluidic channel with a volume of approximately 30 microliters. The cartridge inlet port provides a reservoir for introduction of assay fluids. The exit port provides a fluidic contact to an absorbent pad that serves as a waste reservoir. The cartridge is configured to provide reproducible passive fluid flow driven by a combination of capillary action and hydrostatic pressure as described in for instance U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 391 911 entitled Fluidic Assay Cartridge with Controlled Passive Flow filed 11 Oct. 2010. All fluids stay on board the cartridge upon completion of the assay procedure thus minimizing biohazard. In this way a combination of printed antigens controls and a sample placed in the liquid channel may be used to perform an assay as schematically shown in .

Returning to further details of the cartridge and assay system are described. illustrates a cross sectional view of an assay system including a cartridge . Cartridge includes a planar waveguide with an integrated lens suitable for use with the labeled antigen assay of in accordance with the embodiment See also U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 617 535 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference . An illumination beam is inserted into planar waveguide through integrated lens . Illumination beam may be provided for example by a laser with an appropriate wavelength to excite fluorescent labels at an assay surface . Other appropriate forms of illumination either collimated or uncollimated may also be used with assay system . Integrated lens is configured to cooperate with planar waveguide such that illumination beam so inserted is guided through planar waveguide and may illuminate assay surface by evanescent light coupling. Assay surface an upper component which includes an inlet port and an output port cooperate to define a fluidic sample chamber . Assay surface and upper element can be bonded via a channel defining adhesive gasket or via direct bonding methods such as laser welding ultrasonic welding or solvent bonding. Appropriate chemical compounds such as a printed antigen are bound to assay surface such that when a biological sample and labeled detect reagent are added to the fluidic sample chamber a target analyte if present forms a sandwich between its specific labeled detect reagent and its specific chemical compound immobilized on assay surface . If the specific complex is formed at assay surface fluorescence signal at the immobilized compound location is indicative of the presence of the target analyte within the biological sample. As an example collection and filtering optics may be used to capture the fluorescence signal from assay surface . A signal corresponding to the fluorescence so captured may then be directed to an imaging device such as a CCD or CMOS sensor.

In a further embodiment assay system may be used for rapid simple detection of multiple target antibodies in a single biological sample. Multiple different antigens may be immobilized at reaction sites on the assay surface such as in stripes or spots in an array format using printing technology thereby creating a spatially localized set of parallel assay locations. The combination of a biological sample labeled antibody against human IgG and immobilized antigens on assay surface may lead to the formation of multiple physically separated antigen antibody complexes on the assay surface. Illumination of assay surface results in spatially localized fluorescence signal that may be read with a detection system including collection and filtering optics imaging device and computer . Computer may be integrated into the detection system instrument e.g. single board computer . Alternatively computer could be an external device such as peripheral device of .

Unless otherwise specified in this disclosure components reagents protocol and other methods used in the system and the assays are as described in the Materials and Methods Section of the Example and are for the purpose of illustration only.

This example demonstrates an HIV 1 Ab assay with 100 agreement with known seroreactivity on a collection of 82 HIV Ab positive and 142 HIV Ab negative samples including multiple samples with HCV and syphilis co infection. It also demonstrates a treponemal specific syphilis antibody assay that correctly identifies 67 of 68 Ab positive and 100 of 102 Ab negative samples. The HCV assay correctly identifies 59 of 60 HCV Ab positive and 120 of 121 HCV Ab negative samples. Multiplexed assay performance on whole blood samples is also demonstrated.

Biological Reagents. Modern serological assays for infectious diseases are typically based on recombinant proteins multiple epitope fusion proteins and antigenic peptides. Selection screening and optimization of immobilized antigens are an important aspect of assay development. For the purposes of this disclosure commercially available and commonly used proteins were used. However it is to be recognized that other commercial or customized antigens or antibodies may also be used.

The HIV 1 assay demonstration utilized two commercially sourced purified recombinant proteins envelope gp41 and capsid antigen p24. For the syphilis treponemal assay commercially sourced recombinant proteins Tp47 and Tp17 were used. Tp47 and Tp17 are commonly used in treponemal specific syphilis immunoassays. Note that treponemal specific assays do not readily distinguish between active latent and treated syphilis infection. The platform described here however is amenable to the addition of a non treponemal antibody detection component as has been described in the literature.

Due to the high level of genomic and antigenic variability associated with HCV anti HCV antibody screening typically depends on multiple antigenic targets. For instance a number of FDA approved enzyme immunoassays rely on combinations of recombinant proteins and peptides. Consistent with the need for HCV antigen multiplexing four commercially available HCV recombinant proteins were used in this demonstration including recombinant core protein nucleocapsid p22 fusion protein full length NS3 c33c a mosaic recombinant including NS4 immunodominant regions and a recombinant which contains HCV nucleocapsid NS3 NS4 and NS5 immunodominant regions which is also referred to as the multiple epitope antigen in this disclosure.

Other biological reagents include purified human IgG Sigma St. Louis Mo. goat anti human IgG Thermo Scientific Rockford Ill. and goat anti human IgG conjugated with fluorescent dye DyLight649 KPL Inc. . Assay reagents include bovine serum albumin BSA Sigma Life Science St. Louis Mo. phosphate buffered saline PBS Fisher Scientific Rockford Ill. Blocker Casein in PBS Thermo Scientific Rockford Ill. and Tween20 Thermo Scientific Rockford Ill. .

Five sets of clinical samples were used to characterize the system. A total of 251 different clinical samples were processed in this example.

Well characterized human plasma and serum samples with known antibody reactivity for each of the three pathogens were commercially sourced. These samples included four with known HIV 1 antibody reactivity four with known antibody reactivity and four with known HCV antibody reactivity.

A total of 25 human serum samples with known HIV 1 Western Blot reactivity were sourced under an Institutional Review Board IRB approved protocol by the University of California San Diego Medical Center UCSD . Co infection status was not known for the majority of these samples at the time of the assay described herein.

A collection of 30 de identified sera known positive for syphilis infection were sourced from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment CDPHE Denver Colo. . Syphilis reactivity was determined at the CDPHE Laboratory using rapid plasma regain RPR and particle agglutination TPPA . The HIV serostatus of each of these samples was not known upon receipt from the CDPHE. All 30 sera were also characterized with an FDA approved HIV 1 2 RDT Trinity Uni Gold Recombigen HIV .

A collection of de identified clinical samples from existing sample archives were coordinated with IRB approval by UCSD. Samples were selected for likely HIV HCV hepatitis B virus and or syphilis infection. UCSD clinical samples were all characterized for HIV and HCV infection on a Siemens Centaur clinical analyzer. Syphilis samples were tested by RPR with confirmation by TPPA. The UCSD Co Infection Collection includes a large number of highly complex pathogen antibody and antigen reactivities as commonly encountered in HIV and HCV infected individuals. In addition to HIV HCV HBV and or syphilis infection many of these samples have positive reactivities for CMV Epstein Barr virus and various human herpes viruses.

Human serum controls were commercially sourced and were vendor certified as HIV HCV and RPR negative. antibody reactivity was not provided by the vendor for this collection. In the event of a positive antibody result using the present system and method reference testing was performed on those specific samples. Reference tests for included TPPA Fujirebio Malvern Pa. a syphilis RDT SD Bioline Korea and Treponemal Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA Trep Sure Phoenix Biotech Ontario CA . reference testing was not performed on samples that were negative by RPR and negative using the present system.

Because one of the important uses of the present system and method will be in point of care settings it is important to evaluate the performance of the system on whole blood samples. Whole blood was sourced under an IRB approved protocol from HIV positive donors at the UCSD Antiviral Research Center AVRC . Venipuncture samples were collected in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid EDTA blood collection tubes Lavender Cap BD Vacutainer and shipped overnight to the site where the assays were run within two hours of receipt of the samples i.e. within 24 hours of draw . After whole blood samples were processed the tubes were centrifuged and the plasma fraction was also assayed.

As shown in the examples the HIV 1 assay have 100 agreement with known seroreactivity on a collection of 82 HIV Ab positive and 142 HIV Ab negative samples including multiple samples with HCV and syphilis co infection. The treponemal specific syphilis assay correctly identifies 67 of 68 Ab positive and 100 of 102 Ab negative samples. The HCV assay correctly identifies 59 of 60 HCV Ab positive and 120 of 121 HCV Ab negative samples. Multiplexed assay performance on whole blood samples is also demonstrated.

The system described in the examples here combined single use disposable assay cartridges with a reader instrument. Fluorescence assays were illuminated and imaged using a multi mode planar waveguide technology. Various types of planar waveguides have been used in biosensor and immunoassay applications for decades and are the subject of several technical reviews. Briefly a light source typically a laser was directed into a waveguide substrate where it propagated by total internal reflection TIR at the interface between the high index of refraction waveguide glass or plastic and the surrounding medium air or aqueous solution . The present system uses a planar waveguide system as disclosed for example in aforementioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 617 535.

Samples are processed in cartridges on the bench top at ambient temperature which in this study was approximately 20 to 25 C. Since the assay procedure may be performed independently of the reader instrument sample cartridges may be batch processed with up to 30 run in parallel for example. A tilt rack such as that discussed below with respect to may be used during the assay to facilitate the batch processing if desired. Sample volumes for the disposable cartridge are 6 microliters of serum or plasma or 12 microliters of whole blood making the cartridge compatible with finger stick capillary samples. The larger volume for the whole blood samples is believed to be required to compensate for the cell volume.

Results presented here are based on the following sample processing procedure. A 6 microliter aliquot of serum or plasma is diluted in 194 microliters of a diluent PBS 0.5 casein 0.05 Tween20 . 175 microliters of this diluted sample mixture is then loaded into the cartridge input port by transfer pipette. Passive flow through the cartridge during a 15 minute incubation occurs independently of any user interaction. 175 microliters of wash buffer PBS 0.1 Tween20 is then added to the input port and allowed to flow through the cartridge for 3 minutes followed by 175 microliters of dye conjugated anti human IgG in a second diluent PBS 1 mg mL BSA and 0.05 Tween20 and allowed to incubate for 10 minutes. The total per cartridge assay time in the present example is approximately 28 minutes. While the fluorescence signal generated at the assay region of the cartridge may change over time the cartridge may be read on the reader instrument any time within an hour of sample processing without affecting the final test result. Read time and data processing in the reader instrument is approximately 30 seconds per cartridge.

Custom image processing software has been developed for reaction site finding intra site fluorescence signal intensity measurement and normalization. After results reporting the cartridge is removed from the reader instrument and disposed as biohazard waste and the next processed cartridge may be inserted into the reader instrument. The combination of parallel cartridge processing large read window and rapid analysis allows more than 100 samples per work shift to be processed.

The human IgG and anti human IgG control sites were designed to give fluorescence signal comparable to a typical seropositive sample. Obviously total human IgG and the goat anti human IgG fluorescent conjugate were both in large excess relative to the specific antibodies reacting with each of the antigen sites. The IgG print concentrations were adjusted such that the positive control signals fell into an appropriate range.

Images from four clinical plasma samples are shown in along with background subtracted reaction site signal intensities for the pathogen specific antigens. The clinical sample images in are a representative sampling of images generated in the 28 minute cartridge assay. Positive and negative controls are present in these exemplary assays and the printed antigen sites show different intensities for different individual samples. Based on reference test methods samples A through C are each reactive for one pathogen and negative for the other two. Sample D is antibody reactive for all pathogens as indicated by all array antigen sites yielding positive signal. In particular samples A to C are each mono infected with reactivity to HIV Ab A Ab B and HCV Ab C . Sample D has Ab reactivity to all three pathogens both in the reference methods and the assay system as described herein.

The fluorescence arrays are also quantitative. The table in provides quantitative antibody antigen signal intensities associated with each reaction site. Results for each reaction site in the array are reported as background subtracted and normalized fluorescence signal intensity. Background signal is an average of the signal on negative reference sites adjacent to the antigen site of interest. The intensity of the printed human IgG site signal is utilized for normalization and the reported intensity is thus a dimensionless number. Slightly negative numbers result when the signal on the antigen site is lower than the adjacent negative control. All negative numbers encountered are invariably close to zero. Dynamic range of the current reader instrument is approximately 3.5 logs. Normalization by the signal of the anti human IgG spots compensates for potential differences in coupled and collected light between different instruments or cartridges as well as for possible changes in the fluorescent conjugate solution. Decisions about the reactivity of a sample with each disease antigen are based on comparing the normalized antigen signal to a pre determined cutoff value. For each antigen the cutoff value is established by reviewing the signals obtained from a large number of assays with samples known to be positive and negative for each disease. The cutoff value may be chosen to accurately distinguish positive from negative signals for the specific antigen. Significant changes to the antigens and the print or assay conditions may require establishment of new cutoff values for the various antigens in the assay.

Continuing to refer to if the result of decision is YES the sample is ready within reader instrument and process proceeds to a step in which a light source is enabled. The light source may be for example a laser or a light emitting diode LED of an appropriate wavelength and output power for illumination of the sample being evaluated. Additionally a watchdog circuit may be activated so as to safely power down the light source in case of any malfunction. In a step the exposure time of the light source is set. For example a certain number and durations of exposure times may be preset in process . An image frame is acquired in a step and the acquired image is saved to memory in a step . In a decision a determination is made as to whether images have been taken for all preset exposure times. If the result of decision is NO not all exposure times are done then process returns to step and the exposure time setting and image acquisition steps are repeated. If the result of decision is YES images have been acquired at all preset exposure times then the light source is disabled in a step . The acquired and saved images are then analyzed in a step and the analysis results are saved to memory in a step . As an alternative step and may be performed at peripheral device of such as an external computer rather than being integrated onboard reader instrument . Following step process returns to decision . If a new sample cartridge has been inserted then steps are repeated. Otherwise process is ended with exit program step and end step .

Referring now to further details of step of are described. Step is initiated at a start step then in a step a user manually inputs a cartridge identification number cartridge ID into reader instrument . Alternatively reader instrument may include a barcode reader arrangement. In this case a barcode illumination is enabled in a step and a barcode including cartridge ID and placed on cartridge is read into reader instrument . Based on the cartridge ID the appropriate cartridge configuration information is read into reader instrument . Cartridge configuration may include for example specific reagents used on cartridge layout of any printed protein array sites and any other factors that may influence the image analysis. Once the cartridge configuration information has been read in step then reaction sites are located in all saved images in the memory in a step . For example for cartridges with circular printed antigen sites step may involve circle finding routines. In a step the acquired images for each reaction site for the various exposure times are compared and the best acquired image for each reaction site is identified. For instance the selected reaction site may correspond to the longest exposure time that does not saturate the camera. Then in a step a grid corresponding to the printed protein array such as shown in is located. For instance step may include identifying the centers of the circles found in step combining this data with geometry information included in the cartridge configuration then refining the analysis according to a least squares fit of predefined parameters in the cartridge configuration.

Still referring to a reaction site signal is calculated for each reaction site in the printed protein array in a step . In particular as an example the radius of each reaction site is calculated as an average of found reaction sites the raw signal is integrated over the reaction sites then a per pixel average at the camera is calculated as the reaction site signal. In a step a normalization process is implemented in order to calculate normalized signals for the reaction sites using for instance a power normalization algorithm. In a step signals at each antigen site is determined to calculate antigen signals. For instance step may involve the identification of the antigen sites in accordance with the cartridge configuration then averaging the signals at the antigen sites. Additionally a look up table may be used as an error control such as in the case of noisy signals highly fluctuating signal intensity etc. Finally the calculated antigen signals are compared against predetermined cut offs so as to determine the disease status for the various antigens in a step . The image analysis step is ended in an end step and the process proceeds to step of .

As previously described the specific steps of process as shown in may be performed onboard reader instrument or at peripheral device of .

With the combination of commercial positive controls the UCSD HIV 1 samples the CDPHE Syphilis samples the UCSD Co Infection samples and the negative controls a total of 251 different samples serum and plasma are presented in this clinical results section. It is emphasized that antibody reactivity against all antigens in is measured simultaneously for each sample.

A total of 224 samples in the collection had known HIV 1 seroreactivity status with 82 HIV 1 Ab positive and 142 HIV 1 Ab negative. Antibody reactivity signal as described above against the two HIV antigens in the array gp41 and p24 are linked to the known HIV Ab reactivity status and plotted in . Reaction site signal intensity is the background subtracted normalized intensity as discussed above. The horizontal solid bar in each box represents the median upper and lower boundaries of the boxes are the 75th and 25th percentiles and the upper and lower whisker bars are the 90th and 10th percentiles respectively. The open circles represent samples with values above and below the 90th and 10th percentiles. The dashed lines are empirically derived cutoffs. shows antibody reactivity results for a total of 224 samples with known HIV 1 Ab reactivity status 82 positive and 142 negative .

Ideally samples that are known HIV Ab negative should show little or no intensity on the HIV antigen sites. As expected gp41 and p24 signal results are clustered near zero for these negative samples. We note that the gp41 sites do show some cross reactivity with normalized signals between 0 and 0.4 on this scale. For the HIV Ab positive samples we see a distribution of intensities. A strong gp41 antibody response is expected in seroconverted individuals represented in this collection and the gp41 results are consistent with this expectation. One known HIV Ab positive sample does show low signal on the gp41 site. This particular sample yielded robust signal on the p24 site. For the collection reactivity against the p24 antigen is varied as seen in .

The data plots of are used to establish empiric cutoff values that will be used for subsequent signal cutoff S CO calculations. Cutoffs are set near the highest signal negative sample in the collection. Increasing the cutoff value will yield a more specific assay fewer false positives . Decreasing the cutoff will yield a more sensitive assay fewer false negatives . Given that the antibody reactivity status of the samples in this collection was known individual antigen cutoffs were adjusted empirically to optimize effective sensitivity and specificity. We note that the results obtained in this study are based on a self referential dataset i.e. we are applying the cutoff to the same data used to generate the cutoff. We therefore do not report results in terms of sensitivity and specificity. On the scale shown in the gp41 and p24 cutoffs are set at a value above the highest signal negative sample in the collection cutoffs are 0.45 and 0.16 respectively . If it is assumed that a S CO 1 for either antigen constitutes overall HIV 1 Ab reactivity for that sample then the cutoffs as defined yield 100 agreement between the multiplex assay as described herein and the reference result.

A total of 170 samples in the collection had known antibody reactivity status including 68 treponemal positive and 102 treponemal negative samples. Results for the treponemal antigens p17 and p47 are provided in . shows antibody reactivity results for a total of 170 samples with known treponemal Ab reactivity status 68 positive and 102 negative . As described above cutoffs were empirically determined and are indicated on the plots. Applying these cutoffs to the 170 samples we report treponemal Ab reactivity on 67 of 68 known treponemal Ab reactive samples one false negative . The assay correctly identifies 100 of 102 treponemal negatives two false positives . Next steps will be to improve specific activity and minimize non specific binding to the treponemal antigen sites.

A total of 181 samples had known HCV antibody reactivity including 60 HCV Ab positive and 121 HCV Ab negative. Results for the four recombinant antigens are provided in which shows the antibody reactivity in the exemplary assay for 181 clinical samples with known HCV antibody serostatus 60 positive and 121 negative . Reaction site signal intensity is the background subtracted normalized intensity described in the text. Antibody reactivity against all antigens is measured simultaneously for each sample. The dashed lines are empirically derived cutoffs for the core and NS3 recombinant antigens. The synthetic NS4 and Multi multiple epitope antigens showed relatively high signals on the HCV Ab negative samples so cutoffs for these two antigens were not used in subsequent analyses.

Continuing to refer to a large spread of antibody reactivity signals is observed as expected. The core and NS3 antigens appear to provide the best overall performance in terms of distinguishing positive from negative. The two multiple epitope antigens NS4 and Multi did not offer a benefit over the core and NS3 antigens in this assay. Using these results cutoffs were set for the core and NS3 antigen as described above. With the selected cutoffs the assay correctly identifies 59 of 60 positive and 120 of 121 negative HCV samples. shows a large number of samples positive and negative near the cutoff values. Antigen selection and activity improvements are required to improve robustness of the HCV assay.

Because point of care is the target application of the present system whole blood performance of the assay system is an important demonstration. Lateral flow based RDT s typically incorporate a sample pad material designed to capture red blood cells RBCs without promoting hemolysis as the RBCs and hemoglobin can interfere with the colorimetric read of the device. The present system has no such requirement that is 6 whole blood in buffer may be added directly to the device with no separation of cellular components prior to running the standard assay protocol described above.

Representative whole blood assay results are provided in which present whole blood performance in direct comparison to plasma from the same blood tube. shows comparison of whole blood and plasma performance on the exemplary system. Cartridges were processed with 6 whole blood or 3 plasma from the same venipuncture sample approximately 24 hours after draw. The larger volume of whole blood was to approximately compensate for cell volume. The array layout was as in . Images for the whole blood and plasma from this HIV positive sample were essentially identical as shown in demonstrating that there is no cellular or hemoglobin induced interference in the system. The bar graph provides quantitative output for the gp41 p24 and anti human IgG sites on the arrays demonstrating the same quantitative signal profile for the whole blood and plasma samples. This particular sample had strong reactivity to the gp41 antigen but very little reactivity to p24.

Note that the anti human IgG is printed at very low concentration in the array with activity tuned to give signal on the same scale as positive antigen sites. Total IgG is in large excess in the sample. Data presented are mean values for three replicate cartridges for each sample type. Error bars represent one standard deviation.

The whole blood and plasma assay described above and shown in include triplicate measurements of the same blood or plasma sample 6 cartridges total providing an initial assessment of system reproducibility. Defining coefficient of variation CV as the standard deviation of the three measurements divided by the mean the following results were observed. For the plasma samples gp41 S CO CV was 10 . For the whole blood samples it was 13 . For the anti human IgG sites the plasma samples gave 11 CV and the whole blood gave 4 . These are reasonable initial results for a 28 minute whole blood assay CVs are expected to improve as manufacturing controls are augmented during scale up.

In another configuration not shown antigens may be printed to a solid substrate that is then incorporated in a fluidic cartridge that includes a fluid inlet port. The antigens may be printed for example in a spot or stripe and multiple antigens may be printed in an array format. Similarly to the microwell protocol described above a biological sample is added to the fluidic cartridge and if present target antibodies bind to the printed antigens. After a wash step to remove excess biological sample a labeling step then another wash step to remove excess labeled detect antibody the fluidic cartridge may be imaged using a reader instrument see for example Myatt C. J. et al. Low cost multiplexed biosensor for disease diagnosis Proc. SPIE 7167 Frontiers in Pathogen Detection From Nanosensors to Systems 716703 2009 which is incorporated herein in its entirety .

While the indirect fluorescence assay has proven utility the multi step process may be undesirable for certain applications particularly in the context of rapid point of care or point of need testing. A potentially simpler workflow approach is known in the field as the double antigen sandwich method See for example U.S. Pat. No. 6 120 990 to Brust et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 7 629 295 to Wienhues et al. . The double antigen sandwich method takes advantage of the multi valent nature of immunoglobulin Ig molecules. Instead of the anti immunoglobulin detect format used in the indirect fluorescence assay described above the detect reagent is a labeled antigen containing the same binding epitope as the immobilized antigen. The antigen may be for example a purified natural protein recombinant protein synthetic peptide or other biological molecular representing an immunogenic target. The label may be an enzyme e.g. HRP or alkaline phosphatase for use with colorimetric or chemiluminescence signal transduction. The label may also be a fluorescent dye nanoparticle microparticle light scattering particle or some other labeling system. In the double antigen configuration the target antibody is sandwiched between the surface immobilized antigen and the labeled detect antigen.

There may be several advantages to the double antigen sandwich approach. Importantly the format provides detection of multiple immunoglobulin types IgG and its subtypes IgM etc. . The format also is amenable to simplified workflow protocols as wash and detect reagent steps may be eliminated.

Various versions of the double antigen sandwich concept have been described in the literature and incorporated into commercially available assays including for example tests for detection of anti HIV antibodies such as SD Bioline HIV 1 2 3.0 Standard Diagnostics Inc. Uni Gold Recombigen HIV Trinity Biotech plc ARCHITECT Abbott Laboratories Determine Alere and COBAS CORE Anti HIV 1 HIV 2 EIA DAGS CORE HIV 1 2 Roche . See also Zaaijer et al. The Lancet vol. 340 pp. 770 772 1992 and Miolini et al. Journal of Immunological Methods vol. 20 pp. 25 34 1978 . This technique has become known as the third generation of HIV antibody detection because it is capable of identifying a broader range of antibody types than previous first and second generation tests. The technique is also often incorporated into the current fourth generation HIV antigen antibody combination assays.

The simple labeled antigen assay technique as described herein provides a number of advantages over existing technology. For example current third and fourth generation HIV diagnostic assays that use the double antigen sandwich approach require integration into an immunochromatographic e.g. lateral flow device which requires colorimetric visual interpretation or into an expensive fully integrated automated system with automated fluidic handling and optical readout. The labeled antigen assay in the present embodiment generates signal through fluorescence imaging of captured complexes with evanescent illumination. As described herein the combination of labeled antigens evanescent illumination and fluorescent detection provides advantages of simplicity i.e. minimal user interactions speed i.e. time to result multiplexing i.e. multiple assay results for a single sample and compatibility with complex sample matrices e.g. whole blood . In addition the system described herein provides a means to perform assays based on kinetic data enables numerous in assay controls and can provide means for automatically timing the assay. The approach also allows fluorescence signal acquisition of bound complexes on the surface without the need for washing away of residual unbound fluorescent markers in the liquid volume above the surface thus allowing a truly one step process from biological sample introduction through signal acquisition. While a wash step may still be useful in some applications of the labeled antigen assay described herein the potential elimination of the wash step may provide a significant advantage over existing assay protocols.

Continuing to refer to assay process then proceeds to a step in which a biological sample such as a serum sample is reacted with a labeled antigen mix. The labeled antigen mix may be provided by the assay system manufacturer or custom formulated by the assay system user. The mixed sample is then added to a fluidic sample chamber in a step . Optionally excess labeled antigen mix may be washed away from assay surface in an optional step . The fluorescence signal at the assay surface is then imaged by the assay system in a step and then the captured image may be analyzed in a step .

The assay described with respect to this example may be reduced to a single step assay in which the only user interaction is the introduction of biological sample to the assay device. In an embodiment the labeled antigen mix may be immobilized within the fluidic sample chamber using conventional methods such as lyophilization. For example the labeled antigen mix may be lyophilized along with sugar based stabilizers at or near an inlet port of the assay system. Upon biological sample introduction the labeled antigen mix is rehydrated and target antibody labeled antigen complexes are formed. The complexes may then bind to the appropriate immobilized antigen sites on the assay surface thereby forming the antigen antibody antigen complexes as previously described. A further advantage of this embodiment is that the sensitivity of assay system may allow elimination of subsequent wash steps. In particular when using planar waveguide illumination the evanescent field is localized within a few hundred nanometers of the assay surface for visible light illumination. Consequently fluorescent dye in the bulk solution of the fluidic sample chamber does not contribute to the fluorescence signal measured at detection system . The result is a true single step assay a biological sample is added to cartridge which is then imaged on detection system in step and subsequently analyzed in step . Alternatively a final wash step may potentially yield improved signal to background performance in the assay and may therefore be useful in certain assay applications. Several methods for the final wash step may be envisioned. For example this step may be a simple wash buffer addition introduced by the user from a dropper bottle. Alternatively the final wash buffer may be stored on board the device such as in a blister pack that is either deployed by the user or automatically by activation in the detection system.

We note that the workflow outlined in is only exemplary. Other embodiments may have different sequences of steps or additional modifications.

Recombinant antigens associated with human immunodeficiency virus HIV and causative organism of syphilis were printed in duplicate as a geometrically defined array on assay surface of planar waveguide using a conventional arraying robot Bio Dot . gp 41 and HIV 1 p24 protein were printed for HIV infection analysis while proteins p17 and p47 were printed for detection of syphilis antibodies.

Aliquots of the antigens printed to the array were covalently labeled with fluorescent dye Alexa 647 and quantitated by UV absorbance. Optimal working concentrations of labeled antigens were determined empirically and a labeled antigen mix of antigens at two times the working concentration in assay buffer 1 1 phosphate buffered saline PBS 1 bovine serum albumin BSA 0.05 Tween 20 Poly oxyethylene x sorbitane monolaurate purified for membrane research and available from Roche was formulated.

10 microliters of human serum was mixed with 10 microliters of 2 labeled antigen mix in a microcentrifuge tube. The full volume was introduced to a fluidic sample chamber and allowed to incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature. The incubated sample was imaged with imaging device without any further processing. The signal to noise ratio SNR value for the captured fluorescence signal was derived according to the following formula 

In another embodiment assay system may be combined with the labeled antigen assay described herein to generate kinetic assay data rather than the more common end point assay approach. Due to the fact that the detection system is relatively insensitive to fluorescent dye in the bulk solution assay system may be used to collect real time data as the labeled antigen target antibody complexes bind to the immobilized antigens on the assay surface. Real time data collection allows collection of kinetic parameters that offer several potential advantages. For example initial binding rate information may be used for very rapid assays. Because initial binding rate is directly related to the concentration of target analyte in solution kinetic assays may potentially provide quantitative data with initial binding rate linked to bulk solution concentration. For qualitative assays a biological sample with a large concentration of target analyte will show signal very quickly relative to a negative control. Example kinetic data are provided in from an experiment described in detail below. In this example two target analyte concentrations are distinguished from each other and from the negative control within 5 minutes of biological sample addition. The labeled antigen assay allows real time acquisition of signal from the assay surface in the presence of the sample mixture. Therefore the rate of accumulation of signal on a specific antigen feature may be tracked in real time as a kinetic assay. As an example a labeled antigen assay was performed as in Example 1 except fluorescence images were acquired at time points over fixed intervals for two biological samples varying in concentration of human serum 50 dilution and 0.58 dilution respectively and one biological sample of known negative HIV status VBMA90015 01 See . Signal intensity varied in both rate of increase and final intensity as a function of concentration of serum sample with both the HIV positive samples showing more and faster accumulation of signal than the negative control sample. This result suggests the possibility of a diagnostic assay for analyzing the presence and concentration of targets by the rate of signal acquisition.

The experiment and data in EXAMPLE 11 may also be used as a demonstration of an extremely rapid HIV 1 antibody detection assay. illustrates the collection of kinetic data. Alternatively one may define an end point assay at for example 5 minutes. Reviewing the data shown in one sees that a high concentration HIV sample a lower concentration sample and a negative control are all readily distinguished in terms of quantitative fluorescence output. is thus a demonstration of a very rapid i.e. in minutes HIV 1 antibody detection assay.

In another embodiment system may be combined with the labeled antigen assay described herein to perform assays in complex sample matrices. Because of the evanescent illumination approach the assay is relatively insensitive to various components encountered in the bulk solution. For example many immunoassays require serum or plasma specimens as the cellular components of whole blood may interfere with assay performance. Whole blood assay devices such as immunochromatographic strip assays typically require a cell separation membrane upstream from the readout zone as red blood cells and hemolytic products can interfere with readout on these devices. Example whole blood assay results are provided in from an experiment described immediately below.

In an embodiment whole blood is assayed using the labeled antigen assay described above. The ability to analyze whole blood may extend the utility of a point of care assay by reducing the need for biological sample preparation and the inherently necessary laboratory infrastructure. For example a process flow may be envisioned in which whole blood from a fingerstick is applied directly to a labeled antigen assay cartridge wherein a single addition of assay reagents completes the assay procedure. To demonstrate the feasibility of such a process flow using the labeled antigen assay on the assay system described above whole blood samples from HIV positive donors were drawn into EDTA blood tubes to inhibit coagulation. A portion of each sample was withdrawn and centrifuged to obtain plasma by removal of red blood cells. Then the above labeled antigen assay procedures were performed using concentrations of 90 whole blood 50 whole blood and 50 plasma. As may be seen from the signal to noise ratio results clearly demonstrate efficacy of the method using either whole blood or plasma. Further the results were comparable when using 50 or 90 whole blood. Cellular and other components in the whole blood do not appear to interfere with the assay.

In another embodiment fluidic sample chamber in cartridge may be specifically designed to improve assay performance by controlling fluid flow rates over the assay surface. Static incubations in small fluidic channels generally have limits of detection set by mass transport limitations e.g. diffusion in the system. By engineering fluidic sample chamber geometry i.e. length width height shape and surface energies sample flow rate over the assay surface can be optimized for improved assay performance.

In another embodiment the disclosed system and method are used to detect both antiviral antibodies and viral antigen s in the same sample in a single combination assay. In the context of HIV infection detection of antibodies against the virus is a well established diagnostic tool. Serological testing however only detects infection after the individual has developed an immune response leaving a window phase where viral replication is occurring but no detectable antibodies are present in the host. By adding direct detection of HIV viral antigen such as p24 capsid protein infection may be detected earlier during the window phase. This so called antigen antibody combination assay sometimes referred to as the 4generation of HIV blood diagnostics assays may provide more timely and sensitive test results as compared to antibody only tests.

In this example p24 antigen is used to illustrate the HIV antigen antibody combination detection assay in a sandwich immunoassay using two purified mononclonal antibodies mAbs to detect the p24 antigen. It is to be understood that polyclonal antibodies can also be used as either capture or detect antibodies. For the purpose of this example a mAb mAb pair was used. It is to be understood that other HIV antigens may be used as target proteins. Mouse mononclonal antibodies against HIV 1 p24 antigen were obtained from commercial vendors such as ImmunoDiagnostics Inc. Catalog 1103 Meridian Life science Inc. cat C65690M Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Catalog sc 57827 United States Biological Catalog H6003 33D H6003 30A H6003 27J H6004 72 H6004 73 and H6004 74 Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Catalog MA1 83231 PerkinElmer Inc. Catalog NEA 9306001 Maine Biotechnology Services Catalog MAB739P and NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program Catalog 3537 4121 6457 and 6458 . Alternatively polyclonal anti p24 antibodies may be commercially sourced from vendors such as United States Biological Catalog H6005 and H6003 27A Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Catalog PA1 85555 and Maine Biotechnology Services Catalog PAB7103P .

An appropriate mAb pair was selected based on pairwise screen as commonly performed in sandwich immunoassay development. One mAb was printed to the activated waveguide surface using a robotic arrayer Bio Dot Inc. and is referred to as the capture antibody. The second antibody in the pair also called the detect antibody was conjugated to biotin in a standard NETS ester crosslinking reaction consisting of the antibody and NHS PEG12 Biotin Pierce Biotechnology Rockford Ill. then purified by size exclusion chromatography.

It is to be noted that antibodies against different epitopes of the antigens may be used. In one aspect antibodies against the same antigen may be combined and tested in all possible permutations in order to identify the best pair with the highest specificity and sensitivity. For example three different antibodies Abs A B and C may be tested as antibody pairs A B B A A C C A B C and C B with the first antibody being the capture antibody and the second antibody being the detect antibody. Samples with known antigen composition or samples tested using established methods may be used to select the pair having the highest specificity and sensitivity.

In another aspect either the detect antibody or the capture antibody may contain more than one antibody. In another aspect the detect antibody is different from the capture antibody. In some cases the capture antibody and the detect antibody may be interchangeable or in other words the capture antibody may be used as the detect antibody while the detect antibody is used as the capture antibody. In other cases the capture antibody and the detect antibody are unique and are not interchangeable. In another aspect the detect antibodies shall not significantly bind to the capture antibodies. Typically the detect antibodies and the capture antibody bind to different epitopes on the antigen. The detect antibody and the capture antibody may be either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies.

During an infection the host may produce antibodies against the foreign antigens. Antigen bound to these host antibodies may not be detectable by antibody sandwich assays. These antibody antigen complexes may be disrupted with heat low pH followed by pH neutralization salt or combination thereof. These disruption methods may help denature the antibodies which are incapable of re binding the released antigen. Such disruption process may be referred to as decomplexation.

In this example the final detect reagent is streptavidin conjugated with a fluorescent dye SureLight P3 Columbia Biosciences Columbia Md. . If p24 antigen is present in the sample an antibody antigen antibody sandwich is created on the waveguide surface. The streptavidin dye binds to the biotinylated detect antibody and fluorescent signal is detected

The HIV antibody detection assay is similar to that described in Example 8. Recombinant proteins representing HIV 1 envelope glycoprotein 41 gp41 and capsid antigen p24 were printed to the waveguide surface using the Bio Dot arrayer. The detect reagent was goat anti human IgG conjugated to the fluorescent dye DyLight649 KPL Inc. Gaithersburg Md. . Control spots in the array included human IgG detect reagent control and print buffer spots non specific binding control .

Printed waveguide arrays were rinsed and then blocked with a protein based blocker and then coated with a sugar based stabilizer. Processed waveguides were then assembled into disposable cartridges described previously.

Human serum control samples certified as negative for HIV hepatitis C virus and RPR syphilis were sourced commercially Valley Biomedical Winchester Va. . Serum samples from HIV positive individuals were from a sample archive at the Antiviral Research Center San Diego Calif. provided under an Institutional Review Board approved protocol. Three categories of HIV positive samples were provided 1 RNA positive antibody negative samples acute or window phase samples. These samples have been tested negative for HIV 1 2 antibody by Enzyme Immunoassay EIA EIA is considered the most sensitive screening test in this protocol and Western Blots were not run once the negative EIA results was generated 2 Western Blot indeterminate samples and 3 weak positive Western Blot samples. The HIV positive collection therefore represents individuals in the early stages of HIV infection.

Samples were assayed on the cartridges at ambient temperature about 20 to 25 C. . The p24 antigen detection cartridge array contained spatially arrayed anti p24 antibody printed print buffer blanks and fluorescently labeled BSA positioning marker features. At the completion of the assay procedure the cartridges were inserted into the reader instrument for fluorescence imaging. This workflow allows batch processing of the disposable sample cartridges.

Detection of HIV antigen was performed using the following protocol. A 19 microliter aliquot of serum was combined with an 8 microliter volume biotin labeled detection antibody in sample dilution buffer PBS 0.1 Tween 20 non specific binding blocking reagents and mixed by aspiration. Immunoassay blocking buffer components may include bovine serum albumin BSA polymerized BSA fetal calf serum or normal serum from other animal species non fat dry milk or casein alkaline hydrolyzed casein acid hydrolyzed casein fish gelatin polyethylene glycol PEG polyvinyl alcohol PVA polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP thiol reactive compounds such as glutathione and L cysteine and immunoglobulins including IgG from specific animal sources e.g. mouse IgG polymerized IgG and species specific fragments of IgG Fc Fab F ab 2 to block nonspecific binding. Immunoassay blocking buffer may also contain non ionic detergents such as Tween 20 and Triton X 100. 25 microliters of this diluted sample mixture was loaded into the cartridge input port by transfer pipette. The applied sample passively flowed through the cartridge covering the printed array. Static incubation was for 20 minutes without user intervention. Following the sample incubation period a 100 microliter volume of 8 nanomolar streptavidin SureLight P3 in conjugate dilution buffer PBS 0.2 Tween 20 non specific binding blocking reagents was added to the cartridge input port and allowed to passively flow through the cartridge. Following a 20 minute incubation with streptavidin SureLight P3 two 150 microliter volumes of wash buffer PBS 0.2 Tween 20 non specific binding blocking reagents including 10 mg ml bovine serum albumin Roche as above and 0.5 v v fetal bovine serum Atlas Biologicals Fort Collins Colo. were serially added to the input port and each wash was allowed to flow through the cartridge for 5 to 6 minutes. The cartridge was then inserted into the reader instrument for fluorescence data collection. Read time and data processing in the instrument is approximately 30 seconds per cartridge. After results acquisition the cartridge was removed from the reader instrument and disposed as biohazard waste.

Detection of anti HIV antibody was performed using the following protocol. A 6 microliter aliquot of serum or plasma was diluted in 194 microliters of sample dilution buffer PBS 0.5 casein 0.05 Tween 20 . 175 microliters of this diluted sample mixture was then loaded into the cartridge input port by transfer pipette and were allowed to flow passively through the cartridge during a 15 minute incubation period without user intervention. 175 microliters of wash buffer PBS 0.1 Tween 20 was then added to the input port and allowed to flow through the cartridge for 3 minutes followed by the addition of 175 microliters of dye conjugated anti human IgG in a second diluent PBS 1 mg ml BSA 0.05 Tween 20 and allowed to incubate for 10 minutes. The cartridge was then inserted into the reader instrument for fluorescence data collection. Read time and data processing in the instrument was approximately 30 seconds per cartridge. After acquisition of the results the cartridge was removed from the reader instrument and disposed as biohazard waste.

As shown in two of five window phase sera RNA positive antibody negative had detectable p24 antigen in this assay See results for Sample IDs 3 and 4 . These HIV antigen positive samples would not be detected with an antibody only test. None of the Western Blot indeterminate or weak positive samples gave p24 antigen signal above the cutoff threshold. Of particular note however are samples 9 and 13. These are negative in the antibody assay but show S CO at 0.6 on the p24 antigen assay. We believe this antigen signal is real and that these early seroconversion samples have detectable p24 antigen. Further optimization of the cutoffs for the antigen assay will possibly result in these samples achieving positive status on the p24 antigen assay. The lack of p24 antigen signal in most of the antibody positive samples is expected. As a person generates antibodies against the virus circulating p24 antigen becomes bound in antigen antibody complex. In the absence of decomplexation through heat or chemical treatment which results in denaturation of antibodies and release of their bound antigens complexed p24 antigen may not be detected in a sandwich immunoassay like that described here. Because the current p24 antigen assay in this example does not involve decomplexation p24 antigen may not be detectable when it is bound by anti p24 antibody present in the sample. The decomplexation methods described above may be applied to expose the antigen and make it detectable by the disclosed assays.

Of the 10 HIV 1 positive samples with indeterminate Western Blot results the HIV 1 antibody assay gave five positive two indeterminate and three negative results. All of these samples are true positive for HIV infection as defined by the presence of viral RNA. These results suggest that the antibody assay disclosed herein has superior sensitivity relative to the Western Blot reference method. Of the 10 HIV 1 positive samples with weak positive Western Blot results the HIV 1 assay of the present embodiment was positive for all 10.

In summary the combined HIV 1 antigen antibody assay demonstrated here has superior sensitivity to the Western Blot reference method. This includes detection of some samples in the pre seroconversion window phase. We note that in this example each sample was run in two separate cartridge channels one for antigen and one for antibody. By combining the sandwich assay approach demonstrated in Examples 9 and 10 with the sandwich immunoassay described in this Example a single fluidic channel antigen antibody combination assay may also be performed. It is to be noted that the antigen antibody assay may also be modified to detect infections by other agents for example HCV and syphilis among others.

In certain applications such as when more than one addition of a fluid into the assay cartridge is required it may be advantageous to place the assay cartridge at a tilt so as to assist with the fluid flow such as discussed in previously mentioned U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 391 911. show a perspective view and a side view of a cartridge which is a slight modification of cartridge of . Cartridge includes an upper piece and a lower piece . Upper piece includes an inlet port which is located at a distal end from textured grooves in contrast to cartridge . Lower piece additionally includes fin features . As better visible in fin features includes a first portion and a second portion . First and second portions and respectively are configured such that when cartridge is resting on first portion flow plate not visible inside cartridge lies parallel to the resting surface i.e. flat .

Reference is now made to an exemplary cartridge having the configuration of and implementing an integrated lens of . Light propagating in a waveguide substrate incident on the substrate to chamber interface will at angles of incidence 90 greater than i.e. shallower than the critical angle for total internal reflection undergo total internal reflection TIR . For purposes of this discussion the angle of incidence is relative to the surface normal of the planar waveguide that is the angle of incidence is 90 degrees minus the internal propagation angle . For purposes of this discussion it is assumed that the refractive index of chamber is less than that of waveguide substrate . An evanescent field will form at the surface defining the interface between the substrate and chamber propagating along the interface in the direction defined by the projection of the light propagation direction onto the interface. The intensity of the evanescent field as well as its penetration depth into the chamber depends on the angle of incidence. Both the intensity and the penetration depth increase as the incidence angle is decreased towards the critical angle. At angles smaller than i.e. steeper than the critical angle a portion of the light will penetrate into the chamber . The amount of light penetrating into the sample chamber is given by the Fresnel equations and depends on the angle of incidence.

In embodiments utilizing evanescent illumination of analytes on the substrate surface it is desirable to maximize the intensity of the evanescent wave. Intensity maximization is achieved for example by maximizing the amount of light incident on the surface at incident angles very close to but shallower than the critical angle. In order to effectively illuminate the analytes on the surface the penetration depth must be sufficient to reach the analytes. Generally at incidence angles near critical angle while shallower than critical angle the penetration depth is on the order of a fraction of the wavelength of incident light.

The composition of other materials in the chamber not specifically on the surface must be considered as well. If there are materials in the chamber capable of producing a measurable signal of the same form as the signal used to evaluate analytes on the surface the amount of light propagating in the chamber away from the surface will determine the strength of this signal which in a surface based assay will contribute to the background level of the measurement. At incidence angles shallower than critical angle a significant background level may result from a large penetration depth and associated high intensity of the evanescent field. However the most substantial background level arises at incidence angles steeper than the critical angle where a significant portion of the light penetrates the interface and propagates into the surface and through the chamber. A sharp transition occurs at the critical angle with a strong onset of chamber illumination as the incidence angle becomes steeper than the critical angle.

In certain embodiments utilizing a fluorescence based surface assay that utilizes evanescent illumination multiple sources of background exist. These include autofluorescence of the substrate material background associated with the fluorescence detection device itself fluorescence originating from materials in throughout the chamber as discussed in the above light scattering and signal from undesirable fluorescent material on the surface due to e.g. non specific binding.

Optimizing the assay performance includes maximizing the signal to background ratio. Some of the background contributions mentioned above depend on the incidence angle onto the substrate to chamber interface. Specifically the background caused by illumination of fluorescent materials in the chamber depends very strongly on the incidence angle. In systems with significant amounts of fluorescent material in the chamber away from the surface this may be the dominant source of background. In such systems the incidence angle is the critical parameter for optimization of the signal to background ratio and the amount of light incident at angles steeper than the critical angle must be minimized. In systems with little or no fluorescent material in the chamber away from the interface the incidence angle may be set very close to critical angle in order to increase the signal from the fluorescence based surface assay compared to other background sources that are either insensitive to the incidence angle such as background intrinsic to the detection device or vary relatively slowly with the incidence angle such as the substrate autofluorescence.

Adjusting the incidence angles onto the interface may affect other aspects of the system. For instance in a waveguide the intensity profile of the evanescent wave as a function of position on the waveguide in the direction of light propagation is determined by the range of incidence angles onto the interface. If the light propagating inside the waveguide is a narrow and collimated beam the intensity profile will have a sharp on off pattern which restricts the useful surface area to distinct locations coinciding with illuminated areas. For a diverging beam the profile will initially close to the focus have some degree of an on off pattern. Bounces may be apparent in the evanescent illumination profile. However as the beam propagates down the length of the waveguide it will continue to diverge and the bounces will begin to mix to the point where the illumination is virtually uniform. From this point on the entire surface area is available for surface assay measurements. The system performance requirements infer the requirements to illumination uniformity. For instance illumination uniformity to within 5 may be acceptable. In a system with a diverging beam propagating inside the waveguide the point at which the acceptable uniformity is reached shifts away from the focus if the incidence angle onto the interface is made shallower and or if the divergence angle is decreased.

The integrated waveguide offers an unusually simple method for optimizing the incidence angle onto the substrate to chamber interface. With an integrated waveguide such as that depicted in the height defined by distance y at which the light enters the waveguide lens is directly related to the propagation angle inside the substrate as discussed above. Hence the propagation angle can be adjusted by adjusting the height of entry. For a light beam which will always have a non zero extent the range of entry heights must be considered. Specifically the intensity profile as a function of entry height determines the propagation properties internally in the substrate and consequently the properties of chamber illumination.

In this example the laser height defined by distance y of in a system such as that embodied in was varied to determine the optimal laser height both an assay with detect solution in the chamber . The signal background and signal to background ratio were mapped out for a cartridge containing a printed array of fluorescent features. The chamber was filled with a 20 g mL AlexaFluor 647 labeled anti human IgG detect solution. Prior to performing this experiment the optimal laser height was determined for an assay without detect solution in the chamber. This value was used as the zero point point for the laser height in the present experiment. Images of the cartridge were recorded as a function of laser height. Two parameters were extracted from each image a The signal within printed features averaged over all features here denoted array signal and b the signal on the downstream in terms of light propagation side of the array here denoted off array background . The array signal is the sum of the true surface signal from the array features and the background from fluorescence material in the channel as measured by the off array background .

Next the illumination uniformity within the array region was evaluated. Numerous different methods have been utilized to evaluate the illumination uniformity. The present experiment utilized a cartridge in which the assay surface of the waveguide substrate was coated in a near uniform fashion with a solution containing AlexaFluor 647 labeled Bovine Serum Albumin. The chamber contained non fluorescing buffer. This allowed the recording of the surface illumination profile as a function of longitudinal position. The measurement was performed at multiple different laser heights thereby mapping out the range of laser heights providing sufficient illumination uniformity within the array region. A visual inspection of the illumination profiles is informative and often provides the best assessment of the illumination uniformity when the measurement is based on fluorescently coated cartridges. Alternatively the inter pixel coefficient of variation within the array region may be calculated and compared to the required illumination uniformity.

In the present experiment a visual inspection of the line profiles yielded that the illumination uniformity was sufficient at laser heights below 35 mils. Thus the system is optimized for signal to background ratio and illumination uniformity with a laser height in the range 30 35 mils.

The optimal laser height for the above example 15 with detect solution in the chamber is significantly different from the optimal laser height for the identical system with no detect solution in the chamber . Without detect solution in the channel the dominant background in the system considered here depends on the exact assay properties. In some assays the dominant background is autofluorescence from the waveguide substrate. In this case it is advantageous to maximize the surface signal by operating very close to the critical angle. The autofluorescence does increase as the incidence angle gets steeper. However this increase is slower than that of the surface signal.

In additional embodiments non specific binding of fluorescent material to the waveguide surface is the dominant background. In these cases the adjustable laser height does not offer means of reducing the relative background contribution from non specific binding and the optimal laser height is a height for which the surface signal is sufficiently bright that the background contribution from other sources is negligible.

An alternative method for evaluating the illumination uniformity as pertaining to an assay with a printed array such as printed reaction sites discussed above with specified spot locations and sizes is based on recording images of arrays containing identical printed features in all the locations used in the assay. The inter feature coefficient of variation as a function of longitudinal position is an example of a measure that provides an evaluation of the functional illumination uniformity. In addition the absolute deviation of the brightness of individual features from the average feature brightness is a useful metric that helps identify single or a relatively low number of outlying values which may not contribute significantly to the coefficient of variation. These may stem from relatively local non uniformities such as those caused by the first portion of the array being located too close to the laser focal point where the illumination has not yet reached the required uniformity.

By adjusting the illumination beam height as discussed above in Example 15 using for example a cartridge with an integrated lens as discussed herein the system can be modified to illuminate a cartridge in the low index of refraction interrogation medium waveguide configuration as discussed in reference to above . In this low n Medium the full height of the fluidic channel e.g. channel is illuminated which facilitates readout of solution phase assays. The solution phase signal may be detected in conjunction with a surface based signal. In an embodiment the beam height i.e. the distance from the apex of the integrated lens to the center of the light beam is fixed to illuminate the cartridge in the low index of refraction interrogation medium configuration and the solution phase signal is read out in a region with no surface specific signal. In another embodiment an additional surface specific signal from e.g. one or more printed features is read out in addition to the solution phase signal. In yet another embodiment the beam height may be adjusted during readout such that the solution phase signal is read out with the beam set to illuminate in the low index of refraction interrogation medium configuration while a surface specific signal from e.g. one or more printed features is read out with the beam height set for evanescent illumination of analytes in the immediate vicinity of the substrate guiding the illumination.

In embodiments detecting both solution phase signal and surface specific signal the surface specific signals may serve one or more of numerous roles a surface specific signal may stem from a surface based assay and provide assay results in addition to the solution phase assay results. It may stem from control features used to evaluate e.g. proper sample and or reagent addition and assay functionality. It may stem from calibration features used to e.g. normalize the surface phase signal to calibration signals indicative of the amount of light and or detection reagent provided to the sample.

In the following two exemplary embodiments are discussed i.e. a laser based system and a LED based system in which the beam height is set to illuminate the sample in the low index of refraction interrogation medium configuration discussed in reference to . Both embodiments serve to determine assay results for a solution phase based assay utilizing the fluorophore fluorescein. Also in both embodiments the waveguide contains printed fluorescein features. In the specific experiments presented below these features are used as controls for the reproducibility of the illumination intensity. Alternatively the solution phase signal could be normalized to the signal from the printed fluorescein features thereby correcting for any variability in illumination intensity. In one embodiment the illumination source is a direct laser diode while in the other embodiment an LED is used for illumination.

The fluorescein fluorescence emission is centered around a wavelength of approximately 525 nm. The emission filter in the imaging system has a bandpass centered at 525 nm with a width of 50 nm. The laser based embodiment utilizes a direct 50 mW 445 nm laser diode and the LED based embodiment utilizes a 25 mW 470 nm LED.

Solutions with fluorescein labeled oligo nucleotides were prepared at concentrations ranging from 300 pM to 30 M with an additional solution containing no fluorescein resulting in a titration curve. Each solution was loaded into a cartridge containing several printed fluorescein features. For each cartridge images were recorded at multiple exposure times thereby accommodating the wide range of fluorescein concentrations across the full set of cartridges while exposing all cartridges to the same amount of laser light. The time for which a cartridge was exposed to laser light was minimized in order to minimize bleaching of the fluorescein. This also reduced heating of the laser itself which resulted in stable laser operation and reproducible illumination intensity. The reader control software ensured that each cartridge was exposed to the laser beam for the same length of time.

In the present experiment the printed fluorescein features were used to evaluate the illumination intensity. However no normalization to this signal was performed since the variability of the illumination intensity as evaluated by the printed fluorescein features was found to be insignificant noise in which case the added statistical error associated with including additional measurements in the calculation of the final assay results would have increased the random error on the final assay results. In an alternative embodiment with significant variability in illumination intensity due to e.g. ambient temperature variation as would be experienced in a setting without environmental controls normalization to the printed fluorescein features would improve the assay results variability by removing systematic errors in excess of the statistical error introduced by normalization.

The solution phase signal was read out in a region away from the printed features. In this region the signal consists of three components assay signal autofluorescence and camera noise. The camera noise is extracted from a region of the image representing a portion of the camera sensor not exposed to external light and subtracted in each image prior to assay signal analysis. For each cartridge the optimal exposure time was found as the exposure time where the solution phase signal was as bright as possible without saturating the camera sensor. The image recorded at the optimal exposure time was used for data analysis. All extracted signals were then scaled to a common exposure time of 100 ms.

In this embodiment incorporating a LED based light source an uncollimated 470 nm LED with a specified emission angle of 7 half intensity beam angle was installed. Due to the relatively broadband emission of the LED the illumination head was further equipped with an excitation filter bandpass filter with 22 nm wide bandpass centered at 470 nm . The measured power after the excitation filter was 25 mW. The illumination head was mounted as close to the location of the integrated lens as possible in order to get the maximum amount of LED light coupled into the waveguide. The illumination head height i.e. the height from the apex of the integrated lens to the center of the illumination head of the LED was optimized to yield the strongest solution phase signal which was achieved when operating in the low index of refraction interrogation configuration. A titration curve was recorded following the same procedure as for the laser based system.

Cartridge portion includes a planar waveguide coupled to an integrated lens . Planar waveguide may include a plurality of printed capture molecules located on a planar surface thereof. Cartridge portion additionally includes cartridge elements that form fluidic channel . In one embodiment cartridge portion is similar to cartridge discussed in reference to . In another embodiment cartridge portion is similar to cartridges or discussed in reference to . Although not illustrated in cartridge portion may additionally include cartridge housing i.e. plastic rubber metal or any other material surrounding the illustrated elements.

Reader instrument portion includes a cartridge receiving mechanism not shown a detector subsystem i.e. imaging device and filtering optics and a light source mounted on a vertical translation stage . Vertical translation stage allows the height of the light beam i.e. the height from the apex of the integrated lens to the center of the light beam to be altered without requiring movement of the cartridge portion . Further because of the characteristics of the integrated lens translation of the height of the light beam allows for optimization of the assay performance as discussed above in Example 15.

In certain embodiments reader portion additionally includes a beam shaping element . For example in preferred embodiments the laser beam is adjusted to result in high signal over background ratio and good illumination uniformity within the detection region. For robustness and reliability of the system as well as manufacturability it is further desired that some variation in the alignment of the laser beam relative to the cartridge in the dimension transverse to the beam propagation direction and perpendicular to the axis of the waveguide coupling lens can be tolerated. The tolerance on this parameter is determined by the beam height range within which the signal background ratio and the illumination uniformity meet requirements. In addition to the laser beam height relative to the cartridge beam shaping may be employed to further optimize the performance of the system. Beam shaping may be in the form of changing the waists of the beam produced by light source and or be performed by beam shaping element . In some embodiments non Gaussian beam shaping may be advantageously employed.

The dominant background contribution is the signal originating from fluorescent material in the sample chamber in certain configurations. Examples of such configurations include systems where the assay results are recorded with fluorescence detect solution present in the sample chamber. The signal background ratio approximately equals the ratio of the surface signal i.e. the assay signal to the solution signal. The best performing system is achieved when the illumination beam is aligned and shaped e.g. using beam shaping element to a provide as much power as possible close to the critical angle for total internal reflection resulting in high surface signal b provide significant power over a range of angles near the critical angle leading to good illumination uniformity c minimize the amount of light incident on the assay surface at angles steeper than the critical angle thereby minimizing solution induced background and d provide tolerance to variation in the alignment of the laser beam relative to the cartridge as well as tolerance to beam size shape variation. The system performance can be improved by tailoring the illumination beam shape in a height differentiated fashion to account for the physical effects of illumination at different heights relative to the cartridge.

Example 15 above discusses how to optimize the height of a Gaussian laser beam to meet the requirements to both surface signal and solution signal ratio and illumination uniformity. However an alternate embodiment utilizes a laser beam with a larger beam waist in the dimension transverse to the beam propagation direction and perpendicular to the axis of the waveguide coupling lens. For example in the present example the beam waist has been expanded by approximately a factor of 3 relative to the beam used in Example 15. In the following description the beam shape is altered from a symmetrical shape to a truncated shape where the rays that would otherwise impinge on the assay surface at relatively steep angles are removed from the beam by a simple beam block.

An experiment was performed in which the laser beam height relative to the cartridge was fixed at a value found to produce good assay signal and illumination uniformity but solution signal significantly greater than what was deemed tolerable for the system. A beam block i.e. beam block was inserted into the beam path and a cartridge was imaged at a range of different beam block heights. The cartridge contained a printed array of identical fluorescent features AlexaFluor 647 labeled Bovine Serum Albumin BSA . The array was a rectangular 2 15 feature array i.e. 2 rows of 15 features each down the waveguide along the beam propagation direction. The sample chamber contained AlexaFluor 647 labeled BSA at a concentration of 20 g mL. The printed array provided means for evaluating the surface signal and the illumination uniformity while the fluorescent sample chamber solution was used to evaluate the solution induced signal. The system optimized in Example 15 was used as a reference system and the cartridge was measured in this system as well.

At each beam block height the signal from each array feature was extracted from the images and used to calculate both an average surface signal and an inter column coefficient of variation CV . The inter column CV was based on the average signal from the two printed features in each of the 15 columns of the array and calculated as the ratio of the sample standard deviation to the average. The inter column CV was used as an illumination uniformity metric. The solution signal was extracted from the images as an off array background in a region downstream in the direction of light propagation from the array. shows the solution signal as a function of beam block height the latter indicated as the distance from an arbitrary common point of reference. The dotted line indicates the value obtained in the reference system discussed in Example 15. Table 1 below shows the Inter column CV and average surface signal as a function of beam block height for the present system as well as the corresponding values obtained with the reference system.

It is clear that the solution signal dramatically decreases as the beam block is raised to block the lower portion of the laser beam that contains rays corresponding to steep angles of incidence onto the assay surface. At beam block heights 380 mils and above the solution signal is below that measured in the reference system. Meanwhile the average surface signal only decreases slightly and the illumination uniformity is unaffected at beam block heights up to 395 mils. Consequently the range 380 395 mils is a good range for the beam block height. Based on these results the final beam block height is set to 385 mils.

Since the limit imposed on the incidence angles onto the assay surface by the beam block is determined by the position of the beam block relative to the waveguide coupling lens the beam block should in preferred embodiments be in a fixed position relative to this lens. This could be achieved by incorporating the beam block directly into the cartridge or alternatively relying on good registration of the cartridge in the reader into the reader.

Finally the tolerance on the laser beam height relative to the cartridge was evaluated with the beam block in place at the height found by the above optimization. In this experiment the beam block and cartridge were fixed while the laser beam height was scanned. As in the above the uniformity was assessed by imaging a cartridge containing a printed array of 2 15 identical AlexaFluor 647 labeled BSA features. The measured inter column CV is listed in Table 2 below for three different laser beam heights spanning a range of 20 mils.

The 0 mils entry in Table 2 indicates the laser height used in the experiment performed to optimize the beam block height see above . Although the inter column CV does increase slightly away from 0 mils the measured inter column CVs are still within the requirements. It is concluded that the laser beam height tolerance with the beam block in place is 20 mils which is a reasonable value from a manufacturing perspective.
