The present invention relates to an injection device for injecting a substance such as a drug into a patient.

One of the most common routes of administration for medications is by injection such as intravenous subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. A syringe containing the medication is used for the injection which typically is carried out by trained medical personnel. In certain instances a patient is trained in the use of the syringe to allow for self injection. Moreover certain medications are formulated in pre filled syringes for patient use to avoid the need for the patient to fill the syringe. Some patients however may be averse to carrying out self injection particularly if the patient has a fear of needles.

Automatic injection devices offer an alternative to a syringe for delivering a medication. Automatic injection devices have been used for example to deliver medications under emergency conditions such as to administer epinephrine to counteract the effects of a severe allergic reaction for example as caused by a food allergy. Automatic injection devices also have been described for use in administering antiarrhythmic medications and selective thrombolytic agents during a heart attack see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 910 260 4 004 577 4 689 042 4 755 169 and 4 795 433 . Various types of automatic injection devices also are described in for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 941 130 4 261 358 5 085 642 5 092 843 5 102 393 5 267 963 6 149 626 6 270 479 and 6 371 939.

In general prior automatic injection devices when operated cause the needle of a syringe to move forward and project from a protective housing prior to actuation of the syringe to eject a dose of liquid through the needle. Movement of the syringe toward the patient s skin such that the needle is exposed before pressurizing a liquid charge inside the syringe helps prevent the liquid from dripping out of the needle before the actual injection takes place.

Such prior automatic injection devices have several disadvantages. For example prior devices include an exposed needle that a patient is required to inject into him or herself causing apprehension and anxiety for most patients particularly those patients that are needle phobic . Prior devices are also difficult for patients to use to maintain free of contamination and or to provide an accurate dosage of medicine. In addition patients suffering from chronic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis as well as the elderly and physically disabled may lack the dexterity needed to self administer biologic therapies using existing injection devices. A need therefore exists for such self medication delivery devices that patients are able to use safely and that foster patient adherence to their biologic therapy regimens.

TNF inhibitors are effective in the treatment of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis and Crohn s Disease. Such inhibitors which include biological agents such as antibodies and antibody fusion proteins typically are delivered by injection. The TNF inhibitor adalimumab HUMIRA Abbott Laboratories Lake County Ill. for example has been marketed as a pre filled syringe for self administration by patients and therefore presents as an important candidate for use with an improved automatic injection devices and methods.

In this first operational stage the actuator causes the needle to be inserted into a subcutaneous region of the skin of the user when the proximal end of the device is held against an injection site. In a second operational stage an actuator which may be the same or a different component as the actuator that causes the needle to be inserted causes the fluid disposed within the syringe to be ejected into the subcutaneous region.

The invention will be described below relative to certain illustrative embodiments. While the present invention is described with respect to using the device to provide a subcutaneous injection of a dose of a TNF inhibitor one skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the illustrative embodiment and that the injection device may be used to inject any suitable substance into a user. In addition the components and the method of using the automatic injection device are not limited to the illustrative embodiments described below.

As used herein the term distal refers to the portion or end of an automatic injection device or component in the automatic injection device furthest from an injection site of the user when the device is held against the person for an injection or for mimicking an injection. The term proximal refers to the portion or end of an automatic injection device or a component of the automatic injection device closest to an injection site of the user during an injection.

Referring to the syringe is preferably slidably mounted in the housing as described in detail below. In an inactivated position the syringe is sheathed and retracted within the housing . When the device is actuated a needle of the syringe projects from a first proximal end of the housing to allow ejection of a substance from the syringe into a patient. As shown the first end of the housing i.e. the proximal end includes an opening through which the needle of the syringe projects during actuation of the device .

Continuing to refer to a second distal end of the housing i.e. the distal end includes an activation button for actuating the syringe to move from a sheathed position within the housing to a projecting position and subsequently to expel the substance from the needle into the patient. The housing houses one or more actuators that perform the functions of moving the syringe and expelling the substance from the syringe.

The illustrative automatic injection device shown in may also include a first removable cap or needle cap for covering the first end of the housing to prevent exposure of the needle in the syringe prior to use. In the illustrative embodiment the first cap may include a boss for locking and or covering the interior components of the device until the user is ready to activate the device . Alternatively the first cap may comprise a threaded screw portion and the internal surface of the housing at opening may comprise screw thread. Any suitable mating mechanism may be used in accordance with the teachings of the invention.

A second removable cap or actuator cap may cover the second end of the housing to prevent accidental actuation of the activation button .

The second cap may have a distinctive color to differentiate the first end and second end of the device though one skilled in the art will recognize that the cap and housing may have any suitable color size and configuration.

In the illustrative embodiment of the housing and caps and may further include graphics symbols and or numbers to facilitate use of the automatic injection device . For example in the illustrative embodiment the housing includes an arrow on an outer surface pointing towards the first end of the device to indicate how the device should be held relative to the patient i.e. with the first end adjacent to the injection site as shown in . In addition the first cap is labeled with a 1 to indicate that a user should remove the first cap of the device first and the second cap is labeled with a 2 to indicate that the second cap should be removed after the first cap is removed during preparation for and subsequent injection using the illustrative automatic injection device . One skilled in the art will recognize that the automatic injection device may have any suitable graphics symbols and or numbers to facilitate user instruction or the automatic injection device may omit such graphics symbols and or numbers.

As shown in the first end of the housing may have a wider diameter than the second end . A step may be formed at the transition between the two diameters to accommodate the second cap to facilitate seating of the second cap on the second end of the housing.

As illustrated in the housing also preferably includes a display window to allow a user to view the contents of the syringe housed within the housing as described in detail below. The window may comprise an opening in the sidewall of the housing or may comprise a translucent material in the housing to allow viewing of the interior of the device .

The housing may be formed of any suitable surgical material including but not limited to plastic and other known materials.

The automatic injection device shown in further includes a syringe actuator illustrated as a plunger for selectively moving and actuating the syringe to inject the dose contained in the syringe into a user. The illustrative plunger includes a rod portion having a first end integral with connected to or in fluid communication with the bung for selectively applying pressure to the bung to expel the dose from the needle . The plunger may include a flanged second end .

In an embodiment the syringe activator comprises multiple components and or more actuators are present in the automatic injection device of the invention.

The plunger of is biased forward towards the first end of the device by a first biasing mechanism illustrated as a coil spring disposed about or above a flanged second end of the plunger . In the embodiment illustrated in a proximate end of the coiled spring abuts the flanged second end of the plunger to selectively apply pressure and move the plunger proximally. Alternatively the plunger extends through the center of the spring . Prior to use of the device the coil spring or another suitable mechanism is compressed between the plunger and the housing storing energy. A trigger which is activated by any suitable actuation means such as the activation button shown in retains the plunger and first biasing mechanism in a retracted latched position shown in the activation button is activated. In the illustrative embodiment the trigger latches the flanged second end of the plunger . When a user activates the activation button or other actuation means the trigger releases the flanged second end of the plunger allowing the coil spring which applies pressure to the flanged second end to propel the plunger towards the first end of the device .

A second biasing mechanism illustrated as a coil spring in holds the syringe in a retracted position within the housing prior to use as shown in . In the retracted position the needle is preferably sheathed entirely within the housing . The illustrative syringe coil spring is disposed about the proximal portion of the barrel portion and may be seated in a shelf formed within the housing interior. The top end of the coil spring abuts the flanged second end of the syringe . The spring force of the second biasing mechanism pushes the flanged second end of the syringe away from the first end of the housing thereby holding the syringe in the retracted position until activated. Other components of the device may also position the syringe relative to the housing .

The first biasing mechanism and the second biasing mechanism may have any suitable configuration and tension suitable for use in biasing certain components of the device. For example the first biasing mechanism has any suitable size shape energy and properties suitable for moving the plunger and syringe forward when released. The second biasing mechanism has any suitable size shape energy and properties suitable for retracting the syringe prior to activation. Other suitable means for facilitating movement and expulsion from the syringe may also be used.

Referring still to the illustrative embodiment of the plunger further includes a compressible expanded central portion . In the illustrative embodiment the rod is split in the central portion to form a pair of projecting elbows that define the compressible expanded central portion . The projecting elbows may be pre formed as part of the molded plunger or may be attached to the plunger separately. The projecting elbows are compressible so that they can be moved radially inwardly to cause that portion of the rod to adopt a circumference similar to the rest of the rod. The compressible expanded central portion facilitates movement of the syringe followed by expulsion of the dose in two substantially separate stages as described below.

As shown in when an activation means activates the trigger to release the plunger the spring force of the coil spring propels the plunger forward proximally . During a first operational stage the moving plunger pushes the syringe forward such that the tip of the needle projects from the first end of the housing . The initial biasing force provided by the first coil spring is sufficient to overcome the biasing force of the second coil spring to allow movement of the syringe against the backward biasing force of the second coil spring . In the first operational stage the expanded region of the plunger formed by the projecting elbows rests against the second end of the barrel portion preventing the plunger from traveling within the syringe barrel portion . In this manner all biasing force from the first coil spring is applied to move the syringe forward towards the first end of the device .

The activation means illustrated in may have any suitable size shape configuration and location suitable for releasing the plunger or otherwise activating the device . For example still referring to the activation means may be an activation button formed on a distal end of the housing or may comprise another suitable device such as a latch twist activated switch and other devices known in the art. While the illustrative activation means is located towards a distal end of the device one skilled in the art will recognize that the activation means may be positioned in any suitable location on the device .

The forward motion of the syringe towards the proximal end of the device continues against the biasing force of the coil spring until the flanged end of the barrel portion abuts a stop such as a protrusion or flange on the housing as shown in . One skilled in the art will recognize that alternate stopping or limited mechanisms may be employed and that the invention is not limited to the illustrative stopping mechanism.

As shown in the first operational stage propels the tip of the needle through the opening at the first end of the device so that the needle may pierce the skin of a patient. During this stage the syringe barrel portion preferably remains sealed without expelling the substance through the needle . The interference caused by the stopping mechanisms maintains the needle in a selected position extending from the proximal open end of the device during subsequent steps. Until the stopping mechanisms stop the movement of the syringe the compressible expanded central portion of the plunger prevents movement of the plunger relative to the barrel portion .

The stops may be positioned at any suitable location relative to the open first end to allow the syringe to penetrate the skin by any suitable depth suitable for an injection.

In the second operational stage which commences after the stopping mechanism housing catches the flanged portion or other stopping mechanism stopping further movement of the barrel portion the continued biasing force of the coil spring continues to push the plunger relative to the housing as shown in . The biasing force causes the elbows of the plunger to compress radially inward and slide into the interior of the barrel portion . While the interference between components and retains the barrel portion in a selected position with the needle exposed and with the elbows in a collapsed stage the coil spring pushes the plunger within the barrel portion. After the plunger overcomes the necessary force to allow the elbows to compress and extend into the barrel portion the plunger applies pressure to the bung causing ejection of the contents of the syringe through the projecting needle . Because the first operational stage has displaced the needle into the skin the contents of the barrel portion are injected directly into a subcutaneous region of the patient.

Referring to in one embodiment of the invention the automatic injection device may comprise two interlocking components a syringe housing assembly containing the proximal components of the device e.g. the syringe barrel coil spring needle and other proximal components and a firing mechanism assembly containing the distal components of the device e.g. the means for actuating the syringe . The syringe housing assembly and the firing mechanism assembly may be coupled through any suitable means. In the illustrative embodiment a proximal end of the firing mechanism assembly may be sized and configured to be inserted into a distal end of the syringe housing assembly . In addition one or more tabs shown in detail in on the proximal end of the firing mechanism assembly may snap fit into corresponding openings on the distal end of the syringe housing assembly to ensure alignment and coupling of the two assemblies and the components housed therein.

As shown in the distal housing component includes a substantially tubular body which may include contours to facilitate gripping of the device by a user. A step may be formed in a distal region to facilitate seating of the actuator cap as described above. Forward of the step the distal housing component has a size and shape configured to be inserted into the distal end of the syringe housing . Tabs are formed to facilitate coupling and or locking of the two housing components and together. As shown in the tabs may be formed in a depression on the surface of the proximate end of the distal housing component and may also or alternatively include ribs for guiding the tabs into a locking position relative to the proximate housing component . One skilled in the art will recognize that any suitable means for coupling the two assemblies together may be used and that the invention is not limited to the illustrative coupling means.

As shown in the distal housing component may include an anchoring cap coupled to a smaller diameter distal end of the distal housing component for anchoring the firing mechanisms for actuating the device to the distal housing component . The interface of the anchoring cap and the distal housing component may form a groove to facilitate a snap fit of the activation button on the distal end of the distal housing component or may be joined by other suitable joining means as described above.

Referring to the syringe actuation component is preferably an integrated component formed of any suitable material such as an acetal based plastic though other suitable materials may also be used. The syringe actuation component comprises a pressurizing end for applying pressure to the bung of a corresponding syringe a plunger rod portion with a compressible expanded central portion illustrated as the plunger elbows as well as other components such as components for anchoring the coil spring to the syringe actuation component as described below. The compressible expanded central portion facilitates movement of a corresponding syringe into a protracted position and expulsion of the contents of the syringe in two separate steps as described above. Alternatively the syringe actuator may comprise multiple actuators for moving and or promoting expulsion of the syringe .

The syringe actuation component of further may include an indicator in a solid rod portion distal from the elbows . During operation of the device and after completion of an injection the indicator is configured to align with the window on the housing to indicate completion of the injection. The indicator preferably has a distinctive color or design to represent completion of an injection.

As shown in the illustrative syringe actuation component further includes a retaining flange for holding the actuating coil spring in a compressed position until actuation. The retaining flange is sized dimensioned and formed of a material that preferably allows the syringe actuation component to slidably and easily move within the housing when the device is actuated. Extending distally from the retaining flange the syringe actuation component forms a base for the actuating coil spring . The base terminates in a trigger anchoring portion . The illustrative base may comprise flexible legs around which the spring coils. The trigger anchoring portion may comprise tabbed feet extending from the base and configured to selectively engage the anchoring cap and or distal housing component . The activation button coupled to the distal end of the distal housing component is configured to hold the trigger anchoring portion until activation. When activated the activation button releases the trigger anchoring portion allowing the coil spring to propel the syringe actuation component towards the proximal end of the device in an operation described above.

In a retracted anchored position shown corresponding to the schematic of the trigger anchoring portion interacts with the housing which holds the tabbed feet in a latched position against the biasing force of the coil spring to maintain the syringe actuation component in a retracted position. In this position the flange retracts the spring against the back distal wall of the distal housing component . An opening in the anchoring cap allows the activation button access to the anchoring portion . In the retracted position the pressurizer of the syringe actuation component extends out of an opening on the proximal end of the distal housing component . When the distal housing component couples to a corresponding syringe actuation mechanism the pressurizer extends into the barrel portion of a syringe housed therein. The pressurizer may be integral with the same as connected to or otherwise in communication with the bung of a syringe housed in the device and may have any suitable size shape and configuration suitable for applying pressure to the bung . In one embodiment the pressurizer has a cross section corresponding to the shape of the barrel portion of a corresponding syringe so as to substantially seal the barrel portion and the pressurizer is configured to slidably move within the barrel portion to apply pressure to the bung and actuate the syringe .

In the illustrative embodiment of the syringe actuation component constitutes a single integrated mechanism for anchoring a corresponding syringe spring and other components actuating and moving the syringe to a protracted position and separately expelling the contents of the syringe .

Illustrative embodiments of the syringe carrier the stepped shroud and the proximate cap are shown in detail in respectively. are a perspective side view and a cross sectional side view respectively of the assembled spring housing assembly according to one embodiment of the invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the illustrative embodiments.

Referring now to the syringe carrier of the illustrative embodiment envelopes the distal half of a syringe used in the device . The syringe rests in the carrier and both are contained in the housing . During operation the syringe and carrier move forward e.g. proximally within the housing . The housing stops and limits the movement of the carrier and the carrier in turn stops and limits the movement of the syringe . The illustrative syringe carrier has a substantially tubular structure including window cutouts preferably aligned with the window on the housing to allow a user to view the contents of the syringe prior to operation. The syringe carrier may include a flanged distal end configured to interface with a flanged distal end shown in of the syringe . The flanged distal end may serve as a damper for the syringe . The syringe carrier may further include an intermediate flange which in the illustrative embodiment forms a stop for the syringe that interacts with an interior stop shown in on the proximate housing component to limit forward motion of the syringe . The illustrative syringe carrier may further include a proximate anchor portion that limits movement of the syringe in a distal rearward direction. In the illustrative embodiment the proximate anchor portion includes a radial groove configured to engage the interior stop . A syringe carrier coupler extends forward past the proximate anchor portion to facilitate coupling of the syringe carrier with the distal end of the spring and the stepped shroud as shown in . In one embodiment the syringe carrier is stationary within the housing and the syringe selectively and controllably slides within and relative to the syringe carrier . Alternatively the syringe carrier is slidably disposed within the housing and selectively carries the syringe within the housing . The syringe carrier may have any suitable configuration and size suitable for carrying or guiding the syringe within the housing .

Referring to the illustrative stepped shroud forms a proximate end of the housing . The illustrative stepped shroud has a substantially tubular body including a proximate boss defining the proximate opening of the device through which the syringe needle projects during operation of the device . A step from the main tubular body portion forms the proximate boss of smaller diameter than the main tubular body portion of the stepped shroud . As shown in the step forms a forward stop for the spring to confine the spring and prevent forward movement of the spring towards the proximate end of the device . In the illustrative embodiment shown in the distal rim of the stepped shroud abuts the proximate side of the stop of the proximal housing component . Referring now to distal arms extend from the stepped shroud to lock in the stepped shroud to prevent accidental needle sticks.

Referring to and the interior of the illustrative cap may include a plurality of radial grooves for receiving protruding portions of the stepped shroud and the proximal housing component . For example as best illustrated in a first radially outer groove receives a proximate end of the sidewall of the proximal housing component . A second radially inner groove receives the proximate end of the boss . The cap boss extends into the inner lumen of the housing and surround the proximal end of a syringe loaded therein when the cap is coupled to the housing . In an embodiment an interior needle cover shown in of the cap sheaths the syringe needle . When the cap is removed the syringe needle is exposed within the lumen of the housing . The cap may also include an opening in a proximal end thereof.

As described above and shown in openings in the proximal housing component receive tabs of the firing mechanism assembly to facilitate assembly of the device . The window described above for allowing a user to view the contents of a syringe contained in the assembly as well as to view an indicator that fills the window after completion of an injection may be formed in the proximal housing component

As shown in the trigger anchoring portion of the syringe actuation component is anchored towards the distal end of the housing by the activation button . When a user depresses the activation button driving arms connected to the activation button compress the tabbed feet of the trigger anchoring portion releasing the syringe actuation mechanism and releasing the spring . Prior to operation the compressible expanded central portion illustrated as elbows of the syringe actuation component rests above the flange of the syringe to allow the compressible expanded central portion when pushed by a released coil spring to apply pressure to the syringe barrel portion thereby moving the syringe forward within the housing when actuated. As described above once a stop such as a stop on the proximal housing component shown in and catches the syringe and halts additional forward motion of the projecting syringe the continued biasing force on the spring will continue to move the syringe actuation component forward causing the compressible expanded central portion to compress and move into the barrel portion of the syringe . The forward motion of the syringe actuation component within the barrel portion causes the pressurizer to apply pressure to the bung causing expulsion of the syringe contents into an injection site.

As also shown in the actuator cap may include a stabilizing protrusion that extends through the activator button and between the feet tabbed of the syringe actuation component to stabilize the components of the device prior to activation.

As shown the activation button may be a cap covering the distal end of the distal housing component . The illustrative activation button slides relative to the distal housing component to actuate a syringe actuator such as the plunger or syringe actuation component . A shelf step formed on the outer surface of the distal housing component near the distal end of the distal housing component allows for and limits the movement of the activation button relative to the housing as shown in . The illustrative activation button releasably retains flexible anchoring arms of the plunger . When depressed the activation button releases the flexible anchoring arms to allow a first biasing mechanism illustrated as spring to propel the plunger towards the proximal end of the device .

In the embodiment of the plunger further includes a flange located between the compressible extended middle portion and the distal end of the plunger rod . A first biasing mechanism is seated between an interior distal end of the housing and the flange to bias the plunger towards the proximal end of the housing . As described above when the activation button releases the anchoring arms the coil spring or other suitable biasing mechanism propels the plunger towards the proximal end of the device .

The illustrative embodiment further includes an indicator formed at an intermediate portion of the plunger rod between the flange and the compressible extended portion illustrated as flexible elbows .

The syringe of may include protrusions or other suitable component to facilitate controlled movement of the syringe within the housing . For example with reference to the syringe includes a sleeve forming a proximal protrusion for abutting a proximal side of a first protrusion formed on an inner surface of the housing for limited movement of the syringe in the distal direction within the housing . The sleeve may also form a flange that may abut the distal side of the first protrusion to limit movement of the syringe in the proximal direction during an injection.

In the embodiment of the second biasing mechanism illustrated as coil spring is disposed about a proximal portion of the syringe . A shelf formed at a proximal inner surface of the housing receives a proximal end of the coil spring . Referring to the proximal protrusion of the syringe sleeve or another suitably disposed mechanism receives the distal end of the coil spring . As described above the second biasing mechanism biases the syringe in a retracted position within the housing until activation of the device .

As shown in the automatic injection device incorporates an indicator to indicate to the user of the device when the dose from the syringe has been fully or substantially fully ejected. In the illustrative embodiment the indicator is formed on a portion of the plunger rod between the compressible expanded central portion and the flange . As the plunger rod moves during operation the indicator advances towards and aligns with window as the dose empties from the syringe. The indicator which is preferably a different color or pattern from the substance being injected fills the window entirely to indicate that the dosage has been ejected. Any suitable indicator may be used.

After injection of the dose from the device via the needle a needle sheath which may be formed by the proximal end of the shroud may automatically advance over the exposed needle extending from the housing proximal end to prevent accidental sticks.

Referring to the illustrative housing includes a window formed through a side wall of the housing to allow a user to view the contents of the syringe.

The illustrative window preferably has a keyhole shape. For example the window includes a first end that is substantially linear and may include a curved inner edge . The second end of the window may be substantially hemispherical in shape and wider than the first end of the window . The window may include a fill line to allow verification of the proper dosage within the syringe.

According to another embodiment of the invention a training automatic injection device may be provided for training users how to use the automatic injection device or . The illustrative training injection device mimics the functionality of the automatic training device or without injecting a substance into a patient. The training automatic injection device may have substantially similar components as the automatic injection devices described above yet lacks a needle and or a drug. For example the training automatic injection device may be filled with air that is expelled from the syringe barrel portion when activated. The operation of the training automatic injection device advances the syringe and expels the air or other benign substance preferably without penetrating the skin of the user. The training automatic injection device preferably includes an indicator such as indicator . The training automatic injection device may help train user to become accustomed to toe handling sound feel operation use of the indicator and or timing of the automatic injection device without wasting valuable resources.

The present invention provides significant advantages over prior methods for administering drugs particularly TNF inhibitors. For example the automatic injection device enhances administration convenience is less painful includes a hidden needle to remove apprehension and anxiety for patients who are needle phobic to one degree or another so that fear is not a factor. In addition the automatic injection device efficiently delivers a drug or other substance while being safe. The automatic injection device of the invention also offers safety advantages. Unlike traditional syringes there is no needle exposure with the automatic injection device. The automatic injection device contains a white needle sleeve that surrounds the needle and protects patients from needlestick injury before and after use. Also a safety cap on the automatic injection device prevents accidental misfiring a potential occurrence with prefilled syringes. An audible click announces the beginning of the injection and a distinctive indicator in the inspection window shows the patient that the complete dose was fully administered.

The term antibody as used herein is intended to refer to immunoglobulin molecules comprised of four polypeptide chains two heavy H chains and two light L chains inter connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains CH1 CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability termed complementarity determining regions CDR interspersed with regions that are more conserved termed framework regions FR . Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs arranged from amino terminus to carboxy terminus in the following order FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 FR4. The antibodies of the invention are described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 090 382 6 258 562 and 6 509 015 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The term antigen binding portion of an antibody or simply antibody portion as used herein refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen e.g. hTNF . It has been shown that fragments of a full length antibody can perform the antigen binding function of an antibody. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term antigen binding portion of an antibody include i a Fab fragment a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL VH CL and CH1 domains ii a F ab fragment a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region iii a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains iv a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody v a dAb fragment Ward et al. 1989 341 544 546 which consists of a VH or VL domain vi an isolated complementarity determining region CDR and vii a dual variable domain DVD antibody. Furthermore although the two domains of the Fv fragment VL and VH are coded for by separate genes they can be joined using recombinant methods by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules known as single chain Fv scFv see e.g. Bird et al. 1988 242 423 426 and Huston et al. 1988 85 5879 5883 . Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term antigen binding portion of an antibody. Other forms of single chain antibodies such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites see e.g. Holliger et al. 1993 90 6444 6448 Poljak et al. 1994 2 1121 1123 .

Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germ line immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments however such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis or when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used in vivo somatic mutagenesis and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that while derived from and related to human germ line VH and VL sequences may not naturally exist within the human antibody germ line repertoire in vivo.

Preferably the human antibodies used in the invention are recombinant neutralizing human anti hTNF antibodies. The most preferred recombinant neutralizing antibody of the invention is referred to herein as D2E7 also referred to as HUMIRA or adalimumab the amino acid sequence of the D2E7 VL region is shown in SEQ ID NO 1 the amino acid sequence of the D2E7 VH region is shown in SEQ ID NO 2 . The properties of D2E7 adalimumab HUMIRA have been described in Salfeld et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 090 382 6 258 562 and 6 509 015 which are each incorporated by reference herein. The methods of the invention may also be performed using chimeric and humanized murine anti hTNF antibodies which have undergone clinical testing for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis see e.g. Elliott M. J. et al. 1994 344 1125 1127 Elliot M. J. et al. 1994 344 1105 1110 Rankin E. C. et al. 1995 34 334 342 .

It is well known in the art that antibody heavy and light chain CDR3 domains play an important role in the binding specificity affinity of an antibody for an antigen. Accordingly in another aspect the invention pertains to treating Crohn s disease by administering human antibodies that have slow dissociation kinetics for association with hTNF and that have light and heavy chain CDR3 domains that structurally are identical to or related to those of D2E7. Position 9 of the D2E7 VL CDR3 can be occupied by Ala or Thr without substantially affecting the K. Accordingly a consensus motif for the D2E7 VL CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence Q R Y N R A P Y T A SEQ ID NO 3 . Additionally position 12 of the D2E7 VH CDR3 can be occupied by Tyr or Asn without substantially affecting the K. Accordingly a consensus motif for the D2E7 VH CDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence V S Y L S T A S S L D Y N SEQ ID NO 4 . Moreover as demonstrated in Example 2 of U.S. Pat. No. 6 090 382 the CDR3 domain of the D2E7 heavy and light chains is amenable to substitution with a single alanine residue at position 1 4 5 7 or 8 within the VL CDR3 or at position 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 or 11 within the VH CDR3 without substantially affecting the K. Still further the skilled artisan will appreciate that given the amenability of the D2E7 VL and VH CDR3 domains to substitutions by alanine substitution of other amino acids within the CDR3 domains may be possible while still retaining the low off rate constant of the antibody in particular substitutions with conservative amino acids. Preferably no more than one to five conservative amino acid substitutions are made within the D2E7 VL and or VH CDR3 domains. More preferably no more than one to three conservative amino acid substitutions are made within the D2E7 VL and or VH CDR3 domains. Additionally conservative amino acid substitutions should not be made at amino acid positions critical for binding to hTNF . Positions 2 and 5 of the D2E7 VL CDR3 and positions 1 and 7 of the D2E7 VH CDR3 appear to be critical for interaction with hTNF and thus conservative amino acid substitutions preferably are not made at these positions although an alanine substitution at position 5 of the D2E7 VL CDR3 is acceptable as described above see U.S. Pat. No. 6 090 382 .

Accordingly in another embodiment the antibody or antigen binding portion thereof preferably contains the following characteristics

Preferably the LCVR further has a CDR2 domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 5 i.e. the D2E7 VL CDR2 and the HCVR further has a CDR2 domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 6 i.e. the D2E7 VH CDR2 . Even more preferably the LCVR further has CDR1 domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 7 i.e. the D2E7 VL CDR1 and the HCVR has a CDR1 domain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 8 i.e. the D2E7 VH CDR1 .

Accordingly in another embodiment the antibody or antigen binding portion thereof preferably contains a light chain variable region LCVR comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 i.e. the D2E7 VL and a heavy chain variable region HCVR comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 i.e. the D2E7 VH . In certain embodiments the antibody comprises a heavy chain constant region such as an IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA IgE IgM or IgD constant region. Preferably the heavy chain constant region is an IgG1 heavy chain constant region or an IgG4 heavy chain constant region. Furthermore the antibody can comprise a light chain constant region either a kappa light chain constant region or a lambda light chain constant region. Preferably the antibody comprises a kappa light chain constant region. Alternatively the antibody portion can be for example a Fab fragment or a single chain Fv fragment.

In still other embodiments the invention includes uses of an isolated human antibody or antigen binding portion thereof containing D2E7 related VL and VH CDR3 domains.

The TNF antibody used in the methods and compositions of the invention may be modified for improved treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In some embodiments the TNF antibody or antigen binding fragments thereof is chemically modified to provide a desired effect. For example pegylation of antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention may be carried out by any of the pegylation reactions known in the art as described for example in the following references 3 4 10 1992 EP 0 154 316 and EP 0 401 384 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Preferably the pegylation is carried out via an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive polyethylene glycol molecule or an analogous reactive water soluble polymer . A preferred water soluble polymer for pegylation of the antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention is polyethylene glycol PEG . As used herein polyethylene glycol is meant to encompass any of the forms of PEG that have been used to derivatize other proteins such as mono Cl ClO alkoxy or aryloxy polyethylene glycol.

Methods for preparing pegylated antibodies and antibody fragments of the invention will generally comprise the steps of a reacting the antibody or antibody fragment with polyethylene glycol such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of PEG under conditions whereby the antibody or antibody fragment becomes attached to one or more PEG groups and b obtaining the reaction products. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art to select the optimal reaction conditions or the acylation reactions based on known parameters and the desired result.

Pegylated antibodies and antibody fragments may generally be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis by administration of the TNF antibodies and antibody fragments described herein. Generally the pegylated antibodies and antibody fragments have increased half life as compared to the nonpegylated antibodies and antibody fragments. The pegylated antibodies and antibody fragments may be employed alone together or in combination with other pharmaceutical compositions.

In yet another embodiment of the invention TNF antibodies or fragments thereof can be altered wherein the constant region of the antibody is modified to reduce at least one constant region mediated biological effector function relative to an unmodified antibody. To modify an antibody of the invention such that it exhibits reduced binding to the Fc receptor the immunoglobulin constant region segment of the antibody can be mutated at particular regions necessary for Fc receptor FcR interactions see e.g. Canfield S. M. and S. L. Morrison 1991 173 1483 1491 and Lund J. et al. 1991 147 2657 2662 . Reduction in FcR binding ability of the antibody may also reduce other effector functions that rely on FcR interactions such as opsonization and phagocytosis and antigen dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

An antibody or antibody portion used in the compositions and methods of the invention can be derivatized or linked to another functional molecule e.g. another peptide or protein . Accordingly the antibodies and antibody portions of the invention are intended to include derivatized and otherwise modified forms of the human anti hTNF antibodies described herein including immunoadhesion molecules. For example an antibody or antibody portion of the invention can be functionally linked by chemical coupling genetic fusion noncovalent association or otherwise to one or more other molecular entities such as another antibody e.g. a bispecific antibody or a diabody a detectable agent a cytotoxic agent a pharmaceutical agent and or a protein or peptide that can mediate associate of the antibody or antibody portion with another molecule such as a streptavidin core region or a polyhistidine tag .

One type of derivatized antibody is produced by crosslinking two or more antibodies of the same type or of different types e.g. to create bispecific antibodies . Suitable crosslinkers include those that are heterobifunctional having two distinctly reactive groups separated by an appropriate spacer e.g. m maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester or homobifunctional e.g. disuccinimidyl suberate . Such linkers are available from Pierce Chemical Company Rockford Ill.

Useful detectable agents with which an antibody or antibody portion of the invention may be derivatized include fluorescent compounds. Exemplary fluorescent detectable agents include fluorescein fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine 5 dimethylamine 1 napthalenesulfonyl chloride phycoerythrin and the like. An antibody may also be derivatized with detectable enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase horseradish peroxidase glucose oxidase and the like. When an antibody is derivatized with a detectable enzyme it is detected by adding additional reagents that the enzyme uses to produce a detectable reaction product. For example when the detectable agent horseradish peroxidase is present the addition of hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine leads to a colored reaction product which is detectable. An antibody may also be derivatized with biotin and detected through indirect measurement of avidin or streptavidin binding.

An antibody or antibody portion used in the methods and compositions of the invention can be prepared by recombinant expression of immunoglobulin light and heavy chain genes in a host cell. To express an antibody recombinantly a host cell is transfected with one or more recombinant expression vectors carrying DNA fragments encoding the immunoglobulin light and heavy chains of the antibody such that the light and heavy chains are expressed in the host cell and preferably secreted into the medium in which the host cells are cultured from which medium the antibodies can be recovered. Standard recombinant DNA methodologies are used to obtain antibody heavy and light chain genes incorporate these genes into recombinant expression vectors and introduce the vectors into host cells such as those described in Sambrook Fritsch and Maniatis eds Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 Ausubel F. M. et al. eds. Greene Publishing Associates 1989 and in U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 397 by Boss et al.

To express adalimumab D2E7 or an adalimumab D2E7 related antibody DNA fragments encoding the light and heavy chain variable regions are first obtained. These DNAs can be obtained by amplification and modification of germline light and heavy chain variable sequences using the polymerase chain reaction PCR . Germline DNA sequences for human heavy and light chain variable region genes are known in the art see e.g. the Vbase human germline sequence database see also Kabat E. A. et al. 1991 Fifth Edition U.S. Department of Health and Human Services NIH Publication No. 91 3242 Tomlinson I. M. et al. 1992 The Repertoire of Human Germline VSequences Reveals about Fifty Groups of VSegments with Different Hypervariable Loops 227 776 798 and Cox J. P. L. et al. 1994 A Directory of Human Germ line VSegments Reveals a Strong Bias in their Usage 24 827 836 the contents of each of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference . To obtain a DNA fragment encoding the heavy chain variable region of D2E7 or a D2E7 related antibody a member of the V3 family of human germline VH genes is amplified by standard PCR. Most preferably the DP 31 VH germline sequence is amplified. To obtain a DNA fragment encoding the light chain variable region of D2E7 or a D2E7 related antibody a member of the VI family of human germline VL genes is amplified by standard PCR. Most preferably the A20 VL germline sequence is amplified. PCR primers suitable for use in amplifying the DP 31 germline VH and A20 germline VL sequences can be designed based on the nucleotide sequences disclosed in the references cited supra using standard methods.

Once the germline VH and VL fragments are obtained these sequences can be mutated to encode the D2E7 or D2E7 related amino acid sequences disclosed herein. The amino acid sequences encoded by the germline VH and VL DNA sequences are first compared to the D2E7 or D2E7 related VH and VL amino acid sequences to identify amino acid residues in the D2E7 or D2E7 related sequence that differ from germline. Then the appropriate nucleotides of the germline DNA sequences are mutated such that the mutated germline sequence encodes the D2E7 or D2E7 related amino acid sequence using the genetic code to determine which nucleotide changes should be made. Mutagenesis of the germline sequences is carried out by standard methods such as PCR mediated mutagenesis in which the mutated nucleotides are incorporated into the PCR primers such that the PCR product contains the mutations or site directed mutagenesis.

Moreover it should be noted that if the germline sequences obtained by PCR amplification encode amino acid differences in the framework regions from the true germline configuration i.e. differences in the amplified sequence as compared to the true germline sequence for example as a result of somatic mutation it may be desirable to change these amino acid differences back to the true germline sequences i.e. backmutation of framework residues to the germline configuration .

Once DNA fragments encoding D2E7 or D2E7 related VH and VL segments are obtained by amplification and mutagenesis of germline VH and VL genes as described above these DNA fragments can be further manipulated by standard recombinant DNA techniques for example to convert the variable region genes to full length antibody chain genes to Fab fragment genes or to a scFv gene. In these manipulations a VL or VH encoding DNA fragment is operatively linked to another DNA fragment encoding another protein such as an antibody constant region or a flexible linker. The term operatively linked as used in this context is intended to mean that the two DNA fragments are joined such that the amino acid sequences encoded by the two DNA fragments remain in frame.

The isolated DNA encoding the VH region can be converted to a full length heavy chain gene by operatively linking the VH encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding heavy chain constant regions CH1 CH2 and CH3 . The sequences of human heavy chain constant region genes are known in the art see e.g. Kabat E. A. et al. 1991 Fifth Edition U.S. Department of Health and Human Services NIH Publication No. 91 3242 and DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The heavy chain constant region can be an IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA IgE IgM or IgD constant region but most preferably is an IgG1 or IgG4 constant region. For a Fab fragment heavy chain gene the VH encoding DNA can be operatively linked to another DNA molecule encoding only the heavy chain CH1 constant region.

The isolated DNA encoding the VL region can be converted to a full length light chain gene as well as a Fab light chain gene by operatively linking the VL encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding the light chain constant region CL. The sequences of human light chain constant region genes are known in the art see e.g. Kabat E. A. et al. 1991 Fifth Edition U.S. Department of Health and Human Services NIH Publication No. 91 3242 and DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The light chain constant region can be a kappa or lambda constant region but most preferably is a kappa constant region.

To create a scFv gene the VH and VL encoding DNA fragments are operatively linked to another fragment encoding a flexible linker e.g. encoding the amino acid sequence Gly Ser such that the VH and VL sequences can be expressed as a contiguous single chain protein with the VL and VH regions joined by the flexible linker see e.g. Bird et al. 1988 242 423 426 Huston et al. 1988 85 5879 5883 McCafferty et al. 1990 348 552 554 .

To express the antibodies or antibody portions used in the invention DNAs encoding partial or full length light and heavy chains obtained as described above are inserted into expression vectors such that the genes are operatively linked to transcriptional and translational control sequences. In this context the term operatively linked is intended to mean that an antibody gene is ligated into a vector such that transcriptional and translational control sequences within the vector serve their intended function of regulating the transcription and translation of the antibody gene. The expression vector and expression control sequences are chosen to be compatible with the expression host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into separate vector or more typically both genes are inserted into the same expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted into the expression vector by standard methods e.g. ligation of complementary restriction sites on the antibody gene fragment and vector or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are present . Prior to insertion of the D2E7 or D2E7 related light or heavy chain sequences the expression vector may already carry antibody constant region sequences. For example one approach to converting the D2E7 or D2E7 related VH and VL sequences to full length antibody genes is to insert them into expression vectors already encoding heavy chain constant and light chain constant regions respectively such that the VH segment is operatively linked to the CH segment s within the vector and the VL segment is operatively linked to the CL segment within the vector. Additionally or alternatively the recombinant expression vector can encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the antibody chain from a host cell. The antibody chain gene can be cloned into the vector such that the signal peptide is linked in frame to the amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The signal peptide can be an immunoglobulin signal peptide or a heterologous signal peptide i.e. a signal peptide from a non immunoglobulin protein .

In addition to the antibody chain genes the recombinant expression vectors of the invention carry regulatory sequences that control the expression of the antibody chain genes in a host cell. The term regulatory sequence is intended to include promoters enhancers and other expression control elements e.g. polyadenylation signals that control the transcription or translation of the antibody chain genes. Such regulatory sequences are described for example in Goeddel 185 Academic Press San Diego Calif. 1990 . It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector including the selection of regulatory sequences may depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed the level of expression of protein desired etc. Preferred regulatory sequences for mammalian host cell expression include viral elements that direct high levels of protein expression in mammalian cells such as promoters and or enhancers derived from cytomegalovirus CMV such as the CMV promoter enhancer Simian Virus 40 SV40 such as the SV40 promoter enhancer adenovirus e.g. the adenovirus major late promoter AdMLP and polyoma. For further description of viral regulatory elements and sequences thereof see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 168 062 by Stinski U.S. Pat. No. 4 510 245 by Bell et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4 968 615 by Schaffner et al.

In addition to the antibody chain genes and regulatory sequences the recombinant expression vectors used in the invention may carry additional sequences such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells e.g. origins of replication and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 399 216 4 634 665 and 5 179 017 all by Axel et al. . For example typically the selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs such as G418 hygromycin or methotrexate on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced. Preferred selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene for use in dhfr host cells with methotrexate selection amplification and the neo gene for G418 selection .

For expression of the light and heavy chains the expression vector s encoding the heavy and light chains is transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The various forms of the term transfection are intended to encompass a wide variety of techniques commonly used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell e.g. electroporation calcium phosphate precipitation DEAE dextran transfection and the like. Although it is theoretically possible to express the antibodies of the invention in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells expression of antibodies in eukaryotic cells and most preferably mammalian host cells is the most preferred because such eukaryotic cells and in particular mammalian cells are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologically active antibody. Prokaryotic expression of antibody genes has been reported to be ineffective for production of high yields of active antibody Boss M. A. and Wood C. R. 1985 6 12 13 .

Preferred mammalian host cells for expressing the recombinant antibodies of the invention include Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells including dhfr CHO cells described in Urlaub and Chasin 1980 77 4216 4220 used with a DHFR selectable marker e.g. as described in R. J. Kaufman and P. A. Sharp 1982 159 601 621 NSO myeloma cells COS cells and SP2 cells. When recombinant expression vectors encoding antibody genes are introduced into mammalian host cells the antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or more preferably secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown. Antibodies can be recovered from the culture medium using standard protein purification methods.

Host cells can also be used to produce portions of intact antibodies such as Fab fragments or scFv molecules. It is understood that variations on the above procedure are within the scope of the present invention. For example it may be desirable to transfect a host cell with DNA encoding either the light chain or the heavy chain but not both of an antibody of this invention. Recombinant DNA technology may also be used to remove some or all of the DNA encoding either or both of the light and heavy chains that is not necessary for binding to hTNF . The molecules expressed from such truncated DNA molecules are also encompassed by the antibodies of the invention. In addition bifunctional antibodies may be produced in which one heavy and one light chain are an antibody of the invention and the other heavy and light chain are specific for an antigen other than hTNF by crosslinking an antibody of the invention to a second antibody by standard chemical crosslinking methods.

In a preferred system for recombinant expression of an antibody or antigen binding portion thereof of the invention a recombinant expression vector encoding both the antibody heavy chain and the antibody light chain is introduced into dhfr CHO cells by calcium phosphate mediated transfection. Within the recombinant expression vector the antibody heavy and light chain genes are each operatively linked to CMV enhancer AdMLP promoter regulatory elements to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR gene which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection amplification. The selected transformant host cells are culture to allow for expression of the antibody heavy and light chains and intact antibody is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector transfect the host cells select for transformants culture the host cells and recover the antibody from the culture medium.

In view of the foregoing nucleic acid vector and host cell compositions that can be used for recombinant expression of the antibodies and antibody portions used in the invention include nucleic acids and vectors comprising said nucleic acids comprising the human TNF antibody adalimumab D2E7 . The nucleotide sequence encoding the D2E7 light chain variable region is shown in SEQ ID NO 36. The CDR1 domain of the LCVR encompasses nucleotides 70 102 the CDR2 domain encompasses nucleotides 148 168 and the CDR3 domain encompasses nucleotides 265 291. The nucleotide sequence encoding the D2E7 heavy chain variable region is shown in SEQ ID NO 37. The CDR1 domain of the HCVR encompasses nucleotides 91 105 the CDR2 domain encompasses nucleotides 148 198 and the CDR3 domain encompasses nucleotides 295 330. It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that nucleotide sequences encoding D2E7 related antibodies or portions thereof e.g. a CDR domain such as a CDR3 domain can be derived from the nucleotide sequences encoding the D2E7 LCVR and HCVR using the genetic code and standard molecular biology techniques.

Recombinant human antibodies of the invention in addition to D2E7 or an antigen binding portion thereof or D2E7 related antibodies disclosed herein can be isolated by screening of a recombinant combinatorial antibody library preferably a scFv phage display library prepared using human VL and VH cDNAs prepared from mRNA derived from human lymphocytes. Methodologies for preparing and screening such libraries are known in the art. In addition to commercially available kits for generating phage display libraries e.g. the Pharmacia catalog no. 27 9400 01 and the Stratagene SurfZAP phage display kit catalog no. 240612 examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use in generating and screening antibody display libraries can be found in for example Ladner et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 223 409 Kang et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 18619 Dower et al. PCT Publication No. WO 91 17271 Winter et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 20791 Markland et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 15679 Breitling et al. PCT Publication No. WO 93 01288 McCafferty et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 01047 Garrard et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 09690 Fuchs et al. 1991 9 1370 1372 Hay et al. 1992 3 81 65 Huse et al. 1989 246 1275 1281 McCafferty et al. 1990 348 552 554 Griffiths et al. 1993 12 725 734 Hawkins et al. 1992 226 889 896 Clackson et al. 1991 352 624 628 Gram et al. 1992 89 3576 3580 Garrard et al. 1991 9 1373 1377 Hoogenboom et al. 1991 19 4133 4137 and Barbas et al. 1991 88 7978 7982.

In a preferred embodiment to isolate human antibodies with high affinity and a low off rate constant for hTNF a murine anti hTNF antibody having high affinity and a low off rate constant for hTNF e.g. MAK 195 the hybridoma for which has deposit number ECACC 87 050801 is first used to select human heavy and light chain sequences having similar binding activity toward hTNF using the epitope imprinting methods described in Hoogenboom et al. PCT Publication No. WO 93 06213. The antibody libraries used in this method are preferably scFv libraries prepared and screened as described in McCafferty et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92 01047 McCafferty et al. 1990 348 552 554 and Griffiths et al. 1993 12 725 734. The scFv antibody libraries preferably are screened using recombinant human TNF as the antigen.

Once initial human VL and VH segments are selected mix and match experiments in which different pairs of the initially selected VL and VH segments are screened for hTNF binding are performed to select preferred VL VH pair combinations. Additionally to further improve the affinity and or lower the off rate constant for hTNF binding the VL and VH segments of the preferred VL VH pair s can be randomly mutated preferably within the CDR3 region of VH and or VL in a process analogous to the in vivo somatic mutation process responsible for affinity maturation of antibodies during a natural immune response. This in vitro affinity maturation can be accomplished by amplifying VH and VL regions using PCR primers complimentary to the VH CDR3 or VL CDR3 respectively which primers have been spiked with a random mixture of the four nucleotide bases at certain positions such that the resultant PCR products encode VH and VL segments into which random mutations have been introduced into the VH and or VL CDR3 regions. These randomly mutated VH and VL segments can be rescreened for binding to hTNF and sequences that exhibit high affinity and a low off rate for hTNF binding can be selected.

Following screening and isolation of an hTNF antibody of the invention from a recombinant immunoglobulin display library nucleic acid encoding the selected antibody can be recovered from the display package e.g. from the phage genome and subcloned into other expression vectors by standard recombinant DNA techniques. If desired the nucleic acid can be further manipulated to create other antibody forms of the invention e.g. linked to nucleic acid encoding additional immunoglobulin domains such as additional constant regions . To express a recombinant human antibody isolated by screening of a combinatorial library the DNA encoding the antibody is cloned into a recombinant expression vector and introduced into a mammalian host cells as described in further detail in above.

Methods of isolating human neutralizing antibodies with high affinity and a low off rate constant for hTNF are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 090 382 6 258 562 and 6 509 015 each of which is incorporated by reference herein.

The methods and compositions of the invention can be used with automatic injection devices that administer essentially any substance or medication that is suitable for administration by injection. Typically the substance or medication will be in a fluid e.g. liquid form although medications in other forms such as gels or semi solids slurries particulate solutions etc. also may suitable for use if the automatic injection device is designed to permit the administration of such forms of the medication.

Preferred medications are biological agents such as antibodies cytokines vaccines fusion proteins and growth factors. Methods of making antibodies are described above.

Pharmaceutical compositions may be loaded into the automatic injection device of the invention for delivery to a user. In one embodiment antibodies antibody portions as well as other TNF inhibitors can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a user using the device of the invention. Typically the pharmaceutical composition comprises an antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents dispersion media coatings antibacterial and antifungal agents isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like that are physiologically compatible. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include one or more of water saline phosphate buffered saline dextrose glycerol ethanol and the like as well as combinations thereof. In many cases it is preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars polyalcohols such as mannitol sorbitol or sodium chloride in the composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may further comprise minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents preservatives or buffers which enhance the shelf life or effectiveness of the antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor.

The compositions for use in the methods and compositions of the invention may be in a variety of forms in accordance with administration via the device of the invention including for example liquid solutions e.g. injectable and infusible solutions dispersions or suspensions. In a preferred embodiment the antibody or other TNF inhibitor is administered by subcutaneous injection using the device of the invention. In one embodiment the user administers the TNF inhibitor including but not limited to TNF antibody or antigen binding portion thereof to himself herself using the device of the invention

Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution microemulsion dispersion liposome or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound i.e. antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above as required followed by filtered sterilization. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption for example monostearate salts and gelatin.

In one embodiment the invention includes an automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen comprising an effective TNF inhibitor and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Thus the invention provides a prefilled automatic injection device comprising a TNF inhibitor.

In one embodiment the antibody or antibody portion for use in the methods of the invention is incorporated into a pharmaceutical formulation as described in PCT IB03 04502 and U.S. Appln. No. 20040033228 incorporated by reference herein. This formulation includes a concentration 50 mg ml of the antibody D2E7 adalimumab wherein one autoinjector pen comprises 40 mg of antibody for subcutaneous injection. In one embodiment the automatic injection device of the invention or more specifically the syringe of the device comprises a formulation of adalimumab having the following formula adalimumab sodium chloride monobasic sodium phosphate dihydrate dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate sodium citrate citric acid monohydrate mannitol polysorbate 80 and water e.g. water for injection. In another embodiment the automatic injection device comprises a volume of adalimumab including 40 mg adalimumab 4.93 mg sodium chloride 0.69 mg monobasic sodium phosphate dihydrate 1.22 mg dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate 0.24 mg sodium citrate 1.04 mg citric acid monohydrate 9.6 mg mannitol 0.8 mg polysorbate 80 and water e.g. water for injection. In one embodiment sodium hydroxide is added as necessary to adjust pH.

The dose amount of TNF inhibitor in the automatic injection device may vary according to the disorder for which the TNF inhibitor is being used to treat. In one embodiment the invention includes an automatic injection device comprising a dose of adalimumab of about 20 mg of adalimumab 40 mg of adalimumab 80 mg of adalimumab and 160 mg of adalimumab. It should be noted that for all ranges described herein including the dose ranges all numbers intermediary to the recited values are included in the invention e.g. 36 mg of adalimumab 48 mg of adalimumab etc. In addition ranges recited using said numbers are also included e.g. 40 to 80 mg of adalimumab. The numbers recited herein are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

The TNF antibodies and inhibitors used in the invention may also be administered in the form of protein crystal formulations that include a combination of protein crystals encapsulated within a polymeric carrier to form coated particles. The coated particles of the protein crystal formulation may have a spherical morphology and be microspheres of up to 500 micro meters in diameter or they may have some other morphology and be microparticulates. The enhanced concentration of protein crystals allows the antibody of the invention to be delivered subcutaneously. In one embodiment the TNF antibodies of the invention are delivered via a protein delivery system wherein one or more of a protein crystal formulation or composition is administered to a user with a TNF related disorder. Compositions and methods of preparing stabilized formulations of whole antibody crystals or antibody fragment crystals are also described in WO 02 072636 which is incorporated by reference herein. In one embodiment a formulation comprising the crystallized antibody fragments described in PCT IB03 04502 and U.S. Appln. No. 20040033228 incorporated by reference herein is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis using the methods of the invention.

Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. In certain embodiments an antibody or antibody portion for use in the methods of the invention is coformulated with and or coadministered with one or more additional therapeutic agents including a rheumatoid arthritis inhibitor or antagonist. For example an anti hTNF antibody or antibody portion may be coformulated and or coadministered with one or more additional antibodies that bind other targets associated with TNF related disorders e.g. antibodies that bind other cytokines or that bind cell surface molecules one or more cytokines soluble TNF receptor see e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 94 06476 and or one or more chemical agents that inhibit hTNF production or activity such as cyclohexane ylidene derivatives as described in PCT Publication No. WO 93 19751 or any combination thereof. Furthermore one or more antibodies of the invention may be used in combination with two or more of the foregoing therapeutic agents. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered therapeutic agents thus avoiding possible side effects complications or low level of response by the patient associated with the various monotherapies. Additional agents that may be used in combination with a TNF antibody or antibody portion are described in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 800 531 which is incorporated in its entirety herein.

The automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen of the invention may include a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount of an antibody or antibody portion of the invention. A therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount of the antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the individual and the ability of the antibody antibody portion other TNF inhibitor to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody antibody portion or other TNF inhibitor are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically since a prophylactic dose is used in patients prior to or at an earlier stage of disease the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.

The invention also provides an article of manufacture or kit comprising the automatic injection device of the invention. In one embodiment of the invention the kit comprises an automatic injector device e.g. an autoinjector pen such as the HUMIRA pen comprising a liquid drug e.g. a TNF inhibitor such as an antibody and instructions for administration of the liquid drug. In one embodiment the kit comprises instructions for delivering a TNF inhibitor for treatment of a disorder in which TNF is detrimental e.g. rheumatoid arthritis using the automatic injection device. The instructions may describe how e.g. subcutaneously and when e.g. at week 0 week 2 week 4 etc. the dose of TNF inhibitor shall be administered to a patient for treatment.

An article of manufacture also referred to herein as a kit refers to a packaged product comprising the automatic injection device of the invention. The kit preferably comprises a box or container that holds the components of the kit i.e. automatic injection device. In one embodiment the automatic injection device e.g. an autoinjector pen is housed in a dose tray within the kit or article. The kit may also include instructions for administering a substance such as a liquid drug e.g. a TNF antibody to a patient using the automatic injection device of the invention. The term package insert is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products including liquid drugs that contain information about the indications usage dosage administration contraindications and or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products. In one embodiment the package insert is the label for the therapeutic substance provided by the kit.

The kit or article of manufacture may include a label or a Food and Drug Administration approved label which provides a protocol for using the automatic injection device for administering the substance e.g. TNF inhibitor. Thus the invention also includes labels used alone or in combination with articles of manufacture which provide information to a patient regarding the automatic injection device including information such as how to use the device what substance e.g. liquid dose the device holds for administration to a patient and how to dispose of the device once administration is complete. In one embodiment the label is found on a package insert. In one embodiment the label is a package insert that includes a Patient Information Leaflet which provides information to a patient regarding how to use the automatic injection device of the invention.

The kit or article of manufacture of the invention may contain information regarding the automatic injection device with respect to how the device is packaged within the kit or article. The kit may comprise a dose tray comprising the automatic injection device of the invention containing a substance e.g. a TNF inhibitor. In one embodiment the dose tray is for single use of the device for delivering the agent. In another example the kit may include 2 or more dose trays each containing an automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen.

Methods for using the automatic injection device of the invention are described in more detail below and in the Examples. Moreover any of the methods described herein relating to the automatic injection device may be included in a label of the invention.

The invention also provides methods of using the automatic injection device of the invention for delivering a substance e.g. medication or liquid dose of a drug such as a TNF inhibitor. In one embodiment the automatic injection device is an autoinjector pen such as a HUMIRA pen.

Included in the methods are methods for preparing to use the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen of the invention.

Use of the automatic injection device may require that a patient first choose and prepare an injection site. For example methods for choosing and preparing an injection site for administration with an autoinjector pen such as the HUMIRA pen include first washing the hands of the patient thoroughly. Generally a clean and healthy part of the patient s body is selected to receive the injection from the automatic injection device. In one embodiment a site is chosen on the front of the patient s thighs or abdomen. If the abdomen is chosen the patient should avoid the area 2 inches around the navel. For injection with an autoinjector pen such as a HUMIRA pen a different site should be chosen each time an injection is given. Each new injection should be given at least one inch from a site used previously. Areas where the skin is tender bruised red or hard or where there are scars or stretch marks should generally not be used as injection sites. A patient may find it helpful to keep notes on the location of previous injections.

Once an injection site is selected the patient generally cleans the area. In one embodiment the site where HUMIRA is to be injected is first wiped with an alcohol prep swab using a circular motion. Once cleaned the injection site area should not be touched again until the patient is ready to inject.

The methods of the invention also include preparing the dose of the substance within the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen to be injected. In one embodiment the autoinjector pen is held with the first removable cap pointing up. The patient should examine the solution or substance e.g. liquid drug through the windows on the side of the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen to make sure for example the liquid is clear and colorless. Generally the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen should not be used if the liquid is cloudy or discolored or has flakes or particles in it. In addition an automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen comprising adalimumab should be not used if it is frozen.

Once it has been determined that the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen is satisfactory for use in and injection the device may be held with the first removable cap pointed down. Such an action may serve to determine the level of the liquid drug within the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen.

In one embodiment prior to injection one should check to make sure that the amount of liquid in the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen is the same or close to the line visible through the window. In one embodiment the line represents a full dose of the product. The top of the liquid may be curved. If the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen does not have the correct amount of liquid the autoinjector pen should not be used and optionally a pharmacist should be called.

Injection methods for delivering a substance such as a liquid drug using the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen of the invention may include the following. The automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen is held with one hand. With the patient s other hand the first removable cap is removed and discarded. In one embodiment the first removable cap should be pulled straight off and or should not be twisted. Following removal of the first removable cap the patient should check that the needle sheath of the syringe has come off with the first removable cap. After removal the interior needle cover is held in the cap. The needle housed in the syringe barrel should not be touched. The distal end of the stepped shroud will be exposed following removal of the first removable cap. The first removable cap should not be recapped as the needle may be damaged. In addition the patient should take care to avoid dropping or crushing the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen as it contains a syringe.

Following removal of the first removable cap the second removable cap also referred to as a safety cap is removed to expose the activation button at the top. The patient should pull the second removable cap straight off. The second removable cap should not be twisted off. Following removal of the first and second removable caps the automatic injection device e.g. an autoinjector pen is now ready to use. The patient should be aware that the automatic injection device e.g. an autoinjector pen is activated after removing the second removable cap and furthermore that pressing the activation button under the second removable cap will result in discharge of medication. The patient should also be aware that the activation button should not be removed until properly positioned. In addition at this point the automatic injection device e.g. an autoinjector pen should not be recapped as this may cause the unit to discharge.

Once the patient is ready to deliver the injection the automatic injection device e.g. an autoinjector pen should be positioned so that the window is in view. With the patient s free hand a sizable area of the cleaned skin may be gently squeezed at the injection site creating a platform on which to position the automatic injection device e.g. an autoinjector pen. The proximal end of the automatic injection device e.g. an autoinjector pen may be positioned the at a 90 degree angle flush against the platform of skin. The automatic injection device e.g. so that it will not inject the needle into the patient s fingers. To begin injection the activation button is pressed. In one embodiment the activation button is pressed using a finger e.g. the index finger of the patient to begin the injection. Alternatively in another embodiment the patient may also use a thumb to press the activation button to begin the injection. During the injection the patient should try not to cover the window. In one embodiment when the activation button is pressed there will be an audible indicator e.g. click. The audible indicator e.g. click may indicate the start of the injection. In one embodiment an autoinjector pen comprising adalimumab makes noise once the activation button is pressed. Once the activation button is pressed pressure should be kept on the activation button and the patient may continue to hold the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen with steady pressure on the injection site until the process is finished. In one embodiment the process of pressing the activation button to complete the injection may take up to about 10 seconds. For injection constant pressure is maintained at the injection site for the entire period of time.

Using the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen of the invention a patient will know that the injection has finished when the indicator in the window appears in full view and stops. When the injection is finished the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen is pulled from the skin of the user. The shroud will automatically advance over the needle tip. The patient may press a cotton ball over the injection site and hold it e.g. for 10 seconds. The patient should not rub the injection site and should not be alarmed if there is slight bleeding. Following injection the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen should be disposed of such that the patient tries not to touch the needle. The needle sleeve prevents the patient from touching the needle.

It should be noted that any of the instructions recited in the methods for using the automatic injection device of the invention may be included in a label for the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen of the invention.

In still other embodiments an automatic injection device previously described in the art is used in the methods and compositions of the invention relating to training and promoting an automatic injection device. Suitable automatic injection devices have been described in the art including but not limited to the devices described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 941 130 4 261 358 5 085 642 5 092 843 5 102 393 5 267 963 6 149 626 6 270 479 and 6 371 939.

The automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen of the invention may be used in methods of treating disorders including in one embodiment disorders associated with detrimental TNF activity. In one embodiment the automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector pen is used to deliver a substance e.g. a TNF inhibitor to a patient for treatment wherein the disorder includes but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis including juvenile arthritis Crohn s disease psoriasis psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.

As used herein the term a disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental is intended to include diseases and other disorders in which the presence of TNF in a patient suffering from the disorder has been shown to be or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder. Accordingly a disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental is a disorder in which inhibition of TNF activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and or progression of the disorder. Such disorders may be evidenced for example by an increase in the concentration of TNF in a biological fluid of a patient suffering from the disorder e.g. an increase in the concentration of TNF in serum plasma synovial fluid etc. of the patient which can be detected for example using an anti TNF antibody as described above. There are numerous examples of disorders in which TNF activity is detrimental which are discussed further below 

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in playing a role in the pathophysiology of a variety of autoimmune diseases. For example TNF has been implicated in activating tissue inflammation and causing joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis see e.g. Moeller A. et al. 1990 2 162 169 U.S. Pat. No. 5 231 024 to Moeller et al. European Patent Publication No. 260 610 B1 by Moeller A. Tracey and Cerami supra Arend W. P. and Dayer J M. 1995 38 151 160 Fava R. A. et al. 1993 94 261 266 . TNF also has been implicated in promoting the death of islet cells and in mediating insulin resistance in diabetes see e.g. Tracey and Cerami supra PCT Publication No. WO 94 08609 . TNF also has been implicated in mediating cytotoxicity to oligodendrocytes and induction of inflammatory plaques in multiple sclerosis see e.g. Tracey and Cerami supra . TNF also has been implicated in mediating cytotoxicity to oligodendrocytes and induction of inflammatory plaques in multiple sclerosis see e.g. Tracey and Cerami supra . Chimeric and humanized murine anti hTNF antibodies have undergone clinical testing for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis see e.g. Elliott M. J. et al. 1994 344 1125 1127 Elliot M. J. et al. 1994 344 1105 1110 Rankin E. C. et al. 1995 34 334 342 .

TNF antibodies such as adalimumab may be used to treat autoimmune diseases in particular those associated with inflammation. Examples of such autoimmune conditions include rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid spondylitis osteoarthritis and gouty arthritis allergy multiple sclerosis autoimmune diabetes autoimmune uveitis and nephrotic syndrome. Other examples of autoimmune conditions include multisystem autoimmune diseases and autoimmune hearing loss.

In one embodiment of the invention a TNF inhibitor is used to treat autoimmune disorders such as lupus. Lupus is has been shown to be associated with TNF activity Shvidel et al. 2002 3 32 Studnicka Benke et al. 1996 35 1067 . The term lupus as used herein refers to a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder called lupus erythematosus that may affect many organ systems including the skin joints and internal organs. Lupus is a general term which includes a number of specific types of lupus including systemic lupus lupus nephritis and lupus cerebritis. In systemic lupus SLE the body s natural defenses are turned against the body and rogue immune cells attack the body s tissues. Antibodies may be produced that can react against the body s blood cells organs and tissues. This reaction leads to immune cells attacking the affected systems producing a chronic disease. Lupus nephritis also referred to as lupus glomerular disease is kidney disorder that is usually a complication of SLE and is characterized by damage to the glomerulus and progressive loss of kidney function. Lupus cerebritis refers to another complication of SLE which is inflammation of the brain and or central nervous system.

Another autoimmune disease which can be treated using a TNF antibody is Crohn s disease which is described in more detail below in the Intestinal Disorders Section.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disorders including Crohn s disease see e.g. Tracy et al. 1986 234 470 Sun et al. 1988 81 1328 MacDonald et al. 1990 81 301 . Chimeric murine anti hTNF antibodies have undergone clinical testing for treatment of Crohn s disease van Dullemen et al. 1995 109 129 . The invention includes treatment comprising administering a TNF antibody obtained using the method of the invention to treat intestinal disorders such as idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease using human antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof. Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease includes two syndromes Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis. In one embodiment an antibody obtained using the method of the invention is also used to treat disorders often associated with IBD and Crohn s disease. The term inflammatory bowel disorder IBD related disorder or Crohn s disease related disorder as used interchangeably herein is used to describe conditions and complications commonly associated with IBD and Crohn s disease.

The invention also includes a multiple variable dose regimen comprising administering a TNF antibody to treat Crohn s disease. The treatment of Crohn s disease is based on location extent and severity of disease. Pharmacologic interventions include anti inflammatory agents aminosalicylates and corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents azathioprine and 6 mercaptopurine 6 MP cyclosporine methotrexate MTX antibiotic agents and biologic agents . C reactive protein CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR levels reflect non specific acute phase reactions. Endoscopy is a primary means of diagnosing Crohn s disease. Radiologic features of Crohn s disease are shown by barium examination includes mucosal edema aphthous and linear ulcerations asymmetrical narrowing and strictures and separation of adjacent loops of bowel caused by mesenteric thickening. Abnormalities are focal and asymmetric. The primary histologic lesion is an aphthous ulcer. Subjects with Crohn s disease can be evaluated using the Crohn s Disease Activity Index CDAI which is a standard measure of the severity of the disease with higher scores indicating more severe disease activity.

Examples of Crohn s disease related disorders that can be treated using the methods of the invention include fistulas in the bladder vagina and skin bowel obstructions abscesses nutritional deficiencies complications from corticosteroid use inflammation of the joints erythem nodosum pyoderma gangrenosum and lesions of the eye. Other disorders commonly associated with Crohn s disease include Crohn s related arthralgias fistulizing Crohn s indeterminant colitis and pouchitis.

TNF has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of disorders including inflammatory diseases such as spondyloarthopathies see e.g. Moeller et al. 1990 2 162 U.S. Pat. No. 5 231 024 European Patent Publication No. 260 610 . The invention provides multiple variable dose methods for inhibiting TNF activity in a patient suffering from a spondyloarthropathy which method comprises administering to the patient an antibody antibody portion such that TNF activity in the patient suffering from a spondyloarthropathy is inhibited.

As used herein the term spondyloarthropathy or spondyloarthropathies is used to refer to any one of several diseases affecting the joints of the spine wherein such diseases share common clinical radiological and histological features. A number of spondyloarthropathies share genetic characteristics i.e. they are associated with the HLA B27 allele. In one embodiment the term spondyloarthropathy is used to refer to any one of several diseases affecting the joints of the spine excluding ankylosing spondylitis wherein such diseases share common clinical radiological and histological features. Examples of spondyloarthropathies include ankylosing spondylitis psoriatic arthritis spondylitis enteropathic arthritis reactive arthritis or Reiter s syndrome and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies. Examples of animal models used to study spondyloarthropathies include ank ank transgenic mice HLA B27 transgenic rats see Taurog et al. 1998 . Oxford Oxford University Press .

The automatic injection device of the invention can also be used to treat patients who are at risk of developing a spondyloarthropathy using multiple variable dose methods. Examples of patients who are at risk of having spondyloarthropathies include humans suffering from arthritis. Spondyloarthropathies can be associated with other forms of arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis. In one embodiment of the invention antibodies are used in multiple variable dose methods to treat a patient who suffers from a spondyloarthropathy associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Examples of spondyloarthropathies that can be treated with a TNF antibody are described below 

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis see Verjans et al. 1991 34 486 Verjans et al. 1994 97 45 Kaijtzel et al. 1999 60 140 . Ankylosing spondylitis AS is an inflammatory disorder involving inflammation of one or more vertebrae. AS is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the axial skeleton and or peripheral joints including joints between the vertebrae of the spine and sacroiliac joints and the joints between the spine and the pelvis. AS can eventually cause the affected vertebrae to fuse or grow together. Spondyarthropathies including AS can be associated with psoriatic arthritis PsA and or inflammatory bowel disease IBD including ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease.

Early manifestations of AS can be determined by radiographic tests including CT scans and MRI scans. Early manifestations of AS often include scroiliitis and changes in the sacroliac joints as evidenced by the blurring of the cortical margins of the subchrondral bone followed by erosions and sclerosis. Fatigue has also been noted as a common symptom of AS Duffy et al. 2002 66Abstract . Accordingly multiple variable dose methods comprising administering an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof of the invention can be used to treat AS.

In one embodiment the multiple variable dose method of the invention is used to treat a spondyloarthropathy associated with IBD including AS. AS is often treated with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medications NSAIDs such as aspirin or indomethacin. Accordingly a TNF antibody used in the multiple variable dose method of the invention may also be administered in combination with agents commonly used to reduce inflammation and pain commonly associated with ankylosing spondylitis.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of psoriatic arthritis PsA Pansch et al. 1998 57 691 Ritchlin et al. 1998 25 1544 . As referred to herein psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis associated with the skin refers to chronic inflammatory arthritis which is associated with psoriasis which is a common chronic skin condition that causes red patches on the body. About 1 in 20 individuals with psoriasis will develop arthritis along with the skin condition and in about 75 of cases psoriasis precedes the arthritis. PsA exhibits itself in a variety of ways ranging from mild to severe arthritis wherein the arthritis usually affects the fingers and the spine. When the spine is affected the symptoms are similar to those of ankylosing spondylitis as described above. The TNF antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof obtained using the invention can be used for treatment of PsA.

PsA is sometimes associated with arthritis mutilans. Arthritis mutilans refers to a disorder that is characterized by excessive bone erosion resulting in a gross erosive deformity that mutilates the joint. In one embodiment antibodies obtained using the method of the invention are used to treat arthritis mutilans.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of reactive arthritis which is also referred to as Reiter s syndrome Braun et al. 1999 42 10 2039 . Reactive arthritis ReA refers to arthritis that complicates an infection elsewhere in the body often following enteric or urogenital infections. ReA is often characterized by certain clinical symptoms including inflammation of the joints arthritis urethritis conjunctivitis and lesions of the skin and mucous membranes. In addition ReA can occurs following infection with a sexually transmitted disease or dysenteric infection including chlamydia campylobacter salmonella or yersinia. Accordingly antibodies obtained using the method of the invention may be used to treat ReA.

In one embodiment antibodies obtained using methods of the invention are used to treat patients suffering from undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies see Zeidler et al. 1992 18 187 . Other terms used to describe undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies include seronegative oligoarthritis and undifferentiated oligoarthritis. Undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies as used herein refers to a disorder wherein the patient demonstrates only some of the symptoms associated with a spondyloarthropathy. This condition is usually observed in young adults who do not have IBD psoriasis or the classic symptoms of AS or Reiter s syndrome. In some instances undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies may be an early indication of AS. In one embodiment the invention comprises administering a TNF antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof obtained using the claimed process to treat undifferentiated spondyloarthropathies.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of skin and nail disorders. The term skin disorder or skin disease as used interchangeably herein refers to abnormalities other than injury wounds of the skin that have induced a state of inflammation. In one embodiment the skin disorder of the invention is an inflammatory skin disorder wherein the skin is characterized by capillary dilatation leukocytic infiltration redness heat and or pain. Examples of skin disorders include but are not limited to psoriasis pemphigus vulgaris scleroderma atopic dermatitis sarcoidosis erythema nodosum hidradenitis suppurative lichen planus Sweet s syndrome and vitiligo. As used herein the term skin and nail disorder in which TNF activity is detrimental is intended to include skin and or nail disorders and other disorders in which the presence of TNF in a patient suffering from the disorder has been shown to be or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder e.g. psoriasis. Accordingly skin and nail disorders in which TNF activity is detrimental are disorders in which inhibition of TNF activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and or progression of the disorder. The use of the antibodies antibody portions and other TNF inhibitors of the invention in the treatment of specific skin and nail disorders is discussed further below. In certain embodiments the treatment method of the invention is performed in combination with another therapeutic agent as described below.

1. Psoriasis Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of psoriasis Takematsu et al. 1989 281 398 Victor and Gottlieb 2002 1 264 . The term psoriasis as used herein refers to skin disorders associated with epidermal hyperplasia. Examples of psoriasis include but are not limited to chronic plaque psoriasis guttate psoriasis inverse psoriasis pustular psoriasis psoriasis vulgaris and erythrodermic psoriasis. Psoriasis can also be associated with other inflammatory disorders including inflammatory bowel disease IBD and rheumatoid arthritis RA .

Psoriasis is described as a skin inflammation irritation and redness characterized by frequent episodes of redness itching and thick dry silvery scales on the skin. In particular lesions are formed which involve primary and secondary alterations in epidermal proliferation inflammatory responses of the skin and an expression of regulatory molecules such as lymphokines and inflammatory factors. Psoriatic skin is morphologically characterized by an increased turnover of epidermal cells thickened epidermis abnormal keratinization inflammatory cell infiltrates into the epidermis and polymorphonuclear leukocyte and lymphocyte infiltration into the epidermis layer resulting in an increase in the basal cell cycle. Psoriasis often involves the nails which frequently exhibit pitting separation of the nail thickening and discoloration. Psoriasis is often associated with other inflammatory disorders for example arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease IBD and Crohn s disease. Approximately one third of patients with psoriasis also have psoriatic arthritis PsA which as described above causes stiffness swelling of the joints pain and reduced range of motion Greaves et al. 1995 332 581 .

Evidence of psoriasis is most commonly seen on the trunk elbows knees scalp skin folds or fingernails but it may affect any or all parts of the skin. Normally it takes about a month for new skin cells to move up from the lower layers to the surface. In psoriasis this process takes only a few days resulting in a build up of dead skin cells and formation of thick scales. Symptoms of psoriasis include skin patches that are dry or red covered with silvery scales raised patches of skin accompanied by red borders that may crack and become painful and that are usually located on the elbows knees trunk scalp and hands skin lesions including pustules cracking of the skin and skin redness joint pain or aching which may be associated with of arthritis e.g. psoriatic arthritis.

Treatment for psoriasis often includes a topical corticosteroids vitamin D analogs and topical or oral retinoids or combinations thereof. In one embodiment the TNF antibody of the invention is administered in combination with or the presence of one of these common treatments. Additional therapeutic agents that can be combined with the TNF antibody obtained using the methods of the invention for treatment of psoriasis are described in more detail below.

The diagnosis of psoriasis is usually based on the appearance of the skin. Additionally a skin biopsy or scraping and culture of skin patches may be needed to rule out other skin disorders. An x ray may be used to check for psoriatic arthritis if joint pain is present and persistent.

Improvements in psoriasis in a patient can be monitored by the patient s Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Score PASI . The method for determining the PASI has been described in Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978 157 238 and Marks et al. 1989 125 235. Briefly the index is based on evaluation of four anatomic sites including the head upper extremities trunk and lower extremities for erythema induration and desquamation using a 5 point scale 0 no symptoms 1 slight 2 moderate 3 marked 4 very marked . Based on the extent of lesions in a given anatomic site the area affected is assigned a numerical value 0 0 1 

In one embodiment of the invention a TNF antibody is used for the treatment of psoriasis including chronic plaque psoriasis guttate psoriasis inverse psoriasis pustular psoriasis pemphigus vulgaris erythrodermic psoriasis psoriasis associated with inflammatory bowel disease IBD and psoriasis associated with rheumatoid arthritis RA . In another embodiment a TNF antibody such as adalimumab is used to treat patients who have psoriasis in combination with PsA. Specific types of psoriasis included in the treatment methods of the invention are described in detail below 

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic plaque psoriasis Asadullah et al. 1999 141 94 . Chronic plaque psoriasis also referred to as psoriasis vulgaris is the most common form of psoriasis. Chronic plaque psoriasis is characterized by raised reddened patches of skin ranging from coin sized to much larger. In chronic plaque psoriasis the plaques may be single or multiple they may vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. The plaques are usually red with a scaly surface and reflect light when gently scratched creating a silvery effect. Lesions which are often symmetrical from chronic plaque psoriasis occur all over body but with predilection for extensor surfaces including the knees elbows lumbosacral regions scalp and nails. Occasionally chronic plaque psoriasis can occur on the penis vulva and flexures but scaling is usually absent. Diagnosis of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis is usually based on the clinical features described above. In particular the distribution color and typical silvery scaling of the lesion in chronic plaque psoriasis are characteristic of chronic plaque psoriasis.

Guttate psoriasis refers to a form of psoriasis with characteristic water drop shaped scaly plaques. Flares of guttate psoriasis generally follow an infection most notably a streptococcal throat infection. Diagnosis of guttate psoriasis is usually based on the appearance of the skin and the fact that there is often a history of recent sore throat.

Inverse psoriasis is a form of psoriasis in which the patient has smooth usually moist areas of skin that are red and inflammed which is unlike the scaling associated with plaque psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis is also referred to as intertiginous psoriasis or flexural psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis occurs mostly in the armpits groin under the breasts and in other skin folds around the genitals and buttocks and as a result of the locations of presentation rubbing and sweating can irritate the affected areas.

Pustular psoriasis also referred to as palmar plantar psoriasis is a form of psoriasis that causes pus filled blisters that vary in size and location but often occur on the hands and feet. The blisters may be localized or spread over large areas of the body. Pustular psoriasis can be both tender and painful can cause fevers.

Other examples of psoriatic disorders that can be treated with a TNF antibody delivered using the methods of the invention include erythrodermic psoriasis vulgaris psoriasis associated with IBD and psoriasis associated with arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis.

Pemphigus vulgaris is a serious autoimmune systemic dermatologic disease that often affects the oral mucous membrane and skin. The pathogenesis of pemphigus vulgaris is thought to be an autoimmune process that is directed at skin and oral mucous membrane desmosomes. Consequentially cells do not adhere to each other. The disorder manifests as large fluid filled rupture prone bullae and has a distinctive histologic appearance. Anti inflammatory agents are the only effective therapy for this disease that has a high mortality rate. Complications that arise in patients suffering from pemphigus vulgaris are intractable pain interference with nutrition and fluid loss and infections.

Atopic dermatitis also referred to as eczema is a chronic skin disorder categorized by scaly and itching plaques. People with eczema often have a family history of allergic conditions like asthma hay fever or eczema. Atopic dermatitis is a hypersensitivity reaction similar to an allergy which occurs in the skin causing chronic inflammation. The inflammation causes the skin to become itchy and scaly. Chronic irritation and scratching can cause the skin to thicken and become leathery textured. Exposure to environmental irritants can worsen symptoms as can dryness of the skin exposure to water temperature changes and stress.

Subjects with atopic dermatitis can be identified by certain symptoms which often include intense itching blisters with oozing and crusting skin redness or inflammation around the blisters rash dry leathery skin areas raw areas of the skin from scratching and ear discharges bleeding.

Sarcoidosis is a disease in which granulomatous inflammation occurs in the lymph nodes lungs liver eyes skin and or other tissues. Sarcoidosis includes cutaneous sarcoidosis sarcoidosis of the skin and nodular sarcoidosis sarcoidosis of the lymph nodes . Patients with sarcoidosis can be identified by the symptoms which often include general discomfort uneasiness or an ill feeling fever skin lesions.

Erythema nodosum refers to an inflammatory disorder that is characterized by tender red nodules under the skin typically on the anterior lower legs. Lesions associated with erythema nodosum often begin as flat but firm hot red painful lumps approximately an inch across . Within a few days the lesions may become purplish and then over several weeks fade to a brownish flat patch.

In some instances erythema nodosum may be associated with infections including streptococcus coccidioidomycosis tuberculosis hepatitis B syphilis cat scratch disease tularemia yersinia leptospirosis psittacosis histoplasmosis mononucleosis EBV . In other instances erythema nodosum may be associated with sensitivity to certain medications including oral contraceptives penicillin sulfonamides sulfones barbiturates hydantoin phenacetin salicylates iodides and progestin. Erythema nodosum is often associated with other disorders including leukemia sarcoidosis rheumatic fever and ulcerative colitis.

Symptoms of erythema nodosum usually present themselves on the shins but lesions may also occur on other areas of the body including the buttocks calves ankles thighs and upper extremities. Other symptoms in patients with erythema nodosum can include fever and malaise.

Hidradenitis suppurativa refers to a skin disorder in which swollen painful inflamed lesions or lumps develop in the groin and sometimes under the arms and under the breasts. Hidradenitis suppurativa occurs when apocrine gland outlets become blocked by perspiration or are unable to drain normally because of incomplete gland development. Secretions trapped in the glands force perspiration and bacteria into surrounding tissue causing subcutaneous induration inflammation and infection. Hidradenitis suppurativa is confined to areas of the body that contain apocrine glands. These areas are the axillae areola of the nipple groin perineum circumanal and periumbilical regions.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of lichen planus Sklavounou et al. 2000 29 370 . Lichen planus refers to a disorder of the skin and the mucous membranes resulting in inflammation itching and distinctive skin lesions. Lichen planus may be associated with hepatitis C or certain medications.

Inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor have been implicated in the pathophysiology of Sweet s syndrome Reuss Borst et al. 1993 84 356 . Sweet s syndrome which was described by R. D. Sweet in 1964 is characterized by the sudden onset of fever leukocytosis and cutaneous eruption. The eruption consists of tender erythematous well demarcated papules and plaques which show dense neutrophilic infiltrates microscopically. The lesions may appear anywhere but favor the upper body including the face. The individual lesions are often described as pseudovesicular or pseudopustular but may be frankly pustular bullous or ulcerative. Oral and eye involvement conjunctivitis or episcleritis have also been frequently reported in patients with Sweet s syndrome. Leukemia has also been associated with Sweet s syndrome.

Vitiligo refers to a skin condition in which there is loss of pigment from areas of skin resulting in irregular white patches with normal skin texture. Lesions characteristic of vitiligo appear as flat depigmented areas. The edges of the lesions are sharply defined but irregular. Frequently affected areas in patients with vitiligo include the face elbows and knees hands and feet and genitalia.

Tumor necrosis factor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of scleroderma Tutuncu et al. 2002 20 6 Suppl 28 S146 Mackiewicz et al. 2003 21 41 Murota et al. 2003 48 1117 . Scleroderma refers to a diffuse connective tissue disease characterized by changes in the skin blood vessels skeletal muscles and internal organs. Scleroderma is also referred to as CREST syndrome or progressive systemic sclerosis and usually affects people between the ages 30 50. Women are affected more often than men.

The cause of scleroderma is unknown. The disease may produce local or systemic symptoms. The course and severity of the disease varies widely in those affected. Excess collagen deposits in the skin and other organs produce the symptoms. Damage to small blood vessels within the skin and affected organs also occurs. In the skin ulceration calcification and changes in pigmentation may occur. Systemic features may include fibrosis and degeneration of the heart lungs kidneys and gastrointestinal tract.

Patients suffering from scleroderma exhibit certain clinical features including blanching blueness or redness of fingers and toes in response to heat and cold Raynaud s phenomenon pain stiffness and swelling of fingers and joints skin thickening and shiny hands and forearm esophageal reflux or heartburn difficulty swallowing and shortness of breath. Other clinical symptoms used to diagnose scleroderma include an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR an elevated rheumatoid factor RF a positive antinuclear antibody test urinalysis that shows protein and microscopic blood a chest X ray that may show fibrosis and pulmonary function studies that show restrictive lung disease.

Nail disorders include any abnormality of the nail. The term nail disorder or nail disease as used herein refers to conditions wherein the fingernails or toenails to abnormal color shape texture or thickness. Specific nail disorders include but are not limited to pitting koilonychia Beads lines spoon nails onycholysis yellow nails pterygium seen in lichen planus and leukonychia. Pitting is characterised by the presence of small depressions on the nail surface. Ridges or linear elevations can develop along the nail occurring in a lengthwise or crosswise direction. Beau s lines are linear depressions that occur crosswise transverse in the fingernail. Leukonychia describes white streaks or spots on the nails. Koilonychia is an abnormal shape of the fingernail where the nail has raised ridges and is thin and concave Koilonychia is often associated with iron deficiency.

Nail disorders that can be treated with the TNF antibody of the invention also include psoriatic nails. Psoriatic nails include changes in nails that are attributable to psoriasis. In some instances psoriasis may occur only in the nails and nowhere else on the body. Psoriatic changes in nails range from mild to severe generally reflecting the extent of psoriatic involvement of the nail plate nail matrix i.e. tissue from which the nail grows nail bed i.e. tissue under the nail and skin at the base of the nail. Damage to the nail bed by the pustular type of psoriasis can result in loss of the nail. Nail changes in psoriasis fall into general categories that may occur singly or all together. In one category of psoriatic nails the nail plate is deeply pitted probably due to defects in nail growth caused by psoriasis. In another category the nail has a yellow to yellow pink discoloration probably due to psoriatic involvement of the nail bed. A third subtype of psoriatic nails is characterized by white areas which appear under the nail plate. The white areas are actually air bubbles marking spots where the nail plate is becoming detached from the nail bed. There may also be reddened skin around the nail. A fourth category is evidenced by the nail plate crumbling in yellowish patches i.e. onychodystrophy probably due to psoriatic involvement in the nail matrix. A fifth category is characterized by the loss of the nail in its entirety due to psoriatic involvement of the nail matrix and nail bed.

JRA causes joint inflammation and stiffness for more than 6 weeks in a child of 16 years of age or less. Inflammation causes redness swelling warmth and soreness in the joints. Any joint can be affected and inflammation may limit the mobility of affected joints. One type of JRA can also affect the internal organs.

JRA is often classified into three types by the number of joints involved the symptoms and the presence or absence of certain antibodies found by a blood test. These classifications help the physician determine how the disease will progress and whether the internal organs or skin is affected. The classifications of JRA include the following 

a. Pauciarticular JRA wherein four or fewer joints are affected. Pauciarticular is the most common form of JRA and typically affects large joints such as the knees.

b. Polyarticular HRA wherein five or more joints are affected. The small joints such as those in the hands and feet are most commonly involved but the disease may also affect large joints.

c. Systemic JRA is characterized by joint swelling fever a light skin rash and may also affect internal organs such as the heart liver spleen and lymph nodes. Systemic JRA is also referred to as it Still s disease. A small percentage of these children develop arthritis in many joints and can have severe arthritis that continues into adulthood.

This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application are incorporated herein by reference.

The following examples describe studies using an exemplary automatic injection device e.g. autoinjector or autoinjection pen of the invention. The exemplary autoinjector pen described in the following examples contains a human TNF antibody e.g. adalimumab HUMIRA and is often referred to as the HUMIRA pen below.

Adalimumab is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody for subcutaneous administration by 2 bioequivalent single use injection devices a ready to use prefilled syringe and an integrated disposable delivery system the autoinjection pen. Although pens have been shown to be preferred over syringes by patients requiring long term subcutaneous administration of medications there are no data on preference and pain in the use of biologics in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. Thus the objective of the following study the TOUCH study was to assess injection site pain safety and patient preference of 2 delivery systems of adalimumab.

The objective of the TOUCH study Trial Of Usability in Clinical settings of HUMIRA Autoinjector vs. Prefilled Syringe was to assess which method of delivery rheumatoid arthritis patients preferred the HUMIRA prefilled syringe that they were already using or the new HUMIRA Pen.

Briefly patients with rheumatoid arthritis RA were enrolled in a Phase II multicenter open label single arm sequential trial. Patients self administered a standard dose of adalimumab subcutaneously every other week at each of 3 monitored clinical visits Visit 1 syringe Visits 2 and 3 pen . At each visit patients rated their pain at 2 time points and provided their impressions of and preferences for each delivery system. Safety was evaluated throughout the study and 70 days after final study dose.

Overall fifty two patients were enrolled in the trial and completed all 3 visits. Forty patients 76.9 reported that the pen was less painful than the syringe 4 patients 7.7 found the syringe to be less painful and 8 patients 15.4 had no preference. At Visits 2 and 3 patients had significant mean reductions in injection site pain immediately post injection 1.4 and 1.6 respectively p

In conclusion patients experienced less pain self administering adalimumab via the pen and preferred it over. the syringe. Further patients perceived the pen to be easier to use and more convenient. No differences in safety events were reported between the 2 bioequivalent delivery systems.

The following study was performed to assess which method of delivery patients also referred to herein as users preferred either the HUMIRA also referred to as adalimumab prefilled syringe PFS or the new HUMIRA pen. The following study was also performed to compare the two modes of administration including the level of injection site pain of the 2 delivery systems.

The study design included a phase II multicenter open label study that included patients who had prior experience administering adalimumab using the prefilled syringe. Patients who were 18 years of age had RA diagnosed according to the 1987 revised American College of Rheumatology criteria and had been self administering adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week via the prefilled syringe for at least 3 months were eligible to enroll. Major exclusion criteria included patients with a history of malignancy patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of human immunodeficiency virus demyelinating diseases or poorly controlled chronic disease patients with active infections requiring treatment patients with active tuberculosis or a positive purified protein derivative test within the last 6 months patients who received live investigational drugs within 30 days or 5 half lives patients who were regularly using any medication administered via subcutaneous injection except for adalimumab and women who were pregnant or breastfeeding. Patients in this study were allowed to continue prestudy dosages of standard antirheumatic drug therapies.

Patients n 52 self injected with the HUMIRA prefilled syringe at week 0 followed by injections of the HUMIRA pen at weeks 2 and 4 completing questionnaires at all 3 time points. Patients rated their injection preference for several attributes including overall preference ease of use convenience time to complete injection perceived safety and pain. The study included 3 study visits for patient self administration of adalimumab every other week. Each injection was administered under the supervision of a health care professional at each visit. At Visit 1 patients self administered adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously via a prefilled syringe held at a 45 degree angle to the skin. At Visit 2 patients were instructed by study personnel on proper administration of adalimumab via the pen and on the pen s features including the window for viewing the drug solution before injection and a yellow band to indicate complete injection the sequential opening of safety caps to prevent accidental misfiring and the proper positioning grasp and one touch activation of the device. At Visits 2 and 3 patients self administered adalimumab via the pen held at a 90 degree angle to the skin. Patients chose to self inject in either the thigh or abdomen at Visit 1 and were monitored to ensure they used the same body location for injection at Visits 2 and 3 keeping each injection at least 2 inches from the previous injection site.

The pen was used by the patient according to the following protocol patients were first familiarized with the pen by watching an instructional video and reading a 5 step brochure prior to the pen injection. Patients also used a demonstration pen to practice using the device prior to the pen injection. The steps for using the HUMIRA pen included setting up the pen wherein the pen was removed from the box and allowed to acclimate to room temperature by letting it sit for 15 20 minutes. The patient then swabs themselves with an alcohol swab prior to injection. The injection site was chosen and prepared. HUMIRA was injected using the pen such that the patient pressed the activation button. Once the click was heard the injection began and lasted about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds or when the yellow stopped moving in the window the injection was complete.

Baseline demographics for the study included patients who had been using the HUMIRA PFS between 3 32 months with a mean of 15.4 months. Patients reported that self injection with PFS too 

At week 0 patients were asked the following information the amount of time they have been on HUMIRA their typical injection site their typical time of injection and their overall impression of the syringe. The most common injection sites were the abdomen 25 52 and the thigh 22 52 .

A patient preference survey was administered following the last visit or upon early termination from the study. The survey asked patients to rate their overall preferences syringe pen or no preference and the rationales for their preferences. Patient preference syringe pen or no preference was also rated for each of the following categories ease of use convenience time to administer injection safety and less pain. Patients were also asked to rate their likelihood of switching to the pen if available at the same price extremely unlikely unlikely neutral likely or extremely likely and their likelihood of recommending the pen to another patient receiving adalimumab same ratings as above . At the first and third injections weeks 2 and 4 patients were asked to rate the immediate pain using the pen scale of 0 10 wherein 0 no pain and 10 pain as bad as it could be the amount of pain at 15 30 minutes 0 10 scale their overall impression their injection site whether they experienced a wet or normal injection their adherence to the instructions of the pen and any additional comments.

At the end of the study patients were given a final preference questionnaire to determine the following attributes overall preference as well as reasons specific preference relating to ease of use convenience time of injection safety less pain whether the patient would be likely to switch from the PFD to the pen and whether the patient would be likely to recommend the pen to other patients using adalimumab.

Safety was assessed at baseline for reference and throughout the study using clinical laboratory data and physical examination findings. Patients were monitored for treatment emergent adverse event AE reports whether reported spontaneously by the patient or by the investigator. A serious AE was defined according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities MedDRA version 9.0 as an AE that was fatal or life threatening required prolonged inpatient hospitalization resulted in persistent or significant disability congenital anomaly birth defect miscarriage or elective abortion or required medical surgical intervention to prevent another serious outcome. Number and percentage of study patients with AEs were reported from signed informed consent up to 70 days after last study visit 5 times the estimated half life of adalimumab . Assessments of drug safety and tolerability also compared the 2 and 4 week periods after administration of the syringe and pen respectively. Routine hematology serum chemistry and serology and urinalysis tests were conducted through a certified clinical laboratory. Laboratory reference ranges were obtained prior to the initiation of the study and reviewed by the investigator for screening purposes.

A sample size of approximately 50 patients was needed to demonstrate equivalence between the injection site pain scores following administration of the prefilled syringe vs. the pen with 80 statistical power assuming an equivalence limit of 5 a standard deviation of the differences of 1.25 and a 1 sided Type I error rate of 0.025. Evaluations of preference and injection site pain covered all participants who received 1 injection with a syringe and at least 1 injection with the pen. Baseline characteristics preferences and other categorical data were summarized using means and percentages. An exact 95 CI was computed to compare the patients who either preferred the pen or had no preference with patients who preferred the prefilled syringe. Changes from baseline in injection site pain were analyzed using paired student t test and calculation of 95 CIs. Safety analyses covered all patients who received at least 1 injection. AE rates using each device were compared using the McNemar s test. All statistical tests were performed at the 0.05 level of statistical significance. The statistical analysis was performed using SAS Release 8.2 SAS Institute Inc Cary N.C. with a UNIX Version 11.0 operating system.

An interim study examined statistical and descriptive analysis of information obtained from 17 patients 11 had all 3 visits and 6 had 2 visits. The study also examined baseline and visit 1 data from another 7 patients.

Overall excellent results suggested that the pen is preferred over the syringe. Injection pain was comparable with either the pen or syringe while post injection site pain showed differences mostly in favor of the pen 

The majority reported less post injection site pain with the pen than the syringe Mean values in a 0 10 scale 3.6 syringe 2.4 pen 1 1.9 pen 2 .

Practically all patients found superior the pen for all rating attributes such as overall preference less pain ease of use convenience or safety. The pen was preferred in 63 out of 66 answers 6 preference questions to 11 patients .

Pain data 17 patients pen 1 11 patients pen 2 is shown below in Table 1.1 where injection pain scale 0 10 mean values pen always either same or lower pain than syringe

An interim study following interim study 1 in time examined 19 patients with 3 injections. The interim study 1 summary included exclusively preference results based on descriptive analyses obtained from 31 patients 19 had all 3 visits 5 had 2 visits and 7 had just the first visit.

Overall excellent results confirming that the pen is definitely preferred over the syringe. Practically all patients found superior the pen for all rating attributes such as overall preference less pain ease of use convenience or safety. The pen was preferred in 106 out of 114 answers 6 preference questions to 19 patients .

18 out of 19 patients preferred the pen and considered extremely likely or likely switching to and recommending the pen to others. One patient preferred the syringe considered unlikely to switch and was neutral regarding recommendation.

Comments I seem to be in better control of the injection needle. The second injection felt more painful than the syringe. 

A total of 52 patients were enrolled in the study and completed all 3 study visits. No patients discontinued treatment during the study. Baseline demographics and baseline survey results are included in Table 1.3. Patients enrolled in the study were treated with adalimumab for a mean treatment duration of 15.4 months and were self administering adalimumab with a syringe for the majority of their treatment periods mean duration of self administration was 14.9 months . In addition approximately 655 of patients were receiving concomitant methotrexate and 35 were receiving concomitant steroid therapy. Patients were fairly equally divided as to whether they usually injected their adalimumab doses in the abdomen or thigh whereas a small percentage alternated between sites. During the study 29 patients 55.8 selected their abdomens as their injection site and 23 patients 44.2 selected their thighs as their injection site.

Injection site pain ratings are included in Table 2. At Visit 1 immediately following the syringe injection the mean injection site pain rating was 3.7. Mean pain ratings decreased 37 to 2.3 at Visit 2 and 46 to 2.0 at Visit 3 immediately following the pen injection. Mean within group changes in injection site pain immediately following the injection at Visit 2 pen and Visit 3 pen were statistically significantly reduced P 0.002 and P

At Visit 1 patients were equally divided in rating their overall impressions of their first syringe injections. Approximately one third of the patients rated their overall impressions of the syringe injection as favorable or extremely favorable approximately one third were neutral and approximately one third rated it as unfavorable or extremely unfavorable Table 3 . Following the use of the pen more than 80 of the patients rated their overall impressions of the pen as favorable or extremely favorable at Visit 2 86.5 and Visit 3 88.5 .

The final patient preference survey that was administered following Visit 3 showed that overall 88.5 95 CI 84.1 98.8 of patients preferred the pen 5.8 95 CI 1.2 15.9 preferred the syringe and 5.8 had no preference . Patients were asked to list some of the reasons for their preferences. The majority of patients who chose the pen as their preferred delivery system said it was easier to use and less painful than the syringe. Other reasons why patients preferred the pen included the following no bruising at injection site faster administration time less preparation time and fewer steps to follow better control of the device less force required no need to push syringe to insert needle into skin no view of the needle fewer concerns with needle storage and disposal and no need to draw back on syringe to check for blood. Patients who chose the syringe as their preferred delivery system gave the following reasons familiarity with the syringe no need for change difficulty removing pen cap better control of the injection needle and less painful than the pen.

When patients were asked to rate specific reasons for their preferences more preferred the pen over the syringe for in order from greatest to lowest percentage the following ease of use convenience overall safety and overall attributes same percentage less time to complete the injection and less pain . More than 94 of patients said they would be likely or extremely likely to use the pen if it was available at the same cost as the syringe . Similarly more than 94 of patients said they would recommend the pen to another patient who uses adalimumab .

At each visit patients had their injection techniques assessed by a health care professional to help determine the effectiveness of the training procedure. Overall patient preparation and injection techniques were rated at 98 100 compliant per visit for each component assessed ie prepared the injection site with alcohol inspected the drug level and quality removed the caps in order prepared the skin plateau kept the skin plateau during the injection positioned the pen correctly fired the pen correctly kept constant pressure with no pull back held the injection until complete and observed the yellow stopper in the window when the injection was complete . Approximately 90 of patients noted that the instructional devices video or brochures used by the health care professionals provided adequate training.

No new safety signals were observed during this study. Adalimumab was demonstrated to be generally safe and well tolerated irrespective of syringe or pen delivery. No statistically significant differences were observed between AEs reported during syringe use vs. pen use either in terms of overall AEs or by individual MedDRA preferred term. A total of 13 patients reported a treatment emergent AE 5 while using the prefilled syringe 9.6 and 10 19.2 after 2 pen injections. Two patients reported an AE during both syringe and pen use. Most AEs were mild to moderate and included bronchitis hypersensitivity arthritic pain cough and rhinitis. Three infections and 1 drug hypersensitivity reaction were reported. Two patients had a serious AE while using the pen. Of these a 69 year old white male with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease leading to triple bypass cardiac surgery required hospitalization because of exacerbation of congestive heart failure a diagnosis first established in 1989. This patient received the second dose of adalimumab via pen once stabilized and recovered. The other patient was a 51 year old white male who required hospitalization for the treatment of pneumonia approximately 71 days after the start of study treatment. No other TNF antagonist events of interest including malignancies demyelinating events including multiple sclerosis or lupus like reactions were reported during this study. No patients discontinued from the study in response to a treatment emergent AE and no device failures were reported.

The final results of the study show that 46 out of 52 patients preferred the pen 88.5 while 5.8 n 3 had no preference and 5.8 preferred the PFS n 3 . In addition 40 out of 52 patients thought the pen was less painful 76.9 while 15.4 had no preference. Only 7.7 thought the PFS was less painful. Furthermore patient responses indicated that the pen was easier to use as 49 of 52 patients thought the pen was easier to use 94.2 . Finally the pen was deemed more convenient as 48 of 52 patients thought the pen was more convenient 92.3 . 61.5 n 32 of the patients said that they would be likely to recommend the pen to another HUMIRA user while 32.7 n 17 said they would be likely to recommend and 5.8 n 3 were neutral on the issue. Additional results from the study are shown below in Tables 4 6.

The types and cumulative frequency of adverse events AEs during the 2 wk period after the syringe injection and the 4 wk period after the 2 pen injections were comparable. Five patients 9.6 reported AEs including bronchitis hypersensitivity arthritic pain cough and rhinitis after syringe injection and 8 15.4 after pen injection. There were no AEs leading to discontinuation.

Although the pen was designed to offer patients greater convenience it was unclear what attributes such as less pain would drive patients preferences. This study showed that individual attributes less injection pain safety ease of use convenience and time to complete the injection all favored the pen over the syringe. In this study the pen showed a statistically significant advantage regarding injection pain which was reduced by 46 immediately after injection and by 75 15 30 minutes post injection.

Regarding preference patients were equally divided on their overall impressions of the syringe with respect to 5 prespecified categories i.e. extremely favorable favorable neutral unfavorable and extremely unfavorable . However after switching to the pen patients overall impression ratings shifted significantly toward either favorable or extremely favorable. Moreover after only 2 injections with the pen the majority of patients said they were likely or extremely likely to switch to the pen and to recommend the pen to another patient who was being treated with adalimumab highlighting patients quick acceptance of the pen and its features.

These results may have important treatment implications for patients who require long term TNF inhibitor or other biologic therapies. Because of the relationship of patient preference to adherence to therapy Schwartzman et al. 2004 6 Suppl 2 S19 S23 a patient s preference for a specific route of administration may be a substantial factor in a physician s selection of a biologic therapy. Moreover adherence to therapy is believed to be one of the most important factors in maintaining the long term benefits of TNF antagonist therapy and therefore the lack of adherence can severely compromise the effectiveness of treatment Schwartzman et al. 2004 .

In sum the pen was determined by patients to be easier to use than a prefilled syringe. In addition patients found that the pen was more convenient than the syringe and was less painful than the prefilled syringe. Patients preferred the HUMIRA pen to the HUMIRA PFS across all rating attributes. About 90 of the patients reported an overall preference for the pen compared to the prefilled syringe. 8 out of 10 patients also would recommend the pen to other patients using adalimumab. Finally 80 of the patients rated the pen as less painful than the PFS.

This study indicates that patients believed that the adalimumab pen caused significantly less pain than the traditional prefilled syringe. In additions adalimumab experienced RA patients preferred subcutaneous injection of adalimumab with an autoinjection pen over injection with the prefilled syringe. Patients thought the pen was easier to use more convenient safer and required less time to inject. With regard to the safety profile no apparent differences were observed between the 2 delivery systems. The overall preference of patients for an autoinjection pen device may lead to increased adherence to therapy and in turn improved clinical outcomes during long term therapy with self administered biologic therapies.

Rheumatoid arthritis RA is a chronic debilitating disease that requires long term therapy that is safe and efficacious. Current tools of biologic drug delivery prefilled syringes are painful and cumbersome. Prefilled disposable autoinjector pens like those described in the below example allow for more convenient dosing.

The purpose of the following example was to compare the bioavailability safety and tolerability of adalimumab administered subcutaneously via an autoinjector pen vs. a prefilled syringe

Adalimumab was administered via the Pen or a prefilled syringe in the abdomen or thigh to healthy adult volunteers in this Phase I open label parallel group multicenter study. Regimen A included a 40 mg subcutaneous dose of adalimumab via autoinjector pen while Regimen B included a 40 mg subcutaneous dose of adalimumab via prefilled syringe.

Blood samples were collected by venipuncture prior to dosing Hour 0 at Hours 4 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 108 120 132 144 168 192 240 288 336 and 360 and at Weeks 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 after dosing. Serum concentrations of adalimumab were determined using a validated double antigen immunoassay. The assay had a lower limit of quantification of 3.125 ng mL in diluted serum.

Main Inclusion Criteria included 18 55 years of age and patients were in general good health. Main Exclusion Criteria included pregnancy and a history of positive PPD skin test. Pharmacokinetic analysis included analyzing pharmacokinetic PK parameters that were estimated using non compartmental methods. PK parameters included were maximum observed serum concentration Cmax time to Cmax Tmax area under serum concentration time curve AUC from Hour 0 360 AUC0 360 and AUC from Hour 0 1344 AUC0 1344 

Statistical analysis was performed using the following considerations. A four way analysis of covariance ANCOVA was performed for Tmax and the logarithms of AUC and Cmax with regimen injection site study center and sex as the factors. Body weight was the covariate. To assess bioequivalence of the regimens a two one sided test procedure was carried out for AUC and Cmax via 90 confidence intervals for the ratio of regimen central values. The ratio of regimen central values corresponds to the difference of the regimen main effects in the ANCOVA model.

Safety was evaluated based on assessments of adverse events AEs physical examinations vital signs and laboratory tests

A total of 295 male and female healthy volunteers enrolled in the study. Of these 146 volunteers received a 40 mg dose of adalimumab via an autoinjector pen and 149 subjects received a 40 mg dose of adalimumab via a prefilled syringe. Table 7 contains the summary statistics for demographic parameters

Mean serum adalimumab concentration time profiles were similar in the two regimens. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the pen and prefilled syringe were also comparable between the two injections sites thigh and abdomen.

Pharmacokinetic parameters of adalimumab after administration of each of the two regimens were similar Table 8 . The Tmax log transformed Cmax AUC0 360 and AUC0 1344 central values for the Pen were not statistically significantly different from those for the prefilled syringe Table 8 .

The 90 confidence intervals for log transformed AUC0 360 AUC0 1344 and Cmax were contained within the 0.80 to 1.25 range indicating that the autoinjector test Regimen A was bioequivalent to the prefilled syringe reference Regimen B at both subcutaneous locations thigh and abdomen Table 9 

The autoinjector was well tolerated in this study with a safety profile comparable to that of the prefilled syringe Table 10 

No deaths or discontinuations due to adverse events occurred during the study. One volunteer reported a serious adverse event of appendicitis requiring surgery and hospitalization on Study Day 20. The subject requested to continue participation in the study following her release from the hospital and was allowed to continue following a complete medical evaluation. The majority of the treatment emergent adverse events were assessed by the investigators as not related or possibly related to the study drug and mild in severity.

In conclusion the autoinjector pen was bioequivalent to the prefilled syringe. The two regimens were also bioequivalent at each injection site abdomen and thigh. The safety profile of the pen was comparable to the safety profile of the prefilled syringe
