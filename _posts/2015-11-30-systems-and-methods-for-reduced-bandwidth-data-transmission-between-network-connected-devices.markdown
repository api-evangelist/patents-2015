This application is a continuation of U.S. Nonprovisional patent application Ser. No. 13 929 511 filed Jun. 27 2013 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to data transmission between network connected devices. More specifically exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for reducing bandwidth during the transmission of data such as according to HTTP between devices over the Internet.

People are increasingly accessing Internet content applications and web services over their mobile devices. Many experts have expressed their belief that mobile web traffic has now surpassed traditional desktop based traffic. The use of mobile applications now represents a staggering proportion of consumers free time and of online companies revenue. Web developers publishers and e commerce sites have gone to great lengths to accommodate the tremendous increase in mobile web browsing. For example developers and sites have propagated mobile specific versions of their sites and mobile applications that simplify a user s interaction with content and services in the context of the smaller displays and input mechanisms associated with mobile devices.

In the context of traditional HTTP communications over a network especially in a bandwidth controlled network the need to generate and transmit multiple similar fully constructed requests may cause inefficiencies. For example if a server computer or mobile device is interacting with another server computer or mobile device over a network that device might make two or more requests to the opposing device. For example a mobile phone might send a first request for content to a server and a second request for content to the server. Even though both requests are of the same structure the mobile device must traditionally generate and transmit both entire requests even though only a small input or parameter may be different between the first and second requests. In a bandwidth controlled network and or in a relatively lower bandwidth mobile network the generation and transmission of multiple similar HTTP requests may cause many disadvantages including slow response time user dissatisfaction and lower revenue associated with such activities.

Accordingly a need exists for systems and methods for improved data transmission between network connected devices. More specifically a need exists for systems and methods for reducing bandwidth during the transmission of data such as according to HTTP between devices over the Internet.

Additional objects and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will be set forth in part in the description that follows and in part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the disclosed embodiments. The objects and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the disclosed embodiments as claimed.

Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the disclosure examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.

The present disclosure describes systems and methods for data transmission between network connected devices and for reducing bandwidth used during the transmission of data such as according to HTTP between devices over the Internet. Specifically when using a standard HTTP protocol to transmit data across a network especially in a bandwidth controlled network the need for generating and transmitting multiple similar fully constructed requests may be burdensome on the network and or cause slow performance in an HTTP device. Accordingly the presently disclosed systems and methods include techniques for transmitting HTTP requests including the data that is different from a previous request instead of transmitting an entire fully constructed request including the data that is different from the previous request.

In its most fundamental form if a first HTTP request includes the following request string send me datatype 123 of element i A and the first request is stored as R1 a subsequent request for element B instead of element A may be constructed as R1 i B instead of the longer and larger fully constructed request send me datatype 123 of element i B . Systems and methods according to the presently disclosed techniques may be especially useful when a client is querying a Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP Extensible Markup Language XML or Representational State Transfer REST service where the request has the same structure and only small inputs are changed. By maintaining a copy of the initial request at the server and returning to the client a unique identifier of such request the client may be able to send back only the unique identifier and the needed difference to reconstruct a new request with much lesser payload.

As depicted in first user devices may include for example a mobile device or tablet a laptop and or a computer or server . Likewise the second user devices may include for example a mobile device or tablet a laptop and or computer or server .

In one embodiment user devices may be owned and used by one or more people who may be viewers of web pages and or consumers of content over the Internet either through an application mobile browser or web browser stored on respective user devices. User devices may include any type of electronic device configured to send and receive data such as websites multimedia content and electronic advertisements over electronic network . For example each of user devices may include a mobile device smartphone and or personal digital assistant PDA disposed in communication with electronic network . In addition each of user devices may be a tablet computer or any other kind of touchscreen enabled device personal computer laptop and or server disposed in communication with electronic network . Each of user devices may have a web browser and or mobile browser installed for receiving and displaying electronic content received from one or more web servers. Each of user devices may have an operating system configured to execute a web or mobile browser and any type of application such as a mobile application. In one embodiment user devices may be configured to download applications and or application content from application servers. In one embodiment user devices may be configured to download one or more mobile applications from a mobile application server and execute those one or more applications to receive and manipulate electronic content received from one or more of web servers and or content distribution servers.

The one or more server systems may include any type of web server service or any other type of web resource that may be accessed by one or more of the first or second devices . In one embodiment the server systems may include for purposes of illustration one or more Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP servers one or more Extensible Markup Language XML servers and or one or more Representational State Transfer REST servers . In one embodiment one or more of servers may be associated with an entity that makes and distributes mobile applications or Web based services.

Any or all of the devices and or servers may be disposed in communication with an electronic network such as the Internet. Moreover any pair of the devices and or servers may be configured to exchange data packets over the electronic network according to any suitable predetermined protocol such as hypertext transfer protocol HTTP . Any or all of the devices and or servers may be configured to perform various techniques for exchanging requests for data responses to requests for data and data in manners to reduce the bandwidth used in such exchanges.

Thus even when a pair of devices e.g. nodes A and B or any first and second devices are exchanging very similar structured requests and responses that differ only in certain values or inputs those devices send entire fully constructed requests and responses as described with respect to . Such methods involve significant bandwidth or at the least they do not efficiently conserve bandwidth. This inefficiency is especially burdensome both in terms of time and revenue in low bandwidth networks such as mobile networks or in bandwidth limited or pay per data networks.

Accordingly as described above the presently disclosed systems and methods are directed to solving the above disclosed disadvantages such as by executing the exemplary methods of .

In one embodiment method may include the first system A issuing a first data request step GetDataRequest1 to the second system B . First data request may be any type of request that is structured according to some predetermined protocol such as HTTP. Upon receiving the first data request the second system may store the request step such as by storing the request in cache B StoreRequest1 . In one embodiment cache B may return a first request ID step to node B ReturnRequestID1 or alternatively node B may generate the first request ID step . The second system may then prepare a response step PrepareResponseData1 to the first data request and send the data response and the first request ID step back to the first system GetDataResponse1 RequestID1 .

Upon receiving the first data response step the first system may store the request and request ID step such as by storing the request and request ID in cache A step StoreResponse1 RequestID1 . Accordingly the first system may have received a response to its first request as well as an ID associated with the first request and or the first response. As described above at any given time in the future the first system may be instructed either by a user or operating code to issue a second request to the second system . In some cases the second request may have a format or structure that is similar to or equivalent to the format or structure of the first request. For example the first system may be a client that is querying a SOAP XML REST service operating on the second system where the second request has the same structure as the first request and only small inputs or values are changed.

Accordingly as shown in at any time after receiving and storing the first response the first system may prepare to send a second request to the second system step . Instead of preparing and sending a fully constructed second request the first system may prepare and send to the second system a request differential between the first and second requests along with the first request ID step GetDataRequestDiff2 RequestID1 . In other words the first system may send the second system the ID for looking up the first request and instructions or inputs for generating the second request based on one or more differences between the first and second requests. In some cases the request differential with the first request ID may be considered a partial second data request. Upon receiving the request differential between the first and second requests along with the first request ID the second system may use the first request ID to fetch the first request step e.g. from cache B FetchRequest1 . The second system may receive a returned first request step ReturnRequest1 e.g. from cache B. The second system may then construct a full second request step ConstructFullRequest2 . For example the second system may construct a full second request step based on both the first request as identified by the first request ID and second request differential received from the first system . In one embodiment the second data request may be constructed by merging the received differential between the first data request and the second data request into the first data request. In one embodiment the second data request may be constructed by swapping a payload element in the first data request with a payload element in the received differential between the first data request and the second data request. The second system may then prepare response data step PrepareResponseData2 .

The manner in which the second system may prepare and transmit the response data step to the first system may depend on a number of factors such as any desire to track multiple requests and request IDs and a desired extent of bandwidth conservation. Specifically among other embodiments the second system may in response to receiving the first request ID and the request differential between the first and second requests send back to the first system either i a response differential between the first and second responses ii the response differential between the first and second responses along with a second response ID or iii a fully constructed second response as will be described in more detail with respect to .

In one embodiment the first data request may be a request for a stock price such as the following exemplary structure request 

In this example the first device is requesting a stock price for the company IBM. The string X Diff 1 informs the recipient that the first device intends to invoke the bandwidth conserving techniques of the present disclosure. In one embodiment the second system s storing of the first request returning a request ID for the first request preparing a response to the first request and sending the response to the first system may be executed according to the following exemplary code 

In this example the second device confirms that it is executing the bandwidth conserving techniques of the present disclosure X Diff 1 and assigns the request an ID X Diff Id abc . The second device also includes in the full structure response the specific response to the first device s request namely in this example the stock price for IBM 34.5 .

In one embodiment any second or subsequent data request of a similar or equivalent structure may invoke the bandwidth conserving techniques of the present disclosure by generating and sending a request differential as opposed to a fully constructed response. For example the second data request may be a request for the stock price of another company such as GM as illustrated by the following exemplary code 

In this example the string passes the agreed upon request ID X Diff Id abc and the term 13 8 L3 V GM may be defined where A B is coordinate of the change L is the length of the input to change if specified and V is the target value.

In this example the differential response invokes the bandwidth conserving techniques of the present disclosure X Diff 1 and includes the assigned second request ID X Diff Id efg and the requested stock price of GM in this case 20.0 .

In one embodiment the second data response may include an entire structured response consistent with the exemplary code 

In this example the second device indicates that it is not invoking the bandwidth conserving techniques of the present disclosure X Diff 0 includes the assigned second request ID X Diff Id efg and the requested stock price of GM in this case 20.0 . However the fully constructed second response contains more data than the differential responses generated according to .

Any of user devices and or servers may include any type or combination of computing systems such as handheld devices personal computers servers clustered computing machines and or cloud computing systems. In one embodiment user devices and or servers may be an assembly of hardware including a memory a central processing unit CPU and or optionally a user interface. The memory may include any type of RAM or ROM embodied in a physical storage medium such as magnetic storage including floppy disk hard disk or magnetic tape semiconductor storage such as solid state disk SSD or flash memory optical disc storage or magneto optical disc storage.

Specifically in one embodiment as shown in any of devices devices and or servers may be an assembly of hardware including for example a data communication interface for packet data communication. The platform may also include a central processing unit CPU in the form of one or more processors for executing program instructions. The platform typically includes an internal communication bus program storage and data storage for various data files to be processed and or communicated by the platform such as ROM and RAM although the system often receives programming and data via network communications . The server also may include input and output ports to connect with input and output devices such as keyboards mice touchscreens monitors displays etc. Of course the various server functions may be implemented in a distributed fashion on a number of similar platforms to distribute the processing load. Alternatively the servers may be implemented by appropriate programming of one computer hardware platform.

Program aspects of the technology may be thought of as products or articles of manufacture typically in the form of executable code and or associated data that is carried on or embodied in a type of machine readable medium. Storage type media include any or all of the tangible memory of the computers processors or the like or associated modules thereof such as various semiconductor memories tape drives disk drives and the like which may provide non transitory storage at any time for the software programming. All or portions of the software may at times be communicated through the Internet or various other telecommunication networks. Such communications for example may enable loading of the software from one computer or processor into another for example from a management server or host computer of the mobile communication network into the computer platform of a server and or from a server to the mobile device. Thus another type of media that may bear the software elements includes optical electrical and electromagnetic waves such as used across physical interfaces between local devices through wired and optical landline networks and over various air links. The physical elements that carry such waves such as wired or wireless links optical links or the like also may be considered as media bearing the software. As used herein unless restricted to non transitory tangible storage media terms such as computer or machine readable medium refer to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor for execution.
