One or more embodiments relates to a method of hydrogenation using a hydrogenation catalyst comprising a mixed metal oxide containing metal sites supported on and or incorporated into the lattice. In an embodiment the metal site is a deposited metal and the mixed metal oxide supports the metal site. The metal site comprises a transition metal an alkali metal an alkaline earth metal or mixtures thereof and the mixed metal oxide comprises a pyrochlore a brownmillerite or mixtures thereof. The method of hydrogenation utilizes a reactant gas mixture comprising a carbon oxide such as CO or COand a hydrogen agent such as Hfor the generation of various hydrogenated products including olefins paraffins and others.

Hydrogenation catalysts which enhance reactions between hydrogen and other compounds are a topic of significant interest. In particular catalysts for CO COhydrogenations into higher hydrocarbons are of specific interest. These products are widely used as solvents intermediates fuel additives and neat fuels and producing these products selectively requires catalysts with specific properties. Typically major byproducts from CO COhydrogenations are single carbon compounds so a major challenge is the development of catalysts with higher selectivity towards the higher chain hydrocarbons. There is particular emphasis on high selectivity catalysts for CO COhydrogenations acting in environments of CO CO and H such as syngas which require relatively high stability in the presence of a reducing environment. Generally a variety of catalysts particularly the Group 6 through 11 metals have been employed in CO COhydrogenations but in many cases these catalysts generate broad complex mixtures of hydrocarbons oxygenated hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide. Thus there is a need for CO COhydrogenation catalysts that selectively generate long chain hydrocarbons products.

Certain metals such as Rh. Co and Fe have been extensively studied because of their generally high hydrogenation activities. The activity and selectivity of the active metal catalysts can be increased by various factors such as the presence of promoters the choice of support the synthesis method the use of specific precursors and other factors. Generally optimum long chain hydrocarbon formation requires a balance among the rates of CO dissociation hydrogenation and methyl group insertion. For example promoters such as rare earth metals alkali metals and other transition metals play an important role in these elementary steps. Typically the promoters activate the oxygen atom of an absorbed CO molecule and weaken the C O bond leading to CO dissociation followed by a hydrogenation step to form CHspecies. The mechanism for C C bond formation leading to the formation of long chain hydrocarbons also requires the atomic proximity of another activated CHspecies. Subsequent insertion steps and hydrogenation of the initial Cintermediate leads to higher chain hydrocarbon synthesis. Catalytic metals have also been supported on certain crystalline oxides such as pyrochlores in an effort to promote selectivity in CO COhydrogenations. CO COhydrogenation catalysts have involved catalytic metals such as Co Cu and Rh supported by various structures such as LaZrO LaFeO LaO TiO SiO and AlO. See Kieffer et al. Hydrogenation of CO and COtoward methanol alcohols and hydrocarbons on promoted copper rare earth oxides catalysts 36 1997 and see Chu et al. Conversion of syngas to C1 C6 alcohol mixtures on promoted CuLaZrOcatalysts. 121 1995 and see Fujiwara et al. Hydrogenation of carbon dioxide over copper pyrochlore zeolite composite catalysts 29 1996 . The efforts are generally aimed toward adjustment of the CO dissociation and insertion abilities of the Co Cu or Rh through varying promoter and support compositions. Variations in selectivities are typically attributed to the specific properties of the support the promoter the morphology of the metal and the impact of the support on the reducibility of the metal.

Provided here is a method of hydrogenation utilizing a reactant gas mixture comprising a carbon oxide and a hydrogen agent and a hydrogenation catalyst comprising a mixed metal oxide with a metal site supported by and or incorporated into the lattice. In an embodiment the metal site is a deposited metal and the mixed metal oxide supports the metal site. The metal site comprises a transition metal an alkali metal an alkaline earth metal or mixtures thereof and the conducting oxide comprises a pyrochlore a brownmillerite or mixtures thereof typically doped at an A site or B site of the conducting oxide crystal structure. Contact between the carbon oxide hydrogen agent and hydrogenation catalyst under appropriate conditions of temperature pressure and gas flow rate generate a reaction and products comprising paraffins olefins or combinations thereof where the paraffins olefins or combinations comprise carbon from the carbon oxide and some portion of the hydrogen agent. The carbon oxide may be CO CO or mixtures thereof and the hydrogen agent may be H.

These and other objects aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will become better understood with reference to the accompanying description and claims.

The method generally entails contacting a reactant gas mixture comprising a carbon oxide and a hydrogen agent with a hydrogenation catalyst where the hydrogenation catalyst comprises a mixed metal oxide containing metal sites that can be supported and or incorporated into the lattice. In certain embodiments the metal sites comprise a deposited metal supported by the mixed metal oxide and the deposited metal is a transition metal an alkali metal an alkaline earth metal or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments the carbon oxide is CO. CO or mixtures thereof and the hydrogen agent is H. The mixed metal oxide comprises a pyrochlore or a brownmillerite typically doped at an A site or B site of the mixed metal oxide crystal structure. The A site and B site dopants are typically present at lattice points of the crystal structure of the mixed metal oxide and coordinated with oxygen atoms in the crystal structure of the mixed metal oxide. In some embodiments the A site or B site comprises a noble metal. In additional embodiments the metal site comprises a deposited metal deposited on the mixed metal oxide and comprises a noble metal.

Contact between the carbon oxide hydrogen agent and hydrogenation catalyst generates a hydrogenation reaction and produces a hydrogenated product made up of carbon from the carbon oxide and some portion of the hydrogen agent. In a particular embodiment the hydrogenated product comprises paraffins olefins small quantities of oxygenated hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof.

The various mixed metal oxides described interact with the metal sites to form products from reactant gas mixtures such as syngas with a high degree of selectivity. A feature of the mixed metal oxides utilized here is the ability to isomorphically substitute into the structure various catalytically active elements that can interact at the surface with clusters of metal atoms. Small clusters of metallic sites deposited onto the mixed metal oxide containing structurally incorporated metallic sites provides the unique ability to tailor the distribution of active sites in order to improve product selectivity. Additionally the ability to provide multiple dopants into the mixed metal oxides described allow advantageous use of the bifunctional base hydrogenation catalysts generally used for CO COhydrogenations. The basic sites may act to catalyze the condensation reaction by activating adsorbed CO e.g. by enhancing the formation of the formate intermediate which can be hydrogenated into methyl groups leading to higher chain hydrocarbon growth.

The materials can be processed via a number of synthesis methods including but not limited to solid state diffusion polymeric precursor method e.g. Pechini Method combustion synthesis co precipitation hydrothermal solgel citric acid method chemical vapor deposition atomic layer deposition and other means known in the art for synthesis of metal sites with mixed metal oxides as described herein.

The following description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to use the invention and sets forth the best mode contemplated by the inventors for carrying out the invention. Various modifications however will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art since the principles of the present invention are defined herein specifically to provide a method of conducting a hydrogenation process with a carbon oxide a hydrogen agent and a hydrogenation catalyst comprising a mixed metal oxide and metal sites as described herein to produce olefins paraffins and combinations thereof comprising carbon from the carbon oxide and some portion of the hydrogen agent.

The method generally entails contacting a reactant gas mixture comprising a carbon oxide and a hydrogen agent with a hydrogenation catalyst where the hydrogenation catalyst comprises a mixed metal oxide containing metal sites supported by and or incorporated into the lattice.

In certain embodiments the metal sites comprise a deposited metal supported by the mixed metal oxide and the deposited metal is a transition metal an alkali metal an alkaline earth metal or mixtures thereof. Contact between the carbon oxide hydrogen agent and hydrogenation catalyst under appropriate conditions of temperature pressure and gas flow rate generate a hydrogenation reaction and produce a hydrogenated product made up of carbon from the carbon oxide and some portion of the hydrogen agent. The carbon oxide may be CO CO or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments the hydrogen agent is H. Contact between the reactant gas mixture and the hydrogenation catalyst generates reaction products comprising a hydrogenation product of paraffins olefins or mixtures thereof. In a particular embodiment the reaction products have at least 15 product selectivity preferably at least 30 product selectivity more preferably at least 50 product selectivity for the hydrogenation product of paraffins olefins or mixtures thereof. In another embodiment the reaction products have a less than 20 product selectivity preferably less than 15 product selectivity more preferably less than 10 product selectivity for oxygenated hydrocarbons.

The structure of the various mixed metal oxides described interacts with the metal sites to form products from reactant gas mixtures such as syngas with a high degree of selectivity. Generally and without being bound by theory the effectiveness of catalysts based on metals such as Rh for the formation of products such as Cand higher chain hydrocarbons are greatly improved through interaction with the mixed metal oxide and atomically adjacent promoters.

A feature of the mixed metal oxides utilized here is the ability to isomorphically substitute into the structure various elements that can interact at the surface with clusters of metal atoms. The properties of the mixed metal oxide can be used to tailor the degree and type of interaction with an active metal comprising the metal site to catalyze the conversion of syngas to specific end products.

Hydrogenation catalysts may be prepared using the Pechini Method. See U.S. Pat. No. 3 330 697 issued to Pechini issued Jul. 11 1967 see also Abdelsayed et al. Synthesis characterization and catalytic activity of Rh based lanthanum zirconate pyrochlores for higher alcohol synthesis 207 2013 . Sources of the metal cations A A B or B include compounds of those cations and mixtures thereof. An exemplary preparation method follows.

Metal nitrate precursors and citric acid are dissolved separately into deionized water. The citric acid metal molar ratio may be from 1.0 1.5 preferably about 1.2. The aqueous metal salts are then combined into one beaker and stirred. The aqueous citric acid is then added to the combined metal salt solution. This solution is heated to 60 80 C. preferably about 70 C. with continuous stirring. Ethylene glycol EG is then added to the heated solution. The ethylene glycol citric acid molar ratio may be from 1.0 4.0 preferably about 1.0. The solution is stirred continuously at the desired temperature for several hours to evaporate the majority of the water and to accelerate polymerization between metal chelated citric acid and ethylene glycol. A clear viscous gel is obtained which is further heated at 130 C. in a heating mantle until an amorphous polyester type resin is obtained. The solid material is collected and calcined at 700 1200 C. preferably about 1000 C. for 4 12 hours preferably about 8 hours to breakdown the organic polymer and burns the carbon off leading to a highly crystalline mixed metal oxide.

Microwave assisted chemical reduction method is used to deposit 2 wt Rh on the surface of either pure or Rh substituted lanthanum zirconate LZ pyrochlore catalysts prepared by modified Pechini method mentioned under pyrochlore synthesis . In a typical procedure rhodium nitrate is dissolved in a 100 ml of a HO EtOH 1 2 mixture such that the Rh metal content is equivalent to 2 wt Rh. The LZ powder is dispersed in the above mentioned solution for 3 hours. Next hydrazine monohydrate 500 l is added quickly under vigorous stirring at room temperature. The solution is kept under stirring for another hour before being transferred into a sealed Teflon vessel and placed on a turntable tray of an Anton Paar microwave reaction system Synthos 3000 equipped with pressure and temperature sensors. The dispersion is microwaved for 5 min under continuous stirring and 800 W of microwave power. After cooling the dispersion the particles are separated by centrifuge washed with ethanol and dried under vacuum at 10Torr for 48 hours. After drying the Rh deposited pyrochlore catalyst is calcined at 400 600 C. preferably about 500 C. in air for 2 5 hours preferably about 3 hours.

Microwave assisted chemical reduction method which is very different from conventional impregnation methods offers fast and size controlled particle nucleation and deposition on catalytic supports. Microwave irradiation MWI provides a fast dielectric heating to the reaction mixture due to the difference in the reactant and solvent dielectric constants leading to enhancement in the reduction rate of Rh nitrate by hydrazine hydrate. A microwave induced homogeneous nucleation of metal clusters is intended to produce a narrow size distribution of Rh on the catalyst support.
