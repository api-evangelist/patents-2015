The disclosure generally relates to digital imaging. For example the disclosure may include methods systems and apparatuses for multi directional still pictures and or multi directional motion pictures.

A still picture generally represents a photographer s choice of a fixed view of an object. Still pictures do not enable an intuitive portrayal of most objects nor an interactive way in which a viewer may want to experience an object on today s mobile embedded and other computing devices.

Sequentially changing pictures i.e. film etc. are merely a view of what the director of the film wanted viewers to see. Predefined sequence of changing pictures makes film inflexible from the viewer s standpoint. Usually the only operations viewers can perform on a film are playing pausing forwarding and rewinding the sequence of pictures. These imaging and viewing options are limiting to the user failing to enable the user with interactive viewing and flexible operating options.

In one example initial Multi directional Still Picture may include a Forward Still Picture with a view of a park s walkway facing one of the nearby buildings as shown in Step 1 of . Core Program may display the Forward Still Picture of the initial Multi directional Still Picture in Picture Display . Core Program may then associate Picture Arrows etc. with Still Pictures etc. of the initial Multi directional Still Picture . Core Program may further associate Direction Arrows etc. with Multi directional Still Picture Links etc. of the initial Multi directional Still Picture . Core Program may further associate Orientation Pointer with Orientation of the initial Multi directional Still Picture . User may select or activate a Picture Arrow etc. responsive to which Core Program may display a Still Picture etc. to which the selected Picture Arrow etc points. This way user may change the view from a location represented by the initial Multi directional Still Picture . User may also select or activate a Direction Arrow etc. responsive to which Core Program may execute Multi directional Still Picture to which Multi directional Still Picture Link etc. associated with the selected Direction Arrow etc. points. This way user may move from the initial to another Multi directional Still Picture which may bring user to a next location on the park s walkway such as the location depicted in Step 2 of . User may similarly utilize Direction Arrows etc to move among any Multi directional Still Pictures . User may also select or activate Orientation Pointer responsive to which Core Program may change Orientation .

Multi directional Still Pictures including Multi directional Still Picture Angles etc. may capture this physical feature of the represented object i.e. park in this example . In another example a user may want to obtain a graphical representation i.e. a printout map etc. of the represented object including a collection of Multi directional Still Pictures . The graphical representation of the collection of Multi directional Still Pictures may be accurately displayed by using Multi directional Still Picture Angles etc. Any Multi directional Still Picture Angle may be used such as for example 3 degree 4 degree 5 degree 6 degree 7 degree 9 degree 10 degree 11 degree 15 degree 23 degree 25 degree 28 degree 30 degree 35 degree 45 degree 47 degree 60 degree 66 degree 75 degree 88 degree 90 degree 113 degree 187 degree 256 degree 299 degree 315 degree 348 degree 360 degree 553 degree 1692 degree 32884 degree and others. In addition to degrees units of measurement for Multi directional Still Picture Angles etc. may include angular minutes angular seconds any fractions thereof or any other units of angular measurement. All described features and embodiments of Multi directional Still Picture Angles etc may similarly be utilized with Multi directional Motion Pictures later described where they may be referred to as Multi directional Motion Picture Angles.

Referring to an embodiment of MDP Unit implemented to include stitching of Still Pictures etc. of a Multi directional Still Picture is illustrated. Any image stitching or picture stitching algorithms or techniques known in art may be used to combine multiple digital pictures with overlapping fields of view. Commonly performed through the use of computer software most approaches to image stitching require nearly exact overlaps between distinct pictures. Some picture taking equipment such as high end digital cameras may stitch digital pictures internally. Some of the known software programs and or algorithms for picture stitching include Autostitch Hugin Panorama Maker Ptgui Panorama Tools Microsoft Research Image Composite Editor CleVR Stitcher and others. Some general purpose picture editing programs may also stitch digital pictures such as Adobe Systems Photoshop which may include tools known as Photomerge and Auto Blend. MDP Unit may utilize stitched pictures from one of the above mentioned programs or may implement internal i.e. within Core Program picture stitching by utilizing one of the publicly available picture stitching algorithms. In one example in which Still Pictures etc. may include overlapping fields of view needed for picture stitching process the resulting Combined Picture may be a partial or full 360 degrees panoramic picture that may enable a user to rotate the View from the location represented by a Multi directional Still Picture in all directions. As such means of input such as a control wheel a track ball virtual ball i.e. a ball shown through a graphical user interface etc. and or other rotational means of input may be used instead of or in addition to Picture Arrows etc. In some aspects user s rotation of View of the Combined Picture may be accompanied with Core Program s adjustment or change of Orientation to correspond to the rotation of view. In other aspects the means of input such as control wheel track ball virtual ball and or other rotational means of input Picture Arrows etc. and or other elements of the disclosed methods systems and apparatuses may themselves rotate to correspond to a change of Orientation or direction as the view of Combined Picture rotates.

In some embodiments in which picture stitching may be implemented movement among Multi directional Still Pictures may be implemented by approximating which Multi directional Still Picture Link etc. the user wanted to use in cases where the angle or direction of view of the Combined Picture does not perfectly match the angle or direction of a particular Multi directional Still Picture Link etc. Such approximation may include comparing the angle of user s View of the Combined Picture with Multi directional Still Picture Angles etc to determine the closest Multi directional Still Picture Link etc. In one example Right Multi directional Still Picture Link may be approximated from 20 degrees angle of user s View of the Combined Picture . In another example Left Multi directional Still Picture Link may be approximated from 170 degrees angle of user s View of the Combined Picture . All described features and embodiments of stitching Still Pictures etc. and Multi directional Still Picture Link etc. approximation may similarly be utilized with Motion Pictures etc. later described where the Combined Picture may include combined Motion Pictures etc. In some aspects streams of time stamped still pictures i.e. Motion Pictures etc. may be stitched into a combined stream of time stamped still pictures. Such stitching of streams of time stamped still pictures may include stitching of still pictures having same time stamps from each stream as previously described in still picture stitching. The combined stream of time stamped still pictures may therefore include a stream of combined still pictures depicting a panoramic view from a location of a represented object.

Multi directional Still Picture Distance etc. may be utilized to indicate a distance between the current Multi directional Still Picture and a Multi directional Still Picture referenced or pointed to by a specific Multi directional Still Picture Link etc. As such Multi directional Still Picture Distances etc may be utilized in representations of objects where Multi directional Still Pictures may be arranged at unequal distances. In one example some of park s walkways may be long and fewer Multi directional Still Pictures may be used to cover the distance. Multi directional Still Pictures including Multi directional Still Picture Distances etc. may capture this physical feature of the represented object i.e. park in this example . In another example a user may want to obtain a graphical representation i.e. a printout map etc. of the represented object including a collection of Multi directional Still Pictures . The graphical representation of the collection of Multi directional Still Pictures may be accurately displayed by using Multi directional Still Picture Distances etc. Any Multi directional Still Picture Distance may be used such as for example 1 meter 2 meters 3 meters 4 meters 5 meters 6 meters 7 meters 9 meters 10 meters 11 meters 15 meters 23 meters 25 meters 28 meters 30 meters 35 meters 45 meters 47 meters 60 meters 66 meters 75 meters 88 meters 90 meters 100 meters 1000 meters 10000 meters 100000 meters and others. In addition to meters units of measurement for Multi directional Still Picture Distances etc may include millimeters centimeters decimeters kilometers inches feet yards any fractions thereof or any other units of length measurement. All described features and embodiments of Multi directional Still Picture Distances etc. may similarly be utilized with Multi directional Motion Pictures later described where they may be referred to as Multi directional Motion Picture Distances.

Speech Recognizer may include functions and algorithms for processing input events of Microphone for use by Core Program and or other elements of the disclosed methods systems and apparatuses. Speech Recognizer may include functions and algorithms for listening to voice events on Microphone interpreting the voice events as User s voice commands and or transmitting the voice commands for use by Core Program . Speech Recognizer may fall under the general description of the previously described input Interface and while it includes all the aforementioned embodiments it is described separately in this embodiment to offer additional detail on its functioning. Speech Recognizer may be implemented by utilizing 1 a Computing Device operating system s speech recognition functionality such as iOS s Voice Services Siri etc. which may come inherently as the part of the computing device or mobile device package 2 a Java Speech API JSAPI or any of its implementations such as The Cloud Garden Sphinx etc. and or 3 applications or engines providing speech recognition functionality such as OpenEars Dragon Mobile iSpeech CeedVocal EliJulius etc. In some aspects a lexicon of voice commands i.e. words phrases etc. may be utilized in which each voice command may be associated with the previously described input means such as Picture Arrow etc. Direction Arrow etc. Orientation Pointer and or other input means to facilitate the input of operating instructions through voice input. In one example a phrase go forward may be a voice command in the lexicon and it may be associated with a Forward Multi directional Still Picture Link or Forward Multi directional Motion Picture Link . In another example a phrase look right may be a voice command in the lexicon and it may be associated with a Right Still Picture or Right Motion Picture . In some embodiments MDP Unit including Speech Recognizer may enable a user to utilize the functionalities described herein by issuing voice commands i.e. words phrases etc. combined with utilizing the previously described input means such as Picture Arrows etc. Direction Arrows etc. Orientation Pointer and or other input means. In other embodiments MDP Unit with Speech Recognizer may enable a user to utilize the functionalities described herein by issuing voice commands only which voice commands may select or activate the previously described input means such as Picture Arrows etc. Direction Arrows etc. Orientation Pointer and or other input means.

Microphone may comprise any hardware software or a combination of hardware and software. Microphone may include functions and algorithms for receiving and or detecting User s voice events or inputs. Most modern computing and mobile devices include Microphone as one of the input devices.

In some embodiments MDP Unit may use the Computing Device operating system s speech recognition functionality as the Speech Recognizer .

Depending on resource availability Speech Recognizer may be implemented as keyword spotting or as full speech recognition. Keyword spotting may attempt to find only a select group of words and or phrases and because of this limited lexicon it consumes fewer resources. In the case of keyword spotting implementation words or phrases such as forward go forward backward go backward right go right left go left forward picture look forward backward picture look backward right picture look right left picture look left north orientation south orientation east orientation west orientation forward orientation backward orientation right orientation left orientation and or other words or phrases may define the select group of words and or phrases to be searched. Full speech recognition may attempt to find all words and or phrases that have been spoken and because of this broader lexicon it consumes significant resources. In the case of full speech recognition implementation the broadness of words and or phrases would by definition include all words or phrases needed for MDP Unit In some embodiments both keyword spotting and full speech recognition implementations may include a file or database of words and or phrases located locally on the Computing Device or remotely on a Remote Computing Device accessible over a Network .

Referring to the illustration shows an embodiment of MDP Unit implemented to include multi user functionality also referred to as multi user MDP Unit or MDP application . Multi user MDP Unit may enable multiple users to see and or interact with each other within a MDP application. In some aspects each user of a multi user MDP application may be represented and or shown by his her Avatar . A user may see other users Avatars through Display Window as the user moves among Multi directional Still Pictures and views Still Pictures etc. In some embodiments an instance of multi user MDP Unit may execute or run on a Remote Computing Device i.e. application server cloud etc. to which users may connect over a Network i.e. corporate enterprise network Internet etc. . Users may be remote from each other i.e. in different buildings in different cities in different parts of the world etc. and may use their Computing Devices networking functionalities to connect to a Remote Computing Device i.e. application server cloud etc. running an instance of multi user MDP Unit . As such multi user MDP Unit may be implemented as a network service for all the world s users who wish to experience seeing and or interacting with each other in a MDP application. In some aspects multi user functionality may be implemented to create or define a virtual world where users may see and or interact with each other. Users may be offered a variety of types or forms of Avatars from which to choose. For example a female user may prefer a female looking Avatar wearing a long skirt whereas a male user may prefer a muscular looking Avatar wearing a t shirt. Each Avatar may be associated with a Multi directional Still Picture of the Avatar s user s location within a multi user MDP application. Association of a user s Avatar and a Multi directional Still Picture may include Avatar s identifier and Multi directional Still Picture s identifier Associations of users Avatars and Multi directional Still Pictures may be tracked and or stored in Multi directional Pictures Repository and or any file object data structure DBMS database system process or other repository. Once associated with a Multi directional Still Picture of the user s location in a represented object an Avatar may be shown at that location. In some embodiments showing an Avatar may include inserting Avatar s picture into one or more Still Pictures etc. of one or more Multi directional Still Pictures . As a user moves from one Multi directional Still Picture to another his her Avatar s picture may be deleted from Still Pictures etc. where it was previously inserted and his her Avatar s picture may be inserted into new Still Pictures etc. to correspond to user s new location.

In some aspects an Avatar i.e. avatar s face and frontal side may be turned in the direction of his her user s view or selection of Still Picture etc. For example if Avatar s user is viewing a Forward Still Picture including a view of a building the Avatar s face and frontal side may be directed toward the building. As such pictures of variously directed versions of the same Avatar may be maintained and inserted into or superimposed onto Still Pictures etc. based on Avatar s user s direction of view. In some embodiments Avatar s direction may be associated with Orientation . In other embodiments Avatar s direction may be unassociated with user s direction of view and or Orientation in which case user may control his her Avatar s direction by utilizing input means on the Computing Device such as arrows or other directional signs indicating Avatar s direction. A user may move his her Avatar into various locations by moving among Multi directional Still Pictures i.e. locations of a represented object . Generally Avatar s location may correspond to Avatar s user s location i.e. Multi directional Still Picture representing the location in a represented object and Avatar s movement may correspond to Avatar s user s movement among Multi directional Still Pictures . However in some embodiments Avatar s movement may be unassociated with his her user s movement among Multi directional Still Pictures in which case user may control his her Avatar s movement by utilizing input means on the Computing Device such as arrows or other directional signs indicating Avatar s movement.

In some embodiments multi user MDP Unit may enable a user to experience first person perspective or view First person perspective may show other users Avatars but may not typically show user s own Avatar . In some implementations of first person perspective user may be able to see his her Avatar s hands feet other body parts and or objects that Avatar may be holding. In other embodiments multi user MDP Unit may enable a user to experience third person perspective where user may see his her own Avatar as well as other users Avatars . In some aspects third person perspective may be achieved by inserting or superimposing user s own Avatar s picture into onto a Still Picture etc. of a Multi directional Still Picture representing user s location in a collection of Multi directional Still Pictures . In other aspects third person perspective may be achieved by inserting or superimposing user s own Avatar s picture into onto a Still Picture etc. of a nearby Multi directional Still Picture and displaying the Still Picture etc. of the nearby Multi directional Still Picture comprising Avatar s picture. In some embodiments positional audio may be implemented where ambient sounds may vary depending on Avatar s location in a represented object. In other embodiments audio conversation among proximal Avatars may be implemented via their user s network interconnected Computing Devices and their respective sound input and output devices i.e. microphones speakers etc. and interfaces i.e. Input Interfaces Output Interfaces etc. . In one example a user may view a Forward Still Picture including a view of a park s walkway facing a nearby building where another user s Avatar may stand as shown in Step 1 of . Picture Display may show Forward Still Picture including inserted or superimposed picture of the other user s Avatar . User may select or activate Forward Direction Arrow and move from current to a next Multi directional Still Picture which may bring user to a next location on park s walkway such as location depicted in Step 2 of . Such movement may bring user and or his her Avatar closer to the other user s Avatar .

As such multi user MDP Unit may enable a user to view all views i.e. forward backward right left up down diagonal angular etc. from all locations i.e. Multi directional Still Pictures of a represented object i.e. park in this example as well as to simulate user s motion through the represented object i.e. park in this example including seeing and or interacting with other users Avatars . In some embodiments each Avatar s location and or identification i.e. name of user or user s avatar etc. may be shown on Map . This functionality may enable a user to instantly visit a Multi directional Still Picture i.e. location of a represented object associated with another user s Avatar by clicking on Map s spot indicating the other user s Avatar .

In some embodiments movement appearance behavior and or other features and or aspects of an Avatar may be controlled by a program or algorithm. Such program or algorithm may include a collection of references to Multi directional Still Pictures defining a path of movement of Avatar . Such program or algorithm may include Avatar s picture defining appearance of Avatar Such program or algorithm may include a set of instructions defining Avatar s behaviors and or emotions such as for example behaviors and or emotions in proximity to other Avatars or objects. Such program or algorithm may include functionality to control or define any other features or aspects of Avatar . In one example Avatar may be programmed to circle a building in a college campus i.e. represented object at night. The program or algorithm controlling Avatar may include a collection of references to Multi directional Still Pictures representing locations around the building. The program or algorithm controlling Avatar may include a picture of a security guard as Avatar s picture. The program or algorithm controlling Avatar may include a set of instructions that may cause Avatar to display certain behaviors or emotions in specific situations. Using the collection of references to Multi directional Still Pictures Avatar may move among the referenced Multi directional Still Pictures . A period of time may be defined to be spent by Avatar in each Multi directional Still Picture before moving to a next Multi directional Still Picture in the collection. Users of a multi user MDP Unit may see the security guard picture of Avatar and interact with the Avatar . If a user controlled Avatar approaches the guarded building the program or algorithm may cause the program controlled Avatar to position itself in front of the incoming user s Avatar and issue audible warning i.e. access to this building is restricted at night etc. for example. Any other movements appearances behaviors and or other features and or aspects of an Avatar may similarly be implemented by a program or algorithm. In some embodiments program controlled Avatars may interact with each other and or objects in a MDP application as if they were user controlled Avatars . Such functionality may enable implementation of an evolving virtual world with various and or unforeseen scenarios based on program controlled Avatars interactions. Human users may enter and experience this evolving virtual world and interact with program controlled Avatars as previously described.

Referring to the illustration shows an embodiment of multi user MDP Unit implemented to show Avatar . In one example a Forward Still Picture may include a view from a location of a represented object. Another user s Avatar may be within field of view or line of sight and the Avatar s picture may be shown in the Forward Still Picture . In some embodiments Avatars picture may be inserted into Forward Still Picture by replacing pixels of the Forward Still Picture with Avatar s picture s pixels through picture processing. Additional picture processing may also be performed on Forward Still Picture such as for example adding a shadow by darkening pixels near Avatar s picture smoothing pixels around the edges of Avatar s picture for a finer blending into the background of Forward Still Picture and or any other picture processing to enhance appearance of Avatar . In other embodiments Avatar s picture may be superimposed or overlayed onto Forward Still Picture . In some aspects superimposing or overlying Avatar s picture onto Forward Still Picture may include creating or defining a new layer i.e. digital picture layer etc. comprising Avatar s picture s pixels for Avatar s appearance and or transparent pixels for the background i.e. Forward Still Picture etc. . Examples of types of digital pictures including layer and or transparency functionalities include Portable Document Format PDF Graphics interchange Format GIF Photoshop Document PSD and or other types or formats of digital pictures. In yet other embodiments Avatar s picture may be inserted into or superimposed onto a copy i.e. copy in memory temporary copy etc. of Forward Still Picture without altering the original Forward Still Picture

In some embodiments picture processing may be implemented on a Computing Device to find Still Pictures etc. that may be within a line of sight from an Avatar s location. Avatars picture may then be inserted into or superimposed onto the found Still Pictures etc for users of a multi user MDP Unit to see the Avatar from various locations and or distances within a line of sight. Finding Still Pictures etc. that may be within a line of sight from an Avatar s location may include identifying a Region around a position where Avatar s picture may be inserted into or superimposed onto a Still Picture etc. In some aspects finding Still Pictures etc that may be within a line of sight from an Avatar s location may include identifying a Region around a position where Avatar s picture may be inserted into or superimposed onto a Still Picture etc of a Multi directional Still Picture associated with Avatar i.e. Avatar s location . Region may include any portion subset or area of the Still Picture etc. from which it originates. Region may be of any shape or size such as for example a Region shaped as Avatar s picture a Region larger or smaller than Avatar s picture a Region partially shaped as Avatar s picture a rectangular Region around Avatar s picture a round Region around Avatar s picture an odd shaped Region around Avatar s picture and or any other Region around a position where Avatar s picture may be inserted or superimposed. Finding Still Pictures etc. that may be within a line of sight from an Avatar s location may include comparing the identified Region with another Still Picture etc i.e. comparative picture to determine if the Still Picture etc. i.e. comparative picture may include all or a portion of Region . Finding a Still Picture etc. i.e. comparative picture that may include all or a portion of Region may indicate that the Still Picture etc. i.e. comparative picture may belong to a same line of sight as a Still Picture etc. from which the identified Region originates. This indication may be derived from a premise that if one digital picture i.e. comparative picture etc. may include all or a portion of a region of another digital picture the two digital pictures may be portraying the same line of sight. In some aspects comparing digital pictures to determine if one may include all or a portion of a region i.e. Region of another picture may be performed by determining if a region of pixels of one picture i.e. comparative picture may match a region i.e. Region of pixels of another picture. The threshold for similarity in each of the pixels required for a match may be adjustable by a user or automatically adjustable as needed Such threshold may include exact match such as 100 match nearly exact match such as 90 or 80 match mostly match such as 70 or 60 half match such as 50 low match such as 40 or 30 match or any other match. The threshold for the number of pixels required for a match may similarly be adjustable. In other aspects comparing digital pictures to determine if one may include all or a portion of a region i.e. Region of another picture may be performed by determining if a region of pixels of one picture i.e. comparative picture may match a resized i.e. downsized upsized etc. region i.e. Region of pixels of another picture. Any of the publically available or other digital picture resizing algorithms or techniques may be used. Resizing of Region may be performed incrementally i.e. resizing by one pixel at a time in length or width keeping aspect ratio constant etc. to reduce or increase the size i.e. number of pixels etc. of Region . Each incrementally resized Region or a copy thereof may then be compared with all regions of a comparative picture A comparative picture whose region may be found to match Region may be a Still Picture etc. within a same line of sight as a Still Picture etc from which Region originates. If a match is not found between any regions of a comparative picture and any of the incrementally resized Regions or copies thereof the comparison may be performed between regions of other Still Pictures etc. i.e. comparative pictures in a MDP application and resized Regions or copies thereof. As such regions of all Still Pictures etc in a MDP application may be compared with resized Regions or copies thereof to find all Still Pictures etc that may include all or a portion of Region . Avatar s picture may then be inserted into or superimposed onto these Still Pictures etc. In some aspects inserting or superimposing Avatar s picture into onto Still Pictures etc. found to be within a line of sight may include inserting or superimposing Avatar s picture in position where a resized Region is found in each of the Still Pictures etc. In other aspects Avatar s picture or a copy thereof may be resized and then inserted into or superimposed onto Still Pictures etc. to show a view of the Avatar in perspective as later described.

In one example Avatar may be associated with a Multi directional Still Picture on a park s walkway near a building as shown in . Avatar s picture may be inserted into or superimposed onto Forward Still Picture of the Multi directional Still Picture associated with the Avatar . This way Avatar s picture may be shown to users of a multi user MDP application at Avatar s location. Picture processing may be implemented on a Computing Device to find Still Pictures etc that may be within a line of sight from Avatar s location i.e. Multi directional Still Picture associated with Avatar . Region may be identified around the position where Avatar s picture may be inserted into or superimposed onto Forward Still Picture . Such Region may include a selection of pixels such as for example a rectangular selection of pixels that may be larger than the Avatar s picture. Still Pictures etc. that may be within a line of sight from Avatar s location may then be detected by finding Still Pictures E etc. of any Multi directional Still Pictures that may include all or a portion of the identified Region . A first Still Picture etc. i.e. comparative picture may be compared with Region to determine if a region of pixels of the first Still Picture etc. i.e. comparative picture may match all or a portion of pixels of Region . Such comparison may include incrementally downsizing Region by one pixel at a time in length or width keeping aspect ratio constant i.e. reducing the size from 40 120 pixels to 39 117 pixels etc. and comparing the downsized Region with all regions of the first Still Picture etc. to find a region of the first Still Picture etc. that may match all or a portion of pixels of the downsized Region . The downsized Region may first be compared with a same sized i.e. 39 117 pixels in this example etc. initial region of the first Still Picture etc. starting at pixel 1 1 . If a match is not found the downsized Region may then be compared with a same sized i.e. 39 117 pixels in this example etc. region of the first Still Picture etc starting at pixel 2 1 . If a match is still not found the downsized Region may then be compared with same sized i.e. 39 117 pixels in this example etc. regions of the first Still Picture etc. each starting at remaining pixels in y line 1 i.e. 3 1 4 1 5 1 . . . . If a match is still not found the downsized Region may then be compared with same sized i.e. 39 117 pixels in this example etc. regions of the first Still Picture etc. each starting at remaining pixels in y lines 2 i.e. 1 2 2 2 3 2 . . . 3 4 and so on until the last pixel of the first Still Picture etc pixel coordinates in a digital picture and an example of a searching pattern are later described in more detail . The comparison may include any initial region of the first Still Picture etc. such as for example region in the middle of first Still Picture etc. region at the end of first Still Picture etc. region at right of first Still Picture etc. region at left of first Still Picture etc. and or any other initial region. Also the comparison may include any search pattern for regions of the first Still Picture etc such as for example linear searching in any direction outward searching from a middle region forward searching from a region in the beginning backward searching from a region at the end and or any other search pattern. If a match is not found between any region of the first Still Picture etc. and the downsized Region Region may be downsized to a next smaller size. All regions of the first Still Picture etc. may then be compared with the new downsized Region to find a region of the first Still Picture etc. that may match all or a portion of the new downsized Region . Incrementally downsizing Region and comparing regions of the first Still Picture etc. with downsized Regions may be repeated until a match is found. If any region of the first Still Picture etc. is found to match all or a portion of any downsized Region the first Still Picture etc. may be within a same line of sight as a Still Picture etc. from which Region originates. Any of the described steps for comparing regions of the first Still Picture etc. with downsized Regions may be performed with all Still Pictures etc. in a MDP application to find Still Pictures etc. within a same line of sight as Still Picture etc from which Region originates. Avatar s picture may then be inserted into or superimposed onto these Still Pictures etc. in position where Region is found in each of the Still Pictures etc. This way users of a multi user MDP application may see Avatar from various locations and or distances within a line of sight. In some aspects Avatar s picture may be shown in perspective i.e. larger as the distance from the observer decreases and smaller as the distance from the observer increases . Showing Avatar s picture in perspective may include inserting or superimposing increased size Avatar s picture into onto Still Pictures etc. as user approaches the Avatar or decreased size Avatar s picture as user retreats from the Avatar . In some embodiments a line of sight may be identified as same direction Still Pictures etc. of any Multi directional Still Pictures positioned in a straight line. In one example Forward Still Pictures of any Multi directional Still Pictures on a straight walkway in a park may be within a line of sight. In some aspects previously described Multi directional Still Picture Angles etc may be utilized to identify Multi directional Still Pictures on a straight walkway in a park. For example Multi directional Still Pictures with a same Forward Multi directional Still Picture Angle starting from a specific Multi directional Still Picture may be on a straight walkway in a park.

All described features and embodiments of multi user MDP Unit may similarly be utilized with Multi directional Motion Pictures later described where Avatar may be inserted into streams of still pictures. In some embodiments insertion of Avatar may be performed as previously described into each still picture in a stream of still pictures i.e. motion picture etc. . Also finding Motion Pictures etc. that may be within a line of sight from an Avatar s location may be performed as previously described where processing or comparisons may be performed for each still picture in a stream of still pictures i.e. motion picture etc. to find a match. Therefore additional cycles of processing or comparisons may be performed. In some embodiments still pictures from different streams having same time stamps may be processed or compared. In other embodiments still pictures from different streams having similar time stamps may be processed or compared in which case a threshold may be defined by user or automatically to control how far before or after a specific still picture i.e. frame etc. a search may go to find a matching still picture or a portion thereof.

Referring to the illustration shows an embodiment of a method for finding Still Pictures etc. that may be within a line of sight from an Avatar s location and inserting Avatar s picture in the found Still Pictures etc. The steps of this exemplary method may therefore be used to show a user s Avatar in still pictures of any multi directional still pictures from various locations and or distances within a line of sight. One of ordinary skill in art will understand that some or all steps of this method may be reordered and that other additional steps may be included as needed or some of the disclosed ones may be excluded or a combination thereof may be utilized in alternate embodiments. Some or all steps of this method may similarly be utilized for finding Motion Pictures etc. later described that may be within a line of sight from an Avatar s location and inserting Avatar s picture in the found Motion Pictures etc.

At step a collection of multi directional still pictures each associated with a location of a represented object and each including one or more differently directed still pictures and one or more links to other one or more multi directional still pictures is maintained in memory of a computing device. At step a user s avatar is associated with a first multi directional still picture and the avatar s picture is inserted into a first still picture of the first multi directional still picture. At step a region of the first still picture of the first multi directional still picture is identified around a position where the avatar s picture is inserted. At step the identified region is incrementally resized. At step subsets of a first still picture of a second multi directional still picture are compared with the incrementally resized identified region. At step steps and are repeated to compare subsets of the first still picture of the second multi directional still picture with each incrementally resized identified region. At step a determination is made that a subset of the first still picture of the second multi directional still picture is sufficiently similar to an incrementally resized identified region to indicate a line of sight. At step the avatar s picture is resized proportional to the incrementally resized identified region to portray the avatar in perspective. At step the resized avatar s picture is inserted into the first still picture of the second multi directional still picture in a position where the subset sufficiently similar to the incrementally resized identified region is found. At step steps are repeated to compare subsets of additional still pictures of the second and any other multi directional still pictures with each incrementally resized identified region and to insert resized avatar s pictures.

Multi directional Pictures Repository may later be accessed and read by Core Program to implement the functionalities described herein.

Other additional steps may be included as needed or some of the disclosed ones may be excluded reordered or modified or a combination thereof may be utilized in alternate embodiments.

In some embodiments any method system or apparatus for creating a collection of Multi directional Still Pictures representing an object may include searching digital pictures in any Multi directional Pictures Repository any picture database any picture repository or any collection of pictures to find same or similar picture that a user may need or want to capture. Such picture may have been captured previously by the same or another user. If found such picture may eliminate the need to capture the same or similar picture again saving the user time. For example public places such as Arlington National Cemetery Library of Congress public streets public parks and or other public places may have pictures captured from their various locations and stored in a picture repository that may be accessed by Maker . As such Maker may include functions and or algorithms for detecting pictures needed for creating collections of Multi directional Still Pictures representing an object. Such functions and or algorithms may include any of the previously or later described techniques or steps thereof such as finding Still Pictures etc that may be within a line of sight from a specific location automatically detecting Still Pictures etc. from a collection of digital pictures later described automatically detecting Multi directional Still Picture Links etc. later described and or any other techniques or algorithms known in art for detecting digital pictures having specific patterns. As digital pictures may be captured by various users at various times of day or night Maker may include functions or algorithms for lighting and or color adjustment or correction in digital pictures. Any techniques or algorithms known in art may be used for lighting and or color adjustment or correction. Lighting and or color adjustment or correction also referred to as gray balance neutral balance white balance etc. may generally represent rebalancing of the intensities of the colors typically red green and blue primary colors if RGB color model is used with a goal to render specific colors correctly or differently for reproduction comparison processing or any other purpose. Color rebalancing techniques or algorithms known in art usually directly manipulate red green and blue pixel values of a digital picture Maker may therefore utilize these techniques or algorithms to adjust or correct lighting and or colors of a digital picture captured at a different time of day or night before comparing it with a reference picture before detecting any needed patterns or before conducting any other picture processing. In some embodiments Maker may incrementally adjust i.e. increase or decrease by one the red green and blue pixel values in each cycle of comparisons etc. or correct lighting and or colors of a digital picture before comparing the incrementally adjusted or corrected picture with a reference picture before detecting any needed patterns or before conducting any other picture processing. The threshold for similarity in each of the pixels required for a match may be adjustable by a user or automatically adjustable as needed. Such threshold may include exact match such as 100 match nearly exact match such as 90 or 80 match mostly match such as 70 or 60 half match such as 50 low match such as 40 or 30 match or any other match. The threshold for the number of pixels required for a match may similarly be adjustable.

Referring to the illustration shows an embodiment of Maker including automatic detection of Still Pictures etc. from a collection of digital pictures. Maker may include picture processing implemented on a Computing Device to automatically detect Still Pictures etc. to aid a user in creating a collection of Multi directional Still Pictures representing an object. In some embodiments creating a collection of Multi directional Still Pictures representing an object may include automatic detection of Still Pictures etc. and generation of Multi directional Still Pictures including the detected Still Pictures etc. In other embodiments creating a collection of Multi directional Still Pictures representing an object may include automatic detection of Still Pictures etc. of an initial Multi directional Still Picture generation of the initial Multi directional Still Picture including the detected Still Pictures . . etc. automatic detection of links later described with and generation of adjacent Multi directional Still Pictures including their automatically detected Still Pictures etc. and so on. In some embodiments automatic detection of Still Pictures etc. of a Multi directional Still Picture may include comparing pictures in a collection of digital pictures to determine if one picture may include an overlapping field of view of another picture Finding a picture that may include an overlapping field of view of another picture may indicate that the two pictures may have been captured from the same location of a represented object in different directions and that the two pictures may belong to a same Multi directional Still Picture . In some aspects comparing digital pictures to determine if one may include an overlapping field of view of another picture may be performed by determining if a subset of pixels of one picture i.e. comparative picture may match a subset of pixels of another picture i.e. reference picture . In other aspects comparing digital pictures to determine if one may include an overlapping field of view of another picture may be performed by determining if a subset of pixels of one picture i.e. comparative picture may match a subset of pixels of another picture i.e. reference picture near opposite edges of the compared pictures. The threshold for similarity in each of the pixels required for a match may be adjustable by a user or automatically adjustable as needed. Such threshold may include exact match such as 100 match nearly exact match such as 90 or 80 match mostly match such as 70 or 60 half match such as 50 low match such as 40 or 30 match or any other match. The threshold for the number of pixels required for a match may similarly be adjustable. Any of the publically available or other functions or algorithms for detecting overlapping fields of view such as an algorithm used in digital picture stitching may be used in such comparisons. Pictures found to include matching subsets of pixels i.e. overlapping fields of view from a same location of a represented object may be included as Still Pictures etc. of a same Multi directional Still Picture . If matching subsets of pixels i.e. overlapping fields of view are not found in a reference picture and a comparative picture the comparison may be performed between the reference picture and all other pictures i.e. comparative pictures in a collection of digital pictures. When the comparison is complete between one reference picture and all comparative pictures another picture in the collection of digital pictures may then be used as a new reference picture with which all other pictures i.e. comparative pictures may be compared until all pictures in the collection are compared. As such all pictures in the collection of digital pictures may be compared with all other pictures in the collection to find all pictures with overlapping fields of view.

In one example picture processing may be implemented on a Computing Device to find Still Pictures etc. of a Multi directional Still Picture in a collection of digital pictures. The collection of digital pictures may include Pictures and as shown in Picture may be a reference picture with which all other pictures i.e. comparative pictures in a collection of digital pictures may be compared in one cycle Of comparisons. Picture may be a comparative picture and it may be one of the pictures in the collection of digital pictures that may be compared with Picture . Picture and Picture may be compared to determine if a subset of pixels near one edge of Picture may match a subset of pixels near the opposite edge of Picture . If a subset of pixels of Picture is found to match a subset of pixels of Picture Pictures and may be Still Pictures i.e. Forward Still Picture and Right Still Picture for example etc. of a same Multi directional Still Picture . Any of the described steps for comparing Picture and Picture may be performed with all other pictures in the collection of digital pictures to find all pictures that may belong to same Multi directional Still Pictures . In some embodiments a user may utilize a wide lens camera to capture digital pictures with overlapping fields of view needed for automatic detection of Still Pictures etc. In other embodiments a user may utilize a standard lens camera to capture an increased number of digital pictures to ensure overlapping fields of view needed for automatic detection of Still Pictures etc. In some aspects Maker may include an editor graphical user interface or other means through which a user may access any Multi directional Still Picture and add to it a new Still Picture etc. i.e. still picture that the automatic detection may have missed etc. or modify its existing Still Picture etc. i.e. still picture that the automatic detection may have included erroneously etc. . In some embodiments Still Pictures etc. with overlapping fields of view from a same location of a represented object may be stitched into a Combined Picture through the previously described picture stitching process.

In some embodiments Maker may be implemented to include automatic detection of Still Pictures etc. from a collection of digital pictures stored in a picture database. A picture database may include one or more files one or more DBMSs one or more databases one or more data structures one or more systems one or more processes and or one or more any other data repositories. A picture database may include a local picture database stored on Computing Device . A picture database may also include a remote picture database stored on a Remote Computing Device i.e. application server cloud etc. accessible over a Network i.e. corporate enterprise network Internet etc. . A picture database may include pictures of a represented object captured by a number of users. In some aspects a remote picture database may be publically available such as for example Yahoo Images Google Images and or other publically available picture databases. In other aspects a remote picture database may be available to subscribers or members of an image sharing service such as for example flickr.com tinypic.com imgur.com postimage.org photobucket.com and or other image sharing services. In yet other aspects a remote picture database may be available to subscribers or members of social media that may include picture sharing functionality such as Facebook Twitter and or other social media. In one example a picture database may include digital pictures of an object such as Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia Library of Congress in Washington D.C. and or any other object of which a number of users may have captured digital pictures from various locations. In another example a picture database may include digital pictures of various objects i.e. Facebook picture database including pictures of all objects captured by all Facebook users etc. and a filter may be implemented to seek pictures of the object to be represented in a specific collection of Multi directional Still Pictures . The filter may seek pictures having Arlington National Cemetery included in the picture name for example. Once pictures of a desired object are found in a picture database creating a collection of Multi directional Still Pictures representing an object may include any of the previously described steps or techniques using Maker to manually or automatically generate Multi directional Still Pictures of the represented object i.e. Arlington National Cemetery Library of Congress etc. .

The described techniques for automatic detection of Still Pictures etc. of Multi directional Still Pictures may similarly be utilized with Multi directional Motion Pictures later described where automatic detection and or other operations as described may be performed in streams of still pictures. In some embodiments automatic detection of Motion Pictures etc. may be performed as previously described where processing or comparisons may be performed for each still picture in a stream of still pictures i.e. motion picture etc. to find a match Therefore additional cycles of processing or comparisons may be performed. In some embodiments still pictures from different streams having same time stamps may be processed or compared. In other embodiments still pictures from different streams having similar time stamps may be processed or compared in which case a threshold may be defined by user or automatically to control how far before or after a specific still picture i.e. frame etc. a search may go to find a matching still picture or a portion thereof.

Referring to the illustration shows an embodiment of Maker including automatic detection of links among Multi directional Still Pictures . Maker may include picture processing implemented on a Computing Device to automatically detect links among Multi directional Still Pictures to aid a user in creating a collection of Multi directional Still Pictures representing an object. In some embodiments creating a collection of Multi directional Still Pictures representing an object may include automatic detection of Multi directional Still Picture Links etc. among Multi directional Still Pictures . In other embodiments creating a collection of Multi directional Still Pictures representing an object may include automatic detection of Multi directional Still Picture Links etc of an initial Multi directional Still Picture automatic detection of Multi directional Still Picture Links etc. of Multi directional Still Pictures adjacent to the initial Multi directional Still Pictures and so on. In some embodiments automatic detection of links among Multi directional Still Pictures may include comparing a Still Picture etc of one Multi directional Still Picture with a Still Picture etc. of another Multi directional Still Picture to determine if a subset of one Still Picture etc. may include all or a portion of another Still Picture etc. Finding a Still Picture etc. of one Multi directional Still Picture whose subset may include all or a portion of a Still Picture etc. of another Multi directional Still Picture may indicate a link between the two Multi directional Still Pictures . This indication may be derived from a premise that if a portion i.e. subset etc. of a field of view of one digital picture i.e. reference picture etc. may include all or a portion of a field of view of another digital picture i.e. comparative picture etc. the two digital pictures may be portraying the same line of view in perspective which may indicate views i.e. still pictures of adjacent Multi directional Still Pictures . In some aspects comparing digital pictures to determine if a subset of one may include all or a portion of another picture may be performed by determining if a subset of pixels of one picture i.e. reference picture etc. may match all or a portion of pixels of another picture i.e. comparative picture etc. . The threshold for similarity in each of the pixels required for a match may be adjustable by a user or automatically adjustable as needed. Such threshold may include exact match such as 100 match nearly exact match such as 90 or 80 match mostly match such as 70 or 60 half match such as 50 low match such as 40 or 30 match or any other match. The threshold for the number of pixels required for a match may similarly be adjustable. In other aspects comparing digital pictures to determine if a subset of one may include all or a portion of another picture may be performed by determining if a subset of pixels of one picture i.e. reference picture etc. may match all or a portion of pixels of a resized i.e. downsized upsized etc. another picture i.e. comparative picture etc. . Any of the publically available or other digital picture resizing algorithms or techniques may be used Resizing of a comparative picture may be performed incrementally i.e. resizing by one pixel at a time in length or width keeping aspect ratio constant etc. to reduce or increase the size i.e. number of pixels etc. of the comparative picture. Each incrementally resized comparative picture or a copy thereof may then be compared with all subsets of a reference picture. A comparative picture whose resized copy may be found to match a largest subset of a reference picture may be a Still Picture etc of an adjacent Multi directional Still Picture with which a link may be added. If a match is not found between any subsets of a reference picture and any of the incrementally resized comparative pictures or copies thereof the comparison may be performed between subsets of the reference picture and resized other Still Pictures etc. i.e. comparative pictures or copies thereof in a MDP application. When the comparison is complete between all subsets of one reference picture and all resized comparative pictures or copies thereof another Still Picture etc. of any Multi directional Still Picture may be used as a new reference picture whose subsets may be compared with resized other Still Pictures etc. i.e. comparative pictures or copies thereof in a MDP application until all Still Pictures etc. are compared. As such subsets of all Still Pictures etc. in a MDP application may be compared with all other Still Pictures etc. i.e. resized other Still Pictures etc. or copies thereof to find all Still Pictures etc whose subsets may include all or a portion of other Still Pictures etc.

In one example picture processing may be implemented on a Computing Device to find a link between two Multi directional Still Pictures one of which may include a Forward Still Picture and the other Multi directional Still Picture may include a Forward Still Picture . Forward Still Picture may be a reference picture with which all other Still Pictures etc i.e. comparative pictures in a MDP application may be compared in one cycle of comparisons. Forward Still Picture may be a comparative picture and it may be one of the Still Pictures etc. that may be compared with Forward Still Picture . Forward Still Picture and Forward Still Picture may be compared to determine if a subset of pixels of Forward Still Picture may match all or a portion of pixels of Forward Still Picture . Such comparison may include incrementally downsizing Forward Still Picture by one pixel at a time in length or width keeping aspect ratio constant i.e. reducing the size from 48 36 pixels to 47 35 pixels etc. to derive a Downsized Forward Still Picture as shown in Step 1 in . The Downsized Forward Still Picture may then be compared to all subsets of Forward Still Picture to find a subset of Forward Still Picture that may match all or a portion of pixels of the Downsized Forward Still Picture . The Downsized Forward Still Picture may first be compared with a same sized i.e. 47 35 pixels in this example etc. initial subset of Forward Still Picture starting at pixel 1 1 as shown in Step 2 in If a match is not found the Downsized Forward Still Picture may then be compared with a same sized i.e. 47 35 pixels in this example etc. subset of Forward Still Picture starting at pixel 2 1 if a match is still not found the Downsized Forward Still Picture may then be compared with same sized i.e. 47 35 pixels in this example etc. subsets of Forward Still Picture each starting at remaining pixels in y line 1 i.e. 3 1 4 1 5 1 . . . . 48 1 . If a match is still not found the Downsized Forward Still Picture may then be compared with same sized i.e. 47 35 pixels in this example etc. subsets of Forward Still Picture each starting at remaining pixels in y lines 2 i.e. 1 2 2 2 3 2 . . . 48 2 3 4 and so on until the last pixel of Forward Still Picture . The comparison may include any initial subset of Forward Still Picture such as for example a subset in the middle of Forward Still Picture subset at the end of Forward Still Picture subset at right of Forward Still Picture subset at left of Forward Still Picture and or any other initial subset. Also the comparison may include any search pattern for subsets of Forward Still Picture such as for example linear searching in any direction outward searching from a middle subset forward searching from a region in the beginning backward searching from a region at the end and or any other search pattern. If a match is not found between the Downsized Forward Still Picture and any subset of Forward Still Picture Forward Still Picture may be downsized to a next smaller size. The new Downsized Forward Still Picture may then be compared to all subsets of Forward Still Picture to find a subset of Forward Still Picture that may match all or a portion of the new Downsized Forward Still Picture . Incrementally downsizing Forward Still Picture and comparing the Downsized Forward Still Pictures with subsets of Forward Still Picture may be repeated until a match is found. If any subset of Forward Still Picture is found to match all or a portion of any Downsized Forward Still Picture Forward Still Picture may be a Still Picture of an adjacent Multi directional Still Picture with which a Forward Multi directional Still Picture Link may be added. Any of the described steps for comparing subsets of Forward Still Picture with Downsized Forward Still Pictures may be performed with all Still Pictures etc. in a MDP application to find links among all Multi directional Still Pictures . In some aspects Maker may include an editor graphical user interface or other means through which a user may access any Multi directional Still Picture and add to it a new Multi directional Still Picture Link etc. i.e. a link that the automatic detection may have missed etc. and or modify its existing Multi directional Still Picture Link etc. i.e. a link that the automatic detection may have included erroneously etc. . The described techniques for automatic detection of links among Multi directional Still Pictures may similarly be utilized with Multi directional Motion Pictures later described where automatic detection and or other operations as described may be performed in streams of still pictures. In some embodiments automatic detection of links among Motion Pictures etc. may be performed as previously described where processing or comparisons may be performed for each still picture in a stream of still pictures i.e. motion picture etc. to find a match. Therefore additional cycles of processing or comparisons may be performed. In some embodiments still pictures from different streams having same time stamps may be processed or compared. In other embodiments still pictures from different streams having similar time stamps may be processed or compared in which case a threshold may be defined by user or automatically to control how far before or after a specific still picture i.e. frame etc. a search may go to find a matching still picture or a portion thereof.

Referring to an embodiment is illustrated in which Multi directional Motion Pictures may include coordinates. In some embodiments a Multi directional Motion Picture may include coordinates of a location represented by the Multi directional Motion Picture . In other embodiments a Multi directional Motion Picture may include a data structure whose data field may include coordinates of a location represented by the Multi directional Motion Picture . Such coordinates may include x and y coordinates such as for example coordinates 5 5 of a Multi directional Motion Picture at Action Location . Other systems of coordinates may be used including x y and z coordinates of 3D objects or spaces system of coordinates using angle and distance from a reference point system of coordinates using intersecting angles from various reference points and or any other systems of coordinates.

Referring to an embodiment is illustrated where MDP Unit may include automatic patterns of movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures . In some embodiments a pattern of movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures may include a sequence of references to Multi directional Motion Pictures that Core Program may execute to simulate motion among Multi directional Motion Pictures as if a user were manually moving among the Multi directional Motion Pictures . In other embodiments a pattern of movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures may include a sequence of Multi directional Motion Picture coordinates that Core Program may execute to simulate motion among Multi directional Motion Pictures . Any pattern of movement may be utilized including up down diagonal angular approaching retreating zoom in zoom out straight curved oblique circular elliptical squared rectangular triangular random and others. A pattern of movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures may include absolute or relative pattern of movement. An absolute pattern of movement may move among Multi directional Motion Pictures based on a determined sequence of coordinates regardless of motion of any action scene or object. In one example an absolute pattern of movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures may include a sequence of coordinates located along the perimeter of a room regardless of where the action scene may be at any particular time. Such absolute pattern of movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures may include a sequence of coordinates such as for example 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 10 8 9 8 8 8 7 8 6 8 5 8 4 8 3 8 2 8 1 7 1 6 1 5 1 4 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 . A relative pattern of movement may enable movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures based on a sequence of coordinates relative to coordinates of a reference point such as an action scene. A relative pattern of movement may therefore change with movement of the reference point i.e. action scene . In one example a relative pattern of movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures may include a sequence of coordinates located on a conceptual Circle having a fixed distance i.e. two Multi directional Motion Pictures away 10 feet away etc. from the center of an action scene such as for example Action Location . Any distances used from the reference point i.e. action scene etc. may be fixed or variable i.e. changeable by user or automatically etc. and measured using absolute measurements such as length i.e. meters decimeters millimeters kilometers yards feet inches miles etc. or relative measurements such as a number of Multi directional Motion Picture distances. Any of the Multi directional Motion Pictures on or near Circle may be used in the relative pattern of movement and if near Circle a function to approximate the nearest Multi directional Motion Pictures may be utilized Such function to approximate the nearest Multi directional Motion Pictures may calculate differences between x and y coordinates of points on Circle and x and y coordinates of nearby Multi directional Motion Pictures . Multi directional Motion Pictures having coordinates with the smallest differences or the smallest absolute differences in x and y values from points on Circle may be included in the relative pattern of movement associated with or represented by Circle . In some embodiments a band around inside outside or both Circle may be defined and Multi directional Motion Pictures having coordinates with differences or absolute differences in x and y values from points on Circle that fall within the band may be included in the relative pattern of movement associated with or represented by Circle in some embodiments sequence of coordinates of a relative pattern of movement may be recalculated to correspond to movement of an action scene i.e. follow the movement of the action scene etc. . In one example an action scene may move from Action Location with coordinates 5 5 to Action Location with coordinates 5 6 Such movement of action scene may cause the center of Circle associated with the action scene to also move to the location with coordinates 5 6 . In some aspects coordinates of Multi directional Motion Pictures in the relative pattern of movement associated or represented by Circle may be recalculated to correspond to the movement of the center of Circle . Such recalculation in this example may include increasing by 1 the y value of coordinates of Multi directional Motion Pictures or references thereto of the relative pattern of movement. In other aspects coordinates of Circle may be recalculated to correspond to the movement of the center of Circle Such recalculation in this example may include increasing by 1 the y value of coordinates of points on Circle associated with or representing the relative pattern of movement. After Circle s recalculation a function to approximate new nearest Multi directional Motion Pictures may be utilized as previously described.

Patterns of movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures may include a designer s preferred patterns i.e. movie director s preferred camera patterns etc. user recorded or preferred patterns i.e. patterns that user may have used previously in subject or other MDP applications shaped patterns i.e. still linear curved oblique circular squared rectangular triangular approaching retreating etc. commonly used patterns i.e. patterns used or preferred by other users etc. any patterns of movement toward away and or around an action scene and or any other conceivable patterns in the case of user preferred patterns MDP Unit may include a process of recording and or storing a sequence of coordinates of user s movements among Multi directional Motion Pictures . In some aspects patterns of movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures and or their coordinates may be stored in Multi directional Pictures Repository or in any external file i.e. object file etc. data structure. DBMS database system process and or any other storage or data repository. In one example coordinates of a Multi directional Motion Picture in a pattern may be stored in a data field of the Multi directional Motion Picture data structure. In another example coordinates of a Multi directional Motion Picture in a pattern may be stored in a data field of the pattern data structure and or associated with the Multi directional Motion Picture .

In some embodiments a pattern of movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures may include time periods i.e. delays etc. to measure the length of stay on a particular Multi directional Motion Picture before moving to a next Multi directional Motion Picture in the pattern. Any time periods measured in any time units may be used such as for example 21 milliseconds 5 seconds 113 seconds 17 minutes 49 hours 2 months 1 year etc. Time periods may be used to control and or adjust the speed of movement among Multi directional Motion Pictures in a pattern. As such user may manually or Core Program may automatically adjust time periods of any or all Multi directional Motion Pictures at any time before during and or after a pattern s execution. In some aspects time periods may be stored in Multi directional Pictures Repository or in any external file i.e. object file etc. data structure DBMS database system process and or any other storage or data repository. In one example a time period of a Multi directional Motion Picture in a pattern may be stored in a data field of the Multi directional Motion Picture data structure. In another example a time period of a Multi directional Motion Picture in a pattern may be stored in a data field of the pattern data structure and or associated with the Multi directional Motion Picture .

In some embodiments MDP Unit may include motion detection in streams of pictures i.e. motion pictures . Motion detection functions and algorithms may be implemented for detecting action scenes or moving objects in Motion Pictures etc. Any algorithms or techniques for motion detection in streams of digital pictures known in art may be used Motion detection in streams of digital pictures may generally compare a current picture with a reference picture i.e. previous picture following picture background picture etc. by counting the number of different pixels. The threshold for the number of different pixels may be adjustable by a user or automatically adjustable as needed. Also the threshold for a difference in each of the pixels may be adjustable as well. Motion detection algorithms may detect moving objects as well as their direction of movement through picture processing. Examples of motion detection algorithms and programs include AForge.NET Rise Sun Pryme Motion Hunter Motion Detector Pro and others.

In some embodiments Motion Picture Cameras etc. or other motion picture taking equipment may be installed above an action scene such as for example on a ceiling of a room. As such detection of an action scene or any moving objects may be achieved by detecting motion in Motion Pictures etc. of all Multi directional Motion Pictures . Coordinates of the action scene may be determined or estimated in a Multi directional Motion Picture where no motion is detected. In one example Multi directional Motion Picture with coordinates 5 5 where motion is not detected may be location of the action scene as the action scene may be in the blind spot of Motion Picture Cameras etc. or other motion picture taking equipment whose fields of view may be directed away from the action scene i.e. forward backward right left etc. .

Referring to an embodiment is illustrated where detection of an action scene may be achieved by detecting motion in lines of Multi directional Motion Pictures aligned with reference points i.e. corners of buildings points along walls representing x y or z axes center of a represented object etc. of a represented object. In one example an action scene may be located near the center of a rectangular room such as the Action Location with coordinates 5 5 . As such a Motion Picture etc. of a Multi directional Motion Picture located near one of the walls such as the Multi directional Motion Picture with coordinates 5 1 may be used to detect the action scene. Once action scene is detected in for example Forward Motion Picture of the Multi directional Motion Picture with coordinates 5 1 detection of the action scene may be performed in Forward Motion Pictures of Multi directional Motion Pictures with coordinates 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 9 and 5 10 located on Reference Line As such y coordinate of the action scene may be determined or estimated in y coordinate of the first Multi directional Motion Picture on Reference Line with Forward Motion Picture that did not detect the action scene such as in this example Multi directional Motion Picture with coordinates 5 5 . Similar steps may be used to determine or estimate x coordinate of the action scene by detecting action scene in for example all Right Motion Pictures of Multi directional Motion Pictures located on Reference Line starting with Multi directional Motion Picture with coordinates 1 5 . Any Multi directional Motion Picture may be used as a reference point and or starting point of a reference line. Also any Motion Picture etc. of any Multi directional Motion Picture may be used to detect the action scene or any moving objects.

In some embodiments Motion Picture Cameras etc. or other motion picture taking equipment used for capturing Motion Pictures etc. may include a means of detecting motion a means of aligning itself toward a detected moving object i.e. action scene etc. and or a means of focusing on the detected object i.e. action scene etc. . Detecting motion aligning and focusing may be performed automatically by the motion picture taking equipment. Detecting motion may be accomplished by utilizing any motion sensing technologies known in art such as infrared i.e. passive or active sensors etc. optics i.e. video or camera systems etc. radio frequency energy i.e. radar microwave or tomographic etc. sound i.e. microphones or acoustic sensors etc. vibration i.e. triboelectric seismic or inertia switch sensors etc. magnetism i.e. magnetic sensors or magnetometers etc. and others. Once motion is detected by a motion sensor electric motors may be used to align the field of view of the motion picture taking equipment or lens thereof toward the detected moving object i.e. action scene etc. . Focusing may be accomplished through adjusting the position of a lens of the motion picture taking equipment. Automatic motion detecting aligning and focusing on the detected action scene may enhance user experience of moving among Multi directional Motion Pictures as user would not need to perform these actions him herself. In some embodiments motion detecting aligning and or focusing functionalities that may be built into motion picture taking equipment may be used to determine or estimate coordinates of a moving object i.e. action scene etc. . In one example any triangulation techniques known in art may be used to determine or estimate coordinates of an action scene by utilizing known coordinates of any three locations i.e. Multi directional Motion Pictures etc. with the described motion picture taking equipment installed.
