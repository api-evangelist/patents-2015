This application is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 14 045 610 filed Oct. 3 2013 which claims the benefit of and priority to a Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 809 259 filed Apr. 5 2013 and titled Real time Dynamically Scalable Cloud Based Video Assembly which is hereby incorporated fully by reference into the present application.

The proliferation of distribution modes by which content such as television TV content can be delivered to consumers has given those consumers an unprecedented degree of control over when where and how to enjoy their entertainment of choice. For example the ever increasing selection of news sports and dramatic entertainment content available over the Internet has enabled consumers to view what had been traditional TV programming content using any of a variety of personal communication devices such as a Smartphone or tablet computer at a time and place of their own choosing.

The increased viewing options now available to consumers have created both challenges and opportunities for content providers. For example agreements determining compensation for advertising delivered using one distribution mode such as a linear TV broadcast may not apply when substantially the same advertising content is delivered using an alternative distribution mode such as streaming content delivered over the Internet. In addition there may be constraints placed on the delivery of some content based on the distribution mode used to deliver the content or the type of communication device utilized by the consumer to view the content. On the other hand Internet Protocol IP distribution of content offers the hitherto largely unrealized potential to provide customized entertainment content as well as customized advertising and or promotional content to consumers on a household by household or even viewer by viewer basis.

There are provided content orchestration systems and methods for assembly of customized content streams substantially as shown in and or described in connection with at least one of the figures and as set forth more completely in the claims.

The following description contains specific information pertaining to implementations in the present disclosure. One skilled in the art will recognize that the present disclosure may be implemented in a manner different from that specifically discussed herein. The drawings in the present application and their accompanying detailed description are directed to merely exemplary implementations. Unless noted otherwise like or corresponding elements among the figures may be indicated by like or corresponding reference numerals. Moreover the drawings and illustrations in the present application are generally not to scale and are not intended to correspond to actual relative dimensions.

As noted above the increased viewing options for consumers of television TV program content enabled by advances in technology have created significant challenges for content providers attempting to assure viewer loyalty as well as to generate revenue though advertising and promotions. For example and as also noted above contractual agreements covering compensation for advertising delivered as part of a linear TV broadcast may not apply when substantially the same advertising content is delivered using an alternative distribution mode such as over the Internet. In addition there may be other types of content included in a linear TV broadcast for which the TV broadcaster does not have Internet distribution rights. By way of example Internet distribution rights for many sporting events are typically controlled by the sports league or team rather than a TV broadcaster.

The present application is directed to a real time dynamically scalable cloud based solution configured to orchestrate numerous technical systems and to perform other functions to ensure that live content such as live programming as well as advertising and scheduled programming are properly displayed to viewers. The present application discloses a novel solution by which a multitude of customized content streams such as television or other video streams can be created in a virtual environment by aggregating multiple sources of data or metadata from a national and local program provider. The customized content streams may be derived from data contained within a parent content source from a national provider such as a television network or a cable provider and or data provided by a local affiliate provider. The present content orchestration solution enables assembly of a frame accurate customized video stream from multiple video stream sources for example through replacement of individual programs and or commercials and or interstitial content in an automated fashion in a virtual environment. As a result the present content orchestration solution enables delivery of a substantially unique personalized content stream to an individual user or viewer.

The present content orchestration solution may include two distinct but interrelated parts a complexity engine hereinafter content orchestration engine and a command interface. The content orchestration engine may be configured to manage the state of a content delivery process to ascertain what broadcast mode is operative for example live broadcast versus scheduled broadcast and to manage the operative mode according to the business rules of the broadcast. The content orchestration engine may also be configured to monitor the relationship amongst a group of content sources capable of providing content for use in assembling a customized content stream and to identify which entity is the primary content source authorized to control the customized content stream at any given time.

In addition shows communication network and streaming interface receiving content streams and as well as instructions from content orchestration engine . Streaming interface may be configured to adapt the content available from content streams and or for distribution over communication network . Also shown is network link enabling communication among content orchestration system and other features of content distribution environment over communication network . Content distribution environment may also include advertising content source providing advertising content and users or viewers and using respective client systems and to receive respective customized content streams and

It is noted that although client system is depicted as a Smart TV and client system is depicted as a laptop type personal computer PC in one or both of client systems and may be implemented as any Internet Protocol IP compatible device with display capabilities. For example in other implementations one or both of client systems and may take the form of a desktop computer a netbook a tablet computer a gaming console or a Smartphone for example. It is further noted that local content provider may be an affiliate of national content provider and in that role may be a local content provider for the destination of customized content streams and or . For example where client systems and used by respective viewers and are located in the greater Los Angeles area national content provider may correspond to a New York based parent station of the American Broadcasting Company ABC while local content provider may correspond to its Los Angeles affiliate KABC TV .

Referring to shows a more detailed representation of content orchestration engine suitable for use in content orchestration system in according to one implementation. As shown in content orchestration engine receives content source description data and is configured to accept inputs from command interface and determines content assembly instructions for use by streaming interface . Content orchestration engine receiving content source descriptive data and and determining instructions corresponds to content orchestration engine receiving content source descriptive data and and determining instructions in . In addition command interface and streaming interface in correspond respectively to command interface and streaming interface in . Also shown in are customization guidelines which may include business rules client system profile data and viewer profile data . Moreover in some implementations customization guidelines may include distribution mode constraints .

Referring to together content orchestration system may utilize processor to execute content orchestration engine to determine instructions enabling substantially real time assembly of customized content stream s and or . For example content orchestration engine under the control of processor may be configured to receive content source description data and describing the content sources capable of providing content for use in assembling customized content stream s and or e.g. content streams and

Content orchestration engine may also be configured to identify customization guidelines for assembly of customized content streams and . Customization guidelines may correspond to the destinations of customized content stream s and or . For example customization guidelines may include viewer profile data corresponding to user histories of viewer s and or or to their respective geographical locations. Moreover in some implementations customization guidelines may include client system profile data corresponding to content playback features or capabilities of client system s and or

Content orchestration engine is further configured to determine instructions for assembling customized content stream s and or based on customization guidelines and content source description data and . In one implementation instructions enable assembly of customized content stream s and or as one or more personalized content stream s for delivery to one or more individual user s such as respective viewer s and or . Moreover where content streams and include video streams instructions can enable assembly of frame accurate customized video streams from the video streams included in content streams and for inclusion in customized content stream s and or

Content orchestration engine may be configured to determine instructions in a substantially automated way. However in some implementations it may be advantageous or desirable to override or modify instructions through human intercession. In those instances command interface may be used to input one or more content assembly commands to content orchestration engine . Thus content orchestration engine may be configured to determine instructions based not only on content source description data content source description data and customization guidelines but also on content assembly commands received through command interface .

It is noted that command interface may be implemented using one or more virtual control centers for accepting content assembly commands from an authorized content programmer. As a result command interface may have multiple physical and or virtual instantiations and may enable one or more authorized content programmers remote from computing platform to influence determination of instructions by content orchestration engine .

In some implementations content orchestration engine may be configured to determine instructions directing assembly of customized content stream s and or using one or more of advertising content program content such as a TV program episode or a segment of an episode or promotional content drawn from content streams and . In some implementations instructions may include identifying one of content streams or as a primary content source for assembling one or more of customized content stream s and or and may instruct replacement of a portion of the primary content included in primary content stream or with content from the other content stream.

In some implementations instructions may authorize one or more third parties to provide content for use in assembling customized content stream s and or . For example data received by content orchestration engine over network link may be used to determine instructions authorizing insertion of advertising content provided by advertising content source into customized content stream s and or

In one exemplary implementation one or both of content streams and may be linear TV program streams for example each including a high definition HD or standard definition SD baseband video signal with embedded audio captions time code and other data or metadata such as ratings and or parental guidelines. In some implementations content streams and or may include multiple audio tracks and may utilize secondary audio programming SAP and or Descriptive Video Service DVS for example. As shown in content streams and may be broadcast to a traditional TV audience using respective broadcasting platforms and which may correspond to conventional cable and or satellite networks for example. In addition national content provider and or local content provider may find it advantageous or desirable to make content from respective content streams and available via an alternative distribution mode such as communication network which may comprise a packet network for example such as the Internet.

National content provider and or local content provider may also deem it advantageous or desirable to deliver content from respective content streams and or over communication network substantially concurrently with its provision using broadcasting platform s and or . In addition one or both of national content provider s and or local content provider may choose to selectively replace one or more attributes of content streams and such as program episodes national or local news sports coverage live content and advertisements or a block of advertising hereinafter ad pod based on viewer profile data and or client system profile data . Alternatively or in addition one or more content features in program stream s and or may be replaced due to business rules and or distribution mode constraints related to distribution rights for example. Those replacements may be performed based on instructions . In addition it is noted that when instructing assembly of customized content including live content instructions can enable assembly of customized content so as to include the live content substantially in real time.

Referring to in combination with flowchart begins with receiving data describing multiple content sources capable of providing content for use in assembling customized content stream s and or . The receiving may be performed by content orchestration engine under the control of processor and may correspond to receiving content source description data and describing respective content streams and . Content source description data and may include metadata identifying various aspects of respective content streams and . For example content source description data and may include information regarding a content stream event as metadata.

A content stream event may be any cognizable portion or segment of content streams and . For example a content stream event may be an episode of programming content a segment of such an episode an advertisement an ad pod or a unit of promotional content. Data or metadata regarding such a content stream event may include identification of an event boundary corresponding to initiation of the content stream event and or information describing the duration of the content stream event. Identification of the event boundary may include identification of a start time of the content stream event or a video frame number or time address corresponding to initiation of the program stream event. The duration of the content stream event may be described by content source description data and in terms of time lapse in hours and or minutes and or seconds or in terms of the number of video frames spanned by the content stream event for example. Thus content source description data and can be used to characterize discrete content stream events within respective content streams and

It is noted that although depicts two content streams i.e. content streams and that representation is merely exemplary. In other implementations content orchestration engine may be configured to receive content source description data for additional content streams. For example in an implementation corresponding in general to content distribution environment may include a content stream provided by a live feed and or a live or recorded sports content stream provided by a sports broadcaster in addition to content stream from national content provider and content stream from local content provider . In those implementations content orchestration engine may receive content source description data relevant to the live feed and or sports content in addition to content source description data and . In addition in some implementations content orchestration engine may receive content source description data describing advertising content available from advertising content source . That additional content source description data may be received by content orchestration engine over communication network such as over network link for example.

Flowchart continues with identifying customization guidelines corresponding to a destination of customized content stream s and or . Customization guidelines may be identified by content orchestration engine using data received from respective client systems or over communication network and or from data stored in memory of content orchestration system . As noted above customization guidelines corresponding to the destination of customized content stream s and or may include business rules distribution mode constraints client system profile data and or viewer profile data .

Flowchart continues with determining instructions for assembling customized content stream s and or based on content source description data content source description data and customization guidelines . Determination of instructions may be performed by content orchestration engine under the control of processor . Instructions may identify a primary content source for use as a template for assembly of customized content streams or for example.

As a specific example instructions may identify content stream as a primary content source for assembly of customized content stream . In addition instructions may include an instruction to replace a portion of content stream such as a content stream event within content stream with content from content stream or another available content source. In other words in some implementations content orchestration engine may determine instructions that not only direct replacement of a portion of content available from a primary content source but also identifies the replacement content. In implementations in which content stream is a linear TV program stream replacement content identified by instructions may include another TV program another episode of the same TV program a special event or live feed content for example.

Alternatively or in addition replacement content may be identified dynamically by a separate authorized entity such as advertising content source based on instructions . In one such implementation instructions may authorize replacement of an advertisement or an entire ad pod but not specify the replacement advertising content to take its place thereby enabling use of highly individualized IP based targeting tools to direct different advertisements to viewers and based on their respective viewer preferences. For instance advertising content source may collect or access information regarding the Internet browsing histories of client systems and and identify replacement advertising content that is presumptively appealing to respective viewers and

It is noted that in some implementations it may be desirable for instructions to be based at least in part on a manual input. In such implementations command interface may be used to input a content assembly command. For example a content programmer monitoring content stream and or may utilize command interface to force or prevent content replacement or to override automated preferences for identifying replacement content.

Flowchart concludes with sending instructions for assembling customized content stream s and or to streaming interface . In one implementation content orchestration engine may be configured to send instructions in the form of streaming application programming interface streaming API calls to streaming interface . As noted above instructions enable assembly of customized content stream s and or from content contained in content streams and or as well as other content sources which may include live content sources. Moreover instructions can enable assembly of a frame accurate customized video stream as well as a customized content stream including live content substantially in real time. As a result customized content stream s and or can include a variety of content including live content sports news and dramatic entertainment content and may be provided as personalized content stream s and or for delivery to respective individual viewer s and or
