The term based on is not exclusive and allows for being based on additional factors not described unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In addition throughout the specification the meaning of a an and the include plural references. The meaning of in includes in and on. 

It is understood that at least one aspect functionality of various embodiments described herein can be performed in real time and dynamically. As used herein the term real time means that an event action can occur instantaneously and or almost instantaneously in time when another event action has occurred.

As used herein the term dynamic ly means that an event action that can occur without any human intervention. In some embodiments the event action in accordance with the present invention can be in real time hourly daily weekly monthly etc.

In some embodiments the instant invention provides synchronized single action graphical user interfaces for assisting an individual to uniformly manage computer implemented activities utilizing distinct software e.g. apps and distinct types of electronic data and computer implemented methods and computer based systems utilizing such synchronized graphical user interfaces.

In some embodiments as shown in a synchronized single action graphical user interface which is a cross application data workspace can be in a form of a single programmed user interface also referenced herein as the plate or Plate which can be configured to at least 

2 allow an individual utilizing the single action to perform activities through distinct different applications e.g. mobile apps and or with distinct different types of data.

For example as detailed herein any digital object and or data e.g. from inside and or outside of a particular application can be added to the plate such as a file a contact a task an email a tweet a map an entire application e.g. a calculator etc. Further in accordance with the inventive principles detailed herein on the inventive plate of the instant invention can be implemented across different platforms such as but not limited to 

In addition the different software platforms can have different distinct graphical user interface implementations e.g. a desktop a web app. etc. .

In some embodiments as detailed herein the inventive computer based systems utilizing the inventive synchronized graphical user interfaces e.g. the Plate are configured to allow to drag and drop objects on top of each other for a particular instant action a particular future action and or a particular organization action. For example as detailed herein the inventive computer based systems utilizing the inventive synchronized graphical user interfaces e.g. the Plate are configured to function so that each object becomes like a folder for other object s . When it is time to take action all relevant objects are on hand in the folder. For example the instant actions can be saved when a particular object is dragged on top of another and run like a program at a future date. In some embodiments as shown in the plate can be considered an app by itself.

In some embodiments any electronic mails documents contacts etc. can be put on the plate by a single action of a user e.g. swiping right left selection hovering a cursor and or a finger etc. . In some embodiments the plate functions like a to do list and work management area and the data objects presented on the plate act as the to do item rather than a text description. In some embodiments for example instead of an item being a text label saying call John Smith an inventive to do list in accordance with the instant invention allows the user to actually put John Smith s contact object on the plate which allows to perform a call by simply clicking selecting the call John Smith item on the inventive plate of the instant invention. Consequently the call John Smith item in accordance with the instant invention is actionable since when the user desires call John Smith the user saves a step of having to find John Smith s contact details.

In some embodiments on the inventive plate of the instant invention the user can take actions by dragging and or dropping data objects onto each other. In some embodiments for example the user can drag an email on a person object representing a particular person and or a group of people e.g. John Smith contact object John Smith profile object etc to forward the email instantly to a person and or a group of people and or the user can drag a document on the person object to share such document instantly with the particular person and or the group of people and or drag the document on a task and then drag the task on the person object to share the task with the document attached to it with the particular person and or the group of people etc.

In some embodiments the plate list of the inventive plate of the instant invention behaves like an action list a work management area a to do list and or any combination thereof so that the user can have resources of data available to what s he are working on focusing on. In some embodiments all applications e.g. email documents contacts projects calendar tasks notes intranet links tweets etc. interfacing with the inventive plate of the instant invention are programmed to have a functionality of utilizing a single motion action to put a piece of data and or action s function s on the common plate area.

In some embodiments as shown in data and or action s function s from applications can be placed onto the inventive plate of the instant invention by having the user to perform a simple swipe to the right left from any application. In some embodiments the inventive plate of the instant invention can exhibit characteristics of a chronological list by displaying what the user most recently put on the plate appearing first so that such list is arranged in an order of the most recent list on the top and the plate can be broken down into but is not limited to three sections the past the present and the future.

In some embodiments As shown in while by for example swiping an item email document contact tweet app map etc. to the right with a single action results in such item being placed onto the plate if the user desires to act on such item quickly the user can also for example swipe the same item twice e.g. re add the same item which results in such item being placed to the top of the list. In some embodiments once the item is on the plate of the instant invention the item represents actionable data and or functionality allowing the user to for example but is not limited to drill down into the item e.g. view edit activate share etc. without starting opening particular application s which is are native to the item and thus to continue interact within only the single application utilizing the same synchronized single action graphical user interface of the instant invention without losing functionalities of the native application s for purposes of this disclosure the terms native application s and native apps are directed to software application s functionalities scripts routines which have been specifically designed to process particular type of data perform particular functions offer particular functionalities to users and or any combination thereof and have not been originally designed to interact with the inventive synchronized single action graphical user interfaces of the instant invention e.g. the inventive plate of the instant invention . In some embodiments the computer systems and computer implemented methods of the instant invention allow the user to be where the user wants to be with the shortest amounts of actions.

In some embodiments the computer systems and computer implemented methods of the instant invention allow the user to work on different data in the inventive plate area of the instant invention without exiting the inventive plate in order to reach out different distinct applications to access different distinct data. In some embodiments the computer systems and computer implemented methods of the instant invention allow many applications e.g. mobile apps to behave as one interconnected unit through synchronized single action graphical user interface s of the instant invention. Consequently in some embodiments when the data and or action item is placed on the inventive plate of the instant invention the user does not sacrifice his and or her ability to perform all various actions which s he can perform with such data and or action item in the native application s but instead the user gains visibility into the things that the user desires to focus on which can further be for example segregated into areas sets of things based on for example a time factor identifying when the user has been focusing and or will focus on items selected to the inventive plate e.g. past present and future .

In some embodiments items placed on the synchronized single action graphical user interface s of the instant invention can have uniform size and viewing structure in a list view and a detail view e.g. header action bar body when the user drills into an item in the list view.

In some embodiments the synchronized single action graphical user interface s of the instant invention can be divided in to to do sections lists which can be arranged on time basis relevant focus basis and or any combination thereof e.g. Past Present and Future . In some embodiments each to do section which is arranged on the relevant focus basis can be configured to present maintain things e.g. documents messages data actions etc. based on what the user desires to focus on irrespective of the particular time period. For example with respect to an example having areas of Past Present and Future as shown in the Present area can display things that the user desires to focus on presently irrespective of particular time then the Past area will list items that are associated with things tasks that the user is no longer focusing on and the Future area will list items that are associated with things tasks that the user desires to focus on next after the user is done focusing on things that are residing in the Present to do list tab.

In some embodiments each to do section can have a time basis component and be configured to present maintain things e.g. documents messages data actions etc. within a predetermined time period which can be a default timeframe and or be customizable by the user. For example with respect to an example having areas of Past Present and Future as shown in the Present area can have a timeframe of a single day and or just an hour then the Past area will list items that are associated with things tasks that were focused on by the user during the previous day and the Future area will list items that are associated with things tasks that the user will focus on e.g. things due tasks to be done etc. during the next day. In some embodiments the Past area will list a number of items that are associated with things tasks that user focused on last during the previous day. In some embodiments the Future area will list items that are associated with things tasks that the user will focus first during the next day.

In some embodiments items from the Future area automatically transferred added by the systems and the synchronized single action graphical user interface s of the instant invention to the Present area on a predetermined date and or time specified by the user when the user put the item into the Future area e.g. in one example when the user selects designates the item for the Future area the user is prompted to identify when to move the item to the Present area . In some embodiments all items objects in all views areas of the synchronized single action graphical user interface s of the instant invention are automatically transferred among all views areas based on predetermined instructions associated with the items objects. In some embodiments the systems and the synchronized single action graphical user interface s of the instant invention allow the user to move the item ad hoc to the Present area at any time by for example going into the Future area and swiping the object into the Present area.

In some embodiments as shown in the Present view area of a synchronized single action graphical user interface of the instant invention is an orderable list. In some embodiments the user can arrange the order of distinct data items by dragging these distinct data items to a specific position of the Present view within the container of the same list.

In some embodiments the to do lists can be just a text list of things to do. In some embodiments the Past Present and Future lists announce when things were are and or will be due allowing the user to focus on things beyond what is on the user s immediate schedule. In some embodiments based on a predetermined condition instruction an item can be automatically removed by the systems and the synchronized single action graphical user interface s of the instant invention from its original list e.g. the Present view area and be moved to another list e.g. the Past view area .

In some embodiments as shown in the user can toggle through the Past Present and Future areas lists by for example but not limiting to swiping an item from the Past into the Present from the Present into the Future and or from the Future into the Present .

In some embodiments as shown in when for example the user swipes an item from the Present list view area into the Future list view area the user can be prompted to identify where when the user wants such item to reappear on the synchronized single action graphical user interface s of the instant invention e.g. the plate . In some embodiments there can be a snooze button for data objects of different distinct types.

In some embodiments for example things in the Present area list tab can be swiped to the left bringing them to the Past area list tab as well things being brought to the Future area list tab through a swipe to the right. In some embodiments for example things brought into the future are brought there with the instruction of when the user will carry them out e.g. in a few hours tomorrow in two weeks month etc. . In some embodiments the computer systems and computer implemented methods of the instant invention allow the user utilizing programmed memory containers such as the Past Future areas lists tabs to take different data objects functionalities e.g. email documents contacts tasks calendared items etc. and snooze it e.g. place different data objects functionalities in the system memory e.g. DRAM flash memory remote servers etc. to be rapidly accessed by the computer device when it needed while still keeping the user s focus as to what is there. In some embodiments the computer systems and computer implemented methods of the instant invention can automatically put data on the plate intelligently e.g. for example the user s next scheduled appointment is automatically moved onto the plate since intuitively the user wants to know what is next on the user s schedule . Consequently having the user s next scheduled appointment show up on the plate saves the user additional time to find the same information on the calendar and minimizes the user s need to remember to look at his calendar.

In some embodiments the synchronized single action graphical user interface of the instant invention e.g. the plate of is an area where data from different applications can be added from a single action within that application. For example in some embodiments when the user is in the email application with a single action e.g. but not limited to swiping to the right the user can add an item to the plate which serves as a container of actionable data that the user can focus on.

In some embodiments the inventive systems and methods of the instant invention allow the plate to receive automatically and or though the user s interaction items from a list of things that the user could have been doing and identifying them as the things that the user is choosing to focus on in the present and the present is not defined as an exact time it s just relevant now.

In some embodiments the computer systems and computer implemented methods of the instant invention allow the data of the inventive to do list to be actionable resulting in the shortened number of steps to accomplish a particular task. For example the user can drag the contact John Smith onto the plate which is an obvious suggestion that the user needs to be interacting with that person that might be a reminder to yourself call this person today but this detail is not necessary as you merely have to drag the contact on the inventive plate which ensures the user will carry out the task that the user sets for herself and or himself. In another example similarly the same scenario applies for an email rather than taking a note I have to reply to this a certain email with a specific document after reviewing it the user can just drag the email and the document onto the plate for later review interaction and association via drag and drop e.g. dragging the document onto the email to initiate a reply to the mail with the reviewed document attached . In some embodiments the user can also add a description in order to not confuse herself and or himself on what task the user has to carry out e.g. with contact John Smith . In one example adding description can be accomplished by flipping over the data object and taking a note on what task the user needs to carry out e.g. call John Smith . The fact that the note exists on the back of the object is evident from a visual indicator on the front. In some embodiments for example since a synchronized single action graphical user interface of the instant invention e.g. the inventive plate can be directed to be the focus based when moving a calendar appointment for a particular task from a future date to the plate does not result in corresponding change in the date time of such calendar appointment to advance the date time of the task execution to the present but instead placing the calendar appointment of the particular task on the plate it serves just an indication that the user needs to focus on it now e.g. preparing for the meeting irrespective that the task is due sometime in the future. In some embodiments in the inventive plate the task s do does not necessarily have to be done the inventive plate can by pass time by for example but is not limited to tasks on the plate can slide from and into the Past and or Future. Areas tubs lists.

In some embodiments as shown in objects are required to be docked on the top of a screen. In some embodiments the top docked methodology allows the user to scroll up and down to find the other items that the user might want to drop on it which are already on the plate. In some embodiments to dock any item the user can for example but is not limited to simply hold down on the left side of the item and the item then is displayed in the dock by for example replacing what is already on the dock if anything was there previously.

In some embodiments the computer systems and computer implemented methods of the instant invention provide ability to drag any data object on any other data object to create an action. For example by dragging a document onto a person related item e.g. an icon representing person s contact entry can prompt the user to do what the user is supposed to do regarding such person and the document and or results in a synchronized single action graphical user interface of the instant invention causing a first available action such as electronically and automatically dynamically communicating e.g. transmitting emailing sharing without emailing sending a link SMS texting e.g. if there is a phone number available the program will text e.g. send a SMS message to the person with a link to the document .

In some embodiments the synchronized single action graphical user interface s of the instant invention allow s the user to select e.g. click press holding down etc. a single data object and that object rises to the top of the screen and docks itself which means the object stays at the top of the screen while the user scrolls other items up and down and or from one side to the other side of the screen for example the user wants to share information with John Smith so the user docks an icon representing John Smith by holding down on the left side of the plate . Thus for example a single action causes a data object to dock to the top of the screen and stay there in position so now the user can scroll down through the list and find another document that the user wants to put on the selected data object and the user drags and drops it for example by holding down on the left and dragging the item and dropping it on the docked item onto the specified data object . In some embodiments scrolling can be programmed to be done by touching the middle of the screen if the user scrolls up and down in the middle of the screen the list scrolls but if the user moves the motion to the left of the screen then such action results in drag and drop. In some embodiments the right side of a synchronized single action graphical user interface of the instant invention can be utilized for the user to order the list.

In some embodiments when the user for example but not limited to drag and drop a data item on the plate onto the docked item an action is instantly taken. For example dragging a document on a docked contact results in the document being shared with that contact via the best available method e.g. direct sharing to contact s Drive location email text with a link etc. . In another example if the user drags an email on a person the computer systems of the instant invention can forward that email instantly with no typing and or other action from the user.

In some embodiments the user can select a prompt mode . In some embodiments in the prompt mode as for example shown in the synchronized single action graphical user interfaces of the instant invention e.g. the plate is programmed to generate a prompt instead of performing the default action s automatically to the user asking to select particular action s from a list of possible actions. For example the list of possible actions can be 

1 pick a particular email address of a recipient from the list of email addresses recorded in contact entry for that recipient 

2 select whether the user is trying to associate the file with the person rather than share the file with the person and or

In some embodiments in the lightening default action mode the user can set a timer as to how long is passed before the default action is performed by the systems of the instant invention so that for example but not limited to the user can drop a document to John and the plate automatically sends the document to him her but if the user needs to carry out for example six more actions but the user has not carried out those actions the prior to expiration of the set time the synchronized single action graphical user interfaces of the instant invention system generate a list of those six actions so that the user can select particular action s from the list.

In some embodiments the systems and the graphical user interfaces of the instant invention of the instant invention are configured to obtain data from different applications display the data in a uniform manner on the plate and allow the user to drag and drop order this list for for example but not limited to priority and or move things into Past Present and or Future lists. In some embodiments to order the list the user for example simply drags the item from the right side and drop it where the user desires.

In some embodiments the systems and the graphical user interfaces of the instant invention are configured to allow the user to add a note to any data object on the plate e.g. by clicking on the left . In some embodiments an image of an object is shown to flip over so that the user is writing the note on the back of the object and the front of the object can show an indicator as to whether there is a note and or how many notes there are.

In some embodiments the systems and the graphical user interfaces of the instant invention are configured to allow the user to start a discussion about any data object on the plate.

In some embodiments the systems and the graphical user interfaces of the instant invention are configured to alert the user about communications that relate to any data object on the plate. For example in some embodiments the user can be alerted about communication s that relate to a data object on the plate by causing the plate icon to change its visual appearance e.g. pulsing change color change shape etc. and or produce a sound so that the user is being altered that there is some action relating to the plated item s e.g. new email from someone on the plate document transfer from someone on your plate email related to a document on the plate a new post in a collaborative discussion that is on the plate cancellation of a meeting that is on the plate because it is coming up imminently etc. .

In some embodiments the systems and the methods of the instant invention are directed to representing a suite of applications underlining applications which can be related and or unrelated among each other which are connected at the data level with a uniform interface the plate e.g. a mobile app having a unified navigational structure. In some embodiments the applications are email drive storage containers e.g. documents storage locations calendar tasks files projects contacts notes intranet e.g. business social network and the plate.

In some embodiments the systems and the methods of the instant invention allow to work with data across applications both on the interface level and on the data level. In some embodiments the uniform and unified interface of the instant invention is configured to allow the user with a single action e.g. one touch to discover relationships between data from applications e.g. applications which are not necessarily designed to intercommunicate with each other . In some embodiments on the plate the user can take actions by for example but not limiting to dragging and or dropping data objects e.g. drag an email on a person to forward drag a document on a person to share it drag a document on a task then drag the task on a person to share the task with the document attached to it etc. 

As detailed above in some embodiments the plate is a desktop area for data from different applications forming a do list and cutting down steps for getting things done. In some embodiments emails can be routed to any object on the plate so it acts as an inbox for related communications.

In some embodiments the systems and the methods of the instant invention utilize one and or more of the following functionalities and or abilities to interconnect functions across apps e.g. mobile apps desktop apps or both with a uniform interface and navigation and with contextual association of data 

1 selecting one and or more keyboard keys e.g. holding down the key to create a recording and automatically associate the recording with the object that the user is interacting with 

2 listening to an audio recording while browsing through different applications with ability to start and stop if from within each application 

3 a global notification of all messages within the system of the applications e.g. unified alert system for all messages related to applications running on for example a particular mobile device 

5 an ability to notify about important communications that are related to a data object while interacting e.g. viewing that data object
