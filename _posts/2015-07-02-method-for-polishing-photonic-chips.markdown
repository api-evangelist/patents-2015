title: Method for polishing photonic chips
abstract: A method for polishing photonic chips is described. A gauge is placed in a photonic chip adjacent to an edge to be polished. The gauge includes a set of bars of various lengths. The bar lengths can be progressively ordered from shortest to longest or vice versa. The photonic chip is then secured in a chip polishing jig to get ready for polishing. When the photonic chip is being polished, an operator can visually inspect the gauge by looking at the polishing edge to estimate a polishing depth in order to determine a stopping point for polishing. Once the stopping point has been reached, the polishing of the photonic chip can be stopped.

The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e 1 to provisional application No. 62 020 191 filed on Jul. 2 2014 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. HR0011 05 C 0027 awarded by the DARDAThe United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to photonic chips in general and in particular to a method for polishing photonic chips.

Conventional photonic chips are typically made from silicon wafers. Silicon wafers tend to be comparatively large but many photonic chips are required to be in relatively smaller sizes. In order to reach the desired size the edges of silicon wafers must be cut typically with a diamond tipped saw. However cutting with a diamond tipped saw will leave silicon wafers with rough or jagged edges and rough edges are not ideal for optical transmissions. Thus rough edges need to be polished in order to ensure low loss coupling to external optical fibers especially for photonic chips that utilize waveguides extending to the edge of the photonic chips.

Conventional polishing methods suffer in that the polishing of many photonic chips at the same time requires the use of a chip polishing jig that holds the photonic chips perpendicular to a polish platen and such arrangement does not permit the top edges of the photonic chips to be viewed by an operator. Since the operator cannot see the top of a photonic chip it is impossible for the operator to determine how deep into the photonic chip that the polish has removed without taking the photonic chip off from the chip polishing jig. Needless to say additional time is required for the operator to un mount and remount the photonic chip which leads to an increase in operational time and a decrease in operational efficiency.

In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention a gauge is placed in a photonic chip adjacent to an edge to be polished. The gauge includes a set of bars of various lengths. The bar lengths can be progressively ordered from shortest to longest or vice versa. The photonic chip is then secured in a chip polishing jig to get ready for polishing. When the photonic chip is being polished an operator can visually inspect a the gauge by looking at the polishing edge to estimate a polishing depth in order to determine a stopping point for polishing. Once the stopping point has been reached the polishing of the photonic chip can be stopped.

All features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.

During edge polishing of a photonic chip it is important not to polish too deeply into the photonic chip or the waveguides included within. Thus as a preferred embodiment of the present invention at least one gauge is placed within a photonic chip in order to assist an operator to determine the progress of an edge polishing process via visual inspection.

Referring now to the drawings and in particular to there is illustrated an isometric view of a photonic chip in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention can be incorporated. As shown a photonic chip includes a top surface and four edges side surfaces a d. Photonic chip can be of any size and the length and width of top surface preferably defines the size of photonic chip while the depths of edges a d are substantially smaller than the length or width of photonic chip . Multiple waveguides are located within photonic chip underneath top surface . Waveguides may be made of silicon optical fibers or any other light transmitting media. Waveguides may travel from one edge of photonic chip to another edge of photonic chip . For example in waveguides are shown to travel from edge a to edge c.

A set of gauges and is located within photonic chip underneath top surface preferably at the same level where waveguides are built. Gauges and are located adjacent to edges a and c respectively. Each of gauges and may include a series of bars of varying lengths. The bar lengths can be progressively ordered from shortest to longest or from longest to shortest. Preferably gauges are made of the same or similar materials as waveguide .

As shown in the longest bar of gauge is closer to edge a than the other bars of gauge For example the longest bar of gauge starts at 10 m away from edge a the second bar starts at 10 m farther away than that i.e. 20 m away from edge a the third bar starts at another 10 m farther i.e. 30 in away from edge a the fourth bar starts at another 10 m farther i.e. 40 m away from edge a and the fifth bar starts at another 10 m farther i.e. 50 m away from edge a .

Alternatively all the bars of gauge start at the same distance from edge c even though the lengths of the bars of gauge are different from each other. For example all the bars of gauge are located at 10 m from edge c.

Photonic chip may include additional gauges such as gauges and . Gauges and may have the same structure as gauges and respectively and are located near edges a and c of top surface similarly to gauges and respectively. Each of the bars of gauges is located at a different distance from edge a as each of the bars of gauge Similarly all the bars of gauges are located at the same distance from edge c like all the bars of gauge Gauges and also have similar alignments.

With reference now to there is depicted a method for polishing photonic chips in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Starting at block a photonic chip having multiple gauges such as photonic chip from is placed in a chip polishing jig as shown in block . After the photonic chip has been mounted on the chip polishing jig an operator can start polishing the photonic chip on one of the edges as depicted in block . The chip polishing jig will only allow an edge being polished to be visible to the operator.

Because of how each of the gauges is located near an edge of the photonic chip such as gauge near edge a the bars should become visible as the operator is viewing from a side surface while the corresponding edge is being polished. For example if edge a of photonic chip from is being polished after polishing 10 m into edge a the first bar of gauge will become visible from the polished edge a as shown in . After polishing 20 m into edge a the first and second bar will become visible from the polished edge a as depicted . After polishing 30 m into edge a the first second and third bar will become visible from the polished edge a as shown . The operator can use the number of bars to determine whether or not edge a has been polished down to the right amount as shown in block . As a result the operator can decide how deep into edge a should the photonic chip be polished simply by visually inspecting the bars of gauge without removing the photonic chip from the chip polishing jig.

Alternatively when edge c is being polished the shortest bar of gauge will disappear first after polishing 10 m into edge c. After polishing 20 m into edge c two of the five bars will disappear from the polished edge c. For edge c the operator can visually estimate the polish depth based on the number of bars remaining. In other words for edge c cutting past 10 m into edge c will erase the shortest bar of gauge and only 4 bars will remain to be visible from edge c as shown in . If the polishing on edge c continues for another 10 m then the next shortest bar of gauge would be erased and only 3 bars of gauge will remain to be visible from edge c as depicted in . If the polishing on edge c continues for another 10 m then only 2 bars of gauge will remain to be visible from edge c as shown in .

In addition with two gauges located adjacent near the same edge such as gauges and near edge a an operator may use the two gauges to ensure that an equal amount of the material has been polished across the same edge that needs to be polished. After the edge polishing has been completed the operator can check both gauges to ensure that the numbers bars match with each other. If there is an even level of polishing then an equal number of bars will be visible from each of the two gauges.

Due to the general size of photonic chip the chip polishing jig may include a magnifying element such as a magnifying lens to assist an operator to visual inspect the number of revealed bars on a gauge. In addition all five bars of gauges may be visible to an operator viewing from the side surface of edge a even before polishing but each of the five bars will have a different intensity based on their respective distance from edge a.

As has been described the present invention provides an improved method for polishing photonic chips.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
