Many physical activities require a participant in the activity to perform to the limit of their physical ability testing the participant s endurance strength coordination shock tolerance or other physical variables. Warfighters can be expected to carry heavy loads across long distances taxing their endurance and risking injury due to falls unstable terrain or other unanticipated physical shocks. The elderly or the physically disabled can experience difficulty in performing activities of daily living due to reduced endurance strength injury resistance balance or other issues. Movers or other persons engaged in physical labor can be at increased risk of injury due to repeatedly lifting heavy loads over long durations and difficulty coordinating physical efforts e.g. lifting a large object between multiple people. Athletes can be exposed to joint tendon or other forces sufficient to cause significant temporary or permanent injury. Individuals recovering from surgery or a disabling injury may be unable to perform the minimum tasks necessary to begin rehabilitation and thus may be barred from recovery. Other examples exist of populations and activities that respectively may require more physical ability than is available to members of the population or to participants in the activities.

Assistive devices may be able to alleviate some of these issues. A variety of assistive devices including various exoskeleton based devices have been developed to increase a user s strength fatigue resistance coordination or other factors. These exoskeletons or other devices can be powered or unpowered and may be controlled by feedback from the user s movements be operated in a feed forward manner or be completely passive e.g. hernia belts lifting harnesses . Assistive devices can include electrical or mechanical actuators sensors and controllers. Various assistive devices have been applied to some of the above populations and activities with varying degrees of success.

Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a flexible exosuit alternatively referred to as an exosuit a WarriorWeb a strength suit and or a programmable body augmentation system configured to be worn by a wearer and to apply forces to the wearer among other functions to enable various physical activities of the wearer. In some examples this could include providing forces between segments of the body of the wearer to augment forces applied by the musculature of the wearer s body. Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide various elements that could be incorporated into such an exosuit to enable functions of the exosuit. Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide applications and modes of operation of such an exosuit.

The flexible exosuit includes a multitude of elements to enable the functions described herein. The flexible exosuit includes flexible force transmitting elements FFTEs configured to transmit forces between elements of the flexible exosuit and between elements of the flexible exosuit and tissues of the wearer . The flexible exosuit additionally includes rigid force transmitting elements RFTEs configured to transmit forces between elements of the flexible exosuit and between elements of the flexible exosuit and tissues of the wearer . In some examples the RFTEs can be composed of flexible elements and can be configured to be functionally rigid when attached to other elements and or the body of a wearer. Such RFTEs could be considered conditionally rigid in that their rigid transmission of compressive or other forces is conditional upon their being attached to the other elements and or the body of a wearer. Conditionally rigid RFTEs could be configured to transmit forces given the constraints above similar to forces transmitted by a corresponding non conditionally rigid force transmitting elements while being lighter thinner or otherwise superior according to some application than the corresponding non conditionally rigid force transmitting elements. Mechanical forces are transduced by actuators of the flexible exosuit including twisted string actuators driven by electrical motors and exotendons . Actuators including can generate absorb store or otherwise modulate forces between force transmitting elements in order to generate store or otherwise modulate forces on or within the wearer e.g. joint torques about one or more joints of the wearer to facilitate or enable functions of the flexible exosuit as described herein. The flexible exosuit can include additional elements including batteries controllers sensors user interfaces communications devices or other components according to an application.

Twisted string actuators e.g. are flexible structures capable of generating forces along their length. A twisted string actuator includes at least two flexible strands e.g. wires cables ropes fibers twisted about each other in cases where there are two strings the two strings can be referred to as a twisted pair . In some examples a first end of a twisted string is attached to a first actuated element and a second end of the twisted string opposite the first end is attached to a second actuated element such that the location of the second end does not translate relative to the second actuated element and such that the second end can be rotated by a rotational actuator e.g. an electric motor . The twisted string actuator transduces a rotation or torque applied to the second end of the twisted string into a displacement or force respectively between the first and second actuated elements. Properties of a twisted string e.g. compliance twist pitch diameter length and the driving rotational actuator e.g. acceleration speed torque rotational inertia can be chosen to produce a twisted string actuator having one or more properties according to an application for example a high rate of change of displacement a high transmission ratio between the rotational actuator and the forces applied between the first and second actuated elements a certain compliance or other properties. Further a twisted string can be flexible and can be implemented in a curved configuration. For example the twisted string could be housed in a stiff tube similar to a Bowden cable where the twisted string and the stiff tube are analogous to the inner cable and the outer housing respectively wrapped around a joint of the wearer with each end of the twisted string attached as described above to a respective actuated element on either side of the joint. Such a twisted string actuator could be operated to apply forces between the first and second actuated elements across the joint further the flexibility of the twisted string and the stiff tube can allow the twisted string actuator to remain proximate to a surface of the wearer as the joint moves or as other aspects of the flexible exosuit or wearer change configuration. Note that a twisted string actuator can have more than two flexible strings be connected to actuated elements in different ways be driven by other or multiple rotational actuators or be configured differently to these examples in other ways.

Exotendons e.g. are structures capable of transmitting forces along their length and capable of having one or more mechanical properties e.g. a compliance controlled by an electrical or other signal. Exotendons can be flexible or rigid. Exotendons can be thin flexible and conformal to a curved or flat surface. For example an exotendon could include an electrostatic clutch or some other type of mechanical clutch connected in series with a component having a specified compliance e.g. a spring . The clutch itself could have a first compliance when inactive possibly a very high compliance corresponding to an effectively nearly complete mechanical decoupling between the ends of the clutch and a second compliance when active possibly a very low compliance corresponding to the compliance of individual components of the clutch due to an effectively non compliant mechanical coupling between the ends of the clutch . Thus exotendons could be considered a type of clutched compliance element. The clutch and specified compliance component could be discrete or could be interdigitated intercalated or otherwise assembled proximately to form an exotendon. Further an exotendon could contain multiple specified compliance elements independently or commonly controlled clutches or other elements. In some examples the overall compliance of an exotendon could be controlled to a variety of discrete or continuous levels by controlling multiple clutches. In some examples an exotendon could be operated to store a mechanical energy e.g. by engaging a clutch to prevent relaxation of a stretched specified compliance element and to later release the stored mechanical energy. Other configurations and methods of operating an exotendon are described herein.

The flexible exosuit could include additional wholly or partially flexible linear actuators i.e. actuators capable of being operated to produce a linear force and or displacement and that are wholly or partially flexible and or other varieties of wholly or partially flexible actuators. In some examples the flexible exosuit could include actuators that include electroactive polymer artificial muscle EPAM . EPAM actuators change size or shape in response to an applied electrical field. Conversely a size or shape change in an EPAM actuator caused by an external force can cause an electric field to develop in or on the EPAM actuator. An EPAM actuator can include two or more electrodes configured to interact by way of an electric field with an electroactive polymer material. The electroactive polymer material could include dielectric ferroelectric electrostrictive or other electrically active molecules crystals or materials embedded in a polymer such that application of an electric field causes the electrically active materials to orient expand contract or otherwise respond to the electric field to cause the electroactive material to change a size or shape. For example the electroactive polymer material could be composed of an elastic dielectric configured to experience electrostatic compression. The electroactive material and electrodes can be configured in a variety of ways to enable a desired relationship between mechanical deformation of the EPAM and an electric field between the electrodes. In some examples the material and electrodes could be configured such that the EPAM actuator transduced an electric field into a size change in one direction such that the EPAM actuator could be operated as a flexible linear actuator. EPAM actuators could additionally or alternatively be used to generate electrical energy from mechanical energy. In some examples the flexible exosuit could include actuators that drive and or apply a tension to a cable or cables. For example the flexible exosuit could include a linear pull solenoid attached to a cable. The linear pull solenoid could be attached to a first actuated element and the end of the cable opposite the end of the cable attached to the solenoid could be attached to a second actuated element. Application of an electrical current to the solenoid could result in a force applied between and or a displacement of the first and second actuated elements. Other wholly or partially flexible actuators of the flexible exosuit are anticipated.

The flexible exosuit could include composite actuators that is wholly or partially flexible assemblies mechanically connected between a first actuated element and a second actuated element and including at least one actuator. For example the flexible exosuit could include a smart tendon exomuscle STEM actuator that includes a linear actuator and at least one clutched compliance element that is an element that includes a mechanical clutch mechanically coupled in series with a component having a specified compliance . The linear actuator could be a twisted string actuator. The clutched compliance element could be configured similarly to an exotendon as described herein. A STEM could include a single twisted string actuator connected to the first actuated element and mechanically coupled in series with an exotendon connected to the second actuated element. A STEM could include an exotendon connected between the first and second actuated elements and connected in parallel with a single twisted string actuator connected to the first actuated element and mechanically coupled in series with an exotendon connected to the second actuated element. A STEM could include a single twisted string actuator connected to the first actuated element and mechanically coupled in series with an exotendon also connected to the first actuated element. A STEM could be configured to have a topology and or properties inspired by biological actuators e.g. muscles and tendons and could further be operated to mimic the operation of biological actuators. Other configurations of a STEM are anticipated. A STEM could be operated to extract store inject or otherwise transduce mechanical forces and energies to and from a wearer of the flexible exosuit and or between elements of the flexible exosuit .

Forces could be transmitted between elements of the flexible exosuit and tissues of the wearer through flexible elements in contact with the skin of the wearer and or in contact with a form fitting fabric or garment that is contact with the skin of the wearer . For example actuators of the flexible exosuit could transmit forces into flexible force transmitting elements FFTEs that could in turn transmit forces into the skin of the wearer . The forces transmitted into the skin of the wearer may be compressive forces shear forces or other types and combinations of forces as described further below. Multiple FFTEs could be flexibly or rigidly connected to each other and to actuators to enable forces to be transferred to into the skin of the wearer according to a constraint or application. For example multiple FFTEs could be woven together and connected to an actuator in such a way that the transmission of shear force from the actuator and or normal force between the multiple FFTEs and the skin was evenly spread across an area the wearer s skin. This constraint could be used to specify the configuration of the multiple FFTEs according to a model of the anatomy of the wearer or of some stereotypical and or statistically derived wearer. Individual FFTEs of the multiple woven FFTEs could wind helically around part of the anatomy of the wearer e.g. a shank of a leg such that the pitch of the helix decreased with distance from the point of attachment to the actuator. Multiple FFTEs could additionally be configured to allow for attachment of multiple actuators and or to allow transmission of forces from multiple directions. More than one set of multiple FFTEs connected to respective more than one actuators could transmit forces into the same area of skin of the wearer for example by being configured to slide over each other otherwise not significantly transmit forces between each other while transmitted forces into the skin.

Forces could be transmitted between elements of the flexible exosuit and the wearer through additional methods. FFTEs and or rigid force transmitting elements RFTEs could be configured to transmit forces into and or adhere to skin in regions of minimal skin strain that is regions of skin that experience relatively little strain during specified activities of the wearer e.g. walking running jumping lifting . Additionally or alternatively FFTEs could be configured to transmit forces into and or adhere to skin along lines of non extension of the skin that is lines of the skin that experience strain perpendicular to the lines but substantially no strain parallel to the lines during specified activities of the wearer . FFTEs and or RFTEs could be configured to transmit substantially no shear forces into skin according to an application by having beads cylinders or other freely rotating elements coupled to the FFTEs and or RFTEs such that a normal force is transmitted through one or more beads cylinders or other freely rotating elements and a shear force result in rotation of the one or more beads cylinders or other freely rotating elements and displacement of the FFTE and or RFTE . Other methods of transmitting force between elements of the flexible exosuit and the wearer including straps boots armor segments and electroadhesive pads are anticipated.

The flexible exosuit could include rigid elements including RFTEs and . RFTE is a rigid element configured to couple forces to the foot of the wearer by operating as or in conjunction with a boot. Some or all of the forces generated and or transmitted by twisted string actuator and exotendon are transmitted into RTFE . RTFE could additionally include other element for example RTFE could include one or more EPAM actuators that could be operated to for example absorb and or transmit energy to the foot of the wearer to increase the efficiency or some other factor of an activity e.g. locomotion of the wearer. RFTE is a rigid element configured to couple some or all of the forces generated and or transmitted by twisted string actuator and exotendon to other elements e.g. FFTEs of the flexible exosuit and or skin of the wearer proximate to RFTE . RFTE is a rigid element configured to couple forces from other elements of the flexible exosuit to the torso of the wearer . Some or all of the forces generated and or transmitted by twisted string actuators and exotendons are transmitted into RTFE . RTFE can additionally transmit forces to from FFTEs . RTFE is additionally configured to mount the load to allow forces from the load e.g. force due to gravity to be transmitted directly into the flexible exosuit such that some or all of the forces necessary to transport the load are borne by the flexible exosuit instead of elements of the wearer s back. Other RTFEs than those illustrated in could be included in the flexible exosuit and could be configured to transfer forces to the wearer and or between other elements of the flexible exosuit according to an application.

The flexible exosuit could additionally include an undersuit configured to maintain the location of elements of the flexible exosuit relative to elements of the body of the wearer . The undersuit could be composed of a variety of flexible fabrics textiles or other materials and could enable a variety of functions of the flexible exosuit . For example the undersuit could include Kevlar to protect the wearer from projectiles Gore Tex to manage moisture emitted by the skin of the wearer or other materials. The undersuit RTFEs e.g. FFTEs e.g. and or other non electronically operable elements of the flexible exosuit could be referred to as a flexible suit. The coupling of electronically operable elements e.g. exotendons twisted string actuators or other actuators or other elements disposed on or within the flexible exosuit to the flexible suit could enable the operation of the electronically operable elements to apply forces torques and or compliances to the body of the wearer .

The flexible exosuit includes additional elements. The flexible exosuit includes one or more controllers configured to operate the flexible exosuit . The controller s could be configured to receive data from a plurality of sensors in the flexible exosuit generate commands to operate actuators e.g. of the flexible exosuit and to perform other functions. The controller s could be configured to operate communications elements in the flexible exosuit for example Bluetooth radios WiFi radios LTE or other cellular radios near field RF communications devices modems or other communications devices. The controller s could be configured to operate such communications devices to receive commands send telemetry enable communications between the wearer and some other person or system or enable some other function. The controller s could be configured to operate one or more user interfaces UIs in the flexible exosuit and or in systems in communication with the flexible exosuit . For example the controller s could operate a touch screen disposed on or in a sleeve worn by the wearer to present information about the operation of the flexible exosuit to the wearer and or to receive commands from the wearer e.g. commands to alter the functioning of the flexible exosuit . UIs in the flexible exosuit could include displays touchscreens touchpads buttons sliders knobs indicator lights speakers headphones microphone or other elements.

The controller s could additionally or alternatively be configured to send and or receive commands from the wearer using sensors and or actuators of the flexible exosuit . In some examples the controller s could be configured to use sensors disposed in the flexible exosuit to detect command gestures performed by the wearer and to alter the functioning of the flexible exosuit based on those command gestures. In some examples the controller s could use actuators or other elements of the flexible exosuit to provide feedback to the wearer to indicate a state of the flexible exosuit to the wearer and or to provide some other information to the wearer . For example the controller s could produce a pulse or sequence of pulses using twisted string actuator to indicate that the wearer should adopt a more crouched posture. In another example the flexible exosuit could include one or more vibrating heating or electrostimulating elements and the controller s could operate the vibrating heating or electrostimulating elements to indicate a state of the flexible exosuit to the wearer and or to provide some other information to the wearer . Other methods of using elements of the flexible exosuit to indicate information to the wearer are anticipated.

The flexible exosuit includes a plurality of sensors configured to detect information about the operation and status of the flexible exosuit the wearer and or an environment of the wearer. These sensors include but are not limited to force sensors e.g. load cells strain or displacement sensors e.g. capacitive sensors laser or ultrasonic rangefinders linear encoders rotary encoders on rotary elements of rotary to linear transducers or transmissions angle sensors e.g. magnets and magnetometers filtered accelerometers magnetometers and or gyroscopes location velocity and or acceleration sensors e.g. GPS receivers filtered or unfiltered accelerometers magnetometers and or gyroscopes temperature sensors EMG sensors ECG sensors pulse sensors blood pressure sensors galvanic skin response sensors humidity sensors chemical sensors e.g. CO CO Osensors ionizing radiation sensors cameras SONAR LIDAR proximity sensors or other sensors. The sensors can be discrete or the sensors can be part of an actuator or other element of the flexible exosuit . For example an exotendon could be configured to be used to detect one or more properties of the exotendon or the environment of the exotendon e.g. to detect a strain and or force experienced by the exotendon by measuring an impedance or voltage between and or current through a pair of electrodes of the exotendon .

The sensors can be operated to generate data that can be used to operate the flexible exosuit . Data generated by the sensors could be used by a controller included in the flexible exosuit to operate actuators e.g. e.g. to perform some function. For example the sensors could generate data indicating that the wearer was engaging in locomotion and that the wearer was at a first specified phase of a stereotypical locomotor cycle and the controller could use that data to operate the exotendons to extract negative work from the wearer . At a later point in time the sensors could generate data indicating that the wearer was engaging in locomotion and that the wearer was at a second specified phase of the stereotypical locomotor cycle and the controller could use that data to operate the exotendons to assist the locomotion of the wearer by transferring energy to the leg of the wearer and or to operate the twisted string actuators to transfer energy to the leg of the wearer .

Flexible exosuits could additionally include elements corresponding to an arm or other additional or alternate anatomy of a wearer other than the leg as illustrated by the flexible exosuit of . Such flexible exosuits could be configured to increase the upper body strength of a wearer and or to assist in the carrying of loads in the arms of a wearer. A flexible exosuit having elements corresponding to an arm of a wearer could be configured to transfer mechanical energy to from the arms of a wearer from to the legs of the wearer for example to enable locomotion across a farther distance than the user could achieve without the transfer of mechanical energy from the arms to the legs of the wearer. A flexible exosuit could be configured to be symmetric across the midline of wearer i.e. elements disposed relative to the left leg of a wearer are duplicated and mirrored and disposed relative to the right leg of the wearer or could be asymmetric according to an application. For example a flexible exosuit could be configured to apply forces to an injured leg of a wearer but not to the opposite leg of the wearer. Other configurations of a flexible exosuit are anticipated.

A flexible exosuit could be configured to apply forces and or torques at a single joint or right left pair of joints of a wearer. Such a flexible exosuit could include elements covering disposed proximate to parts of the wearer distant from the single joint or could only include elements covering disposed proximate to the single joint. Elements of the flexible exosuit configured to apply forces torques to the single joint could be disposed proximate to the single joint or could be disposed elsewhere and mechanically coupled to the single joint e.g. through a belt cable gears twisted string transmission and or some other method. In some examples a flexible exosuit could be configured to apply forces across the ankles of a wearer. For example the flexible exosuit could include a smart tendon exomuscle disposed on the back of the wearer s leg and configured to apply and or transmit forces between two actuated elements mechanically coupled to the wearer s calf and foot respectively. Elements of the STEM e.g. a motor configured to drive a twisted string transmission could be disposed near the ankle e.g. on the back of the calf or at other locations e.g. attached to a belt worn by the wearer and mechanically coupled to the ankle by a twisted string or cable transmission . Such a flexible exosuit could include additional elements e.g. batteries controllers sensors disposed according to an application. For example sensors of the flexible exosuit could be disposed across the leg and torso to enable gait detection a battery powering the flexible exosuit could be located on a belt worn by the wearer etc.

A flexible exosuit e.g. could be operated to enable a variety of functions or modes of operation according to a variety of applications. In some applications a flexible exosuit could have a mode of operation configured to reduce monitor and or dose fatigue during physical activity of a wearer. For example the flexible exosuit could be operated to detect and or prevent the development of fatigue during extended locomotion by the wearer. The flexible exosuit could act to extract store and or inject energy to from the legs of the wearer to reduce fatigue. Additionally or alternatively the flexible exosuit could act to extract energy from the wearer during a first period and to inject the stored energy back to the wearer during a second period to level the amount of exertion fatigue the wearer experiences between the first and second periods. Other configurations and modes of operations of a flexible exosuit to reduce monitor and or dose fatigue during locomotion climbing carrying or other extended physical activities of a wearer.

In some applications a flexible exosuit could have a mode of operation configured to increase the strength of the wearer. For example a flexible exosuit including elements to apply forces and or torques to the arms of the wearer and or between the arms of the wearer and the torso legs of the wearer the flexible exosuit could be operated to enable the wearer to lift objects heavier than and or to apply forces greater than the wearer would naturally be capable. The flexible exosuit could apply forces and or torques to the legs of the wearer to allow the wearer to jump higher than the wearer would naturally be capable. In some applications the flexible exosuit could have a mode of operation configured to prevent injury of the wearer by applying protective forces and or torques to joints of the wearer and or applying clutches to compliant elements crossing joints of the wearer to prevent excessive joint and or muscle motion or velocity. Operation of the flexible exosuit to prevent injury of the wearer could occur continuously and or could occur when sensors of the flexible exosuit detect a state of the wearer and or of the environment indicating an increased probability of the wearer being injured. In some applications a flexible exosuit could have a mode of operation configured to assist a wearer to coordinate his her actions with another wearer of a flexible exosuit or with some other information source. The flexible exosuit could coordinate the activity of the wearer by applying forces and or torques to joints of the wearer in time with the source of coordination information and or applying haptic information to the wearer e.g. vibrating elements of the exosuit .

A flexible exosuit could have a mode of operation configured to provide information to and or detect information from a wearer. For example actuators of the flexible exosuit e.g. twisted string actuators exotendons STEMs EPAM actuators vibration sources could be operated to indicate some information to the wearer. In one example a sequence of torque pulses could be applied to a joint of the wearer to indicate a battery status of the exosuit or to indicate that the wearer should check a communications device. In another example vibrating motors in the flexible exosuit could indicate that the wearer was straying from a commanded pose where the commanded pose is a pose the wearer could assume to satisfy some objective e.g. to minimize fatigue while crouching or standing. Motions forces or other mechanical outputs of the wearer could be detected by sensors and or actuators of the flexible exosuit. The detected motions could be used to control functions of the exosuit and or to control other systems in communication with the flexible exosuit. For example a certain gesture e.g. tapping the left foot against the ground twice could be detected by the flexible exosuit and used to as a command e.g. to prepare the exosuit to assist the wearer in climbing a wall or to send an all clear signal to a remote server. Additionally or alternatively the motions forces and other mechanical information about the wearer could be recorded for later use e.g. biomechanical research physical training motion capture for entertainment or some other application.

A flexible exosuit could have modes of operation configured to cause a movement of the wearer even in cases where the wearer is unable to move or where the wearer is attempting to move in a manner contrary to the movement executed by the flexible exosuit. In an example the wearer could be incapacitated and the flexible exosuit could operate to move the wearer to safety and or to a source of emergency assistance. In another example a limb or other portion of the wearer could be wholly or partially paralyzed and the flexible exosuit could operate to move the paralyzed portion of the wearer e.g. to allow the wearer to locomote. A flexible exosuit could be operated to enable rehabilitation of a wearer e.g. when the wearer has experienced a stroke spinal cord injury nerve damage or some other injury or disease process assisting weakened movements of the wearer and or counteracting disordered movements of the wearer.

A flexible exosuit could be operated in combination with some other prosthetic system. For example a wearer could be missing a limb and the flexible exosuit could operate in combination with a prosthetic worn by the wearer and configured to replace some of the function of the missing limb. The flexible exosuit could be integrated with the prosthetic and could be configured to mount the prosthetic to the wearer and or to transmit forces and or torques between the prosthetic and the wearer. In some example information detected using sensors and or actuators of the flexible exosuit e.g. information about the posture and movement of a leg of the wearer could be used to operate the prosthetic e.g. a detected locomotor gait type phase speed or other information from the leg of the wearer could be used to control a leg prosthetic to assume a configuration complementary to the configuration of the wearer s leg . Such a flexible exosuit could additionally be operated to optimize the movements of the wearer to complement the operation of the prosthetic during an activity e.g. altering a gait pattern of a wearer s leg to complement a pattern of operation of a leg prosthetic .

Flexible exosuits as described herein could act as standard multi purpose platforms to enable a variety of mechatronic biomedical human interface training rehabilitative communications and other applications. A flexible exosuit could make sensors electronically operated actuators or other elements or functions of the flexible exosuit available to remote systems in communication with the flexible exosuit and or a variety of applications daemons services or other computer readable programs being executed by processors of the flexible exosuit. The flexible exosuit could make the actuators sensors or other elements or functions available in a standard way e.g. through an API communications protocol or other programmatic interface such that applications daemons services or other computer readable programs could be created to be installed on executed by and operated to enable applications and or modes of operation of a variety of flexible exosuits having a variety of different configurations. The API communications protocol or other programmatic interface made available by the flexible exosuit could encapsulate translate or otherwise abstract the operation of the flexible exosuit to enable the creation of such computer readable programs that are able to operate to enable functions and or operational modes of a wide variety of differently configured flexible exosuits.

Additionally or alternatively the flexible exosuit could be modular in its hardware configuration i.e. actuators sensors or other elements could be added or subtracted from the flexible exosuit to enable applications functions and or operational modes of the flexible exosuit . This modularity could be reflected in the processors operating systems or other controllers configured to operate the elements of the flexible exosuit. That is the controllers of the flexible exosuit could determine the hardware configuration of the flexible exosuit dynamically akin to plug and play and could adjust the operation of the flexible exosuit relative to the determined current hardware configuration of the flexible exosuit. Additionally or alternatively the controllers of the flexible exosuit could be provided with information describing the hardware configuration of the flexible exosuit. This operation could be performed in a way that was invisible to computer readable programs e.g. computer readable programs describing methods to enable an operating mode of the flexible exosuit accessing the functionality of the flexible exosuit through a standardized programmatic interface. For example the computer readable program could indicate to a controller of the flexible exosuit through the standardized programmatic interface that a specified level of torque was to be applied to an ankle of a wearer of the flexible exosuit. The controller of the flexible exosuit could responsively determine a pattern of operation of actuators based on the determined and or provided hardware configuration of the flexible exosuit sufficient to apply the specified level of torque to the ankle of the wearer.

Further the use of electronically operable actuators e.g. twisted string actuators EPAM actuators and or haptic feedback elements exotendons electrostatic clutches electrolaminates etc. could enable the use of standard driving electronics and communications and or power busses and interconnects to enable function and operating modes of a flexible exosuit according to a variety of specialized applications and or configurations. For example individual configurations of flexible exosuits could be specified related to individual wearers environments sets of applications or other considerations. The cost time or other resources required to design and enable such an individual flexible exosuit could be reduced by using such standard driving electronics and communications and or power busses electrical and or mechanical interconnects controllers computer readable control programs or other standardized aspects enabling the fabrication programming and operation of a flexible exosuit. Further the use of such standard hardware and software could enable common applications services drivers daemons or other computer readable programs to be created to enable functions or operating modes of a variety of flexible exosuits having a variety of respective configurations. A flexible exosuit configured in this way i.e. to act as a standardized platform for a variety of applications could operate according to a variety of different operating modes to enable a respective variety of applications of a flexible exosuit. For example different modes of operation could correspond to the wearer walking running jumping lifting load carrying climbing cycling exercising training controlling a virtual avatar controlling a tele robotic system or some other application or activity of the wearer. In some examples an operating mode enabled e.g. by a computer readable program installed on the flexible exosuit could not be compatible with the hardware configuration of the flexible exosuit. For example the operating mode could require actuators to be coupled to the flexible exosuit and to be configured to apply a certain minimum amount of torque to the ankle of a wearer. If a control system of the flexible exosuit determines that the hardware configuration is insufficient to enable the operating mode the control system could disable the operating mode and or effect the operating mode at a reduced level. The control system could additionally or alternatively indicate that the hardware of the flexible exosuit was unable to fully enable the operating mode e.g. by operating haptic elements or other actuators of the flexible exosuit and or indicate specifications and configurations of actuators that the wearer could acquire and install on the flexible exosuit to enable the operating mode. Other modes of operation and configurations of a flexible exosuit and elements thereof are anticipated.

III. Exotendons Electrostatic Clutches Electrolaminates Controllable Compliance Elements Energy Storage and Recovery Elements and Other Configurations of Electrostatic Metamaterials

A flexible exosuit could include a plurality of flexible elements capable of being loaded under tension. In some applications it could be useful for a flexible exosuit to include such tensile flexible elements where the elements had a compliance that was able to be electronically modulated e.g. switched or clutched between two or more states . For example the compliance of the element could have two or more discrete values or a continuous range of values according to an electronic operation of the element. Additionally or alternatively the tensile flexible element could have a zero or low compliance state i.e. transmitting longitudinal tension while exhibiting substantially no longitudinal strain and an infinite or high compliance state i.e. substantially incapable of transmitting tension while exhibiting whatever effective strain is required for such and the tensile flexible element could change states according to electronic operation of the element. Such electronically controlled compliance tensile flexible elements could be implemented using electrostatic clutches i.e. clutches configured to use electrostatic attraction to generate controllable forces between clutching elements and are termed exotendons in this disclosure. Exotendons as described herein can be composed of flexible or rigid elements according to an application. Further exotendons can be thin and conformal to curved or flat surfaces.

When the electrodes are uncharged the exotendon will generally act as a compliant element with a compliance corresponding to the compliance of the first low compliance sheet in series with the first high compliance element in parallel with the second low compliance sheet in series with the second high compliance element

Application of a high voltage between the first and second conductive electrodes causes the development of an attractive force between the conductive electrodes and or other elements of the exotendon acting to clutch the first and second low compliance sheets together by applying a normal force between first and second low compliance sheets across the surface of overlap . The insulator layers have a specified resistivity allowing a specified low level of current to flow directly between the conductive electrodes . When operated with high voltage in this way the exotendon will generally act as a relatively non compliant element with a compliance corresponding to a first fraction of the compliance of the first low compliance sheet in series with a second fraction of the compliance of the second low compliance sheet where the first and second fractions are related to the degree of overlap of the first and second sheets 

Elements of the exotendon or other similar clutched compliance elements could be configured in a variety of ways and include a variety of materials. Further the ordering and presence of the layers of exotendon i.e. first low compliance sheet first conductive electrode first insulator layer second insulator layer second conductive electrode second low compliance sheet is meant as an illustrative example. Other orderings of conductive layers low compliance sheets and insulator layers are anticipated. In some examples only one insulator layer may be present. In some examples a conductive electrode and low compliance sheet may be incorporated as a single element i.e. a low compliance conductive material . The compositions dimensions and relative ordering of layers of an exotendon could be specified to achieve a desired level of clutching force e.g. due to Coulombic attraction Johnsen Rahbek effects or other physical principles overall compliance in clutched and or un clutched states or other considerations. An exotendon could additionally or alternatively be configured and operated to clutch and or control a torsional compliance a shear compliance mechanical impedance or some other mechanical property of the exotendon. In some examples the high compliance elements could be part of protective packaging of the exotendon or could be omitted altogether. In some examples additional layers materials or other elements could be included. For example the low compliance sheets could include and or be adhered to a fiber reinforced or other variety of adhesive tape. The conductive electrodes could include a variety of materials e.g. aluminum magnesium copper silver gold conductive carbon nanotubes disposed by a variety of methods e.g. chemical vapor deposition CVD physical vapor deposition PVD sputtering adhesive bonding lithography onto respective low compliance sheets the could include a variety of materials e.g. Mylar polyimide carbon fiber polymers crystals liquid crystals . For example the first conductive electrode and first low compliance sheet could together be a sheet of aluminized Mylar. Additionally or alternatively the conductive electrodes and respective low compliance sheets could be a single material. For example the second conductive electrode and second low compliance sheet could together be a sheet of conductive polyimide. In other examples the second conductive electrode and second low compliance sheet could together be a sheet of polymer or other material impregnated with a conductive substance e.g. conductive carbon nanotubes or other conductive particles.

The insulator layers could include a variety of materials according to an application. In some examples the insulator layers could be polyurethane or some other polymer material. A conductive material dipole or other electrically active element could be added to the polymer material to effect specified properties of the insulator layers e.g. resistivity breakdown voltage dielectric constant degree of charge migration at the surface of overlap high level of surface charge density at the surface of overlap when the conductive electrodes are charged to effect certain properties of the exotendon e.g. clutching force clutching pressure coefficient of friction or degree of stiction at the surface of overlap . For example the insulator layers could be layers of polyurethane containing metal oxide particles or salts e.g. tetrabutylammonium perchlorate .

The composition and operation of the exotendon could be determined by desired operational characteristics of elements of the exotendon and or the exotendon as a whole. Durability strength number of actuation cycles to failure operating voltage clutch and un clutched compliance levels clutching strength e.g. the pressure exerted between elements of the exotendon when the exotendon is operated to clutch insulator layer resistivity clutch switching time and other properties could be specified according to an application of the exotendon . For example when the insulator layer is composed of polyurethane impregnated with a metal oxide the exotendon could be clutched using a voltage of 400 volts and 5 microamps applied to the conductive electrodes and this applied voltage could result in a pressure of 7.5 pounds per square inch between the two sides of the clutch of the exotendon . Further the exotendon could switch between the clutched and un clutched state in less than 20 milliseconds and could be operated to clutch and to subsequently un clutch more than 1000000 times before failing.

The exotendon could be operated as a clutched compliance element switching between two or more states having two or more respective overall levels of compliance according to an application. In some examples the exotendon could be part of a flexible exosuit and could be operated thusly to increase the efficiency of locomotion of a wearer by providing an appropriate additional compliance across a joint of the wearer during specified phases of locomotion. Additionally or alternatively the exotendon could be operated to reduce the compliance of the exotendon to protect a joint of a wearer e.g. during a fall while being operated during other periods to have a higher compliance so as to interfere less with the movement of the joint. In some examples the high compliance elements could have a very high compliance or could be omitted thus having an effectively infinite compliance allowing the exotendon to be operated as a switchable tensile flexible element. For example such an exotendon included in an arm of a flexible exosuit could be operated to allow unrestricted arm movement i.e. to transmit substantially no tension during a first period of time. The exotendon could be operated during a second period of time to be substantially noncompliant i.e. acting as a rigid element capable of transmitting longitudinal forces during a second period to transmit some of a load carried by the arm such that the wearer could expend less energy to carry the load. The ratio between the compliance of the exotendon during the first period and the compliance of the exotendon during the second period could be greater than 100 1. Other applications configurations and operations of the exotendon are anticipated.

In some examples the exotendon could be connected in series with a spring to allow the spring to be clutched to transmit forces e.g. to from a body of a wearer during a first period of time and to transmit substantially no forces during a second period of time. For example the exotendon could be connected in series with a spring between the calf and the foot of a wearer such that the exotendon and spring could be operated to apply an extensor torque to the ankle of the wearer. The exotendon could be clutched following contact of the heel of the user with the ground during locomotion. The clutched spring could then be charged with elastic potential energy as the user flexes their ankle. The stored elastic potential energy could be released to the ankle of the wearer as the wearer extends their ankle before lifting their foot from the ground this storage and release of mechanical energy from to the ankle of the wearer could increase the efficiency of the locomotion of the wearer. The exotendon could be un clutched following the lifting of the wearer s foot from the ground such that the exotendon and spring did not substantially affect the rotation and or torque at the wearer s ankle while the wearer s foot was not in contact with the ground. Other configurations and patterns of use of a spring connected in series with an exotendon are anticipated according to an application. Further the spring connected in the series with the exotendons could be implemented as an element of the exotendon e.g. the high compliance elements of exotendon

The exotendon could additionally be operated to dissipate energy. A high voltage could be applied between the first and second conductive electrodes such that an attractive force develops between the conductive electrodes . The high voltage could be controlled such that the first and second low compliance sheets were only partially clutched that is an external force applied between the first and second endplates could be sufficient to cause the first and second low compliance sheets to slip allowing a displacement between the first and second endplates to increase. In the process some of the energy applied to the exotendon by the force between the first and second endplates could be dissipated by frictional heating of the surface of overlap as the first and second low compliance sheets slip against each other.

The exotendon illustrated in is intended as an example of a broader class of controlled compliance exotendons that could be included in a variety of applications and apparatus. Exotendons could include more than two low compliance sheets. Exotendons could include multiple exotendons configured in series and or parallel to enable certain applications. Exotendons could be flexible and or compliant in non longitudinal directions and could be configured to flexibly conform to a curved surface.

The exotendon could be operated as part of a flexible exosuit worn by a wearer to deliver haptic information to the wearer. The exotendon while under some nominal tension applied by segment of the body of the wearer and or by elements of the flexible exosuit could be operated to repeatedly clutch and un clutch and or repeatedly clutch and partially un clutch by changing a voltage applied to the conductive electrodes . A repeated change in compliance of and or force transmitted by the exotendon mechanically coupled into the skin and or body segments of the wearer by elements of the flexible exosuit could cause the wearer to experience a haptic sensation. In some examples the exotendon could be operated to indicate a physical action and or to indicate a change in a physical action to be performed by the wearer. In an example the exotendon could be activated across the knee of a wearer to indicate to the wearer that a step should be initiated using the leg of which the knee is a part. In another example a wearer could be locomoting using a gait that is likely to result in fatigue and or injury and exotendons of a flexible exosuit worn by the wearer could indicate ways the wearer could alter their gait e.g. by activating exotendons in directions of joint torque opposite good directions of motion to stimulate the wearer away from bad motions to reduce the rate of fatigue and or the probability of injury.

An exotendon could include two low compliance sheets as exotendon does or could include more low compliance sheets. Some of the more than two low compliance sheets could have conductive electrodes and or insulator layers on both sides. The more than two low compliance sheets could be operated similarly to exotendon . The additional low compliance sheets could enable higher overall strength higher strain to slip or other properties to such an exotendon. The low compliance sheets could have a specified compliance and the conductive electrodes on the more than two low compliance sheets could be operated to only clutch a subset of the more than two low compliance sheets together. In this way the overall compliance of the exotendon could be electronically actuated to have a number of values where the value of the overall compliance of the exotendon is related to which of the more than two low compliance elements are clutched together. Other configurations of an exotendon are anticipated.

An exotendon could be configured that included multiple independently actuated exotendons e.g. exotendon connected in series. is a cross sectional illustration of an example exotendon . The exotendon includes first and second endplates that are configured to be mechanically coupled to first and second elements of some other mechanism or apparatus e.g. flexible and or rigid force transmitting elements of a flexible exosuit according to an application. Exotendon includes three independently actuatable sub exotendons configured similarly to exotendon and connected by series endplates . That is each sub exotendon includes two low compliance sheets that are configured to be electrostatically clutched together. Further each low compliance sheet is connected directly to a first endplate and indirectly to a second opposite endplate through an element having a specified compliance. The first sub exotendon includes first specified compliance elements the second sub exotendon includes second specified compliance elements and the third sub exotendon includes third specified compliance elements . The overall compliance of the exotendon is related to the compliance of the three sub exotendons connected in series.

Each of the sub exotendons can be independently clutched. That is when clutched a sub exotendon has a first overall compliance substantially related to the compliance of the low compliance sheets of the clutched sub exotendon. Further when unclutched the sub exotendon has a second overall compliance substantially related to the compliance of the low compliance sheets of the sub exotendon in series with the compliance of the specified compliance elements of the sub exotendon. Thus depending on the actuation of the three sub exotendons the overall compliance of the exotendon could be controlled to have one of eight different values.

The exotendon could be operated i.e. the sub exotendons could be actuated to effect a specified compliance between first and second elements of some other mechanism or apparatus e.g. elements of a flexible exosuit . For example the compliance of the exotendon when configured to apply forces across a joint of a wearer of a flexible exosuit could be operated to increase the efficiency of locomotion by the wearer by optimizing the impedance of the joint or operated according to some other application. Note that the illustrated exotendon is only one example of an exotendon including independently actuated sub exotendons connected in series in general an exotendon could include more or fewer than three sub exotendons. Further the sub exotendons could be configured similarly to or differently from the sub exotendons according to an application. Note that where an exotendon includes N independently actuated sub exotendons the sub exotendons could be actuated such that the overall compliance of the exotendon could be controlled to have one of 2 N different levels depending on the respective compliances of the low compliance sheets and specified compliance elements of each of the sub exotendons.

Note that exotendons described herein are intended as non limiting examples of configurations and applications of exotendons. Two or more adjacent locally parallel electrostatic clutching elements of an exotendon could be rectangular sheets or could have some other shape and could be curved wrapped helical cylindrical or some other geometry according to an application. The distribution of conductive material on the locally parallel clutching elements could be uniform i.e. evenly distributed across the locally parallel clutching elements or could have some pattern e.g. parallel linear cross hatching fractals or some other pattern according to an application. The exotendons could further include clutching elements that are not locally parallel sheets that is the exotendons could include other electrostatic clutching materials and configurations of materials. For example the exotendons could include arrays of low compliance electrostatic latches disposed on a high compliance base material such that the exotendons had a first overall compliance related to the compliance of the base material when the latches are not latched and a second compliance related to the compliance of the latches when the latches are latched. For example exotendons or other electrostatically operated clutched compliance elements could be configured as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8 436 508.

An exotendon can be configured to have some specified clutching force that is forces applied to the exotendon when the exotendon is being operated to assume a clutched state e.g. a low compliance state will not cause the exotendon to increase in length or otherwise slip when the applied forces have a magnitude less than the clutching force. An exotendon could be operated in combination with other elements to increase the effective magnitude of the clutching force when the exotendon is operated in a clutched state. For example friction between the exotendon and or a cable or other element coupled to the exotendon could be used to increase the effective clutching force of the exotendon e.g. by employing the capstan effect.

The capstan hold force of the combination of the exotendon cable and capstan of could be specified by choosing the radius of the capstan the number of times the cable is wrapped around the capstan the coefficient of friction between the cable and the capstan or other features. For example more than one cable could be connected to the exotendon and wrapped around the capstan or around some other element rigidly or otherwise coupled to the first actuated element

The configurations illustrated in are intended as illustrative examples of configurations of exotendons and elements connected to the exotendons having frictive surfaces such that shear forces at the frictive surfaces effectively multiply the clutching force of the exotendons. Other configurations are anticipated. In some examples other rigid elements than cylindrical capstans could be in frictive contact with exotendons and or elements connected to exotendons. For example an exotendon could be in contact with a curved surface of a rigid force transmitting element RFTE of a flexible exosuit such that the exotendon in combination with the RFTE could be operated to resists greater forces than the exotendon could resist if not in contact with the RFTE. The shape of those other rigid elements could be specified to maximize the ratio of the capstan holding force to the clutching force of the exotendon or according to some other consideration.

Many applications require linear actuators configured to apply forces and or effect changes in displacement between two actuated elements. Twisted string actuators are a class of actuators that translate a torque and or rotation into a force and or displacement by twisting a string made of two or more flexible strands. Alternatively a single strand can be folded in half and twisted about itself resulting in a twisted string able to be incorporated into a twisted string actuator. Rotation of the string causes the two or more strands to twist shortening the string and or creating a force between the ends of the string. Such a string could have a first end connected to a first actuated element and a second end connected via e.g. a thrust bearing to a second actuated element to convert rotation e.g. by a motor coupled to a segment or end of the string of a segment or end of the string into displacement of and or force between the first and second actuated elements. Further because the twisted string can be flexible a twisted string actuator can allow for actuation around curved and or flexible elements. A twisted string actuator as described herein can be incorporated into a flexible exosuit to enable functions of the flexible exosuit or can be used in a variety of other applications.

Thus the TSA can be operated to produce a force and or induce a reduction of displacement between the flexible mesh grip and the rigid footplate by applying a torque and or rotation to the second end of the twisted string . This force and or displacement could cause the ankle of the wearer to extend and or to apply a force and or torque to the environment of the wearer e.g. to the ground beneath the wearer . Additionally or alternatively the TSA could be actuated to reduce a force between the flexible mesh grip and the rigid footplate by reducing removing or otherwise changing a torque applied to the second end of the twisted string .

The TSA could additionally or alternatively be operated to be driven by motions forces and or torques applied between the flexible mesh grip and the rigid footplate by the wearer . For example the rotary actuator in the actuator head could be operated to extract energy from rotation of the twisted string caused by the application of force between the flexible mesh grip and the rigid footplate . This energy could be stored by some other system connected to the rotary actuator. Additionally or alternatively the TSA could be operated to act as a brake on changes in displacement between the flexible mesh grip and the rigid footplate caused e.g. by movement of the ankle of the wearer .

TSA as illustrated in is attached to a first actuated element that is flexible i.e. flexible mesh grip and to a second actuated element that is rigid i.e. rigid footplate and configured to apply forces and or torques across the ankle of a wearer . However a general TSA could be configured to operate across different joints or to be operated in other applications requiring linear or other actuation. Further a general TSA could be mechanically coupled to other combinations of rigid flexible semi rigid or otherwise configured actuated elements than flexible and rigid first and second actuated elements respectively.

Transmission tube is a single straight rigid tube. However a general TSA could be differently configured as described in detail below. A transmission tube could be straight curved serpentine or have some other shape according to an application. Additionally or alternatively a transmission tube could be flexible in some way in some examples the transmission tube could withstand longitudinal forces while allowing the transmission tube to be bent for example around a joint that flexes during operation of the TSA. That is the transmission tube and twisted string partially contained therein could be configured analogously to the outer housing and inner cable respectively of a Bowden cable.

Further the transmission tube and or elements attached thereto e.g. flexible mesh grip could be configured to be adjustable such that properties of the TSA are adjustable. For example the transmission tube could include lockable and or actuated telescoping elements such that the overall length of the transmission tube i.e. the length between the actuator head and the end of the transmission tube from which the twisted string emerges could be changed and or controlled to control a range of motion a transmission ratio or some other property of the TSA . Additionally or alternatively the transmission tube and or the flexible mesh grip could be configured to allow the relationship between the transmission tube the flexible mesh grip and the rigid footplate to be changed i.e. to bring the end of the transmission tube proximate to the rigid footplate closer to the rigid footplate to control a range of motion a transmission ratio or some other property of the TSA . Other methods and types of reconfiguration and or actuation of the TSA are anticipated.

The housing transmission tube load cell and encoder stator elements of the thrust bearing and stator elements of the motor are rigidly mechanically coupled. The second end of the twisted string the transmission block and a first end of the slip clutch are rigidly mechanically connected. A second end of the slip clutch and rotor elements of the motor are rigidly connected.

The motor could be operated to generate a torque between the housing and the second end of the slip clutch . This torque could be transmitted through the slip clutch and the transmission block to the twisted string resulting in the TSA applying a torque and or force between the flexible mesh grip and the rigid footplate . Similarly the motor could be operated such that a rotation of the rotor of the motor resulted in a change in displacement between the flexible mesh grip and the rigid footplate .

The slip clutch could be configured such that the torque transferred between the motor and the transmission block does not exceed a specified torque level. The specified torque level could be chosen or set such that a force applied between the flexible mesh grip and the rigid footplate by TSA does not exceed a specified force level. The specified force level could be related to the specified torque level and a transmission ratio of the TSA related to the length of the twisted string and the pitch of the twist of the strands of the twisted string .

The load cell and encoder are configured to measure the force transmitted through and the rotation of the second end twisted string . The load cell could include piezoelectric elements strain gauges or other elements configured to transduce the force transmitted from the second end of the twisted string into the transmission tube and actuator head into a signal or value able to be used as an indicator of that transmitted force e.g. an electrical voltage . The encoder could include optical or other elements capable of measure the absolute and or relative rotation of the second end of the twisted string directly and or indirectly e.g. by detecting absolute or relative rotation of the transmission block twisted string and or a rotor of the thrust bearing .

For example the rotor of the thrust bearing could include a grating that is curved radially around the axis of the thrust bearing and that extends into the load cell and encoder . The encoder could include at least one light emitter and at least two light detectors arranged such that a beam of light from the at least one emitter could be detected by the at least two detectors unless a slat of the grating of the thrust bearing is interposed between one or more of the at least two detectors and the at least one emitter. A pattern of occlusion of the at least two detectors over time could be detected and used to determine an angle and direction of rotation of the thrust bearing rotor and by proxy the second end of the twisted string . Other types of sensors and sensed elements of rotating members are anticipated e.g. magnetic sensors optical sensors and electrical contacts in contact with corresponding conductive trace patterns. Additionally or alternatively the motor could be operated to detect rotation of the motor e.g. by detecting back EMF on coils of the motor and or counting a number and pattern of coil activations and from the detected rotation of the motor to infer rotation of the second end of the twisted string .

Information from the load cell and encoder could be used to operate TSA for example to operate the TSA using feedback. For example a controller could operate the motor based on forces and or rotations detected using the load cell and encoder to generate a constant force in the twisted string a constant rotation of the second end of the twisted string or some other specified pattern of actuation of the TSA . Additionally or alternatively a controller could be configured to derive other detectable parameters of the TSA flexible mesh grip and or rigid footplate . For example the controller could be configured to determine a rotation rate of the second end of the twisted string corresponding to a specified rate of change of linear displacement between the flexible mesh grip and the rigid footplate based on a stored known or otherwise determined current length and or level of twist of the twisted string . The controller could then operate the TSA to effect the specified rate of change of linear displacement by operating the motor to effect the rotation rate corresponding to the rate of change of linear displacement. Other methods of operation of the TSA are anticipated.

The TSA illustrated in includes elements configured such that the direction of a force transmitted by the twisted string is in the direction of and aligned with the axis of rotation of the motor the thrust bearing and the second end of the twisted string . This alignment could reduce wear and fatigue of the twisted string compared to other configurations. A TSA could additionally include a grommet or other element a specified distance along the axis of rotation and configured to ensure that the direction of a force transmitted by the second end of the twisted string is in the direction of and aligned with the axis of rotation. Note that the direction of a force transmitted by sections of the twisted string that are on the distal side of the grommet relative to the actuator head could be different than the direction of the axis of rotation. Additionally or alternatively a TSA could include a gimbal and a constant velocity or universal joint and could be configured such that a thrust bearing second end of a twisted string or other rotational elements of the TSA were coupled to the gimbal such that the axis of rotation of the rotational elements of the TSA are aligned with the direction of a force transmitted by the second end of the twisted string. This configuration could reduce wear and fatigue of the twisted string compared to other configurations.

The TSA could be configured to be partially disassembled. For example the motor and or elements of the slip clutch could be removed from the actuator head without removing other elements e.g. the twisted string and transmission block . In another example the transmission block elements of the slip clutch and thrust bearing and the twisted string could be removed without fully disassembling the TSA . This partial disassembly could allow for broken elements e.g. a twisted string that has been flexed stressed fatigued or otherwise utilized to failure to be replaced quickly and easily i.e. field stripped . Additionally or alternatively this partial disassembly could allow for components having different properties to be swapped out of the TSA according to changing conditions wearers and or applications. For example a set of twisted strings could be fabricated such that individual twisted strings of the set are configured for respective individual wearers e.g. wearers having respective different heights calf lengths foot lengths or other properties . A twisted string of the set corresponding to properties of the wearer could be quickly and easily installed in the TSA . Additionally or alternatively the TSA could be operated using a first twisted string having properties transmission ratio length stroke length specified to enable basic operation of the TSA for a broad population of wearers. The wearer could operate the TSA and sensors e.g. the load cell encoder or other sensors could be operated to determine an optimal transmission ratio length stroke length or other properties of the TSA . The second twisted string having properties corresponding to the determined optimal properties could be quickly and easily installed in the TSA . Motors slip clutches or other elements could be similarly matched to the wearer and quickly and easily installed in the TSA .

The transmission block connected the twisted string to other elements of the TSA within the actuator head and or transmission tube . The transmission block transmits linear forces from the twisted string through the thrust bearing and load cell and encoder to the transmission tube and or actuator head . The transmission block transmits torque from the motor via the slip clutch to the twisted string . Forces especially time varying cyclical forces applied between the transmission block and the strands of the twisted string can cause the strands to fail at the second end in or near the transmission block before the strands fail at other locations along the twisted string .

Individual strands A of the twisted string enter the transmission block and come into contact with the transmission block along a contact surface . The ends of the individual strands A rigidly attach to the structure of the transmission block by being tied welded clamped or by some other fixation method. The contact surface has an overall radius of curvature such that loads between the individual strands A and the transmission block are distributed substantially evenly across the contact surface . That is a surface on which an individual strand A contacts the transmission block can be approximated by an arc of a circle having a radius equal to the radius of curvature. Additionally or alternatively the contact surface could correspond to a compound curve in three dimensions. The shape of the contact surface could be specified to reduce the rate of fatigue and or the probability of failure of the strands of the twisted string compared to other configurations of the transmission block . Additionally or alternatively the strands A could be tied together using a knot e.g. a single or triple fisherman s knot and looped around a smooth rigid or semi rigid element e.g. a cylinder . The smooth element could be incorporated in the TSA in the place of the transmission block . Additionally or alternatively the smooth element could be incorporated into the transmission block .

In some examples the twisted string could be fabricated from a single strand folded in half and twisted about itself such that the strands correspond to respective halves of the single strand. In those examples the region of the folding of the single strand corresponds to the second end of the twisted string . The halves of the single strand could be folded around a securing element that is mechanically coupled to rigid footplate . The securing element could be a cylinder or some other smooth rigid or semi rigid element configured to minimize the concentration of stress in the strands of the twisted string. The radius of the cylinder or other smooth element could be a specified value large enough that when the TSA is operated to cause maximum twist of the twisted string the strands leaving the cylinder or other smooth element form an angle greater than 90 degrees.

Properties of the twisted string and of the individual strands of the twisted string could be specified to satisfy some constraint s and or to have some property s according to an application. For example a diameter and composition of the strands could be chosen such that the twisted string had a specified strength fatigue resistance transmission ratio compliance or some other property or properties. In some examples the strands of the twisted string could be wholly or partially composed of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene or some other high strength low bending radius low internal friction high stiffness material.

The twisted string could be configured and or include additional elements to reduce the rate of fatigue and or the probability of failure of the twisted string . For example the individual strands near the second end could have a coating or cladding to smooth the transition between contact and non contact with the transmission block . For example the ends of the individual strands could be wholly or partially encased in and or coated with PTFE another fluoro polymer and or some other low friction material. To reduce fatigue of and or reduce the chance of failure of the twisted string low friction or otherwise protective coatings and or claddings could be applied along part of or the entire length of the individual strands . Additionally or alternatively a lubricant could be applied to the twisted string e.g. a silicone lubricant. A low friction protective material could be interposed between the individual strands of the twisted string to reduce friction between the individual strands and to prevent surface roughness or other aspects of the individual strands from damaging the individual strands during use of the TSA . For example a long narrow strip of Teflon sheet or some other low friction material could be interposed between the individual strands 

The fabrication of the individual strands and or the twisted string could be executed in such a way as to reduce the rate of fatigue and or the probability of failure of the strands of the twisted string . In some examples the strands could individually be fabricated to have a helical geometry such that the individual strands experienced minimal internal strain when assembled into the twisted string and when the twisted string is actuated to mid stroke i.e. the twisted string is rotated such that the length of the twisted string was some length between the full length of the un twisted twisted string and a length corresponding to some maximal functional twist of the twisted string . This could be accomplished by assembling a bundle of fibers. A first twist could be applied to the bundle of fibers. The bundle of fibers could then be folded in half about an attachment point e.g. a smooth cylinder rigidly coupled to the rigid footplate such that the point of the folding becomes the second end of the twisted string . The two halves of the bundle identical with respective strands could then be twisted in about each other to form the twisted string . The ends of the bundle could be tied together and secured to the transmission block . The fibers of the twisted string can exhibit minimal strain at some level of twist and or length this level of twist and or length can be related to the magnitude of the first twist. Thus the magnitude of the first twist could be specified in order to fabricate a twisted string having a specific transmission ration length stroke length or combination of these properties related to the specified magnitude of the first twist. In some examples the strands could be assembled into the twisted string i.e. tied welded clamped or otherwise attached to string terminating elements e.g. the transmission block and the twisted string could be stretched and heated such that the lengths of the individual strands become more identical.

A twisted string actuator TSA could include a string having two strands like the strands of the twisted string of TSA or could include more than two strands. The arrangement of the two or more strands could be controlled and or specified. In some examples the arrangement of the two or more strands could be controlled by the configuration of a transmission block e.g. or by the way in which ends of the strands opposite the transmission block are attached to each other and or to an actuated element. For example a transmission block could be configured such that the transmission block causes four strands of a twisted string attached to the transmission block to assume a square configuration a diamond configuration a triangular configuration i.e. three of the four strands form a triangle and the fourth strand is maintained at the center of the triangle or some other configuration according to an application. Additionally or alternatively a twisted string could include one or more spaces along the length of the twisted string to control the arrangement of the two or more strands of the twisted string. A spacer could include strips of Teflon or other low friction substances to additionally reduce the friction between the individual strands of the twisted string as the twisted string is twisted.

TSA is one embodiments of a twisted string actuator TSA as described herein. Other configurations of TSAs including alternate additional fewer and or differently configured components are anticipated. A TSA could include multiple twisted strings different number s of strands multiple motors twisted strings actuated by two rotational actuators i.e. a rotational actuator coupled to each end of the twisted string more than one transmission tube differently configured transmission tubes different locations and or means of attachment to actuated elements or other configurations according to an application. For example illustrates alternate configurations of twisted string actuators TSAs 

A TSA can include more than one string. TSAs can include additional strings configured in a variety of ways to enable additional functionality and or improve or control one or more operating characteristics of the TSA. For example including additional strings in a TSA could increase the strength stroke length usable lifetime redundancy or other characteristics of the TSA. Further the TSA could be configured to enable differential operation of the strings of the TSA enabling higher transmission ratios between the motor of the TSA and the linear actuation of the TSA or other characteristics or operational modes. A variety of TSAs including multiple strings are illustrated in .

The TSA additionally includes first and second twisted strings that have respective first ends mechanically coupled to the third and fourth gears respectively. The first and second twisted strings additionally have respective second ends mechanically coupled to the first and second gears respectively. A rotor of the motor is coupled to the first gear such that the motor can be operated to apply opposite and substantially equal torque and or rotations to the second ends of the twisted strings . As a result of such rotations and or torques first ends of the twisted strings rotations opposite each other and having a ratio related to the ratio of the number of teeth on the third gear and the number of teeth on the fourth gear . Further these rotations can cause the TSA to apply a force and or change a displacement between the first and second actuated elements. A transmission ratio of the TSA could be defined as a ratio between a torque applied by the rotor and the forces applied between the first and second actuated elements as a result of the torque. The transmission ratio of the TSA could be related to the gear ratio of the second set of gears and the length degree of twist or other factors related to the twisted strings . This configuration could enable a higher transmission ratio between rotation torque of the motor and change of displacement force between the first and second actuated elements than could be achieved without the second set of gears by allowing the twisted strings to engage in a certain degree of rotation that is greater than the degree of twisting of the twisted strings 

In some examples the first set of gears could have a non unity gear ratio and the second set of gears could have a gear ratio of unity. In other examples the first and second set of gears could both have respective gear ratios that were not unity. The gear ratio of the first set of gears could be the reciprocal of the gear ratio of the second set of gears e.g. the first set of gears could have a gear ratio of 2 1 and the second set of gears could have a gear ratio of 1 2 . The choice of the gear ratios of the respective sets of gears could be specified as reciprocal to balance a load torque or other consideration between elements of the TSA e.g. to balance a strain experienced by thrust bearings that couple the gears with respected actuated elements . Other configurations of the TSA are anticipated.

A TSA configured similarly to one or more of the TSAs described herein e.g. TSAs could include additional twisted strings and respective gears configured such that a torque and or rotation could be applied in common to all of the twisted strings of the TSA. Additional twisted strings could be added to increase a strength fatigue resistance lifetime redundancy or some other property of the TSA. Gears of the TSA could have one or more gear ratios to effect a specified fixed or variable transmission ratio of the TSA. Additionally or alternatively the TSA could include additional gears or other elements such that the torques and or rotations were applied in common to the twisted strings but such that the gears coupled to the strings are not necessarily directly enmeshed with each other. For example a TSA could be configured similarly to the TSA but could include gears that are linked by a chain drive such that a rotation of one gear is accompanied by a substantially equal rotation of a second gear in the same direction as the rotation of the first gear. Other configurations and additional elements are anticipated.

The TSA can be operated to apply a force and or change a displacement between the first and second actuated elements by applying a torque to the first ends of the twisted strings using the rotor . A transmission ratio between rotation of the rotor and change in displacement between the first and second actuated elements can be related to the lengths degrees of twist or other factors related to the twisted strings . TSA including two twisted strings driven by the same rotor could be employed in an application to provide a transmission ratio stroke length or other property that could be difficult to achieve using similar materials or components configured as a TSA having a single twisted string e.g. TSA . The TSA could be configured such that at rest or at some other default state twisted strings have lengths degrees or twist or other features such that the transmission ratio of the TSA is a specified value and such that the transmission ratio of the TSA changes as the TSA is operated e.g. as the rotor is rotated to effect a change in displacement between the first and second actuated elements according to an application. For example the transmission ratio of the TSA could be a minimum value when the twisted strings are fully untwisted and the transmission ratio of the TSA could increase as the twisted strings are rotated by the rotor

Additionally or alternatively the first and second twisted strings could have opposite twist. The TSA configured in this way could be operated to apply a force and or change a displacement between the first and second actuated elements by applying a torque to the first ends of the twisted strings using the rotor . Further the TSA can be configured such that thrust or other bearings coupling the rotor to the stator of the motor transmit substantially no longitudinal forces i.e. in the direction of the axes of the twisted strings due to such forces being substantially transmitted by the twisted strings and or the rotor . This could enable the use of lower friction bearings and or higher efficiency operation of the TSA by reducing friction losses due to longitudinal forces on bearings included in the motor

The first and second motors could be operated to apply respective torques to respective second ends of respective twisted strings to effect a force and or change in displacement between the first and second actuated elements. In some examples the twisted strings could have respective different lengths degrees or twist or other features such that the respective transmission ratios of the twisted strings are different. The first and second could be configured and or operated advantageously relative to the different properties of the twisted strings . For example the first string could have a higher transmission ratio than the second string and the first motor could have a higher torque capacity and a lower positional bandwidth than the second motor . A TSA configured in this way could have better overall performance in terms of torque positional bandwidth or other operational properties than a TSA including only the first twisted string and motor alone or the second twisted string and motor alone. Other configurations and operations of TSA are anticipated.

Further the twisted string of a TSA can be configured in a variety of ways. The twisted string could include two strands as described elsewhere herein or could include more than two strands. A twisted string could be configured such that the two or more strands of the twisted string were located at the same distance from a rotational axis of the string where the rotational axis could be a local rotational axis for strings that are not straight e.g. strings that are contained within Bowden cable housings and that are deformed about another object or otherwise not straight . To ensure that the strands of a twisted string are located at the same distance from the rotational axis of the string and or for other purposes spacers could be incorporated into the string. In some examples the spacers could be toroidal disc shaped or otherwise configured rings or plates having holes through which the strands of the twisted string could pass the size shape and positioning of the holes could be such that the strands could change an angle of twist e.g. as the twisted string is rotated but such that the strands could not change their positioning relative to each other i.e. they would maintain a radial distance from a rotational axis of the string and they would maintain an angular relationship between each other . Additionally or alternatively the twisted string could include a central element that ensured that the strands of a twisted string are located at the same distance from the rotational axis of the string and or for other purposes. For example one or more spheres cylinders or other shaped objects could be localized in the center i.e. centered on a rotational axis of the twisted string. The location of the objects in the center of the twisted string could be maintained by having three or more strands in the twisted string and or by including grooves or rings in the objects to ensure a specified relationship between the strands and the objects. Additionally or alternatively the objects could be held in place by an additional center strand that did not substantially act to transmit longitudinal forces of the twisted string.

Alternatively the twisted string of a TSA could comprise a single strand that is folded in half about an attachment point. The two halves of the strand then twist around each other to form the twisted string.

The material composition of the strands of the twisted string and of possible lubricants spacers anti friction coatings or shims or other elements of or relating to the twisted string could be specified according to an application. Material compositions and configurations of twisted strings and elements thereof can be specified to enable a certain application and or to ensure that the twisted string has a specified value of a property e.g. compliance or fatigue resistance. Generally strands of a twisted string can be configured to have a low compliance i.e. the twisted string will deform minimally in response to longitudinal stress on the string a high strength i.e. the twisted string will only fail when exposed to very high longitudinal stresses and a small bending radius i.e. the strands of the twisted string are able to be coiled very tightly about a small radius without failure . Further strands of a twisted string can be configured by having a material composition and or being woven in a certain manner from fibers to have a low external friction i.e. the strand will move against an external object e.g. another strand with low friction and low internal friction i.e. sub strands fibers or other elements composing the strand will move against each other with low friction .

In some examples the strands could be composed of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene compositions of which are traded under the trade name Dyneema . In some examples individual strands of the twisted string could include a low friction coating surface treatment or cladding. For example an individual strand could be clad in polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE . Additionally or alternatively sheets of low friction material e.g. sheets of PTFE could be disposed between strands of a twisted string to reduce friction between the strands decreasing mechanical losses to heat and decreasing fatigue of the strands. In some examples strands or other elements of the twisted strings could be coated impregnated with or otherwise exposed to a lubricant. For example a twisted string could be coated in a silicone lubricant. Other compositions and configurations of twisted strings are anticipated according to applications of twisted strings in TSAs. In an example a twisted string could be composed of Dynex 70 or Dynex 75 and could be lubricated by silicone grease.

Individual twisted strings could be nested and connected together to form composite twisted strings. Such a composite twisted string incorporated into a TSA could enable an actuator having many of the benefits of a non nested twisted string while having a greater stroke length per unit string length. illustrate a nested twisted string NTS that includes an outer twisted string an inner twisted string and a cylinder . The cylinder is configured to transmit compression and torsion from one end of the cylinder to the other end while exhibiting substantially no deformation. The outer twisted string includes three strands each connected to four spacer rings . A first spacer ring is connected to a first end of the cylinder and a second spacer ring could be connected to a first termination block or other element configured to transmit forces and or torques into the twisted string . The inner twisted string includes three strands each connected to four spacer rings . A first spacer ring could be connected to a second termination block or other element configured to transmit forces and or torques into the twisted string and a second spacer ring is connected to a second end of the cylinder .

Example NTS includes inner and outer twisted strings that are substantially similarly configured that is their lengths and strand and spacer compositions and configurations are substantially identical and the radius of the spacers is identical except for a small difference to accommodate the cylinder and to accommodate the motion of the inner and outer twisted strings relative to each other when the NTS is twisted. As a result the behavior of the NTS in response to twisting i.e. the degree of shortening a transmission ratio is substantially identical to another twisted string configured similarly to either the outer or inner twisted strings that has a total length equal to the sum of the lengths of the inner and outer twisted strings. As a result the NTS can provide the functionality of a non nested twisted string while having a shorter overall length.

Note that NTS is intended only as an illustrative example of a nested twisted string that could be applied to a TSA or to other applications. The relative lengths relative radii number of spacers number of strands and other properties of the twisted strings could be different than those described herein. In some examples one or both of the twisted string could lack spacers. For example the inner twisted string and or the outer twisted string could be tightly wound i.e. could have no spacers. Further the inner diameter of the cylinder could be related to a maximum effective diameter of the inner twisted string when the inner twisted string is fully twisted. In some example an NTS could include more than two twisted strings. For example an NTS could include three twisted strings and two cylinders. The twisted cylinder could be a solid cylinder like the illustrated cylinder or could be a rigid or semi rigid mesh rings connected by bars or plates or some other structure capable of transmitting compressive forces and torques from one end of itself to another.

A TSA configured as described herein could enable a variety of applications by enabling high performance flexible linear actuation i.e. generation of tensile forces and changes in linear displacement between ends of a flexible or semi flexible element e.g. twisted string . Such a TSA can enable transduction of energy from a rotational actuator to a linear displacement at greater than 92 . Use of high speed electrical motors as the rotational actuator driving a twisted string of such a TSA can enable the actuation of the TSA to change length from a maximum length to a minimum length i.e. to change in length by the stroke length of the TSA in less than 200 milliseconds. Further the TSA could be operated to achieve a positional bandwidth greater than 5 hertz for displacements on the order of the stroke length. Such high performance capabilities enable novel applications for example the actuation of a flexible exosuit to augment or assist the activities of a wearer.

A flexible exosuit can include a variety of actuators sensors and other elements. The actuators could include the aforementioned exotendons and twisted string actuators or could include additional or alternate actuators. A flexible exosuit can additionally include feedback and control elements for detecting information about the wearer and or elements of the flexible exosuit and its environment and for indicating information to the wearer and or some other person or system mechanically or electronically coupled to the flexible exosuit.

A flexible exosuit could include hydraulic and or pneumatic actuators and other elements to enable to the use of those actuators e.g. fluid pumps reservoirs . Actuators of the flexible exosuit could be coupled to other elements of the flexible exosuit and or tissues of the wearer by a variety of transmission methods. For example a rotational actuator could create a rotational torque that is translated into a linear force by a drive screw a ball screw a cable wrapped around a driven drum or some other method. Further transmissions may be included in the flexible exosuit to transmit a force and or torque from one location in the flexible exosuit to another location e.g. a cable possibly disposed within a Bowden cable style sheath could be used to transmit a linear actuation from a location at one end of the cable to another location at the other end of the cable. For example an exotendon could be connected via one or more cables that may be disposed within one or more Bowden cable style sheaths to two or more elements of a flexible exosuit or other system to allow the exotendon to apply a controller compliance between store a mechanical energy from a change in displacement between or otherwise apply a force between the two or more elements of the flexible exosuit.

A class of actuators that could be included in a flexible exosuit includes electro active polymers EAPs configured to transduce electrical energy into mechanical energy. EAPs are polymer materials containing electro active molecules crystals or other materials that are orientable or otherwise capable of exhibiting a physical change when subjected to an electric field such that the EAP material deforms when exposed to an electrical field. Conversely the EAP material may produce an electrical field when deformed by an external force allowing for bidirectional transduction of mechanical and electrical energy.

EAPs can be included in electroactive polymer artificial muscles EPAMs . EPAMs are actuators that include an EAP material and two or more electrodes configured to transduce an electrical voltage and or current applied to the electrodes into a mechanical force displacement due to a deformation of the EAP caused by an electrical field around the electrodes that is caused by the applied voltage and or current. In an example configuration a thin sheet of EAP has an electrode disposed on either side i.e. the electrodes are opposite each other along the short axis of the EAP . Application of a high voltage between the two electrodes causes the EAP to deform becoming thinner and wider longer. The EAP can also become thicker due to the applied voltage. Conversely energy can be extracted from the EPAM from an externally applied mechanical force and deformation. Additionally or alternatively an EPAM and or other element including EAP material could be configured and operated as a mechanical sensor detecting strain force or some other mechanical variable by transducing the mechanical variable into a voltage and or current at electrodes of the EPAM or other element including EAP material.

EPAMs could be included in a flexible exosuit to inject and or sink mechanical energy to from elements of the flexible exosuit and or the wearer. An EPAM could be employed as an alternative to a twisted string actuator or could be employed in other applications. For example a chemical burning engine could include an EPAM and or EAP material to enable extraction of energy from combustion of a fuel by transducing a mechanical deformation of the EPAM or EAP due e.g. to an increased pressure in a volume due to combustion of the fuel into an electrical energy that could be used to power a flexible exosuit or to power some other electrical system. Additionally or alternatively other elastomeric polymers could be included in in such a chemical burning engine.

EPAMs could be employed in a flexible exosuit as haptic elements. That is an EPAM could be disposed in a flexible exosuit such that the EPAM was in direct or indirect mechanical contact with skin of the wearer. Application of patterns of electrical energy to the EPAM could cause deformation of the EPAM that could be mechanically coupled into the skin of the wearer causing the wearer to experience a haptic sensation. Such a haptic indication could be used to communicate a variety of information to the wearer. In some examples an alert could be communicated to the wearer using an EPAM haptic element. In some examples an EPAM haptic element could be operated to indicate a physical action and or to indicate a change in a physical action to be performed by the wearer. In an example an EPAM haptic element could be activated at the knee of a wearer to indicate to the wearer that a step should be initiated using the leg of which the knee is a part. In another example a wearer could be locomoting using a gait that is likely to result in fatigue and or injury and EPAM haptic elements of a flexible exosuit worn by the wearer could indicate ways the wearer could alter their gait e.g. by activating EPAM haptic elements in directions opposite good directions of motion to stimulate the wearer away from bad motions to reduce the rate of fatigue and or the probability of injury.

Other operations of EPAM or other haptic elements to indicate information to a wearer of a flexible exosuit are anticipated. Further EPAM haptic elements need not be limited to application in flexible exosuits and may be used to enable a variety of applications including indication using a variety of wearable devices e.g. watches headbands haptic feedback as part of a virtual reality device haptic feedback as part of a tele robotic system or other applications. Further other devices could be incorporated into a flexible exosuit or other system to enable to haptic indication or other functions described herein. For example piezoelectric elements vibrating elements e.g. motors driving off axis masses heating elements electrodes configured to inject safe and sense able electrical currents into human skin or other mechanical transducers or actuators. Additionally or alternatively other actuators e.g. exotendons TSAs of a flexible exosuit or other system could be operated to provide haptic feedback to a user. For example an exotendon could un clutch and then quickly re clutch several times in a row resulting in a series of momentary changes in the force transmitted by the exotendon that could be detected by a wearer of a flexible exosuit including the exotendon. Further EPAM could be used as an input device by transducing a force exerted by a user e.g. by a user pressing on an EPAM using a fingertip into an electrical signal that could be detected by a controller or other system of a flexible exosuit or other system.

A flexible exosuit could include a smart sole device. A smart sole device is mechanically coupled to the sole of the foot of the wearer and includes at least one mechanical transducer. The mechanical transducer could be operated to sense a force between the sole of the wearer and the ground to extract and or inject mechanical energy from into an interaction between the sole of the wearer and the ground to modulate a compliance of the smart sole or some other mechanical function. The mechanical transducer could include a variety of transducing elements including EPAM elements piezo elements hydraulic elements pneumatic elements or some other elements. The smart sole could include one or many mechanical transducers arranged in a variety of ways. For example the smart sole could include a hexagonal array of EPAM transducers across the sole of the foot of the wearer. Electrolaminates e.g. exotendons could also be included in a smart sole to enable functions of the smart sole e.g. to control the compliance of the smart sole. The smart sole could be operated in a variety of ways to enable a variety of applications.

In some examples the one or more mechanical transducers could be operated to generate a detected distribution of force between the sole and the ground during a step. This information could be used to diagnose a medical condition to indicate a way for the wearer to alter their gait according to some application e.g. to increase the efficiency of locomotion of the wearer to decrease a probability of injury or some other application. In some examples the one or more mechanical transducers could be operated to indicate a physical action and or to indicate a change in an a physical action to be performed by the wearer e.g. to reduce the amount of force the wearer applies to the heel during a step to reduce the degree of a heel strike to reduce the amount of force the wearer applies to the outer edge of the sole during a step . In some examples the one or more mechanical transducers could be operated to modulate a compliance of the one or more mechanical transducers to increase the efficiency with which the wearer locomotes e.g. by matching an impedance between the foot of the wearer and the ground that the wearer is locomoting on . Other operations and applications of a smart sole are anticipated.

A flexible exosuit could include a wide variety of sensors. The sensors could be configured to sense a wide variety of physical phenomena including electrical fields electrical current magnetic fields mechanical stress mechanical strain pressure humidity electromagnetic radiation high energy particles acceleration displacement rotational acceleration rotational velocity angular displacement or other phenomena. The detected physical phenomena could be related to one or more properties of the wearer of the flexible exosuit and or of the environment of the wearer and flexible exosuit. The sensors could be disposed at a variety of locations on the flexible exosuit. For example a set of accelerometers could be disposed in the flexible exosuit to enable detection of the acceleration and by proxy location and displacement of segments of the wearer s body. The sensors could be incorporated into other elements of the flexible exosuit. For example electrodes of an exotendon could be used to detect displacement and or force between actuated elements attached to either end of the exotendon by detected the capacitance between the two electrodes. The capacitance between the two electrodes could be related to the degree of overlap of the electrodes which could in turn be related to the length force strain or other properties of the exotendon. In another example an encoder could detect rotation of a motor of a TSA the rotation of the motor could be used to determine the length of the TSA based on information about the twisted string of the TSA.

The sensors could be configured and or disposed to allow for a partial or complete determination of the kinematic state of the wearer and or the flexible exosuit. That is the sensors could be configured to allow for detection of the position velocity relative orientation relative orientation velocity and other properties of some or all of the segments of the body of the wearer and or segments of the flexible exosuit. The sensors could include accelerometers and or gyroscopes configured such that the accelerometers and or gyroscopes could detect motion and acceleration of parts of a wearer s body. The accelerometers and or gyroscopes could be microelectromechanical systems MEMS or some other kind of systems.

The sensors could include displacement sensors for measuring the distance between two points e.g. between two different elements of the flexible exosuit . The displacement sensors could be implemented in a variety of ways for example the sensors could include two substantially parallel plates that are free to move relative to each other and that are connected to respective measured locations the displacement between the measured locations could be related to a degree of overlap of the parallel plates which could in turn be related to a capacitance between the parallel plates that could be detected to determine the distance between the measured locations. The parallel plates could be part of an exotendon. Additionally or alternatively a displacement between two locations actuated by a TSA could be determined by detecting the rotation of the twisted string of the TSA. In some examples a displacement could be detected by detecting the capacitance of an EPAM as the EPAM is deformed by changes in the displacement. A joint angle could be determined based on a detected displacement between two locations on opposite sides of the joint. Additionally or alternatively a joint angle could be detected by using a goniometer included in the flexible exosuit.

The flexible exosuit could include biosensors configured to detect one or more properties of the body of the wearer of the exosuit. In some examples the flexible exosuit could include two or more electrodes disposed on the skin of the wearer for detecting biopotentials or for detecting other properties of the wearer. For example electrodes could be used to detect an electromyogram EMG generated by muscles of the wearer beneath the skin. Additionally or alternatively electrodes could be used to detect an electrocardiogram ECG or an electrooculogram EOG generated by the heart or eye s respectively of the wearer. Additionally a small current could be injected into the skin of the wearer using the electrodes to detect a Galvanic skin response GSR an impedance spectrum or some other property of the skin. The biosensors could include light emitters and light sensors configured to detect a pulse and or blood oxygen level of the wearer. Other biosensors could be included in the flexible exosuit. Further the properties of the wearer detected using the biosensors could be used to enable a variety of different applications including health monitoring fatigue dosing i.e. altering the operation of the flexible exosuit to meter the rate at which the wearer becomes fatigued control of the exosuit e.g. detecting a controlled muscle twitch of the user and using the detection to change an operating mode of the flexible exosuit or other applications.

A flexible exosuit could include additional elements. For example the flexible exosuit could include one or more controllers operatively coupled to one or more actuators sensors or other elements of the flexible exosuit such that the one or more controllers could operate the flexible exosuit based on one or more stored programs accessible to the one or more controllers. The flexible exosuit could additionally include batteries fuel cells engines solar cells or other elements to provide power to operate the flexible exosuit. The flexible exosuit could include communications elements including radios Bluetooth transceivers WiFi transceivers LTE or other cellular communications equipment satellite uplinks ZigBee transceivers IRdA or other optical communications elements or some other components configured to enable communications between elements of the flexible exosuit e.g. a controller and some remote system.

A flexible exosuit could include electroadhesive elements. That is the flexible exosuit could include elements that could electrically modulate an electrostatic attraction between the elements and some other object. The other object could be another element of the exosuit skin of the wearer of the exosuit or an element of the environment of the exosuit e.g. a rock face a wall a box .

The electroadhesive element could be operated to allow for elements of a flexible exosuit to skin of the wearer to transmit forces from elements of the flexible exosuit e.g. exotendons TSAs into tissues of the wearer. Further such adhesion could be electronically controlled allowing the adhesion to be turned off when the flexible exosuit was not transmitting forces to tissues of the wearer. In some examples the electroadhesive element could be used to adhere objects to the flexible exosuit. For example the electroadhesive element could be used to adhere a pack weapon or other equipment reversibly to the flexible exosuit. In some examples the electroadhesive element could be operated to enable a wearer of the flexible exosuit to climb a wall cliff or other surface by operating the electroadhesive element to adhere to the wall cliff or other surface while the wearer and or exosuit transmitted a force through the electroadhesive element allowing the wearer and or flexible exosuit to lift the wearer and flexible exosuit upwards.

Note that the electroadhesive element and electroadhesive strap and operations and applications thereof described herein are meant as illustrative examples only. An electroadhesive element could be disposed as part of a flexible exosuit or as part of some other device or system to enable electrically controlled adhesion to objects or other devices or systems. An electroadhesive element could take the form of a circle a strap or any other shape that could be substantially flat or could have a curved rigid or flexible surface according to an application. Further the arrangement of first and second sets of conductors as parallel alternating strips on the surface of an electroadhesive element is intended as an illustrative example. The strips could be circles rectangles spirals polygons or other shapes and they could be tiled intercalated or related to each other in some other manner according to an application. There could be more than two sets of conductors indeed each conductor of an electroadhesive element could be individually electronically actuated. For example high voltage could be applied individually to specified conductors of an electroadhesive element in a specified region of the electroadhesive element to enable only the specified region of the electroadhesive element to adhere to an object. Other operations and configurations are anticipated.

A flexible exosuit can include actuators e.g. exotendons TSAs capable of generating transmitting modulating or otherwise controlling forces between two or more elements. In order to enable applications of the flexible exosuit e.g. applying forces and or torques to a body of a wearer to assist record or otherwise interact with physical activities of a wearer the flexible exosuit can be configured to transmit forces into tissues of a wearer e.g. bones joints and muscles of the wearer by transmitting forces into the skin of the wearer. By transmitting forces into the tissues of the wearer rather than transmitting forces across joints of the wearer using a rigid exoskeleton the flexible exosuit can be lighter and can cause less impediment to motions of the wearer including motions of joints even when unpowered than a rigid exoskeleton. A flexible exosuit can include rigid and flexible elements to transmit forces from elements of the flexible exosuit e.g. actuators to other elements of the flexible exosuit and or the skin of a wearer. The flexible exosuit could include straps plates configured to follow a contour of a body part of the wearer flexible meshes boots harnesses or other flexible rigid and semi rigid elements.

Flexible and or rigid elements of a flexible exosuit can be configured to apply a normal force and or stress evenly across a section of a wearer s skin. Distributing loads evenly across a section of the wearer s skin can reduce discomfort experienced by the wearer when forces are applied to the skin and can reduce the change of injury e.g. tears or abrasions of the skin of the wearer. To evenly distribute a load applied to skin of the wearer the flexible exosuit could include a flexible mesh or woven network of flexible elements configured to be mounted to the skin.

For example the flexible exosuit could include a cuff made of woven flexible straps that has a shape specified to conform to an aspect of the wearer s body e.g. the thigh of the wearer. The cuff could include an attachment point for a force transmitting actuator e.g. an exotendon or a TSA and the woven elements of the cuff could be connected to the attachment point such that forces transmitted to the cuff from the actuator are in turn transmitted through the woven elements and into the skin of the wearer evenly along the length of the woven elements. The compliance of the woven elements the pattern of the woven structure and other aspects of the configuration of the cuff could be specified based on information about the aspect of the wearer s body e.g. thigh . For example the pattern of individual woven elements of a cuff configured to be mounted to a shank of a limb of a wearer could follow a catenary pattern as the individual woven element wrapped around the shank of the limb. The shape of the catenary pattern of interconnection between individual woven elements and compliance of individual woven elements could be specified to ensure that the normal force between a segment of a woven element and the skin beneath the segment was sufficient to enable the segment to transmit an amount of shear force into the skin that was substantially similar to the amount of shear force transmitted into other areas of the skin beneath respective other segments of the woven element. Other configurations of flexible and semi flexible cuffs configured to be worn by a wearer and to transmit shear and or normal forces into skin of the wearer are anticipated.

Flexible elements configured to transmit forces into skin of a wearer can be configured to follow be adhered to approximate or otherwise be related to lines of non extension of the skin. Lines of non extension of the skin are lines on the surface of the skin of a wearer along which the skin substantially does not deform during normal motions of the wearer and perpendicularly to which the skin substantially does deform during normal motions of the wearer. A flexible strap that is a substantially linear element configured to be highly compliant in directions perpendicular to the length of the strap and substantially non compliant in along the length of the strap could be adhered to skin along a line of non extension and the deformation of the skin in response to normal motions of the wearer could be substantially unaffected by the adhesion of the strap. Thus the strap could be used to transmit forces into the skin in a manner that did not substantially impede normal motions of the wearer when the strap is not being used to transmit forces into the skin. Configuring flexible elements of a flexible exosuit to conform to lines of non extension of skin could reduce abrasion of the skin relative to the use of flexible elements not configure to substantially conform to and or follow lines of non extension of the skin.

Elements of a flexible exosuit e.g. flexible and or rigid force transmitting elements could be adhered to skin of a wearer in a variety of ways. A chemical adhesive could be applied to bond elements of the flexible exosuit to skin of the wearer and to prevent the elements from slipping. Elements of the flexible exosuit configured to contact and or transmit forces into skin of a wearer could include electroadhesive elements and the electroadhesive elements could be configured to adhere the elements of the flexible exosuit to the skin. The electroadhesive elements could be operated to adhere to and release from the skin according to an application. For example the electroadhesive elements could be operated to adhere elements of the flexible exosuit to the skin when actuators of the flexible exosuit were being operated to apply forces to the body of the wearer. The electroadhesive elements could be operated to release the elements of the flexible exosuit from the skin of the wearer at other times to save energy to increase the comfort of the wearer to allow for repositioning of elements of the flexible exosuit or to enable other functions or applications.

A flexible exosuit that includes elements configured to transmit forces into skin over at least two segments of the body of a wearer e.g. skin of the thigh and of the calf of the wearer could include actuators configured to apply modulate or otherwise transmit forces between the at least two segments to effect and or affect a torque on a joint or joints between the at least two segments e.g. to apply a torque to the knee of the wearer . Additionally or alternatively such a flexible exosuit could be configured to transfer a load or other forces between segments of the body to enable some application.

Flexible and or rigid elements of a flexible exosuit that are configured to transmit forces into skin of a wearer can be incorporated into on and or beneath other elements of the flexible exosuit and or other garments worn by a wearer. In some examples the flexible exosuit includes a conformal undersuit. Flexible and or rigid force transmitting elements of the flexible exosuit can be incorporated into and or disposed on top of elements of the undersuit. In examples where the force transmitting elements are disposed on top of elements of the undersuit the elements of the undersuit could be configured to enable the transmission of normal and or shear forces from the force transmitting elements into the skin. Additionally or alternatively the undersuit could allow the force transmitting elements to move relative to the skin when the force transmitting elements were not transmitting substantial forces into the skin e.g. to reduce abrasion and discomfort of the skin during motion of the wearer . The undersuit could include electroadhesive elements or other elements to facilitate and or modulate the transmission of forces between flexible and or rigid force transmitting elements of the flexible exosuit and the skin of the wearer.

The undersuit could be configured to provide additional functionality. The material of the undersuit could include anti bacterial anti fungal or other agents e.g. silver nanoparticles to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The undersuit could be configured to manage the transport of heat and or moisture e.g. sweat from a wearer to improve the comfort and efficiency of activity of the wearer. The undersuit could include straps seams Velcro or other elements configured to maintain a specified relationship between elements of the flexible exosuit and aspects of the wearer s anatomy. This could additionally increase the ease with which a wearer could don and or doff the flexible exosuit. The undersuit could additionally be configured to protect the wearer from ballistic weapons sharp edges shrapnel or other environmental hazards by including e.g. panels or flexible elements including Kevlar or other armor materials .

The components of the exosuit may be disposed on or in the flexible and or rigid wearable elements of the exosuit or other elements of the exosuit e.g. protective housings a backpack or pouch to enable functions of the exosuit. Note that exosuit is intended as an example and that exosuits as described herein can have more or fewer components than those illustrated in . For example an exosuit could lack TSAs exotendons and or haptic elements and or could include electroadhesive elements or other components.

The physiological sensors include a temperature sensor a heart rate sensor that could include an ECG sensor an optical pulse sensor a microphone or some other elements configured to detect a pulse of a wearer and a Galvanic skin response GSR sensor .

The kinematic sensors could include one or more of each of the types of sensors according to an application of the flexible exosuit for example the flexible exosuit could include and IMU for each of the segments of a wearer s body such that the exosuit could operate the IMUs to determine a posture of the wearer s body that includes information about the relative location and orientation of each segment of the wearer s body. The kinematic sensors could include additional or alternate sensors.

The environmental sensors could include additional or alternate sensors.

The battery s are configured to power elements of the exosuit . The battery s could be rechargeable or single use. The battery s could include a variety of chemistries including but not limited to alkaline zinc air zinc oxide nickel cadmium lead acid lithium polymer and nickel metal hydride. The battery s could include a single battery or a plurality of batteries disposed on or within the exosuit according to an application. Additionally or alternatively the exosuit could be powered by a tether e.g. a tether plugged into a mains power grid a fuel cell a chemical engine e.g. chemical engine that include an electro active polymer as describe above solar cells or some other power source or combination of power sources.

Controller s may be a general purpose processor s a special purpose processor s e.g. digital signal processors application specific integrated circuits etc. or combinations thereof. The one or more controllers can be configured to execute computer readable programs that are stored in a computer readable medium disposed in the exosuit not shown and that are executable to provide the functionality of the exosuit described herein. Additionally or alternatively the controller s could execute instructions received from an outside system using the communications interface s . The instructions could include descriptions of application programming interfaces APIs or other protocols to allow functions of the exosuit e.g. biosensing actuation to be monitored initiated altered or otherwise interacted with by a remote system communicating with the exosuit through some communications channel e.g. a smartphone application communicating with the exosuit through the communications interface s .

Controller s may be disposed at various locations in or on the exosuit according to an application. For example one of the controller s could be disposed in the motor controller s to facilitate high bandwidth low latency control of the TSA s . The controller s could be configured in ways related to their location and or function in the exosuit . For example a controller disposed in the motor controller s could be an FPGA or ASIC while a controller configured to coordinate all of the elements of the exosuit i.e. could be a more multi purpose processor e.g. ARM PIC x86 . Further the program instructions executed by individual controllers of the controller s could be specific to the individual controllers. For example a controller disposed to enable functions of the user interface s may execute program instructions containing descriptions of the user interface elements and methods for conveying information to from other controllers while a controller disposed to enable control of an actuator may execute program instructions that define a real time operating system RTOS and PID controller that enable fixed latency updates of any actuator control outputs generated by the controller.

The user interface s could include buttons screens touchpads indicator lights joysticks or other elements configured to present information to a wearer of the exosuit and or to receive commands from the wearer. The user interface s could be operated to allow the user to select a mode of operation of the exosuit to adjust one or more parameters of the exosuit initiate a function of the exosuit or to otherwise input information to the exosuit . For example the user interface s could include a touchscreen disposed on an element of the exosuit configured to be worn on an arm of the wearer. The touchscreen could be operated to present a number of operating modes of and or applications installed in the exosuit to the user e.g. walk sprint stand at attention jump carry object lift object to detect the presence and location of the wearer s finger on the touchscreen to detect the operating mode and or application selected by the wearer and to communicate the identity of the selected option to another system e.g. the controller s .

Conversely the interface s could be operated to indicate information to the user. For example the interface s could include a display screen possibly a touchscreen additionally configured to accept user input as described above configured to indicate a mode or property of the exosuit a component of the exosuit the wearer of the exosuit or some other information. Example information indicated by the screen could include a battery level of a battery powering the exosuit a pulse rate of the wearer as detected by the physiological sensors an operational mode of the exosuit and the posture of the wearer of the exosuit as detected by the physiological sensors environmental sensors and or kinematic sensors .

The communications interface s could be any component or components configured to enable elements of the exosuit e.g. controller s to send and or receive information to from some other system or systems. For example the communications interface s could include a radio transceiver configured to transmit telemetry data e.g. exosuit operations physiological data about a wearer to a remote system. In another example the communications interface s could be configured to communicate with a cellphone or tablet of the wearer and to facilitate control of the exosuit by an application on the cellphone or tablet by enabling communication between the application and the controller s . The communications interface s could be configured to communicate over wired and or wireless media. The communications interface s could include radios Bluetooth transceivers WiFi transceivers LTE or other cellular communications equipment satellite uplinks ZigBee transceivers IRdA or other optical communications elements or some other components configured to enable communications between elements of the exosuit e.g. controller s and some remote system.

The communications interface s could be operated to enable the sending of telemetry about the exosuit and or wearer the sending and or receiving of calibration data for elements of the exosuit or aspects of a wearer receiving program instructions or other data from a remote system e.g. an online application store . Further the communications interface s could be configured to facilitate communication between a wearer of the exosuit and some other person or system. For example the exosuit could include a microphone and or speakers and could operate the communications interface s microphone and speakers to facilitate verbal communications between the wearer and another person.

The high voltage driver s are configured to produce and modulate high voltage signals to operate exotendon s and or electropolymer artificial muscle EPAM haptic element s . The high voltage driver s could include inductors transformers flybacks capacitors high voltage switches oscillators or other elements to enable the production storage modulation gating and other functions relating to high voltage. The high voltage could be a voltage of several hundred volts or some other voltage according to the configuration of the exotendon s and or haptic element s . In some examples the high voltage driver s could include a single high voltage generator and one or more high voltage switches configured to gate a high voltage generated by the high voltage generator to a set of respective actuators e.g. exotendon s haptic element s . The high voltage driver s could be configured to provide intermediate levels of voltage to an actuator e.g. exotendon s haptic element s to enable operation of the actuator at an intermediate level e.g. to operate an exotendon such that the exotendon slipped under tension rather than being fully clutched no slip or fully un clutched free movement .

The high voltage driver s could be configured to enable other functions. In some examples the high voltage driver s could be configured to allow for detection of some property or properties of the actuator s . For example the high voltage driver s could be configured to detect a capacitance of an exotendon and the detected capacitance could be used to determine a length strain or other information about the exotendon . Further the high voltage driver s could be configured to perform closed loop control of an actuator for example the high voltage driver s could detect a length of an exotendon that is under tension and could operate to apply a voltage to the exotendon such that the length of the exotendon increased at a controlled rate or according to some other command or constraint. In some examples the high voltage driver s could be configured to ensure safe operation e.g. to prevent over voltage over current injury to a wearer damage to elements of the exosuit or some other adverse condition by including breakers varistors voltage clamping diodes or some other element or elements. The high voltage driver s could additionally include level shifting circuitry to enable components operating at lower voltages e.g. controller s to operate the high voltage driver s without being damaged by the high voltages produced in the high voltage driver s .

The motor controller s are configured to produce and modulate voltages and or currents to operate motor s of TSA s . The motor controller s could include inductors transformers flybacks buck converters boost converters capacitors switches oscillators controllers comparators or other elements to enable the production storage modulation gating and other functions relating to driving a motor. The motor controller s could be configured to produce voltage and or current waveforms to drive coils of motors of TSA s . For example the motor controller s could include pulse width modulated PWM switches configured to produce pulses of voltage having specified pulse widths such that a coil of a motor connected to such a PWM switch would experience an effective current related to the specified pulse widths. The motor controller s could include electronics e.g. comparators ADCs amplifiers to detect rotation of and or forces applied to elements of the TSA using the encoder s and or load cell s respectively. The motor controller s could control the timing of voltages and or currents applied to motor coils based on a detected angle of the rotor of the motor and or a magnetic field detected by a Hall sensor disposed in the motor. Additionally or alternatively the motor controller s could control the timing of voltages and or currents applied to motor coils based on a detected back EMF from the motor coils and or currents through motor coils detected using current sensors of the motor controller s . Further the motor controller s could be configured to perform closed loop control of TSA s for example the motor controller s could detect a tension being applied by a TSA e.g. by using the load cell s and could operate the TSA such that the tension increased decreased at a controlled rate or according to some other command or constraint.

Exotendons twisted string actuators TSAs and other actuators can be operated to apply and or transmit forces individually between two different actuated elements. Exotendons TSAs and other actuators can alternatively be incorporated into composite actuators to apply and or transmit forces between two different actuated elements. Composite actuators including exotendons and TSAs could be configured to operate in a manner that was superior in some way to operating those actuators individually. For example a composite actuator could have a superior compliance similarity to biological actuators efficiency range of motion stroke length or some other property when compared to independently configured and or operated exotendons and or TSAs. A composite actuator including at least one TSA and at least one exotendon is referred to herein as a smart tendon exomuscle STEM .

The exotendon could be configured such that it had a very high compliance when unclutched and a very low compliance when clutched. That is the exotendon could be configured such that it acted to engage and disengage the TSA from the first and second actuated elements. The exotendon could be operated in this way to allow a range of motion of the TSA to be adapted to an application. The range of motion of the TSA is the total change in displacement between the first and second actuated elements that the TSA could effect by rotating the second end of the twisted string

In some examples the STEM could be part of a flexible exosuit and the first and second actuated elements could be a shank of a wearer s leg and a wearer s foot respectively such that the STEM could be operated to apply a torque to the ankle of the wearer. Displacement of the first and second actuated elements can correspond to changes in angle of the ankle of the wearer. The displacement corresponding to the full range of ankle angles that the wearer could experience could be greater than the range of motion of the TSA . In such a situation the exotendon could be operated to un clutch the TSA to allow the wearer to freely move their ankle joint. Once it was determined that the flexible exosuit should apply a torque to the ankle of the wearer the exotendon could be operated to clutch the TSA and the TSA could be operated to apply the torque to the ankle of the wearer. In this way incorporation into the STEM could be said to have increased the effective range of motion of the TSA by allowing the first and second actuated elements to be un clutched from the TSA and repositioned.

In some examples the exotendon could be clutched i.e. could be operated to have a relatively low compliance . A flexible exosuit that includes the STEM could operate the TSA and sensors e.g. load cell s encoder s accelerometer s according to some application. The flexible exosuit could operate the TSA and sensors to determine an optimal transmission ratio length stroke length or other property or properties of the TSA relative to the application. The flexible exosuit could then clutch and un clutch the exotendon to adjust the transmission ratio length stroke length or other property or properties of the TSA to correspond to the determined optimal property or properties of the TSA 

For example the transmission ratio of a TSA included in a STEM configured to apply forces across an ankle of a wearer could be related to the weight geometry or other properties of the wearer and or of the STEM. A flexible exosuit including the STEM could operate the STEM to apply forces to the ankle of the wearer determine the optimal transmission ratio of the TSA and operate STEM to cause the transmission ratio of the TSA to correspond to the determined optimal transmission ratio. Thus could include un clutching the exotendon then operating the motor of the STEM to change the twist of the twisted string of the STEM thus changing the transmission ration of the TSA and then clutching the exotendon. In some examples the flexible exosuit could indicate to a wearer using a user interface a haptic element operation of the STEM or some other method actions to be performed by the wearer to facilitate a change in the properties of the TSA e.g. by instructing the wearer to exert an isometric force while the exotendon is un clutched so that the TSA can be operated to change a property of the TSA the exotendon could subsequently clutch such that the TSA could assist the musculature of the wearer in applying dynamic and or static forces .

The STEM could additionally or alternatively be operated in a bio mimetic manner. That is the compliance of the exotendon and the force and or displacement of the TSA could be controlled to enable application and or transmission of forces between the first and second actuated elements that was more efficient less likely to cause injury or damage to a wearer or system attached to the first and second actuated elements or in some other way superior to operating individual TSAs and or exotendons according to an application. In some examples the exotendon could be configured to extract inject and or store mechanical energy by including one or more springs or other compliant elements. In an example the STEM could operate such an exotendon to be charged with elastic potential energy by operating the TSA to apply a force and displacement to the exotendon . The exotendon could then be operated to release the stored elastic potential energy. For example the exotendon could be operated to release the stored elastic potential energy to allow a wearer of a flexible exosuit containing the STEM to accomplish a jump that was higher than the wearer and or TSA could have accomplished without the elastic potential energy stored in the exotendon

A STEM configured similarly to STEM could be configured as a self contained flexible unit. illustrates a STEM attached to first and second actuated elements such that the STEM could be operated to apply a force and or change a displacement between the first and second actuated elements. The STEM includes a motor rigidly coupled to a first end of a flexible transmission tube that is configured to transmit torques and or forces along its length and to be flexible in directions perpendicular to its length similar to the outer housing of a Bowden cable . A second end of the flexible transmission tube is rigidly coupled to the first actuated element . A first end of a twisted string is mechanically coupled to a first end of an exotendon . A second end of the exotendon is mechanically coupled to the second actuated element . The twisted string is partially contained within and protected by flexible transmission tube . A rotor of the motor is coupled to a second end of the twisted string such that the motor can be operated to apply a torque and or rotation to the second end of the twisted string such that a force and or change in displacement is applied between the first actuated element and the first end of the exotendon . The exotendon is configured to act as a switched compliance element able to be electrically operated to have one of at least two effective compliances i.e. to have two different relationships between forces applied between the first and second ends of the exotendon and strains of the exotendon . The exotendon and twisted string actuator could be configured similarly to other exotendons e.g. and TSAs e.g. respectively described herein or could be configured in other ways. STEM could be operated similarly to STEM

The STEM could be operated to provide some application or operation of a flexible exosuit. In some examples the second exotendon could be connected in series with a spring to allow the spring to be clutched to transmit forces e.g. to from a body of a wearer during a first period of time and to transmit substantially no forces during a second period of time. For example the exotendon could be connected in series with a spring and the first and second actuated elements could be the calf and the foot of a wearer such that the STEM could be operated to apply an extensor torque to the ankle of the wearer. The second exotendon could be clutched following contact of the heel of the user with the ground during locomotion. The clutched spring could then be charged with elastic potential energy as the user flexes their ankle. The stored elastic potential energy could be released to the ankle of the wearer as the wearer extends their ankle before lifting their foot from the ground this storage and release of mechanical energy from to the ankle of the wearer could increase the efficiency of the locomotion of the wearer. The second exotendon could be un clutched following the lifting of the wearer s foot from the ground such that the second exotendon and spring did not substantially affect the rotation and or torque at the wearer s ankle while the wearer s foot was not in contact with the ground. In parallel the first exotendon could be clutched at the point in time that the spring began to release stored elastic potential energy and un clutched following the lifting of the wearer s foot from the ground. While the first exotendon is clutched the TSA could be operated to apply an extensor torque to the ankle of the wearer assisting the spring and the muscles of the wearer in applying force against the ground through the foot of the wearer. Other configurations and patterns of use of the STEM are anticipated according to an application. Further a spring connected in series with an exotendon could be implemented as an element of the exotendon.

In some examples the exotendons and or additional exotendons not shown included in the STEM could be clutched and un clutched in an alternating fashion to allow greater forces to be generated and or applied between the first and second actuated elements. For example the exotendons could be operated to ratchet a spring mechanically connecting it to force applying and or force generating elements the body of a wearer the TSA to progressively add mechanically energy in a spring not shown and or included in the exotendons . Other repeated mechanically additive operations of a STEM are anticipated.

Note that the STEMs described herein e.g. are intended as non limiting illustrative examples. Other configurations and operations of a STEM are anticipated. Further the TSA of any example STEM herein could be replaced with some other linear actuator for example an EPAM.

The first and second exotendons could be operated to clutch and un clutch elements having a specified compliance e.g. springs straps included in the exotendons to store and release elastic potential energy and or to modulate the impedance of elements of the flexible exosuit during locomotion or during other activities of the wearer as described herein. Further the first and second exotendons could be operated to reduce the compressive loading of the ankle and the shear and or normal forces transmitted into skin of the calf of the wearer by the first FTE when the flexible exosuit is operated to apply an extensor torque to the ankle of the wearer

Note that show simplified cross sectional schematic views of elements of respective flexible exosuits . Some or all of the elements of flexible exosuits could be duplicated and the original and duplicate elements disposed on opposite sides of the leg of the respective wearer . Additionally or alternatively elements of flexible exosuits could be configured to wholly or partially encircle parts of respective wearers bodies such that forces and or torques transmitted between elements and or between elements and parts of respective wearers bodies are applied substantially along a plane bisecting local elements e.g. joints of respective wearers bodies e.g. along a mid sagittal plane of a leg in the illustrated examples . Further elements described as bearings e.g. could be any variety of bearings e.g. plain bearings ball bearings roller bearings fluid bearings or could be other elements configured to allow a rotation between elements but not to allow translation e.g. a ball and socket joint according to an application. Additionally illustrated bearings e.g. could include rods or pins configured to rigidly couple duplicate paired elements as described above on opposite sides of an aspect of a wearer s body. Further note that where rods and or pins are shown other rotational or other joints could be used according to an application. For example hinge joints ball and socket joints Hardy Spicer joints or other joints could be used according to an application requiring two elements to not be able to translate but to be able to rotate in one or more dimensions.

Configurations of actuators and rigid and flexible force transmitting elements in a flexible exosuit can additionally enable the transmission of compressive forces from a first segment of a wearer s body to a second segment. This can be accomplished using electrically operated elements such that the flexible exosuit could operate the actuators to minimally encumber relative motion of the first and second segments. illustrate side and back views respectively of parts of a flexible exosuit configured to selectively transmit compressive forces between the thigh and the calf of a wearer .

The flexible exosuit includes first and second rigid force transmitting elements RFTEs . The first and second RFTEs are connected together by bearings configured to allow the first and second RFTEs to rotate relative to each other. When the flexible exosuit is worn by the wearer as shown in an axis of rotation of the bearings is located proximate to by not necessarily coaxial with an axis of rotation of the knee of the wearer . The flexible exosuit is configured such that relatively unencumbered motion of the wearer s knee and or operation of the flexible exosuit to transmit compressive forces between the thigh and calf of the wearer are not contingent upon a precise alignment of the axis of rotation of the bearings and the axis of rotation of the knee . The first and second RFTEs are connected at first and second attachment points respectively to first and second force coupling elements FCEs respectively. The FCEs can include rigid and or flexible elements as described elsewhere in this disclosure and are configured to transmit forces transmitted to the FCEs from the RFTEs through the attachment points respectively into skin of the thigh and calf respectively of the wearer .

The flexible exosuit includes exotendons having first ends rigidly coupled to the second RFTE and second ends connected to respective cables that wrap around respective pulleys on the second RFTE . The cables then connect to respective attachment points on the first RFTE . When the exotendons are unclutched the RFTEs can rotate about each other in response to movement of the knee of the wearer . When the exotendons are clutched rotation of the RFTEs about the bearings can be prevented by tensile forces transmitted between the RFTEs by the cables . As a result a compressive force could be transmitted by the flexible exosuit between the thigh and calf of the wearer through the attachment points when the exotendons are clutched.

The illustrated elements of the flexible exosuit are only one example of how elements of a flexible exosuit could be configured to allow transmission of compressive forces from a first segment of a wearer s body to a second segment while being able to be operated to substantially not encumber relative motion of the first and second body segments. In some examples the actuator could include a twisted string actuator or some other flexible or rigid linear actuator a rotational actuator e.g. a motor a clutch or could include a combination of actuators e.g. a STEM . For example instead of the exotendon cable and pulley system illustrated in a mechanical clutch could be situated on or near the bearings to prevent relative motion of the RFTEs . The mechanical clutch could be configured to prevent rotation of the bearings in either direction allowing the flexible exosuit to transmit both compressive and tensile forces. Additionally or alternatively additional cables pulleys and other elements could enable at least one exotendon to prevent rotation of the bearings in one or both directions allowing the flexible exosuit to transmit compressive and or tensile forces between segments of a user s body.

Further the illustrated flexible exosuit could include additional or alternate elements to enable additional functionality. Flexible straps or other elements could be connected to the RFTEs to maintain the RFTEs close to the leg of the wearer and or to maintain some minimum alignment between the axis of rotation of the bearings and the axis of rotation of the knee while allowing the flexible exosuit to be operated so as to not substantially encumber relative motion of the thigh and calf of the wearer . The shape of the second RFTE the composition of surface coatings of the second RFTE and or the exotendons or some other aspect of the flexible exosuit could be specified to enhance the clutching force of the exotendons through the capstan effect. That is the flexible exosuit could be configured such that a significant fraction of the force transmitted by the cables between the RFTEs is transmitted into the second RFTE through friction between a surface of the second RFTE and or a surface of some element rigidly mechanically coupled to the second RFTE and surfaces of the cables and or exotendons . Other configurations of a flexible exosuit configured to transmit compressive forces between body segments of a wearer are anticipated.

The illustration of elements of a flexible exosuit configured to apply forces between the calf and the foot of a wearer as in or forces between the calf and the thigh or a wearer as in are intended as examples. A flexible exosuit could include similar structures to transmit compressive and or tensile forces between different segments of a wearer s body and or across different joints of a wearer s body. For example structures similar to those illustrated in and or could with minimal modification be configured to apply torques to elbows wrists shoulders hips knees ankles and or other joints and or combinations of joint of a wearer. Additionally the use of twisted string actuators in and the use of exotendons in and are meant as illustrative examples of actuators. Additionally or alternatively flexible linear actuators twisted string actuators exotendons EPAMs STEMs motor and drum driven cables servos pneumatic or hydraulic pistons racks and pinions motorized screw drives or ball screws or other actuators could be used in place of the illustrated twisted string actuators or exotendons according to an application.

The force transducers additionally include a hip extensor and a hip flexor connected between the torso and pelvis and the femur across the hip . Properties of the force transducers could be chosen to represent elements of human anatomy available artificial transducers or according to some other constraint or application.

The model includes exotendons comprising a clutch connected in series with a spring. These exotendons are intended to simulate some of the properties of tendons including the ability to store energy from dissipate energy from and or and release stored energy to the leg during locomotion. The exotendons additionally include the clutch enabling the energy storage and or compliance of the exotendons to be modulated during movement of the simulated leg to enable more efficient locomotion. The exotendons include a knee extensor and a knee flexor connected between the femur and the tibia across the knee .

The exotendons additionally include a posterior tibia exotendon connected between the femur and the spring that is connected in turn to the foot such that the posterior tibia exotendon and spring together cross the ankle and knee . Properties of the exotendons and spring could be chosen to represent elements of human anatomy available artificial exotendons or other clutched compliance components or according to some other constraint or application.

The model can be used to simulate the effect of a sequence of activations of clutches of the exotendons and or force generating elements of the force transducers on a leg. A sequence of such simulations could be used to develop sets of exotendon properties force transducer properties clutch and force generating element activation timings and or other model properties to optimize some metric. For example simulations using the model could be used to develop a set of clutch and force generating element activation timings to enable simulated locomotion using minimal energy. Other metrics could be optimized including system stability perturbation tolerance segment jerk joint angular acceleration instantaneous power use or other factors.

The model could be used to develop control algorithms for flexible exosuits prosthetics assistive devices or other applications of or devices relating to the human leg. For example a prosthetic leg could be configured to reflect the configuration of elements in the model i.e. to include force transducer like and exotendon like elements . The prosthetic leg could then be operated to locomote according to an output of the model e.g. a set of clutch and force generating element activation timings. In another example the model could be used to test and or train a controller for a device configured to reflect the configuration of elements in the model e.g. the prosthetic above or a flexible exosuit . That is gains timings topologies or other aspects of a controller could be optimized trained validated or otherwise specified based on simulations performed using the model. Other uses and applications of the model are anticipated.

In some examples the model could be used to determine joint angles joint angular velocities joint torques and other variables of locomotion across a stereotypical locomotor cycle. This stereotypical locomotor cycle could be determined by including additional constraints to the behavior of the model e.g. by attempting to develop a stable maximally efficient locomotor cycle. From the determined information about the stereotypical locomotor cycle a mapping or other relationship between a set of joint angles a set of joint angular velocities a locomotor phase and or a set of joint torques. For example given a set of joint angles and joint angular velocities one could determine a corresponding locomotor phase e.g. a point 60 from the beginning of the stereotypical locomotor phase . One could then determine a set of joint torques corresponding to the determined locomotor phase.

The Endo Herr model or some other model including the Endo Herr model could be implemented as part of a controller of a flexible exosuit prosthetic assistive device or other device related to a human leg. For example a controller be configured to generate a set of activations for clutches and force generating elements in the model based on sensed information about the human leg e.g. joint angles joint velocities joint torques user interface commands from the owner of the leg etc. . An implementation of the model could be included in the controller and could be configured to generate a simulated set of joint torques based on the generated set of activations. Another element of the controller could be configured to operate a flexible exosuit or other device interacting with the human leg to create torques about the human leg approximating the set of simulated joint torques produced by the implementation of the model . Additionally or alternatively a controller could be configured to generate a set of joint torques for a human leg based on sensed information about the human leg. An inverse implementation of the model could be included in the controller to generate a set of activations for clutches and force generating elements and to operate a flexible exosuit or other device interacting with the human leg based on the generated set of activations. Other uses and implementations of the Endo Herr model or some other model including the Endo Herr model are anticipated.

Properties and patterns of operation of the exotendons spring and force transducers could be chosen to mimic forces moments movements or other properties of locomotion recorded from a human. For example a pattern of torques applied by muscles of a human to bones of the human while the human walks could be recorded. The properties and patterns of actuation of elements e.g. of the Endo Herr model could be specified such that the torques applied to the joints of the simulated skeleton by the elements of the Endo Herr model mimicked the torqued recorded from the human and or maximized some cost function related to the recorded torques and or the simulated work performed by the elements of the Endo Herr model .

The levels of activation not shown and timing of activation of the force transducers respectively are specified to produce a simulated torque at the hip using and and at the ankle that mimics the recorded torques. The simulated hip torque mimics the recorded torque exactly due to the presence of independent hip extensor and hip flexor force actuators. The simulated ankle torque is produced partially by the ankle extensor force actuator and closely matches the recorded ankle torque.

The specified compliances and timings of actuation of respective exotendons are specified using an optimization process to maximize correspondence between the simulated joint torques and recorded joint torques to simulated energy used by the force transducers or according to some other cost function combination of cost functions or some other constraints and or considerations. Recorded torque patterns could be from an individual from a population of individuals or from some other source e.g. a pattern of torque determined from a model or simulation to be in some way optimal for crouched locomotion jumping running or some other application of lower limbs of a human .

Parameters topologies or other aspects of configuration of a controller could be optimized according to some constraint or cost function similar to the cost functions and constraint outlined above or according to some other application in simulation before being used to control a specific physical implementation of the Endo Herr model being used to apply forces and or torques to a specific individual and or some other physical application. Parameters of the Endo Herr model that is used to simulate the operation of a controller could be specified based on a specific individual and or a specific physical implementation of elements of the Endo Herr model .

Rigid elements corresponding to the foot tibia femur and torso and pelvis and respectively have geometrical extents and other properties in addition to the properties of the corresponding elements and of the Endo Herr model . The geometrical extents and relative positions of the rigid elements could be based on anatomical data from an individual human an anatomical database a description of an idealized mean human skeleton or some other source.

The activation of the simulated muscles movement of the rigid elements and other aspects of such simulations could be defined by data collected from individual users. Additionally or alternatively the activation of the simulated muscles movement of the rigid elements and other aspects of such simulations could be based on ongoing properties of such simulations for example simulated muscle activations could be generated by a simulated nervous system or other controller based on the state of the combined model and or the locations of the rigid elements could be based on kinematics torques or other outputs of the combined model . Simulations using the combined model could include the presence of simulated loads rigidly or otherwise attached to the simulated torso and pelvis

The combined model could be used to develop control algorithms for flexible exosuits prosthetics assistive devices or other applications of or devices relating to the human leg.

Additionally or alternatively the combined model could be used to train a controller to activate elements of the device to prevent injury of a non simulated leg of a wearer of the device while allowing the wearer to use the leg relatively unimpeded. Other uses and applications of the combined model are anticipated.

A flexible exosuit may be configured in a variety of ways according to a variety of applications. Indeed it is this versatility in the choice of elements and software that establishes the exosuit as a human augmentation platform for the variety of applications. Further a flexible exosuit may be configured according to an overall topology e.g. having a twisted string actuator configured to apply a flexor torque to a knee of a wearer and an exotendon configured to apply an extensor torque to an ankle of a wearer and additionally have specific parameters or measurements specified according to an individual wearer and or be configured to have one or more parameters or measurements adjustable to accommodate an individual wearer. A flexible exosuit may be configured to apply forces to the lower body upper body torso or combinations of some or all of these parts of a wearer. A flexible exosuit could be symmetric able to apply the same types of forces and torques to one side of a wearer s body as to the opposite side or could be asymmetric e.g. to enable strength assists and or rehabilitation to a wearer that has experienced an injury to one limb and not to the opposite limb . Different overall topologies of configuration of flexible exosuits may correspond to and or be specified by respective applications of flexible exosuits.

The flexible exosuit could include other elements and actuators not shown . The flexible exosuit could include sensors to detect one or more properties of the flexible exosuit the wearer and or the environment of the flexible exosuit . The sensors could be discrete or could be incorporated into assemblies with or integrated as part of the actuators . The sensors could include accelerometers gyroscopes strain gauges load cells encoders displacement sensors capacitive sensors biosensors thermometers or others types of sensors. The flexible exosuit could include feedback elements including haptic feedback elements that could be operated to indicate information to the wearer . Additionally or alternatively the actuators could be operated to indicate haptic information to the wearer . The flexible exosuit could additionally include controllers batteries engines fuel cells communications devices user interfaces or other elements as described herein or as are familiar to one of skill in the art to enable functions and applications of the flexible exosuit .

Note that a flexible exosuit need not be capable of independent actuation of each joint or degree of freedom of a wearer s body that is covered by the flexible exosuit. That is the flexible exosuit could be under actuated and the degrees of freedom of the wearer s body that are actuated could be specified according to an application of the flexible exosuit. For example the flexible exosuit illustrated in is underactuated i.e. the flexible exosuit is unable to independently actuate e.g. apply independent torques to using tension generating actuators all of the joints of the wearer s lower limb. The configuration of actuators in the flexible exosuit is related to the pattern of simulated actuators in the Endo Herr reduced model of efficient bipedal locomotion.

The flexible exosuit is sufficiently actuated to enable various applications and uses of the flexible exosuit . The flexible exosuit could be operated to prevent the development of fatigue during extended locomotion by the wearer by extracting storing and or injecting energy to from the legs of the wearer . The flexible exosuit could be operated to increase the maximum load carried by the wearer by adding extensor torques to the joints of the legs of the wearer and or by operating the clutched compliance elements to modulate the effective impedance of the joints of the wearer to reduce the development of fatigue. The flexible exosuit could be operated to prevent injury of the wearer for example by increasing the effective joint impedance and or limiting the range of motion of a joint that was about to experience an injury inducing amount of torque force and or angular displacement.

The flexible exosuit could be operated to assist the wearer in carrying heavy loads and or reducing the development of fatigue in the arms of the wearer while carrying a load for a prolonged period of time. For example the clutched compliance elements could be deactivated i.e. substantially slack high compliance and non interfering with motions of the wearer when the wearer is not carrying a load. When the wearer is carrying a load the clutched compliance elements could be activated such that the clutched compliance elements are substantially non compliant such that the force necessary to carry the load is transferred between the wearer s upper torso by the flexible exosuit instead of by the muscles and other active metabolic energy consuming fatigue able elements of the wearer s arm. The flexible exosuit could additionally or alternatively be operated to enable other functions for example the actuators could be operated to effect a specified posture of the arm of the wearer e.g. to effect greater accuracy of operation of a weapon. In another example the flexible exosuit could be operated to assists the wearer in climbing e.g. by assisting the wearer by using the tension generating actuator .

The illustration of elements of a flexible exosuit in and are intended as examples. A flexible exosuit could include actuators in a similar or different arrangement according to an application. In some examples elements of a flexible exosuit could allow the arms and legs of the body of a wearer to be controllably mechanically coupled. For example exotendons could be disposed in an exosuit to couple motions of the arms of a wearer to motions of the legs of a wearer. This configuration could enable a wearer to use the wearer s arms to assists the wearer s legs in walking running sprinting climbing or some other activity. Other alternate configurations and applications of a flexible exosuit are anticipated. Additionally illustrated twisted string actuators and exotendons are meant as illustrative examples of actuators. Additionally or alternatively twisted string actuators exotendons EPAMs STEMs motor and drum driven cables servos pneumatic or hydraulic pistons racks and pinions motorized screw drives or ball screws or other actuators could be used in place of the illustrated twisted string actuators or exotendons according to an application.

A flexible exosuit or similar mechatronic system could be operated by electronic controllers disposed on or within the flexible exosuit or in wireless or wired communication with the flexible exosuit. The electronic controllers could be configured in a variety of ways to operate the flexible exosuit and to enable functions of the flexible exosuit. The electronic controllers could access and execute computer readable programs that are stored in elements of the exosuit or in other systems that are in direct or indirect communications with the flexible exosuit. The computer readable programs could describe methods for operating the flexible exosuit or could describe other operations relating to a flexible exosuit or to a wearer of a flexible exosuit.

The user interface could be configured to be removably mounted to the flexible exosuit e.g. by straps magnets Velcro charging and or data cables . Alternatively the user interface could be configured as a part of the flexible exosuit and not to be removed during normal operation. In some examples a user interface could be incorporated as part of the flexible exosuit e.g. a touchscreen integrated into a sleeve of the flexible exosuit and could be used to control and or access information about the flexible exosuit in addition to using the user interface to control and or access information about the flexible exosuit . In some examples the controller or other elements of the flexible exosuit are configured to enable wireless or wired communication according to a standard protocol e.g. Bluetooth ZigBee WiFi LTE or other cellular standards IRdA Ethernet such that a variety of systems and devices could be made to operate as the user interface when configured with complementary communications elements and computer readable programs to enable such functionality.

The flexible exosuit could be configured as described in example embodiments herein or in other ways according to an application. The flexible exosuit could be operated to enable a variety of applications. The flexible exosuit could be operated to enhance the strength of a wearer by detecting motions of the wearer e.g. using sensors and responsively applying torques and or forces to the body of the wearer e.g. using actuators to increase the forces the wearer is able to apply to his her body and or environment. This could include enabling a wearer to lift heavier objects or to jump higher than the wearer would be able to when not wearing the flexible exosuit . This could include allowing a wearer to walk or run while carrying a load or while unencumbered farther than the wearer would be able to when not wearing the flexible exosuit by providing some fraction of the ground reaction forces or other forces and or torques that the wearer generates while locomoting. Further elements of the flexible exosuit could be operated to reduce and or meter fatigue of the wearer by supplementing the forces and or torques that the wearer generates with a specified fraction of the forces and or torques by suing the actuators . The specified fraction could be constant could be related to a detected fatigue state of the wearer e.g. detected using the sensors or could be based on some other consideration.

The flexible exosuit could be operated to avoid and or reduce injuries experienced by a wearer. In some examples reducing the fatigue experienced by a wearer by operating the suit as described herein to supplement forces generated by the wearer to perform tasks or according to other applications can reduce the probability that the wearer experiences joint damage sprains strains or other injuries. The actuators e.g. exotendons could be operated to increase the effective impedance of a wearer s joints to reduce the forces and or torques experienced by the joints during a fall or other injury inducing event. Additionally or alternatively actuators of the flexible exosuit could be operated to ensure that joints of the wearer were able to move freely in certain directions but not in other directions likely to result in injury e.g. an ankle could be able to move freely to dorsiflex and or plantarflex but not to rotate in directions other than the dorsiflexion plantarflexion direction e.g. adduction abduction or to ensure that the rate and or extent of joint motion does not exceed some safety threshold.

The flexible exosuit could be operated to avoid and or reduce injuries experienced by a wearer by operating actuators continuously e.g. by continuously operating actuators to reduce the effective impedance of a joint of the wearer or could operate the actuators in response to a detected condition e.g. by the sensors . For example the sensors could detect that a rate of joint movement was above a threshold and the actuators could be responsively operated to increase the effective impedance of the joint. In some examples the flexible exosuit could operate the actuators to avoid and or reduce the occurrence of injuries in response to the presence of unstable or otherwise dangerous terrain or other dangerous environmental conditions. For example the flexible exosuit could include LIDAR radar ultrasonic rangefinders or other sensors configured to detect that terrain in front of a wearer is uneven. Additionally or alternatively the flexible exosuit could receive information from the server about the terrain in front of the wearer. The flexible exosuit could then be operated to avoid and or reduce the occurrence of injuries to the wearer in response to information indicating that the terrain was uneven.

The flexible exosuit could be operated to train a wearer to perform certain physical activities. For example the flexible exosuit could be operated to enable rehabilitative therapy of a wearer. The flexible exosuit could operate to amplify motions and or forces produced by a wearer undergoing therapy in order to enable the wearer to successfully complete a program of rehabilitative therapy. Additionally or alternatively the flexible exosuit could be operated to prohibit disordered movements of the wearer and or to use the actuators and or other elements e.g. haptic feedback elements to indicate to the wearer a motion or action to perform and or motions or actions that should not be performed or that should be terminated. Similarly other programs of physical training e.g. dancing skating other athletic activities vocational training could be enabled by operation of the flexible exosuit to detect motions torques or forces generated by a wearer and or to apply forces torques or other haptic feedback to the wearer. Other applications of the flexible exosuit and or user interface are anticipated.

The flexible exosuit could be operated to perform any of the described functions e.g. training injury prevention fatigue reduction while the wearer performs a variety of tasks. In some examples the flexible exosuit could be worn by a wearer engaged in athletic activities. The flexible exosuit could be worn by a wearer engaging in cycling the flexible exosuit could be operated to train the wearer to use a more effective stroke to help the wearer to engage in more effective pacing or some other application. The flexible exosuit could be worn by a wearer who was walking running or otherwise locomoting and the flexible exosuit could be operated to increase the efficiency of the wearer s locomotion. In some examples the wearer could be walking in an environment that was unfamiliar to the wearer and or that includes some hazards and the flexible exosuit could be operated to train the wearer to walk in a manner that minimized a chance of injury maximized an efficient speed or other constraint to protect the wearer from injury or according to some other application. For example the wearer could be using snow shoes to walk across snowy terrain and the flexible exosuit could be operated to train the wearer in an efficient gait for locomoting across the snowy terrain and or could apply forces and or torques to the wearer to assist the wearer in locomoting. In some examples the flexible exosuit could act as a golf coach by guiding the movements of a wearer using e.g. haptic feedback elements exotendons TSAs to teach the wearer to perform a golf stroke having an optimal trajectory timing or other properties. The wearer could perform the movements to perform the golf stroke repeatedly and could learn proper technique from the guidance of the flexible exosuit .

The flexible exosuit could be operated to make it more difficult for the wearer to perform a task e.g. a task that may be harmful to the wearer . That is the flexible exosuit could be operated to apply forces and or torques to the body of the wearer such that the wearer had to exert more effort to perform a task e.g. walking running climbing than the wearer would have to exert if the flexible exosuit was not being operated in that way. This operation of the flexible exosuit could enable more effective strength and or cardiovascular training. In some examples the flexible exosuit could be operated to act as a virtual gym allowing the wearer to perform exercises against forces and or torques generated by the flexible exosuit as though the wearer was interacting with exercise equipment e.g. a treadmill an elliptical machine . For example the flexible exosuit could be operated to apply forces to the arms of the wearer to simulate the presence of free weights being used by the wearer. Further the flexible exosuit could be operated to enable exercise regimens that would be expensive or impossible to implement using standalone gym equipment. In some examples the flexible exosuit could be operated to apply forces and or torques to the body of the wearer to simulate other environments. For example the forces and or torques could simulate for the wearer the experience of performing underwater or in some other fluid by simulated the increased drag the wearer would experience underwater in a heavy wind e.g. assisting motions of the wearer in the direction of the simulated wind and hindering motions in the opposite direction performing in a different gravity field e.g. on the moon on a world with higher gravity than the earth or other environments.

The user interface can additionally communicate with communications network s . For example the user interface could include a WiFi radio an LTE transceiver or other cellular communications equipment a wired modem or some other elements to enable the user interface and flexible exosuit to communicate with the Internet. The user interface could communicate through the communications network with a server . Communication with the server could enable functions of the user interface and wearable exosuit . In some examples the user interface could upload telemetry data e.g. location configuration of elements of the flexible exosuit physiological data about a wearer of the flexible exosuit to the server .

In some examples the server could be configured to control and or access information from elements of the flexible exosuit e.g. to enable some application of the flexible exosuit . For example the server could operate elements of the flexible exosuit to move a wearer out of a dangerous situation if the wearer was injured unconscious or otherwise unable to move themselves and or operate the exosuit and user interface to move themselves out of the dangerous situation. Other applications of a server in communications with a flexible exosuit are anticipated.

The user interface could be configured to communicate with a second user interface in communication with and configured to operate a second flexible exosuit . Such communication could be direct e.g. using radio transceivers or other elements to transmit and receive information over a direct wireless or wired link between the user interface and the second user interface . Additionally or alternatively communication between the user interface and the second user interface could be facilitated by communications network s and or a server configured to communicate with the user interface and the second user interface through the communications network s .

Communication between the user interface and the second user interface could enable applications of the flexible exosuit and second flexible exosuit . In some examples actions of the flexible exosuit and second flexible exosuit and or of wearers of the flexible exosuit and second flexible exosuit could be coordinated. For example the flexible exosuit and second flexible exosuit could be operated to coordinate the lifting of a heavy object by the wearers. The timing of the lift and the degree of support provided by each of the wearers and or the flexible exosuit and second flexible exosuit could be controlled to increase the stability with which the heavy object was carried to reduce the risk of injury of the wearers or according to some other consideration. Coordination of actions of the flexible exosuit and second flexible exosuit and or of wearers thereof could include applying coordinated in time amplitude or other properties forces and or torques to the wearers and or elements of the environment of the wearers and or applying haptic feedback though actuators of the exosuits through dedicated haptic feedback elements or through other methods to the wearers to guide the wearers toward acting in a coordinated manner.

Coordinated operation of the flexible exosuit and second flexible exosuit could be implemented in a variety of ways. In some examples one flexible exosuit and the wearer thereof could act as a master providing commands or other information to the other flexible exosuit such that operations of the exosuits are coordinated. For example the exosuits could be operated to enable the wearers to dance or to engage in some other athletic activity in a coordinated manner. One of the flexible exosuits could act as the lead transmitting timing or other information about the actions performed by the lead wearer to the other flexible exosuit enabling coordinated dancing motions to be executed by the other wearer. In some examples a first wearer of a first exosuit could act as a trainer modeling motions or other physical activities that a second wearer of a second exosuit could learn to perform. The first exosuit could detect motions torques forces or other physical activities executed by the first wearer and could send information related to the detected activities to the second exosuit. The second exosuit could then apply forces torques haptic feedback or other information to the body of the second wearer to enable the second wearer to learn the motions or other physical activities modeled by the first wearer. In some examples the server could send commands or other information to the exosuits to enable coordinated operation of the exosuits .

Note that more than the two illustrated flexible exosuits can be operated in a coordinated manner. In some examples many flexible exosuits or other mechatronic or other systems could be operated in a coordinated manner to enable some application. For example a troupe of ballet dancers a team of football players a team of synchronized skaters a marching band a mime troupe or some other groups of athletes or performers could be wearing flexible exosuits configured to coordinate their motions in time. In some examples a first wearer of a first exosuit could act as a trainer or coach modeling motions or other physical activities that many wearers of respective flexible exosuits could learn to perform. The first exosuit could detect motions torques forces or other physical activities executed by the first wearer and could send information related to the detected activities to the many other flexible exosuits. The many other exosuits could then apply forces torques haptic feedback or other information to the bodies of respective wearers to enable the wearers to learn the motions or other physical activities modeled by the first wearer. In some examples a server could send commands or other information to a plurality of exosuits to enable coordinated operation of the plurality of exosuits. Other applications including the coordinated operation of a plurality of flexible exosuits are anticipated.

The flexible exosuit could be operated to transmit and or record information about the actions of a wearer the environment of the wearer or other information about a wearer of the flexible exosuit . In some examples kinematics related to motions and actions of the wearer could be recorded and or sent to the server . These data could be collected for medical scientific entertainment social media or other applications. The data could be used to operate a system. For example the flexible exosuit could be configured to transmit motions forces and or torques generated by a user to a robotic system e.g. a robotic arm leg torso humanoid body or some other robotic system and the robotic system could be configured to mimic the activity of the wearer and or to map the activity of the wearer into motions forces or torques of elements of the robotic system. In another example the data could be used to operate a virtual avatar of the wearer such that the motions of the avatar mirrored or were somehow related to the motions of the wearer. The virtual avatar could be instantiated in a virtual environment presented to an individual or system with which the wearer is communicating or configured and operated according to some other application.

Conversely the flexible exosuit could be operated to present haptic or other data to the wearer. In some examples the actuators e.g. twisted string actuators exotendons and or haptic feedback elements e.g. EPAM haptic elements could be operated to apply and or modulate forces applied to the body of the wearer to indicate mechanical or other information to the wearer. For example the activation in a certain pattern of a haptic element of the flexible exosuit disposed in a certain location of the flexible exosuit could indicate that the wearer had received a call email or other communications. In another example a robotic system could be operated using motions forces and or torques generated by the wearer and transmitted to the robotic system by the flexible exosuit . Forces moments and other aspects of the environment and operation of the robotic system could be transmitted to the flexible exosuit and presented using actuators or other haptic feedback elements to the wearer to enable the wearer to experience force feedback or other haptic sensations related to the wearer s operation of the robotic system. In another example haptic data presented to a wearer could be generated by a virtual environment e.g. an environment containing an avatar of the wearer that is being operated based on motions or other data related to the wearer that is being detected by the flexible exosuit .

Note that multiple functions applications or other operations of the flexible exosuit as described herein or according to other applications may be executed simultaneously. For example a flexible exosuit could be operated to reduce fatigue of a wearer by supplementing the forces and or torques generated by muscles of the wearer. Sensors in the exosuit or other systems e.g. remote servers drones could provide an indication to the flexible exosuit while the flexible exosuit is being operated to reduce wearer fatigue that the ground in front of the wearer is unstable. The flexible exosuit could be responsively operated to increase the effective impedance of the ankles of the wearer to reduce the probability of the wearer experiencing an ankle sprain or strain due to locomoting on the unstable ground. Simultaneous operation could include linearly or nonlinearly summing actuator commands generated according to multiple applications e.g. fatigue reduction and injury prevention a first application blocking operation by a second application of certain actuators required by the first application during a period of time the first application is required to operate the certain actuators or other schemes of operation of an exosuit according to multiple applications simultaneously.

Note that the flexible exosuit illustrated in is only one example of a flexible exosuit that could be operated by control electronics software or algorithms described herein. Control electronics software or algorithms as described herein could be configured to control flexible exosuits or other mechatronic and or robotic system having more fewer or different actuators sensors or other elements. Further control electronics software or algorithms as described herein could be configured to control flexible exosuits configured similarly to or differently from the illustrated flexible exosuit . Further control electronics software or algorithms as described herein could be configured to control flexible exosuits having reconfigurable hardware i.e. exosuits that are able to have actuators sensors or other elements added or removed and or to detect a current hardware configuration of the flexible exosuits using a variety of methods.

A controller of a flexible exosuit and or computer readable programs executed by the controller could be configured to provide encapsulation of functions and or components of the flexible exosuit. That is some elements of the controller e.g. subroutines drivers services daemons functions could be configured to operate specific elements of the flexible exosuit e.g. a twisted string actuator a haptic feedback element and to allow other elements of the controller e.g. other programs to operate the specific elements and or to provide abstracted access to the specific elements e.g. to translate a command to orient an actuator in a commanded direction into a set of commands sufficient to orient the actuator in the commanded direction . This encapsulation could allow a variety of services drivers daemons or other computer readable programs to be developed for a variety of applications of a flexible exosuits. Further by providing encapsulation of functions of a flexible exosuit in a generic accessible manner e.g. by specifying and implementing an application programming interface API or other interface standard computer readable programs can be created to interface with the generic encapsulated functions such that the computer readable programs could enable operating modes or functions for a variety of differently configured flexible exosuits rather than for a single type or model of flexible exosuit. For example a virtual avatar communications program could access information about the posture of a wearer of a flexible exosuit by accessing a standard exosuit API. Differently configured exosuits could include different sensors actuators and other elements but could provide posture information in the same format according to the API. Other functions and features of a flexible exosuit or other robotic exoskeletal assistive haptic or other mechatronic system could be encapsulated by APIs or according to some other standardized computer access and control interface scheme.

The controller additionally operates a user interface that is configured to present information to a user and or wearer of the flexible exosuit and a communications interface that is configured to facilitate the transfer of information between the controller and some other system e.g. by transmitting a wireless signal . Additionally or alternatively the user interface could be part of a separate system that is configured to transmit and receive user interface information to from the controller using the communications interface e.g. the user interface could be part of a cellphone .

The controller is configured to execute computer readable programs describing functions of the flexible exosuit . Among the computer readable programs executed by the controller are an operating system applications and a calibration service . The operating system manages hardware resources of the controller e.g. I O ports registers timers interrupts peripherals memory management units serial and or parallel communications units and by extension manages the hardware resources of the flexible exosuit . The operating system is the only computer readable program executed by the controller that has direct access to the hardware interface electronics and by extension the actuators and sensors of the flexible exosuit .

The applications are computer readable programs that describe some function functions operating mode or operating modes of the flexible exosuit . For example application could describe a process for transmitting information about the wearer s posture to update a virtual avatar of the wearer that includes accessing information on a wearer s posture from the operating system maintaining communications with a remote system using the communications interface formatting the posture information and sending the posture information to the remote system. The calibration service is a computer readable program describing processes to store parameters describing properties of wearers actuators and or sensors of the flexible exosuit to update those parameters based on operation of the actuators and or sensors when a wearer is using the flexible exosuit to make the parameters available to the operating system and or applications and other functions relating to the parameters. Note that applications and calibration service are intended as examples of computer readable programs that could be run by the operating system of the controller to enable functions or operating modes of a flexible exosuit .

The operating system could provide for low level control and maintenance of the hardware e.g. . In some examples the operating system and or hardware interface electronics could detect information about the flexible exosuit the wearer and or the wearer s environment from one or more sensors at a constant specified rate. The operating system could generate an estimate of one or more states or properties of the flexible exosuit or components thereof using the detected information. The operating system could update the generated estimate at the same rate as the constant specified rate or at a lower rate. The generated estimate could be generated from the detected information using a filter to remove noise generate an estimate of an indirectly detected property or according to some other application. For example the operating system could generate the estimate from the detected information using a Kalman filter to remove noise and to generate an estimate of a single directly or indirectly measured property of the flexible exosuit the wearer and or the wearer s environment using more than one sensor. In some examples the operating system could determine information about the wearer and or flexible exosuit based on detected information from multiple points in time. For example the operating system could determine a gait phase e.g. stance swing heel strike toe off and or gait phase percent while the wearer is locomoting based on detected joint angles body segment locations actuator loads or other detected information from multiple past points in time.

In some examples the operating system and or hardware interface electronics could operate and or provide services related to operation of the actuators . That is in case where operation of the actuators requires the generation of control signals over a period of time knowledge about a state or states of the actuators or other considerations the operating system and or hardware interface electronics could translate simple commands to operate the actuators e.g. a command to generate a specified level of force using a twisted string actuator TSA of the actuators into the complex and or state based commands to the hardware interface electronics and or actuators necessary to effect the simple command e.g. a sequence of currents applied to windings of a motor of a TSA based on a starting position of a rotor determined and stored by the operating system a relative position of the motor detected using an encoder and a force generated by the TSA detected using a load cell .

In some examples the operating system could further encapsulate the operation of the flexible exosuit by translating a system level simple command e.g. a commanded level of torque applied to the knee of a wearer into commands for multiple actuators according to the configuration of the flexible exosuit e.g. command signals sufficient to cause a TSA and exotendons that cross the knee of the wearer to apply forces to the body of the wearer such that the commanded level of torque is applied to the knee of the wearer . This encapsulation could enable the creation of general purpose applications that can effect a function of an exosuit e.g. allowing a wearer of the exosuit to jump higher without being configured to operate a specific model or type of exosuit e.g. by being configured to generate a simple ankle torque profile that the operating system and hardware interface electronics could translate into actuator commands sufficient to cause the actuators to apply the commanded torque profile to the ankle .

The operating system could act as a standard multi purpose platform to enable the use of a variety of flexible exosuits having a variety of different hardware configurations to enable a variety of mechatronic biomedical human interface training rehabilitative communications and other applications. The operating system could make sensors actuators or other elements or functions of the flexible exosuit available to remote systems in communication with the flexible exosuit e.g. using the communications interface and or a variety of applications daemons services or other computer readable programs being executed by operating system . The operating system could make the actuators sensors or other elements or functions available in a standard way e.g. through an API communications protocol or other programmatic interface such that applications daemons services or other computer readable programs could be created to be installed on executed by and operated to enable functions or operating modes of a variety of flexible exosuits having a variety of different configurations. The API communications protocol or other programmatic interface made available by the operating system could encapsulate translate or otherwise abstract the operation of the flexible exosuit to enable the creation of such computer readable programs that are able to operate to enable functions of a wide variety of differently configured flexible exosuits.

Additionally or alternatively the operating system could be configured to operate a modular flexible exosuit system i.e. a flexible exosuit system wherein actuators sensors or other elements could be added or subtracted from a flexible exosuit to enable operating modes or functions of the flexible exosuit . In some examples the operating system could determine the hardware configuration of the flexible exosuit dynamically and could adjust the operation of the flexible exosuit relative to the determined current hardware configuration of the flexible exosuit . This operation could be performed in a way that was invisible to computer readable programs e.g. accessing the functionality of the flexible exosuit through a standardized programmatic interface presented by the operating system . For example the computer readable program could indicate to the operating system through the standardized programmatic interface that a specified level of torque was to be applied to an ankle of a wearer of the flexible exosuit . The operating system could responsively determine a pattern of operation of the actuators based on the determined hardware configuration of the flexible exosuit sufficient to apply the specified level of torque to the ankle of the wearer.

In some examples the operating system and or hardware interface electronics could operate the actuators to ensure that the flexible exosuit does not operate to directly cause the wearer to be injured and or elements of the flexible exosuit to be damaged. In some examples this could include not operating the actuators to apply forces and or torques to the body of the wearer that exceeded some maximum threshold. This could be implemented as a watchdog process or some other computer readable program that could be configured when executed by the controller to monitor the forces being applied by the actuators e.g. by monitoring commands sent to the actuators and or monitoring measurements of forces or other properties detected using the sensors and to disable and or change the operation of the actuators to prevent injury of the wearer. Additionally or alternatively the hardware interface electronics could be configured to include circuitry to prevent excessive forces and or torques from being applied to the wearer e.g. by channeling to a comparator the output of a load cell that is configured to measure the force generated by a TSA and configuring the comparator to cut the power to the motor of the TSA when the force exceeded a specified level .

In some examples operating the actuators to ensure that the flexible exosuit does not damage itself could include a watchdog process or circuitry configured to prevent over current over load over rotation or other conditions from occurring that could result in damage to elements of the flexible exosuit . For example the hardware interface electronics could include a metal oxide varistor breaker shunt diode or other element configured to limit the voltage and or current applied to a winding of a motor.

Note that the above functions described as being enabled by the operating system could additionally or alternatively be implemented by applications services drivers daemons or other computer readable programs executed by the controller . The applications drivers services daemons or other computer readable programs could have special security privileges or other properties to facilitate their use to enable the above functions.

The operating system could encapsulate the functions of the hardware interface electronics actuators and sensors for use by other computer readable programs e.g. applications calibration service by the user through the user interface and or by some other system i.e. a system configured to communicate with the controller through the communications interface . The encapsulation of functions of the flexible exosuit could take the form of application programming interfaces APIs i.e. sets of function calls and procedures that an application running on the controller could use to access the functionality of elements of the flexible exosuit . In some examples the operating system could make available a standard exosuit API to applications being executed by the controller . The exosuit API could enable applications to access functions of the exosuit without requiring those applications to be configured to generate whatever complex time dependent signals are necessary to operate elements of the flexible exosuit e.g. actuators sensors .

The exosuit API could allow applications to send simple commands to the operating system e.g. begin storing mechanical energy from the ankle of the wearer when the foot of the wearer contacts the ground in such that the operating system can interpret those commands and generate the command signals to the hardware interface electronics or other elements of the flexible exosuit that are sufficient to effect the simple commands generated by the applications e.g. determining whether the foot of the wearer has contacted the ground based on information detected by the sensors responsively applying high voltage to an exotendon that crosses the user s ankle .

The exosuit API could be an industry standard e.g. an ISO standard a proprietary standard an open source standard or otherwise made available to individuals that could then produce applications for exosuits. The exosuit API could allow applications drivers services daemons or other computer readable programs to be created that are able to operate a variety of different types and configurations of exosuits by being configured to interface with the standard exosuit API that is implemented by the variety of different types and configurations of exosuits. Additionally or alternatively the exosuit API could provide a standard encapsulation of individual exosuit specific actuators i.e. actuators that apply forces to specific body segments where differently configured exosuits may not include an actuator that applies forces to the same specific body segments and could provide a standard interface for accessing information on the configuration of whatever flexible exosuit is providing the exosuit API . An application or other program that accesses the exosuit API could access data about the configuration of the flexible exosuit e.g. locations and forces between body segments generated by actuators specifications of actuators locations and specifications of sensors and could generate simple commands for individual actuators e.g. generate a force of 30 newtons for 50 milliseconds based on a model of the flexible exosuit generated by the application and based on the information on the accessed data about the configuration of the flexible exosuit. Additional or alternate functionality could be encapsulated by an exosuit API according to an application.

Applications could individually enable all or parts of the functions and operating modes of a flexible exosuit described herein. For example an application could enable haptic control of a robotic system by transmitting postures forces torques and other information about the activity of a wearer of the flexible exosuit and by translating received forces and torques from the robotic system into haptic feedback applied to the wearer i.e. forces and torques applied to the body of the wearer by actuators and or haptic feedback elements . In another example an application could enable a wearer to locomote more efficiently by submitting commands to and receiving data from the operating system e.g. through an API such that actuators of the flexible exosuit assist the movement of the user extract negative work from phases of the wearer s locomotion and inject the stored work to other phases of the wearer s locomotion or other methods of operating the flexible exosuit . Applications could be installed on the controller and or on a computer readable storage medium included in the flexible exosuit by a variety of methods. Applications could be installed from a removable computer readable storage medium or from a system in communication with the controller through the communications interface . In some examples the applications could be installed from a web site a repository of compiled or un compiled programs on the Internet an online store e.g. Google Play iTunes App Store or some other source. Further functions of the applications could be contingent upon the controller being in continuous or periodic communication with a remote system e.g. to receive updates authenticate the application to provide information about current environmental conditions .

The flexible exosuit illustrated in is intended as an illustrative example. Other configurations of flexible exosuits and of operating systems kernels applications drivers services daemons or other computer readable programs are anticipated. For example an operating system configured to operate a flexible exosuit could include a real time operating system component configured to generate low level commands to operate elements of the flexible exosuit and a non real time component to enable less time sensitive functions like a clock on a user interface updating computer readable programs stored in the flexible exosuit or other functions. A flexible exosuit could include more than one controller further some of those controllers could be configured to execute real time applications operating systems drivers or other computer readable programs e.g. those controllers were configured to have very short interrupt servicing routines very fast thread switching or other properties and functions relating to latency sensitive computations while other controllers are configured to enable less time sensitive functions of a flexible exosuit. Additional configurations and operating modes of a flexible exosuit are anticipated. Further control systems configured as described herein could additionally or alternatively be configured to enable the operation of devices and systems other than flexible exosuits for example control systems as described herein could be configured to operate robots rigid exosuits or exoskeletons assistive devices prosthetics or other mechatronic devices.

Control of actuators of a flexible exosuit could be implemented in a variety of ways according to a variety of control schemes. Generally one or more hardware and or software controllers could receive information about the state of the flexible exosuit a wearer of the flexible exosuit and or the environment of the flexible exosuit from sensors disposed on or within the flexible exosuit and or a remote system in communication with the flexible exosuit. The one or more hardware and or software controllers could then generate a control output that could be executed by actuators of the flexible exosuit to effect a commanded state of the flexible exosuits and or to enable some other application. One or more software controllers could be implemented as part of an operating system kernel driver application service daemon or other computer readable program executed by a processor included in the flexible exosuit.

Determining an output based on the detected state using a controller could include performing calculations on the detected state calibration information information about past detected states controller parameters or other information to determine one or more output commands. The calculations could implement one of a variety of different controllers according to an application. The controllers could include state machines feedback loops feed forward controllers look up tables LUTs proportional integral derivative PID controllers parametric controllers model based controllers inverse kinematic model based controllers state space controllers bang bang controllers linear quadratic Gaussian LQG controllers other controllers and or combinations of controllers. Parameters topologies or other aspects of configuration of a controller could be optimized trained or otherwise validated in simulation before being used to control a flexible exosuit. Parameters of the controller and or of simulations used to validate the controller could be related to calibration parameters or other data related to a model or type of flexible exosuit an individual flexible exosuit an individual wearer of a flexible exosuit or an environment in which a flexible exosuit could be operated. The controllers could be configured to improve adapt or otherwise reconfigure to improve performance according to some metric. Such improvement adaptations or reconfiguration could be related to detected or specified changes in properties of the flexible exosuit and or the wearer patterns of usage of the flexible exosuit by the wearer gait patterns or other patterns of physical activity or motion engaged in by the wearer or other information.

Operating the flexible exosuit according to the determined output could include operating twisted string actuators TSAs exotendons electropolymer artificial muscle EPAM actuators or other mechatronic elements to apply forces and or torques to elements of the flexible exosuit the body of the wearer and or the environment of the flexible exosuit. For example the determined output could specify that a TSA shorten at a specified rate and operating the flexible exosuit according to the determined output could include applying voltages and or currents to windings of a motor of the TSA detecting a rate and or angle of rotation of the motor or other processes such that the TSA shortened at the specified rate. In another example the determined output could specify that a level of torque be applied to a joint of the wearer and operating the flexible exosuit according to the determined output could include operating one or more actuators of the flexible exosuit to apply the specified level of torque to the joint of the wearer. Further the translation between the determined outputs and signals to actuate elements of the flexible exosuit could be based on calibration data about the actuated elements and or other aspects or elements of the flexible exosuit. For example operating a TSA to shorten at a specified rate could include determining a rate of rotation to rotate a motor of the TSA based on calibration data that includes a transmission ratio of the TSA. Other scenarios and processes as described elsewhere herein are anticipated.

A model based controller is a controller having a structure organization or other features based on or inspired by a mechanical or other model of a system to be controlled by the controller. For example a model based controller of an inverted pendulum could be created based on inverting or otherwise manipulating a model of the response of the inverted pendulum i.e. the evolution of the states of the inverted pendulum to control inputs such that the inverted or otherwise transformed model generated outputs to control the inverted pendulum e.g. base forces to follow a commanded state of the inverted pendulum based on detected states of the inverted pendulum. In some examples a model based controller includes a model of a system to be controlled and applies potential and or current control outputs to the model of the system to predict the output of the system in response to the control outputs to generate an error signal or to enable some other application. In some examples a model based controller can be a more generic type of controller e.g. PID controller state space controller bang bang controller linear quadratic Gaussian LQG controller that has parameters trained or otherwise optimized according to some cost function or constraint using a simulation of the system represented by the model.

The use of a model based controller could allow control of the flexible exosuit to be adapted to different wearers environments and conditions without a training period. That is model parameters could be updated based on detected changes in properties of the flexible exosuit the wearer and or the environment that correspond to the model parameter. For example a single model and or model based controller could be created to control flexible exosuits having a specific configuration e.g. that were configured to include actuators i.e. TSAs exotendons corresponding to the simulated actuators of the Endo Herr model i.e. force transducers clutched compliance elements . Specific parameters of the model based controller could correspond to properties of the wearer and or elements of the flexible exosuit. For example the weight of body segments of the wearer the compliance of an exotendon in the clutched state the force length characteristics of an individual TSA or other properties could correspond to parameters of a model based controller. Additionally or alternatively different operating modes of the flexible exosuit and corresponding applications services or other computer readable programs could correspond to different wearers environments and conditions. For example a first wearer could operate a flexible exosuit using a first configuration service i.e. a service that updates controllers applications drivers configuration parameters operating modes applications or other information relative to information about the first wearer and a second wearer could operate the flexible exosuit using a second configuration service. In some examples updates to change model parameters could indicate a qualitative change in a state of the flexible exosuit and or of the wearer. In some examples the indicated qualitative change could be an indication that an element of the flexible exosuit was in need of replacement and or likely to fail. For example updating model parameters corresponding to a TSA could indicate that the twisted string of the TSA was significantly fatigued and was likely to break and or was likely to cause the TSA to operate in a sub optimal manner. This indication could be conveyed to the wearer through a user interface of the flexible exosuit. Additionally or alternatively the indication could be conveyed to a remote system or person e.g. a repair technician a health technician a parts manager . In some examples the indicated qualitative change could be an indication that the wearer has become significantly physically and or mentally fatigued. This indication could be conveyed to the wearer through a user interface of the flexible exosuit. Additionally or alternatively the indication could cause the flexible exosuit to change its operation by increasing a degree or percent to which the flexible exosuit augments the activity of the wearer and or inhibits potentially injurious actions or motions of the wearer.

In some examples the use of a model based controller could enable control of a flexible exosuit based on continuously changing properties of the flexible exosuit. That is the control of the exosuit could continuously adapt to changes in properties of elements of the flexible exosuit e.g. force length torque properties of TSAs the compliance of exotendons as the humidity of the environment of the flexible exosuit changes . Sensors in the flexible exosuit could generate measurements sufficient to update calibration parameters of elements of the flexible exosuits e.g. force length torque properties of TSAs the compliance of exotendons over time. This calibration process could be performed periodically by a computer readable program being executed by a controller of the flexible exosuit e.g. calibration service during operation of the flexible exosuit to effect operating modes and or during operations of the flexible exosuit directed specifically toward determining calibration parameters. Additionally or alternatively individual elements of a flexible exosuit could be replaceable and calibration parameters corresponding to a replacement element could replace calibration parameters stored for an element that is replaced by the replacement element such that the flexible exosuit has stored updated calibration parameters about the properties of the elements of the flexible exosuit. The calibration parameters could correspond to parameters of a model based controller and calibration parameters corresponding to the current state of the flexible exosuit generated e.g. by a calibration process and or by replacing calibration parameters corresponding to a replaced element with parameters corresponding to a replacement element .

Calibration parameters could additionally describe properties of the wearer of the flexible exosuit and or of loads or other objects carried by the wearer and or by the flexible exosuit. For example a parameter of a model based controller could correspond to the mass of the wearer above the wearer s hips i.e. the mass of the wearer s torso head and arms and of any loads carried by or attached to those segments of the wearer s body . Sensors and or actuators of the flexible exosuit could be operated to continuously or periodically estimate the mass of the wearer above the wearer s hips. The parameter of the model based controller corresponding to that mass could be updated based on the estimated mass of the wearer above the wearer s hips such that after updating the mass parameter of the model based controller control outputs determined by the controller take into account the current mass of the wearer above the wearer s hips corresponding to the updated mass parameter. For example determined output forces applied by actuators to the body of the wearer could be increased to compensate for an increase in mass of the wearer above the wearer s hips.

Calibration parameters could be uploaded to a remote system in communication with the flexible exosuit. Additionally or alternatively calibration parameters could be downloaded from a remote system in communication with the flexible exosuit. Sets of calibration parameters could be associated with specific flexible exosuits wearers elements of flexible exosuits or combinations thereof. Calibration parameters associated with a specific wearer and or a flexible exosuit used by a specific wearer could be associated with a username password or other credentials to allow the specific wearer to access the stored calibration parameters over a communications network e.g. the Internet . Accessing calibration parameters of the specific wearer in this way could enable the specific wearer to use multiple flexible exosuits while maintaining easy access to calibration parameters describing physical properties of the specific wearer controllers and or controller parameters used by the specific wearer applications and or application data used by the specific wearer and or usage gait or other patterns related to the specific wearer and or the specific wearer s operation of flexible exosuits. The username password and or other credentials could secure calibration parameters or other information about a wearer from being accessed by people or systems that are not the wearer. Additionally or alternatively a flexible exosuit worn by the wearer could transmit some information about the wearer e.g. a gait pattern a gesture made by the wearer and the information could be used as a credential e.g. as a biometric identifier .

Determining an output based on the detected state using a reference function includes performing some calculation on the detected state where the calculation results in the generation of a determined output. In some examples determining an output based on the detected state using a reference function could include transforming the detected state. In some examples transforming the detected state could include selecting certain elements of the detected state and discarding other elements. For example the reference function could be a function of a detected ankle angle of a wearer and information in the detected state e.g. angles of other joints body segment velocities joint torques that are not ankle angles could be discarded. In some examples transforming the detected state could include scaling shifting inverting or quantizing one or more variables of the detected state. In some examples transforming the detected state could include reducing the dimensionality of the detected state this is translating a first number of variables of the detected state into a second number of variables that is less than the first number. For example variables of the detected state could be subjected to principal component analysis independent component analysis factor analysis varimax rotation non negative matrix factorization isomap or some other dimensionality reduction process. In some examples transforming the detected state could include filtering the detected state e.g. by using a Kalman filter a Wiener filter or some other linear or nonlinear filter . In some examples transforming the detected state could include applying the detected state to a classifier. For example one or more variables of the detected state could be applied to a support vector machine a k nearest neighbors classifier or some other classifier of pattern matching algorithm to transform the one or more variables of the detected state into one of a finite number of output classes.

In some examples transforming the detected state could include using the detected state to determine gait information. For example the detected state could be used to determine a gait cycle percent i.e. how far as a percent ratio or fraction through a locomotor cycle a wearer of the flexible exosuit is at a current point in time or a gait phase e.g. stance swing heel strike toe off . The gait cycle percent and or phase could be determined based on detected joint angles and or joint torques of the wearer. For example measured joint angles of the detected state could be compared to patterns of recorded joint angles simulated joint angles recorded joint torques and or simulated joint torques . Recorded and or simulation patterns against which the detected state is compared to determine the gait cycle percent and or phase could be related a specific wearer of the flexible exosuit or could be related to a population of wearers or other humans e.g. the patterns could be mean patterns generated from data recorded from a population of humans .

In some examples determining an output based on the detected state using a reference function could include applying the determined state and or a transformed version of the determined state to a smooth reference function and calculating the output of the smooth reference function to determine the output. The smooth reference function could be univariate bivariate or multivariate and could have one or more outputs corresponding to one or more determined outputs based on the detected state. The smooth reference function could be a polynomial a rational function an exponential function a sinusoid some other smooth function or a combination of the above. The shape and or parameters could be based on a model of some element or function of a flexible exosuit. For example the smooth reference function could be selected to approximate a force profile produced by a force transducer that is simulated as part of the Endo Herr model to produce stable simulated locomotion. The shape and or parameters could be based on recorded data from a wearer of the flexible exosuit and or a population of wearers of flexible exosuits and or other humans.

In some examples determining an output based on the detected state using a reference function could include applying a transformation to the detected state to generate a one or more discrete input variables and generating the output based on the contents of a cell of a look up table corresponding to the one or more discrete input variables. For example the detected state could be transformed to one of four possible gait phases e.g. heel strike stance toe off or swing and each of four possible gait phases could have a corresponding set of outputs e.g. each gait phase could have a respective set of exotendons to clutch . The look up table could have one two or more discrete input variables and could specify the state of one or more outputs for each combination of values of the one or more discrete input variables. One or more of the discrete input variables could be discretized and or quantized continuous variables of the detected state for example one of the input variables could be a joint ankle discretized into 50 bins such that the input variable has fifty different discrete states and the discrete states can be ordered according to the relative magnitude of the angles corresponding to the discrete states. The output values corresponding to the cells of the look up table could be based on a model of some element or function of a flexible exosuit. The contents and organization of the cells of the look up table and the transformation used to determine which cell of the look up table to access for a given detected state could be based on recorded data from a wearer of the flexible exosuit and or a population of wearers of flexible exosuits and or other humans.

One or more properties of the reference function could be based on a model of the flexible exosuit elements of the flexible exosuit and or a wearer of the flexible exosuit. In some examples the reference function could be a pattern of activation of some element of the flexible exosuit that has been generated using a model to increase the efficiency of locomotion of the wearer to decrease a probability of injury of the wearer or to maximize minimize and or satisfy some constraint. For example the reference function could be a pattern of exotendon clutching as a function of gait cycle percent e.g. . In some examples generating the reference function from the model could be computationally expensive. For example generating the reference function could require gradient descent a genetic algorithm and or the computation of one or more simulations of the model. In such examples the reference function could be generated using the model at a low rate related to the computational cost of generating the reference function. Additionally or alternatively the reference function could be re calculated only when determined manually input or otherwise specified parameters of the model change.

In an example determining an output based on the detected state using a reference function includes determining a gait cycle percent based on detected joint angles of the wearer and actuating exotendons of a flexible exosuit according to a pattern of activation of clutched compliance elements generated using the Endo Herr model e.g. . In another example determining an output based on the detected state using a reference function includes operating joint related state machine controllers that have state transitions related to gait phases e.g. toe off heel strike foot flat and that actuate exotendons and operate TSA controllers and that are configured similarly to .

Operating the flexible exosuit according to the determined output could include operating twisted string actuators TSAs exotendons electropolymer artificial muscle EPAM actuators or other mechatronic elements to apply forces and or torques to elements of the flexible exosuit the body of the wearer and or the environment of the flexible exosuit. For example the determined output could specify that a TSA shorten at a specified rate and operating the flexible exosuit according to the determined output could include applying voltages and or currents to windings of a motor of the TSA detecting a rate and or angle of rotation of the motor or other processes such that the TSA shortened at the specified rate. In another example the determined output could specify that a level of torque be applied to a joint of the wearer and operating the flexible exosuit according to the determined output could include operating one or more actuators of the flexible exosuit to apply the specified level of torque to the joint of the wearer. Further the translation between the determined outputs and signals to actuate elements of the flexible exosuit could be based on calibration data about the actuated elements and or other aspects or elements of the flexible exosuit. For example operating a TSA to shorten at a specified rate could include determining a rate of rotation to rotate a motor of the TSA based on calibration data that includes a transmission ratio of the TSA. Other scenarios and processes as described elsewhere herein are anticipated.

Multiple controllers and or reference functions could be used to determine output s based on detected states of an exosuit. For example a first controller could be used to determine outputs during a first period of time and a second controller could be used to determine outputs during a second period of time. Additionally or alternatively a first controller could be used to determine outputs corresponding to a first set of actuators joints or other elements of a flexible exosuit and or a wearer thereof and a second controller could be used to determine outputs corresponding to a second set of actuators joints or other elements of a flexible exosuit and or a wearer thereof that is disjoint from the first set. Further one or more controllers classifiers or other algorithms could be used to determine which controllers of a set of controllers should be used to generate output s and or how to combine the generated output s from the set of controllers to generate a final combined output s that could be used to operate elements of the flexible exosuit.

In some examples generating a final combined output s could include generating a linear combination of outputs generated by a set of controllers. For example a first controller could be configured to generate output s to reduce fatigue of a wearer by supplementing the forces and or torques generated by muscles of the wearer. A second controller could be configured to generate outputs s to increase the effective impedance of the ankles in response to a determination based on the detected state that the ground in front of the wearer is unstable. Combining the generated output s of the two controllers could include linearly or nonlinearly summing actuator commands of the generated output s . Additionally or alternatively the generated output s from the second controller could supersede the generated output s from the first controller due to the second controller having a higher priority than the first controller. Priority could be assigned to controllers according to an application e.g. controllers that generate outputs s relating to injury prevention could have higher priority than other controllers and or priority could be context dependent i.e. dependent on a detected state of the flexible exosuit the wearer and or the environment of the flexible exosuit .

In some examples generated output s could be modulated by one or more state variables of the flexible exosuit. For example when a power source of the flexible exosuit is nearly depleted forces and or torques generated by the flexible exosuit could be reduced by some fraction related to the battery discharge level. In some examples a fatigue level of the wearer could be detected and forces and or torques generated by the flexible exosuit could be related to the detected fatigue level. For example the forces and or torques could be increased when the wearer is fatigued to assist the wearer to allow the wearer to recover from the fatigue while still engaging in physical activity and or to reduce the probability of the wearer experiencing fatigue related injuries. Additionally or alternatively the modulation of the forces and or torques relative to the detected fatigue of the wearer could be implemented according to some other scheme for example a pattern configured to maximize the distance a wearer could march by dosing the fatigue that the wearer accrued over time. In some examples the forces and or torques applied to the wearer by the flexible exosuit could be modulated according to a setting specified by the wearer. For example a user interface could allow the wearer to select a level of assistance and or augmentation that the flexible exosuit could apply to the wearer s body according to the comfort of the wearer.

Controllers models transformations filters reference functions and other elements and processes described above could be implemented as computer readable programs. The computer readable programs could be part of an operating system of a flexible exosuit e.g. or could be implemented as applications e.g. being executed by a flexible exosuit and operating in conjunction with an operating system. Applications services daemons or other computer readable programs could access functions of the flexible exosuit through APIs provided by an operating system. Additionally or alternatively applications services daemons or other computer readable programs could provide functionality to other computer readable programs by providing additional APIs or other mechanisms configured to enable access to functions of the applications services daemons or other computer readable programs by other computer readable programs.

The operation of a flexible exosuit could be related to information input by a user and or wearer of the flexible exosuit by interacting with a user interface. The user interface could be incorporated into the flexible exosuit e.g. a touchscreen removably or non removably disposed in a sleeve of the flexible exosuit or could be part of a separate device e.g. a tablet . Additionally or alternatively some or all of the user interface of a flexible exosuit could be implemented on some other device e.g. a laptop computer or a cellphone. Interactions of a wearer with a user interface could alter settings or parameters of the flexible exosuit cause the flexible exosuit to change operational modes result in the addition subtraction or reconfiguration of applications installed on the flexible exosuit or enable other functions or operating modes of the flexible exosuit.

The parameter setting interface provides a mechanism for the wearer to manually set one or more parameters related to the operation of the flexible exosuit. In the example of the parameter setting interface is displaying a pattern of actuator force versus gait cycle percent. The parameter setting interface is additionally displaying a slider configured to be operated by the wearer to change the magnitude of the actuator force . The wearer could drag the slider to a level corresponding to a level of actuator force that is comfortable to the wearer. Additionally or alternatively the wearer could use the slider to select a level of force according to some other consideration or combination of considerations for example the wearer could reduce the level of actuator force to conserve energy in the battery of the flexible exosuit.

The parameter setting interface provides a mechanism for the wearer to manually set one or more parameters related to the operation of the flexible exosuit. In the example of the parameter setting interface is presenting the wearer with interface elements that the wearer could operate to set the extent of operation of actuators of the flexible exosuit operating across the right and left ankles of the wearer. A first slider could be operated by the wearer to set a maximum stroke length of the right ankle actuator i.e. to set a maximum amount of dorsiflexion of the right ankle that the right ankle actuator will allow to occur . A second slider could be operated by the wearer to set a minimum stroke length of the right ankle actuator i.e. to set a maximum amount of plantarflexion of the right ankle that the right ankle actuator can impose on the right ankle A third slider could be operated by the wearer to set a maximum stroke length of the left ankle actuator i.e. to set a maximum amount of dorsiflexion of the left ankle that the left ankle actuator will allow to occur . A fourth slider could be operated by the wearer to set a minimum stroke length of the left ankle actuator i.e. to set a maximum amount of plantarflexion of the left ankle that the left ankle actuator can impose on the right ankle . The wearer could drag one or more of the sliders to levels that corresponded to ankle actuator operation that is comfortable to the wearer. For example the wearer could be recovering from an injury to their right ankle. The wearer could set the second slider to a level lower than the fourth slider to reflect the fact that the wearer s right ankle is more sensitive and or has a smaller range of motion than the wearer s left ankle due to the injury.

A parameter setting interface could be configured to present additional or alternate settings parameters controls or other user interface elements to the wearer. For example the parameter setting interface could present the user with a variety of controllers and or applications that could be executed to operate the flexible exosuit to enable operating modes of the suit e.g. increasing the efficiency of locomotion of the wearer enhancing the strength of the wearer allowing the wearer to jump higher or other functions. Further the parameter setting interface could provide user settable parameters respective to controllers and or applications executed by the flexible exosuit. For example the parameter setting interface could allow the wearer to set a magnitude of a force applied to the wearer s ankles to assist the wearer to jump. The wearer could set such a setting according to the distance the wearer intended to jump the mass of a load carried by the wearer or some other consideration. Other parameters and configurations of parameter setting interfaces are anticipated.

A status variable display of a user interface could indicate additional or alternate information to the heart rate and battery status illustrated in the examples of . For example the metabolic rate of the wearer the distance a wearer has traveled since some waypoint the distance a wearer has yet to travel to a destination an operating mode of the flexible exosuits or some other information could be presented to the wearer by the status variable display . In some examples the information displayed by the status variable display and other properties of the status variable display could be controlled by the wearer. For example the wearer could choose through some element of the user interface not shown what information is displayed by the status variable display . Additionally or alternatively the information indicated by the status variable display could be related to the current operation and or status of the flexible exosuit the wearer and or the environment of the wearer. For example if the user has operated the flexible exosuit to assist the user to jump the status variable display could display a countdown to the time when the flexible exosuit will apply the forces and or torques necessary to assist the wearer to jump. In some examples pressing information indicated by the status variable display could cause a window or application to be opened related to the indicated information that was pressed. For example if a wearer pressed an indication of the wearer s heart rate a window illustrating the wearer s ECG and other health and or physiological information about the wearer could be displayed. Other information displayed by the status variable display and methods of wearer interaction with the status variable display are anticipated.

An informational schematic of a user interface could indicate a variety of information to a wearer about a flexible exosuit and could be configured to operate according to a variety of applications. In some examples a shape color size animation or other information about elements of the informational schematic could indicate a variety of information about corresponding elements of the flexible exosuit. In some examples the informational schematic could be operated to indicate that elements of the flexible exosuit are being used are in need of calibration are damaged are in need of replacement or other information. In some examples the schematic representing the flexible exosuit in the informational schematic could be animated and the animation could indicate an operational mode of the flexible exosuit. Additionally or alternatively the schematic representing the flexible exosuit could be animated to mirror the motions and or configuration of the flexible exosuit and or the wearer. In some examples the wearer could press elements of the informational schematic to access more information and or parameter settings controls or applications related to the elements of the informational schematic pressed by the wearer. For example pressing an element on the informational schematic corresponding to ankle actuators could cause the parameter setting interface shown in to be displayed. For example pressing an element on the informational schematic corresponding to a sensor could cause an indication of current and or past measurements made using the sensor to be displayed. Other information displayed by the informational schematic and methods of wearer interaction with the informational schematic are anticipated.

A user interface of a flexible exosuit could be configured to provide additional information and or functionality. In some examples the user interface could enable a wearer or some other person or system to log or record one or more measurements related to the flexible exosuit the wearer the environment of the flexible exosuit the interaction between the wearer and the flexible exosuit or some other information related to the flexible exosuit. The user interface could allow the wearer to view the recorded information and or to perform analyses on the recorded information. For example the wearer could operate the user interface to record information about the wearer s gait while running and could use the user interface to perform analyses on the wearer s gait to improve the wearer s running technique. The wearer could also use the user interface to make recorded information available to other persons or systems. For example the wearer could make recorded information available to a teacher coach physician or other individual.

In some examples a wearer could operate the user interface to access previously recorded information about the flexible exosuit the wearer the environment of the flexible exosuit and or the interaction between the wearer and the flexible exosuit and to use to previously recorded information to affect the operation of the flexible exosuit. For example the accessed data could be used as a baseline of comparison to enable the wearer to compare the wearer s current performance of a task to the wearer s past performance of the task represented by the accessed data. That is the wearer could perform analyses to compare the wearer s progress at learning a task and or to determine a change in the wearer s physical abilities. In another example the flexible exosuit could be operated to guide the wearer in re enacting the activity or motions represented by the accessed data.

In some examples previously recorded data could be used to update parameters or other configuration data of applications controllers other services drivers daemons or other computer readable programs used to operate the flexible exosuit. For example the parameters or other configuration data could be updated to reflect a specific wearer s pattern of walking and the updated the parameters or other configuration data could be used by the computer readable programs to change a timing of actuation of elements of the flexible exosuit to more accurately reflect the timing of a user s motion during walking. In some examples previously recorded data could be associated with the wearer becoming fatigued and the flexible exosuit could be operated to detect that the wearer is becoming fatigued by detecting that a current property of the actions of the wearer is similar to actions of the wearer represented in the previously recorded data that are associated with the wearer becoming fatigued. The operation of the flexible exosuit could be changed in response to such a determination for example the magnitude to which the flexible exosuit operated actuators of the flexible exosuit to assists actions of the wearer could be increased and or the flexible exosuit could indicate that the wearer was becoming fatigued to the wearer or to a remote person or system in communication with the flexible exosuit. Other applications of previously recorded information about the flexible exosuit the wearer the environment of the flexible exosuit and or the interaction between the wearer and the flexible exosuit to operate a flexible exosuit and or to effect other operating modes of the flexible exosuit are anticipated.

In some examples a wearer could operate the user interface to provide recorded information about the flexible exosuit the wearer the environment of the flexible exosuit and or the interaction between the wearer and the flexible exosuit and to use to previously recorded information to a remote system e.g. a server . The remote system could receive such recorded information from a plurality of wearers of flexible exosuit and could generate a reference data set from the received recorded information. The remote system could perform analyses or other computations on the reference data set. Results of the performed analyses or other computations on the reference data set could be provided to individual flexible exosuits to improve the operation of the individual flexible exosuits e.g. to update parameters or other configuration data of applications controllers other services drivers daemons or other computer readable programs used to operate the individual flexible exosuits . For example the remote server could determine that an individual wearer was performing a task better than the performance of the task represented by the current reference data set and the remote server could responsively update the reference data set to reflect the data received from the flexible exosuit worn by the individual wearer. Other applications and operations of remote systems in communication with a plurality of flexible exosuits are anticipated. A user interface of a flexible exosuit could be configured to provide additional information and or functionality. In some examples the user interface could present the wearer with a home screen. The home screen could display a variety of applications operating modes functions and settings of the flexible exosuit as icons that the wearer could press. Pressing an icon could cause an application program or other function to be executed. For example pressing a button for a jump application could cause the jump application to begin execution and the jump application could operate elements of the flexible exosuit to assist the wearer in jumping. The jump application could additionally present an interface to the wearer that could include methods for controlling aspects of the jump application for example jump timing jump height jump power jump symmetry or other methods of controlling the jump application. The home screen could additionally provide methods for the wearer to stop applications that are running determine whether and which applications are running or other functions. Other applications methods of interacting with and or presenting a home screen to a wearer menus accessible from a home screen or by some other method methods of interaction between an application of a flexible exosuit and a wearer and other configurations and applications of a user interface of a flexible exosuit are anticipated.

A user interface of a flexible exosuit could additionally provide methods for a wearer to browse applications for the flexible exosuit purchase exosuit applications download exosuit applications install exosuit applications configure exosuit applications uninstall exosuit applications or other functions related to applications configured to be executed by a flexible exosuit. The user interface could allow a wearer to access a profile or account related to the wearer and to the purchasing installing updating and personalization of exosuit applications. Other applications methods of interacting with and or presenting a user interface to a wearer methods of interaction between a user interface of a flexible exosuit and a wearer and other configurations and applications of a user interface of a flexible exosuit are anticipated.
