This invention relates generally to the field of computer processors. More particularly the invention relates to an apparatus and method for dynamic polygon or primitive sorting for improved culling.

Prefix Sum or Cumulative Sum of a sequence of numbers x0 x1 x2 etc. is a second sequence of numbers y0 y1 y2 etc. An example of this is defined in the table illustrated in . Prefix Sums have many applications including parallel quicksort and line drawing. A current use case crops up in the atomic instruction support. While some current graphics processing architectures provide instructions to perform atomic operations they do so inefficiently e.g. 64 atomics cycle . The problem becomes more aggravated when atomic operations are directed to the same memory location where there is contention among single instruction multiple data SIMD lanes to write to the same location essentially serializing the atomic access.

A compiler optimization may be applied when the destination address is uniform i.e. all the SIMD lanes write to the same address . This optimization is referred to as scalar atomics which attempt to perform two basic operations 1 accumulate and 2 broadcast the result of accumulation to the active lanes. Emulating this behavior efficiently in software is extremely important for the performance of certain applications. Naive solutions have proved to be detrimental as performance drops of up to 25 have been observed compared with performing the atomic operation itself due to the inefficiencies in the algorithm when all SIMD lanes are active. These inefficiencies are addressed by the embodiments of the invention described below.

In some embodiments thread execution logic includes a pixel shader a thread dispatcher instruction cache a scalable execution unit array including a plurality of execution units A N a sampler a data cache and a data port . In one embodiment the included components are interconnected via an interconnect fabric that links to each of the components. In some embodiments thread execution logic includes one or more connections to memory such as system memory or cache memory through one or more of instruction cache data port sampler and execution unit array A N. In some embodiments each execution unit e.g. A is an individual vector processor capable of executing multiple simultaneous threads and processing multiple data elements in parallel for each thread. In some embodiments execution unit array A N includes any number individual execution units.

In some embodiments execution unit array A N is primarily used to execute shader programs. In some embodiments the execution units in array A N execute an instruction set that includes native support for many standard 3D graphics shader instructions such that shader programs from graphics libraries e.g. Direct 3D and OpenGL are executed with a minimal translation. The execution units support vertex and geometry processing e.g. vertex programs geometry programs vertex shaders pixel processing e.g. pixel shaders fragment shaders and general purpose processing e.g. compute and media shaders .

Each execution unit in execution unit array A N operates on arrays of data elements. The number of data elements is the execution size or the number of channels for the instruction. An execution channel is a logical unit of execution for data element access masking and flow control within instructions. The number of channels may be independent of the number of physical Arithmetic Logic Units ALUs or Floating Point Units FPUs for a particular graphics processor. In some embodiments execution units A N support integer and floating point data types.

The execution unit instruction set includes single instruction multiple data SIMD instructions. The various data elements can be stored as a packed data type in a register and the execution unit will process the various elements based on the data size of the elements. For example when operating on a 256 bit wide vector the 256 bits of the vector are stored in a register and the execution unit operates on the vector as four separate 64 bit packed data elements Quad Word QW size data elements eight separate 32 bit packed data elements Double Word DW size data elements sixteen separate 16 bit packed data elements Word W size data elements or thirty two separate 8 bit data elements byte B size data elements . However different vector widths and register sizes are possible.

One or more internal instruction caches e.g. are included in the thread execution logic to cache thread instructions for the execution units. In some embodiments one or more data caches e.g. are included to cache thread data during thread execution. In some embodiments sampler is included to provide texture sampling for 3D operations and media sampling for media operations. In some embodiments sampler includes specialized texture or media sampling functionality to process texture or media data during the sampling process before providing the sampled data to an execution unit.

During execution the graphics and media pipelines send thread initiation requests to thread execution logic via thread spawning and dispatch logic. In some embodiments thread execution logic includes a local thread dispatcher that arbitrates thread initiation requests from the graphics and media pipelines and instantiates the requested threads on one or more execution units A N. For example the geometry pipeline e.g. of dispatches vertex processing tessellation or geometry processing threads to thread execution logic . In some embodiments thread dispatcher can also process runtime thread spawning requests from the executing shader programs.

Once a group of geometric objects has been processed and rasterized into pixel data pixel shader is invoked to further compute output information and cause results to be written to output surfaces e.g. color buffers depth buffers stencil buffers etc. . In some embodiments pixel shader calculates the values of the various vertex attributes that are to be interpolated across the rasterized object. In some embodiments pixel shader then executes an application programming interface API supplied pixel shader program. To execute the pixel shader program pixel shader dispatches threads to an execution unit e.g. A via thread dispatcher . In some embodiments pixel shader uses texture sampling logic in sampler to access texture data in texture maps stored in memory. Arithmetic operations on the texture data and the input geometry data compute pixel color data for each geometric fragment or discards one or more pixels from further processing.

In some embodiments the data port provides a memory access mechanism for the thread execution logic output processed data to memory for processing on a graphics processor output pipeline. In some embodiments the data port includes or couples to one or more cache memories e.g. data cache to cache data for memory access via the data port.

In some embodiments the graphics processor execution units natively support instructions in a 128 bit format . A 64 bit compacted instruction format is available for some instructions based on the selected instruction instruction options and number of operands. The native 128 bit format provides access to all instruction options while some options and operations are restricted in the 64 bit format . The native instructions available in the 64 bit format vary by embodiment. In some embodiments the instruction is compacted in part using a set of index values in an index field . The execution unit hardware references a set of compaction tables based on the index values and uses the compaction table outputs to reconstruct a native instruction in the 128 bit format .

For each format instruction opcode defines the operation that the execution unit is to perform. The execution units execute each instruction in parallel across the multiple data elements of each operand. For example in response to an add instruction the execution unit performs a simultaneous add operation across each color channel representing a texture element or picture element. By default the execution unit performs each instruction across all data channels of the operands. In some embodiments instruction control field enables control over certain execution options such as channels selection e.g. predication and data channel order e.g. swizzle . For 128 bit instructions an exec size field limits the number of data channels that will be executed in parallel. In some embodiments exec size field is not available for use in the 64 bit compact instruction format .

Some execution unit instructions have up to three operands including two source operands src0 src1 and one destination . In some embodiments the execution units support dual destination instructions where one of the destinations is implied. Data manipulation instructions can have a third source operand e.g. SRC2 where the instruction opcode determines the number of source operands. An instruction s last source operand can be an immediate e.g. hard coded value passed with the instruction.

In some embodiments the 128 bit instruction format includes an access address mode information specifying for example whether direct register addressing mode or indirect register addressing mode is used. When direct register addressing mode is used the register address of one or more operands is directly provided by bits in the instruction .

In some embodiments the 128 bit instruction format includes an access address mode field which specifies an address mode and or an access mode for the instruction. In one embodiment the access mode to define a data access alignment for the instruction. Some embodiments support access modes including a 16 byte aligned access mode and a 1 byte aligned access mode where the byte alignment of the access mode determines the access alignment of the instruction operands. For example when in a first mode the instruction may use byte aligned addressing for source and destination operands and when in a second mode the instruction may use 16 byte aligned addressing for all source and destination operands.

In one embodiment the address mode portion of the access address mode field determines whether the instruction is to use direct or indirect addressing. When direct register addressing mode is used bits in the instruction directly provide the register address of one or more operands. When indirect register addressing mode is used the register address of one or more operands may be computed based on an address register value and an address immediate field in the instruction.

In some embodiments instructions are grouped based on opcode bit fields to simplify Opcode decode . For an 8 bit opcode bits and allow the execution unit to determine the type of opcode. The precise opcode grouping shown is merely an example. In some embodiments a move and logic opcode group includes data movement and logic instructions e.g. move mov compare cmp . In some embodiments move and logic group shares the five most significant bits MSB where move mov instructions are in the form of 0000xxxxb and logic instructions are in the form of 0001xxxxb. A flow control instruction group e.g. call jump jmp includes instructions in the form of 0010xxxxb e.g. 0x20 . A miscellaneous instruction group includes a mix of instructions including synchronization instructions e.g. wait send in the form of 0011xxxxb e.g. 0x30 .

Commands from ring interconnect are interpreted by a command streamer which supplies instructions to individual components of graphics pipeline or media pipeline .

In some embodiments command streamer directs the operation of a vertex fetcher that reads vertex data from memory and executes vertex processing commands provided by command streamer . In some embodiments vertex fetcher provides vertex data to a vertex shader which performs coordinate space transformation and lighting operations to each vertex. In some embodiments vertex fetcher and vertex shader execute vertex processing instructions by dispatching execution threads to execution units A B via a thread dispatcher .

The cache can be configured as a data cache an instruction cache or a single cache that is partitioned to contain data and instructions in different partitions.

In some embodiments graphics pipeline includes tessellation components to perform hardware accelerated tessellation of 3D objects. In some embodiments a programmable hull shader configures the tessellation operations. A programmable domain shader provides back end evaluation of tessellation output. A tessellator operates at the direction of hull shader and contains special purpose logic to generate a set of detailed geometric objects based on a coarse geometric model that is provided as input to graphics pipeline . In some embodiments if tessellation is not used tessellation components can be bypassed.

In some embodiments complete geometric objects can be processed by a geometry shader via one or more threads dispatched to execution units A B or can proceed directly to the clipper . In some embodiments the geometry shader operates on entire geometric objects rather than vertices or patches of vertices as in previous stages of the graphics pipeline. If the tessellation is disabled the geometry shader receives input from the vertex shader . In some embodiments geometry shader is programmable by a geometry shader program to perform geometry tessellation if the tessellation units are disabled.

Before rasterization a clipper processes vertex data. The clipper may be a fixed function clipper or a programmable clipper having clipping and geometry shader functions.

In some embodiments the rasterizer logic includes a windower masker unit to perform fixed function triangle and line rasterization. An associated render cache and depth cache are also available in some embodiments.

In some embodiments support is provided for the Open Graphics Library OpenGL and Open Computing Language OpenCL from the Khronos Group the Direct3D library from the Microsoft Corporation or support may be provided to both OpenGL and D3D. Support may also be provided for the Open Source Computer Vision Library OpenCV . A future API with a compatible 3D pipeline would also be supported if a mapping can be made from the pipeline of the future API to the pipeline of the graphics processor.

In some embodiments client specifies the client unit of the graphics device that processes the command data. In some embodiments a graphics processor command parser examines the client field of each command to condition the further processing of the command and route the command data to the appropriate client unit. In some embodiments the graphics processor client units include a memory interface unit a render unit a 2D unit a 3D unit and a media unit. Each client unit has a corresponding processing pipeline that processes the commands. Once the command is received by the client unit the client unit reads the opcode and if present sub opcode to determine the operation to perform. The client unit performs the command using information in data field . For some commands an explicit command size is expected to specify the size of the command. In some embodiments the command parser automatically determines the size of at least some of the commands based on the command opcode.

In some embodiments the graphics processor command sequence may begin with a pipeline flush command to cause any active graphics pipeline to complete the currently pending commands for the pipeline. In some embodiments the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline do not operate concurrently. The pipeline flush is performed to cause the active graphics pipeline to complete any pending commands. In response to a pipeline flush the command parser for the graphics processor will pause command processing until the active drawing engines complete pending operations and the relevant read caches are invalidated. Optionally any data in the render cache that is marked dirty can be flushed to memory. In some embodiments pipeline flush command can be used for pipeline synchronization or before placing the graphics processor into a low power state.

In some embodiments a pipeline select command is used when a command sequence requires the graphics processor to explicitly switch between pipelines. In some embodiments a pipeline select command is required only once within an execution context before issuing pipeline commands unless the context is to issue commands for both pipelines. In some embodiments a pipeline flush command is is required immediately before a pipeline switch via the pipeline select command .

In some embodiments a pipeline control command configures a graphics pipeline for operation and is used to program the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline . In some embodiments pipeline control command configures the pipeline state for the active pipeline. In one embodiment the pipeline control command is used for pipeline synchronization and to clear data from one or more cache memories within the active pipeline before processing a batch of commands.

In some embodiments return buffer state commands are used to configure a set of return buffers for the respective pipelines to write data. Some pipeline operations require the allocation selection or configuration of one or more return buffers into which the operations write intermediate data during processing. In some embodiments the graphics processor also uses one or more return buffers to store output data and to perform cross thread communication. In some embodiments the return buffer state includes selecting the size and number of return buffers to use for a set of pipeline operations.

The remaining commands in the command sequence differ based on the active pipeline for operations. Based on a pipeline determination the command sequence is tailored to the 3D pipeline beginning with the 3D pipeline state or the media pipeline beginning at the media pipeline state .

The commands for the 3D pipeline state include 3D state setting commands for vertex buffer state vertex element state constant color state depth buffer state and other state variables that are to be configured before 3D primitive commands are processed. The values of these commands are determined at least in part based the particular 3D API in use. In some embodiments 3D pipeline state commands are also able to selectively disable or bypass certain pipeline elements if those elements will not be used.

In some embodiments 3D primitive command is used to submit 3D primitives to be processed by the 3D pipeline. Commands and associated parameters that are passed to the graphics processor via the 3D primitive command are forwarded to the vertex fetch function in the graphics pipeline. The vertex fetch function uses the 3D primitive command data to generate vertex data structures. The vertex data structures are stored in one or more return buffers. In some embodiments 3D primitive command is used to perform vertex operations on 3D primitives via vertex shaders. To process vertex shaders 3D pipeline dispatches shader execution threads to graphics processor execution units.

In some embodiments 3D pipeline is triggered via an execute command or event. In some embodiments a register write triggers command execution. In some embodiments execution is triggered via a go or kick command in the command sequence. In one embodiment command execution is triggered using a pipeline synchronization command to flush the command sequence through the graphics pipeline. The 3D pipeline will perform geometry processing for the 3D primitives. Once operations are complete the resulting geometric objects are rasterized and the pixel engine colors the resulting pixels. Additional commands to control pixel shading and pixel back end operations may also be included for those operations.

In some embodiments the graphics processor command sequence follows the media pipeline path when performing media operations. In general the specific use and manner of programming for the media pipeline depends on the media or compute operations to be performed. Specific media decode operations may be offloaded to the media pipeline during media decode. In some embodiments the media pipeline can also be bypassed and media decode can be performed in whole or in part using resources provided by one or more general purpose processing cores. In one embodiment the media pipeline also includes elements for general purpose graphics processor unit GPGPU operations where the graphics processor is used to perform SIMD vector operations using computational shader programs that are not explicitly related to the rendering of graphics primitives.

In some embodiments media pipeline is configured in a similar manner as the 3D pipeline . A set of media pipeline state commands are dispatched or placed into in a command queue before the media object commands . In some embodiments media pipeline state commands include data to configure the media pipeline elements that will be used to process the media objects. This includes data to configure the video decode and video encode logic within the media pipeline such as encode or decode format. In some embodiments media pipeline state commands also support the use one or more pointers to indirect state elements that contain a batch of state settings.

In some embodiments media object commands supply pointers to media objects for processing by the media pipeline. The media objects include memory buffers containing video data to be processed. In some embodiments all media pipeline states must be valid before issuing a media object command . Once the pipeline state is configured and media object commands are queued the media pipeline is triggered via an execute command or an equivalent execute event e.g. register write . Output from media pipeline may then be post processed by operations provided by the 3D pipeline or the media pipeline . In some embodiments GPGPU operations are configured and executed in a similar manner as media operations.

In some embodiments 3D graphics application contains one or more shader programs including shader instructions . The shader language instructions may be in a high level shader language such as the High Level Shader Language HLSL or the OpenGL Shader Language GLSL . The application also includes executable instructions in a machine language suitable for execution by the general purpose processor core . The application also includes graphics objects defined by vertex data.

In some embodiments operating system is a Microsoft Windows operating system from the Microsoft Corporation a proprietary UNIX like operating system or an open source UNIX like operating system using a variant of the Linux kernel. When the Direct3D API is in use the operating system uses a front end shader compiler to compile any shader instructions in HLSL into a lower level shader language. The compilation may be a just in time JIT compilation or the application can perform shader pre compilation. In some embodiments high level shaders are compiled into low level shaders during the compilation of the 3D graphics application .

In some embodiments user mode graphics driver contains a back end shader compiler to convert the shader instructions into a hardware specific representation. When the OpenGL API is in use shader instructions in the GLSL high level language are passed to a user mode graphics driver for compilation. In some embodiments user mode graphics driver uses operating system kernel mode functions to communicate with a kernel mode graphics driver . In some embodiments kernel mode graphics driver communicates with graphics processor to dispatch commands and instructions.

The embodiments of the invention perform Prefix Sum calculations using a software based approach on certain types of graphics processing units GPUs which provide regioning support e.g. the Intel Gen GPUs such as the Gen 8 GPU . As mentioned above scalar atomics try to do two basic operations 2 accumulate and 2 broadcast the result of accumulation to the active lanes. Emulating this behavior efficiently in software is extremely important to the performance of certain applications.

The embodiments of the invention implement a software solution to emulate the behavior of accumulate and broadcast using regioning logic on graphics processors to parallelize portions of the instructions. Using regioning rules as described below is more efficient than performing the atomic operation itself for every SIMD lane. Regioning allows each instruction to specify the lanes on which it will perform its operation. In addition because there are multiple data elements the stride between each element is also specified.

A na ve solution would be to accumulate each element separately. This means that for n elements n instructions would be needed. A SIMD1 instruction would be used to perform the accumulation. An exemplary algorithm for such a na ve process is illustrated in the example in and the resulting sequence of instructions are illustrated in . Thus it can be seen that the na ve method generates a huge sequence of instructions where a set of instructions is actually executed in a loop which is used to extract the bits from the execution mask and then set the return values appropriately to each lane. If every channel is on then the loop will execute for 8 SIMD8 and 16 SIMD16 times respectively. This means about 67 SIMD8 SIMD16 instructions are executed.

An improved method may be used which involves using a shifting technique where values in lanes are shifted and then added and this process continues. However this process also generates more instructions than the approach described below.

One embodiment of the invention utilizes the GPU s regioning techniques which allow program code to be executed in a SIMD way thereby performing multiple operations simultaneously with a single instruction. illustrates a high level architecture of one embodiment in which a prefix sum calculation module comprising sequences of instructions is executed on a SIMD vector execution unit of a graphics processor unit GPU . In one embodiment the prefix sum calculation module takes advantage of the regioning techniques made available by the ISA of the SIMD vector execution unit as described in detail below. A set of vector SIMD registers are utilized to store vector SIMD data while performing the operations. In one embodiment the vector SIMD registers comprise 512 bit registers which store sixteen 32 bit data elements. However the underlying principles of the invention are not limited to any particular data element or register sizes.

Instructions are described below in accordance with the following format OPERATION DEST SRC0 SRC1 where OPERATION designates the operation to be performed on the SIMD data e.g. add move etc. DEST identifies the destination register and parameters associated with the destination register and SRC0 SRC1 identify the source registers and parameters associated with the source registers. In addition in the notation used below the values between the less than and greater than symbols i.e. indicate the vertical stride width and horizontal stride of each operation. The vertical stride value indicates for example a row offset between rows of data elements in a register file i.e. the number of elements skipped to get to the corresponding position in the next row the width indicates the number of operations performed in some cases the number of operations on each half of a particular register and the horizontal stride indicates a column offset between columns of data elements in a register file e.g. a horizontal stride of 2 may indicate that every other data element is being written . For example SRC0 d indicates a vertical stride of 8 a width of 4 and a horizontal stride of 2. The d indicates that the operation is performed on dword values i.e. 32 bit values . In addition a single number within the symbols indicates a horizontal stride. For example DEST indicates a horizontal stride of 2.

The prefix sum operations performed in one embodiment of the invention will now be described with respect to . As can be seen with the described approach the loops have been eliminated and the code size generated by the compiler is much smaller.

In the instruction mov 16 r12.0 d 0 w Align1 H1 NoMask initializes all lanes to 0 as illustrated. Here the 16 indicates a SIMD16 write i.e. 16 data elements the r12.0 indicates the destination register r12.0 the indicates a horizontal stride of 1 every element written the d indicates a doubleword and the 0 w indicates that the source values are word data types having a value of 0. The NoMask indication tells the instruction to ignore the execution mask thereby ensuring that even if some execution masks are turned off all data elements are written to.

In the initial set of values used for the prefix sum calculation are moved to the destination register r12.0 from the source register r9.0 in accordance with the following instruction mov 16 r12.0 d r9.0 d Align1 H1 i.e. a SIMD16 copy from SRC to DEST . Once again the indication means a vertical stride of 8 a width of 8 and a horizontal stride of 1 i.e. every element . In this example the execution mask is honored. As a result the values from register r9.0 are superimposed over the existing 0 values stored in register r12.0. In some locations 0s remain indicating that no values were copied from r9.0 for these data elements.

In a SIMD8 copy with regioning operation is performed using values from adjacent data elements in accordance with the following instruction add 8 r12.1 d r12.0 d r12.1 d Align1 Q1 NoMask thereby adding adjacent values e.g. 3 4 6 5 7 0 etc. and storing the results as indicated by the arrows. For example the result of 3 4 is stored in the prior location of 4 the result of 5 6 is stored in the prior location of 6 etc. The results of the addition operations are shown in .

Then in a SIMD4 copy with regioning operation is performed in accordance with the following instruction add 4 r12.2 d r12.2 d r12.1 d Align1 Q1 NoMask resulting in the addition operations 7 5 7 8 10 11 and 25 14 with the results stored in the locations pointed to by the arrows i.e. in the prior locations of 5 8 11 and 14 respectively . The resulting values are shown in .

Then in a SIMD4 copy with regioning operation is performed for the upper SIMD16 half of the register in accordance with the following instruction add 4 r12.4 d r12.3 d r12.4 d Align1 Q1 NoMask. The end result as indicated by the arrows is that the value of 18 is added to 7 7 15 and 24 and the results are stored in the element positions pointed to by the arrows resulting in the values shown in .

In a SIMD4 copy with regioning operation is performed for the upper SIMD16 half of the register in accordance with the following instruction add 4 r13.4 d r13.3 d r13.4 d Align1 Q1 NoMask resulting in the value of 21 being added to the values of 12 25 39 and 54 as illustrated. Once again the resulting values are stored in the data elements positions pointed to by the arrows as shown in .

Finally in the value of 42 in the upper left data element position is copied to each of the data element positions in the lower half. The end result of 117 in the lower left data element position is the final prefix sum result achieved with significantly fewer instructions than prior implementations.

A method in accordance with one embodiment of the invention is illustrated in . At a SIMD register is initialized with all zeroes. As discussed above this may be accomplished by ignoring the execution mask thereby ensuring all data elements are written to. At the initial values to be used for the prefix sum are loaded into a register. As mentioned above this may be accomplished using a move operation which moves the values from a source register to a designated destination register. The execution mask may be honored to superimpose the values from the source on top of the destination values. Finally at a series of SIMD operations are performed using regioning techniques to generate the prefix sum. In one embodiment this involves a series of SIMD copy with regioning operations in which data elements are summed in parallel to generate intermediate results and then some of the intermediate results are used in subsequent SIMD copy with regioning operations.

Embodiments of the invention may include various steps which have been described above. The steps may be embodied in machine executable instructions which may be used to cause a general purpose or special purpose processor to perform the steps. Alternatively these steps may be performed by specific hardware components that contain hardwired logic for performing the steps or by any combination of programmed computer components and custom hardware components.

As described herein instructions may refer to specific configurations of hardware such as application specific integrated circuits ASICs configured to perform certain operations or having a predetermined functionality or software instructions stored in memory embodied in a non transitory computer readable medium. Thus the techniques shown in the figures can be implemented using code and data stored and executed on one or more electronic devices e.g. an end station a network element etc. . Such electronic devices store and communicate internally and or with other electronic devices over a network code and data using computer machine readable media such as non transitory computer machine readable storage media e.g. magnetic disks optical disks random access memory read only memory flash memory devices phase change memory and transitory computer machine readable communication media e.g. electrical optical acoustical or other form of propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. .

In addition such electronic devices typically include a set of one or more processors coupled to one or more other components such as one or more storage devices non transitory machine readable storage media user input output devices e.g. a keyboard a touchscreen and or a display and network connections. The coupling of the set of processors and other components is typically through one or more busses and bridges also termed as bus controllers . The storage device and signals carrying the network traffic respectively represent one or more machine readable storage media and machine readable communication media. Thus the storage device of a given electronic device typically stores code and or data for execution on the set of one or more processors of that electronic device. Of course one or more parts of an embodiment of the invention may be implemented using different combinations of software firmware and or hardware.
