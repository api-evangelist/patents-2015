abstract: Systems and methods are provided that may be implemented to utilize multiple sensors to intelligently control RF transmit power and specific absorption rate (SAR) produced from a wireless-enabled information handling system platform in the presence of a detected nearby human body. The disclosed systems and methods may be implemented in one example to avoid the poor performance and user experience that results from a reduction in the information handling system platform radio transmit power when it is not necessary (due to false detection of a human body), or that results when the platform transmit power is reduced too much and/or too quickly when nearby proximity of an actual human body is detected.

This invention relates generally to information handling systems and more particularly to wireless transmission from information handling systems.

As the value and use of information continues to increase individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes compiles stores and or communicates information or data for business personal or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled how the information is handled how much information is processed stored or communicated and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed stored or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing airline reservations enterprise data storage or global communications. In addition information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process store and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems data storage systems and networking systems.

Specific absorption rate SAR refers to the rate at which radio frequency RF energy is absorbed by the human body and is used to measure the power absorbed from mobile wireless devices such as cell phones tablet computers and notebook computers. Many government agencies around the world have set maximum allowable SAR value limits for such mobile devices when in use. To conform RF emissions to these SAR limits while at the same time maximizing wireless performance a mobile device has been provided with a single capacitive proximity sensor that detects close proximity of an object such as a human body. A processor within the mobile device has then been used to reduce wireless RF transmission power from the mobile device when the capacitive proximity sensor detects close proximity of a nearby object but to allow higher RF transmission power in the absence of the detection of a nearby object.

Current methods and implementations for controlling SAR utilize a single capacitive proximity sensor to control only the power transmitted from the main WWAN LTE transmit antenna of a wireless device and employ a binary detection mechanism to control wireless RF transmission power based only on either detection or non detection of a nearby object. Since the capacitive proximity sensor cannot reliably distinguish between a human body and a non human object proximity trigger event wireless transmission performance from the device can needlessly suffer when transmit power is reduced due to the detected nearby presence of a non human object.

Disclosed herein are systems and methods that may be implemented to utilize multiple sensors to intelligently control SAR produced from a wireless enabled information handling system platform e.g. mobile wireless device such as tablet or notebook computer smart phone etc. in the presence of a detected nearby human body while also enabling optimal wireless RF transmit performance from the platform when no nearby human body is detected. The disclosed systems and methods may be so implemented to be more robust than conventional SAR solutions employed for mobile devices. For example the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented in one embodiment to avoid the poor performance and user experience that results from a reduction in the information handling system platform radio transmit power when it is not necessary due to false detection of a human body or that results when the platform transmit power is reduced too much and or too quickly when nearby proximity of an actual human body is detected. Thus the disclosed systems and methods may employ smart usage of combinations of sensors to increase proximity detection field of view and to reduce or substantially eliminate false proximity detection positives and in one embodiment meet FCC or other governmental agency SAR requirements for RF exposure without significant platform performance degradation of wireless feature s.

The disclosed systems and methods may be implemented in one exemplary embodiment to reliably detect the difference between nearby proximity of an actual human body and a non human proximity trigger event and without the need for multiple peripherally located capacitive SAR sensors located to distinguish between human body and non human proximity e.g. such as 4 to 6 capacitive proximity sensors located around the periphery of a wireless tablet device depending on the size of the tablet device or other such smart form factor which may drive increased complexity increased cost and require more space for additional capacitive electrodes with associated industrial design and mechanical engineering impacts. Moreover the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented in a scalable manner for reliable human proximity detection as opposed to capacitive proximity sensing technology which may require increased distance between the multiple capacitive sensing electrodes and sensor integrated circuits needed leading to increased susceptibility to noise and reduction in proximity detection performance.

In one embodiment the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented to control SAR resulting from multiple transmit antennas of a single wireless enabled information handling system platform including relatively small sized wireless platforms having multiple transmit antennas. This capability is advantageous given the current trend of increased number of transmit antennas supported by a single wireless platform device coupled together with the current trend of decreasing the typical physical wireless device size e.g. such that SAR conformance is also required for Wi Fi emissions. Examples of system platform types and environments with which the disclosed systems and methods may be advantageously implemented to meet FCC or other governmental agency SAR requirements for RF signal exposure without significant degradation of the wireless performance include but are not limited to handheld end user computing EuC systems such as tablet first designs.

In one exemplary embodiment the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using multiple different types of sensors provided on board an information handling system. In a further embodiment these different types of sensors may include all the existing sensors that are provided in a commercial off the shelf COTS information handling system platform to more intelligently control SAR emissions from the platform. In any case smart usage of various combinations of multiple sensors may be implemented to increase proximity detection field of view around an information handling system platform and may be further implemented to reduce or substantially eliminate occurrence of false positive identification of a nearby human user that requires SAR RF transmit power reduction.

In one embodiment a fusion of multiple sensors of a wireless enabled information handling system platform may be used to provide a more detailed system and environment view of the device platform to enable intelligent and dynamic SAR control configurations. For example one exemplary embodiment of the disclosed systems and methods may utilize knowledge of a wireless device usage profile e.g. stored in system memory for a given wireless information handling system to predict likelihood of SAR trigger events for that given information handling system.

In another embodiment the scope of SAR control may be extended e.g. by using one or more additional sensor s or other type devices that are located on some other proximity adjacent objects rather than on the information handling system platform itself to determine proximity of a human user to a mobile device antennae of concern. Such off platform devices may communicate with processing devices of the information handling system for example via wired or wireless communication e.g. Bluetooth RF signal communication optical communication such as infrared signals near field communication signals etc. . Examples of such other objects include but are not limited to the body of the current use of the information handling system e.g. such as using a capacitive other type proximity sensor or short range RF transmitter located on a user wearable component that communicates proximity indicative signals to the system platform that may contain sensed proximity distance values or that may have a received signal strength that varies with proximity to the system platform or a nearby notebook computer e.g. the nearby proximity of a human user s body to a cellular phone system platform may be positively detected and reported to processing device s of the system platform when the user generates input signals by typing on the keyboard of a notebook computer that is wirelessly tethered via Bluetooth to the cellular phone wireless device that is in turn transmitting via Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN RF cellular signals .

Specific examples of different types of hardware and or methodology that may be employed in the practice of the disclosed systems and methods for human proximity detection to detect nearby proximity of a human body to a wireless enabled information handing system platform include but are not limited to 1 thermal sensors such as thermocouples or resistance temperature detectors RTDs or thermistors for thermal sensing e.g. mapping variations in sensed temperature due to contact of a user s human tissue with the platform at different temperature 2 motion detector to detect motion e.g. if a mobile information handling system platform has been motionless for a certain period of time then it may be assumed that the platform is not currently being held by a human being 3 display touch sensor e.g. detecting a user holding a touch screen display device by using edge touch detection to determine the location of a user s hands and or fingers when the user is holding the mobile device and if no touch activity has been reported from the touch screen for a specified period of time and there is IP traffic then it may be assumed that the touch screen display device is not being held by a human examples of such use cases include Personal Hotspot Music listening Video watching etc. 4 biometrics sensor e.g. such as a sensor capable of detecting a nearby user s heart beat and that is placed in proximity to the wireless device platform transmit antennas of concern such sensors are conventionally employed in wearables and may provide a relatively high level of certainty that an object detected is indeed human tissue 5 Local localization techniques e.g. local localization techniques may be established between a wireless enabled information handling system platform such as a tablet or notebook computer and a second device that is physically associated with a user such as a user wearable like a Watch to determine the real time distance between the user and the wireless platform in this case some wireless device platforms have restricted access and usage to a certain very limited number of users such as one two or more identified users . It will be understood that in a further embodiment any of such human proximity detection schemes such as described above may be enhanced by a Machine Learning engine e.g. such as running on the wireless information handling system platform based on user usage history.

In one respect disclosed herein is an information handling system platform including multiple sensors that are each configured to react to a proximity of a human user to the system platform by producing a sensor output signal that is indicative of a proximity distance of the human user to the system platform one or more antenna elements at least one transmitter coupled to the one or more antenna elements and configured to transmit radio frequency RF signals from each of the antenna elements and at least one processing device coupled to the transmitter the processing device being coupled to receive the sensor output signals of the multiple sensors and to determine a real time object proximity detection distance from each of the multiple sensor output signals. The at least one processing device of the system platform may be further configured to control the transmitter to reduce RF transmit power according to at least one proximity distance sensing profile that defines a relationship between RF transmit power reduction and the determined object proximity detection distance according to the multiple sensor outputs.

In another respect disclosed herein is a method of operating an information handling system platform including using multiple sensors of the information handling system platform to detect a proximity of a human user to the system platform by producing a sensor output signal that is indicative of a proximity distance of the human user to the system platform using at least one processing device of the information handling system platform to receive the sensor output signals of the multiple sensors and to determine a real time object proximity detection distance from each of the multiple sensor output signals and using the at least one processing device of the information handling system platform to control a transmitter of the information handling system platform to reduce RF transmit power from one or more antennas of the information handling system platform according to at least one proximity distance sensing profile that defines a relationship between RF transmit power reduction and the determined object proximity detection distance according to the multiple sensor outputs.

Still referring to information handling system platform includes integrated RF antennas and which are each coupled to a transmitter that includes respective RF tuner or and radio front end as shown. In the illustrated embodiment separate tuners and are configured to modify the operating characteristics of the separate antenna elements and respectively based on the operating state of the baseband processor and radio front end e.g. based on the current frequency band or RF channel in use. Circuitry of RF tuners and radio front end is configured to perform intermediate frequency IF to RF up conversion mixing and RF processing tasks for outgoing transmitted signals to antennas and vice versa including down conversion for incoming received signals from antennas . Besides IF front end may perform up conversion and down conversion between RF and other suitable frequencies for processing by baseband processing device or processor e.g. such as zero IF frequency baseband frequency etc. In this regard baseband processor e.g. digital signal processor DSP or other suitable RF module or processing device s is coupled to exchange outgoing and incoming IF or other suitable signals with baseband processor through respective digital to analog DAC and analog to digital ADC converters not shown . Baseband processor may be configured to manage RF signal transmission and reception as well as to perform tasks including signal processing encoding frequency shifting and or modulation operations to provide transmitted information in outgoing signals based on digital data provided by application processor and to perform signal processing decoding frequency shifting and or demodulation operations to obtain the message content in the incoming signals as digital data to provide to application processor .

Application processor may in one embodiment be a host processing device e.g. such Intel or AMD based central processing unit CPU or other suitable type of processing device configured to execute a host operating system OS and to exchange outgoing and incoming and outgoing digital data with baseband processor . Application processor may be coupled as shown to main system memory e.g. dynamic random access memory DRAM or other suitable type of system memory and to system storage e.g. media drive s such as magnetic hard drive s or optical storage drive s solid state drive s SSD other non volatile memory device s etc. . Such storage and memory devices may also be accessible to other processing devices of system platform . Application processor may also be configured to execute an operating system OS such as Microsoft Windows based Linux based Apple OS based or other suitable operating system as well as to execute applications and system BIOS for system platform . Among other things application processor may be coupled e.g. via a platform controller hub PCH to one or more I O devices or circuitry of system including but not limited to video display circuitry touch sensitive circuitry or touch pad or keyboard for accepting user input audio amplifier circuitry and system speaker s system microphone etc.

Further shown in is sensor fusion hub with co processor that is coupled to receive sensor inputs from multiple sensors detect nearby proximity of a human user from the multiple sensor inputs and to determine transmit power reduction based on the multiple sensor inputs in a manner described further herein. It will be understood that in one embodiment a co processor may be an integrated component provided within a fusion hub as illustrated. In an alternative architecture embodiment a co processor may be a dedicated processing device component that is used instead of a fusion hub processing component.

In one exemplary embodiment co processor may be a system on a chip SoC that includes an Advanced RISC Machines ARM based processor although any other suitable type of co processor or other type of processing device s may be alternatively employed. It is also possible that the operational tasks of co processor may also be performed by an application processor or other type of single processor or may be divided or partitioned between multiple different processing devices of a system . It will be understood that multiple sensors coupled to co processor may be any combination of different sensor types that are configured or otherwise capable of detecting or otherwise reacting to the nearby proximity of a human user to system platform by producing a sensor output signal that is indicative of the nearby proximity of the human user.

As shown in co processor e.g. integrated within a sensor fusion hub such as illustrated in may be configured to contain a proximity sensing engine that acts as the proximity sensing brain of the fusion hub. In this embodiment the proximity sensing engine may be the core logic that is configured to perform operations to process a proximity sensing algorithm . In this regard the proximity sensing engine may be configured to execute the proximity sensor algorithm e.g. as a proximity sensing library and application programming interface API issue commands and receive interrupts from the array of sensors that are used for measuring proximity of nearby human users and to produce a SAR power control command that is provided through application processor to baseband processor as shown. Baseband processor is in turn configured to execute dynamic power reduction control logic that is configured to receive the SAR power control command and based thereon to produce a SAR power level control signal that is provided to circuitry of RF tuners and radio front end to control the RF transmission power level for RF signals transmitted from antenna at any given time.

As shown in multiple proximity distance sensing profiles may be retrieved by proximity sensor algorithm from storage in non volatile memory e.g. NVRAM of co processor or from any other suitable memory device accessible by co processor . In one embodiment each proximity sensing profile may be defined based on a given radio transmit antenna currently being used with different profiles applying to different respective antennas . Each proximity sensing profile may in turn define a relationship between RF transmit power reduction e.g. as a percentage or fraction of maximum possible power transmission as an offset from maximum power transmission wattage level etc. and determined nearby object proximity detection distance according to sensor outputs received as inputs by sensor fusion and calibration logic of proximity sensor algorithm from multiple system sensors e.g. sensors . In one embodiment proximity sensor algorithm may in turn dynamically communicate SAR power control commands to baseband processor . SAR power control commands may be in the form of smart sensing fused sensor profile parameter values determined e.g. for a given antenna or antennas from a combination of fused sensor information from sensor fusion and calibration logic and proximity distance sensing profiles .

SAR power control commands transmitted from proximity sensor algorithm cause dynamic power reduction control logic of baseband processor to produce and provide a corresponding SAR power level control signal to RF tuners radio front end so as to implement usage context based and proximity detection based power reduction and to secure optimized performance while at the same time meeting SAR RF exposure requirements. RF tuners radio front end are in turn configured to control RF transmission power level to a given antenna antennas according to SAR power level control signal provided for the given antenna s . In this manner smart usage of various combinations of multiple sensors may be employed to increase proximity detection field of view and elimination of false positives with respect to nearby human user detection.

As further shown in proximity sensor algorithm may also be optionally configured to receive usage and environment change inputs for system platform e.g. inputs such as provided from primary or secondary device usage modes as may be configured on the system platform device by a user. Examples of different such usage modes include but are not limited to tablet usage mode and notebook usage mode e.g. in tablet usage mode the display orientation of system platform may be either landscape or portrait orientation depending on current running application and or on current physical orientation of the system platform while in notebook mode the display orientation may be fixed to be only landscape mode orientation etc. Examples of such usage and environment change inputs include but are not limited to information on environment and operational condition and or mode changes such as changes between convertible computer portable mode to stand mode and vice versa changes between portrait and landscape orientation for tablet computer system platform etc. Multiple different proximity sensing profiles may in turn be defined that each correspond to a different one of multiple possible usage and or environment modes and or conditions. Proximity sensor algorithm logic may optionally consider one or more usage and environment change input s together with fused sensor information to determine smart sensing fused sensor profile parameter values from proximity distance sensing profiles .

In one exemplary embodiment how a system platform is configured and used may be a primary input in determining the proximity distance profiles . For example if the system platform is configured as a hybrid 2 in 1 detachable device it may be configured in several ways by a user. In some usage modes such as notebook open mode or notebook closed mode then the proximity sensing function may be disabled or put in a sleep state by proximity sensor algorithm . However if the system platform is configured or reconfigured in tablet mode by the user it may be used in a number of orientations such as primary landscape primary portrait secondary landscape or secondary portrait. In each of these orientations proximity sensing be enabled by proximity sensor algorithm and may require separate proximity distance profiles depending on the location of the sensors and transmitting antennae in the system

Also shown in is resource management logic that may be executed as part of proximity sensing algorithm by co processor to select among multiple sensor inputs for purposes of managing and monitoring the resources required for the sensors such as the number and type of interfaces required interrupt handling and sensor data buffering requirements etc.

As will be further described herein in relation to individual proximity distance profiles may be associated with each transmit antenna and or sensor of based on upper and lower detection thresholds that are configurable by the proximity sensing engine of co processor . As previously mentioned each of the multiple types of sensors of may have different coarseness of proximity detection distance threshold. For example camera sensor s may have the most coarse proximity detection distance threshold motion sensor s e.g. accelerometer gyroscope etc. may have a relatively finer proximity detection distance threshold than camera s touch gesture e.g. user hand gesture sensor s may have a relatively finer proximity detection distance threshold than motion sensor s barometric pressure sensor s may have a relatively finer proximity detection distance threshold than touch gesture sensor s acoustic sensor s may have a relatively finer proximity detection distance threshold than pressure sensor s IR sensor s may have a relatively closer proximity detection distance threshold than acoustic sensor s capacitive proximity sensor s may have a relatively finer proximity detection distance threshold than IR sensor s and fingerprint sensor s may have a relatively finer proximity detection distance threshold than capacitive sensor s . As previously mentioned the particular types and number of different sensors of are exemplary only and any combination of fewer additional and or alternative different types of sensors may be provided for a given configuration of an information handling system platform .

In one exemplary embodiment individual sensor proximity distance sensing profiles may be calibrated for each of the sensors used for detection e.g. using sensor fusion and calibration logic . The proximity distances in each profile may be updated by the proximity sensing engine of co processor to compensate for environmental drift. In this regard some sensors may be subject to environmental drift bias that introduces errors and deviation from the original sensor calibrated levels. Such sensor drift of individual sensors may cause changes in the proximity distance sensing profiles and thus require compensation to correct for these errors. Sensor fusion and calibration logic may be configured to implement automatic sensor calibration algorithms to address drift via frequent self recalibration.

As illustrated in each of different sensors has a different individual sensor proximity distance sensing profile that in this embodiment includes an individual sensor curve and that has a different effective range of human body proximity detection distance detection sensitivity and corresponding indicated RF transmit power reduction amount for a given value of actual proximity distance of a human body to information handling system platform that is indicated by X axis value of . In this regard each of sensors may be configured to produce a sensor output signal that varies with different proximity distance of a human body to the system platform e.g. such as varying capacitance signal value varying sound level signal value varying barometric pressure level signal value level varying motion level signal value varying light level signal value etc. . Further as shown in each of sensors may be assigned e.g. based on empirical SAR compliance measurement for a corresponding transmitter during laboratory testing or other suitable testing methodology a varying indicated RF transmit power reduction amount that varies as a function of different proximity distances of a human body to the system platform based on the varying value of its respective sensor output signal as the actual proximity distance of a human body to the system platform X axis value changes.

Still referring to a blended relationship in the form of a fitted curve of RF transmit power reduction as a function of actual human body proximity detection distance over the multiple sensors may be created e.g. in real time by proximity sensor algorithm in step for each antenna and or usage mode as illustrated in . In this step a blended multi sensor curve fitting approach may be employed to smooth RF transmit power reduction steps over human body e.g. human hand proximity detection distances for each antenna and or usage mode. Fitted curve may be determined using any suitable curve fitting methodology from the individual RF transmit power reduction value profiles of the corresponding individual sensors e.g. such as a least squares method total least squares method interpolation between two consecutive sensor curves of in the decreasing detection distance direction i.e. in the right to left direction along X axis of interpolation between two consecutives curves of in the increasing detection distance direction i.e. in the left to right direction along X axis of etc. It will be understood that in other embodiments any other suitable type of blended relationship of different RF transmit power reduction values derived from different sensors as a function of proximity detection distance from the multiple sensors having different effective object distance detection ranges may be employed e.g. such as a lookup table of blended power reduction values that are each calculated from the average RF transmit power reduction values for two or three sensors having adjacent effective object distance detection ranges.

For example RF transmit power reduction range P defined by fitted curve is specified for the bracketed X axis detection distance range assigned only to sensor between sensor brackets and as shown with similar RF transmit power reduction ranges being individually specified for and assigned to each individual sensor as indicated by the different bracketed detection distance ranges of the X axis proximity detection distance denoted for each sensor in . Thus when the determined detection distance values measured by sensor fall within the assigned bracketed X axis distance value range of a corresponding RF transmit power reduction range P is indicated and defined by curve . It will also be understood that each different antenna and or usage mode may be assigned a different shaped curve that corresponds to the required SAR transmit power reduction and that each transmit antenna and or usage mode may be assigned such a curve as a proximity distance sensing profile described previously in relation to .

Next in step proximity sensor algorithm may be configured with the fitted proximity distance sensing profiles for use by the proximity sensing library and API which is configured to take inputs from all of multiple sensors and to deliver corresponding smart sensing fused profile parameters corresponding to a given transmit antenna to baseband radio processor or to each baseband radio processor for system platforms having multiple baseband radio processors . In step each baseband radio processor is configured to register with and accept the smart sensing fused sensor profile parameters as input from proximity sensor algorithm and to use the smart sensing fused sensor profile parameters to control and optimize output power for the given transmit antenna .

Next in step smart sensing fused sensor profile parameter values for a given antenna and or usage mode that are based on sensor inputs received from sensors are delivered by proximity sensor algorithm to baseband radio processor . In this regard a radio driver in baseband processor is configured to register with proximity sensing API of proximity sensor algorithm to receive these smart sensing fused sensor profile parameter values . In step dynamic power reduction control logic of baseband radio processor is configured to dynamically configure output power reduction e.g. as a selected fraction of full transmit output power by using the received smart sensing fused sensor profile parameter values together with radio and antenna operating parameters as inputs for performance optimization for SAR RF power reduction during transmit usage mode determined by usage context manager for a given antenna . In this regard such radio and antenna operating parameters used in step may be for example the identity of the frequency band or frequency channel in use by the baseband processor and radio front end and or the tunable antenna band switching or impedance matching state etc. In one embodiments such radio and antenna operating parameters may alter to a greater or lesser degree the amount of power reduction that is applied for SAR performance.

In step dynamic power reduction control logic of baseband radio processor delivers the dynamic power adjustment as control signals to the respective radio transmit chain e.g. radio front end and tuner and given antenna . In this way closed loop optimization of SAR RF power reduction performance for each proximity event detection distance usage mode radio operating condition and transit antenna may be achieved. In step proximity sensor algorithm monitors for changes in proximity event detection distance usage mode radio operating condition and or transit antenna and repeats to step as shown.

It will be understood that the illustrated steps of methodology are exemplary only and that any other combination of additional fewer and or alternative steps may be employed that is suitable to implement utilize multiple sensors to intelligently control SAR produced from a wireless enabled information handling system platform in the presence of a detected nearby human body. It will also be understood that the steps of methodology may be implemented with configurations of RF transmission capable information handling system platform configurations other than that illustrated in relation to .
