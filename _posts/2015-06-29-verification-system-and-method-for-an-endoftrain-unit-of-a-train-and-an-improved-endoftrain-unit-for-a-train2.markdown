This invention relates generally to trains and train systems including trains having an end of train unit and more specifically a verification system and method for use in connection with the end of train unit of the train as well as an improved end of train unit for a train.

As is known in the art most trains operating within a complex track network include a variety of systems for tracking certain aspects and parameters associated with the train. For example certain trains are equipped with a Positive Train Control PTC system such as the I ETMS of Wabtec Corporation which allow the train to navigate and operate effectively within the railway system. In addition most trains include a head of train unit and an end of train unit and these units are in communication with the train management computer in the PTC segment in the locomotive of the train.

One of the first functions of the end of train unit is to report the brake pipe pressure at the rear of the train to the engineer operating the train in the lead locomotive. Because accurate reporting of the end of train air pressure is critical the Federal Railroad Association FRA has mandated that the railroads perform a periodic calibration check of the pressure transducer in the end of train unit with the intent of ensuring that the readings are accurate and the transducer has not drifted over time. In particular the proper functioning of the end of train unit is important to ensure that appropriate braking can occur across the railcars of the train.

In current operating procedures and in order to perform the calibration check the end of train unit is removed from service and sent to a maintenance shop for service. During this time the end of train unit is not available for railroad operations and the railroad incurs the expense of a calibration check even if the pressure transducer is operating correctly and providing accurate pressure readings. For example and in connection with one known railroad system the estimated total expense associated with the annual calibration check is about 400 per unit which accounts for the loss of use while the end of train unit is in transit. Further if each end of train unit is not calibrated or checked on the periodic basis mandated by the FRA rule the railroad may be subject to penalties for violating this rule.

Accordingly there is a need in the art for a verification system and method for an end of train unit of a train and an end of train unit for a train that allows the unit to monitor the condition of its pressure transducer and dynamically determine when recalibration or maintenance is required. Further there is a need in the art for a verification system and method for an end of train unit of a train and an end of train unit for a train that allows the railroads to shift to condition based service and calibration of the unit i.e. only performing the calibration and maintenance or calibration check when the end of train unit actually requires it.

Generally the present invention provides an improved verification system and method for an end of train unit of a train and an end of train unit for a train. Preferably in some aspects of the present invention provided are a verification system and method for an end of train unit of a train and an end of train unit for a train that allow a railroad to implement condition based maintenance and calibration of the end of train unit fleet rather than servicing the end of train units on a set schedule.

Of course it is envisioned that any type of train management system can be used within the context and scope of the present invention.

As is known braking systems and arrangements are required for slowing and stopping vehicles such as cars trucks trains railcars railway vehicles and the like. With specific respect to trains and other railway vehicles the braking system is normally in the form of a pneumatically driven arrangement or air brake arrangement which includes mechanisms and components that interact with each railcar. As discussed hereinafter certain components i.e. a braking system of an air brake arrangement are positioned on or in or otherwise associated with the locomotive L . Similarly certain components i.e. a braking assembly of the air brake arrangement are positioned on or in or otherwise associated with locomotive L as well as one or more of the individual railcars RC .

With continued reference to and in one preferred and non limiting the operator of the train TR has control over the air brake arrangement such as each braking assembly on each railcar RC through the use of an operator control valve . Through the movement of a handle associated with the control valve the operator can adjust the amount of braking to be applied in the air brake arrangement such as in each braking assembly . The higher the braking force selected the faster the air brake arrangement will attempt to slow and stop the train TR . Alternatively and as discussed in more detail hereinafter the air brake arrangement and or each braking assembly for each railcar RC may also be controlled by the operator from the on board computer that transmits data signals typically over a trainline or cable extending between the locomotive L and the railcars RC which may be referred to as an electronically controlled pneumatic ECP air brake arrangement.

In order to provide the appropriately compressed air to the system and in certain conventional air brake applications the braking system also includes a compressor for providing compressed air to a main reservoir which is in communication with the control valve . Further an equalizing reservoir is also in communication with the control valve . Whether through the main reservoir or the equalizing reservoir compressed air is supplied through the control valve to a brake pipe that extends along and is associated with each railcar RC . Each railcar RC includes a braking assembly or unit which represents an arrangement that allows an auxiliary reservoir to be charged with air via a valve as well as including a brake cylinder which is in communication with the valve. The brake cylinder is operable to urge a brake shoe mechanism against a surface of a wheel.

In operation the brake pipe is continually charged to maintain a specific pressure e.g. 90 psi and each auxiliary reservoir and emergency reservoir which may be combined into a single volume or main reservoir are similarly charged from the brake pipe . In order to brake the train TR the operator actuates the control valve and removes air from the brake pipe thereby reducing pressure to a lower level e.g. 80 psi. The valve arrangement quits charging the auxiliary reservoir and transfers air from the auxiliary reservoir to the brake cylinder. Normally using a piston operable arrangement the brake cylinder urges the brake shoe mechanism against the wheel. As discussed in conventional non ECP air brake systems the operator may adjust the level of braking using the control valve since the amount of pressure removed from the brake pipe results in a specific pressure in the brake cylinder which results in a specific application force of the brake shoe mechanism against the wheel. Alternatively in the ECP air brake arrangement the brake commands are electronic signals transmitted over the ECP trainline to each railcar RC and based upon commands from the on board computer .

As discussed and in connection with ECP brake arrangements control signals can be transmitted from the on board computer to one or more of the railcars RC over the trainline . Each railcar RC is normally equipped with a local controller which is used to monitor and or control certain operating parameters in the air brake arrangement such as the air reservoirs and or the valve arrangement. In this manner the operator can broadcast brake commands to the railcars RC to ensure a smooth efficient and effective braking operation.

In addition this pressure data includes data representing the air pressure in the brake pipe at or near the EOT unit and or the last railcar RC of the train TR .

Further the computer is configured adapted or programmed to receive or determine pressure data from or associated with the one or more additional pressure sensors . Again this pressure data may be in analog or digital form or format and the either or both of the computer and the one or more additional pressure sensors may include the appropriate software hardware or firmware to receive process determine convert and or provide the pressure data for further use within the system . This pressure data also includes data representing the air pressure in the brake pipe at or near the EOT unit and or the last railcar RC of the train TR . As discussed above the first pressure sensor and the one or more additional pressure sensors can be positioned or obtain air pressure data or information from specified locations along the brake pipe .

Next in this embodiment or aspect the computer compares at least a portion of the pressure data received or determined i.e. associated with the first pressure sensor with at least a portion of the pressure data received or determined i.e. associated with the one or more additional pressure sensors . Based at least partially upon the results of this comparison the computer implements facilitates and or causes the implementation or facilitation of at least one action which will be discussed in various preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect hereinafter.

In one preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect the comparison process includes determining variance data which is the quantitative difference between the pressure data e.g. the air pressure received or determined from the first pressure sensor and the pressure data e.g. the air pressure received or determined from the additional pressure sensor . For example the variance data may be a determination of the difference between the sensed air pressure by the first pressure sensor and the sensed air pressure by the additional pressure sensor . Accordingly and in one preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect the first pressure sensor and the additional pressure sensor are configured or positioned to sense the air pressure in the brake pipe at the same point or portion of the bake pipe . Further the action that is implemented or facilitated may be dependent on this determined variance data.

In another preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect the logging and or communication of the information regarding the status or other conditions associated with the EOT unit or any component thereof may occur at some specified rate or time increment. For example this specified rate may be periodic e.g. daily weekly monthly etc. continual or dynamic e.g. on a substantially continual or ongoing basis configurable e.g. at a rate or time increment as set by the manufacturer the operator the railroad a standards organization a governmental body etc. condition based e.g. based upon the existence or absence of some condition or parameter at a rate determined by a regulation or standard e.g. a rate compliant with a regulation a standard a governmental body etc. or any combination thereof. Therefore different users or operators can adjust when how and how often the status or conditions associated with the EOT unit or any component thereof should be checked logged communicated and or the like. As stated this rate or time increment can be wholly adjustable and configurable to ensure compliance with the standards rules policies and or laws of any of the manufacturer operator owner standards organization governmental body etc.

In another preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect and as illustrated in the first pressure sensor and the secondary pressure sensor are in communication whether wired or wirelessly with the EOT computer i.e. the local controller which is in communication with an EOT communication device . This EOT communication device may be configured adapted or programmed to transmit process and or receive data in wired form such as over the trainline or wirelessly such as over a communication link . The communication link can be established directly or indirectly with another computer such as the on board computer the central controller or some other computing device e.g. a computer in a remote server a wayside device a remote data repository and or the like. In particular and in this embodiment or aspect the EOT communication device is in communication with the communication device in the locomotive L of the train TR and or the central controller e.g. a back office server central dispatch back office PTC components and or the like. Further the transmission of data and information may occur indirectly between the EOT communication device and the central controller using the communication device and or the on board computer as the intermediary. Other similar communication paths and links to transmit process and receive data and information within the verification system are also envisioned within the spirit and context of the present invention.

In another preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect the first pressure sensor and the at least one additional pressure sensor are provided or manufactured by a different manufacturer. Specifically and by obtaining the pressure sensors from different manufacturers a more independent and distinct measurement and comparison of the pressure in the brake pipe may be obtained. Further trends or data patterns can be identified between the pressure sensors manufactured or provided by different manufacturers e.g. differences or variations in pressure measurement drift differences or variations in failure type or rate differences or variations in required maintenance type or rate differences or variations in accuracy differences or variations in interface parameters with the other components of the EOT unit and or the like. These differences or variations can be categorized and or analyzed for use in making purchasing decisions and may also be used in predicting which EOT units i.e. which pressure sensors in the EOT unit are more or less likely to require maintenance or replacement.

In a further preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect the first pressure sensor and the at least one additional pressure sensor are provided with or use a different technology to determine the pressure data. By using different technologies in the pressure sensors and as discussed above in connection with the different manufacturers a more independent and distinct measurement and comparison of the pressure in the brake pipe may be obtained. Also as discussed trends or data patterns can be identified between the pressure sensors utilizing a different sensing or measuring technology e.g. differences or variations in pressure measurement drift differences or variations in failure type or rate differences or variations in required maintenance type or rate differences or variations in accuracy differences or variations in interface parameters with the other components of the EOT unit and or the like. These differences or variations can be categorized and or analyzed for use in making purchasing decisions and may also be used in predicting which EOT units i.e. which pressure sensors in the EOT unit are more or less likely to require maintenance or replacement.

In another preferred and non limiting embodiment the first pressure sensor and the at least one additional pressure sensor are configured or are selected to have or exhibit different responsive or reactive characteristics. These characteristics may include different responses to the effects of internal and or external temperature different aging characteristics or parameters different responses to the effects of vibration and or the like. For example the first pressure sensor and or the at least one additional pressure sensor may be selected chosen or configured such that it reads higher as it ages and the other pressure sensor may be selected chosen or configured such that it reads lower as it ages. Such an arrangement would minimize or avoid a situation where both pressure sensors drift in the same direction e.g. both higher or both lower which would provide an output where the pressure sensors agree but the actual measurements are inaccurate.

In another preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect and with reference to the verification system may include multiple additional pressure sensors . As discussed above these multiple additional pressure sensors may be located or positioned to sense the air pressure in the brake pipe preferably at or near the EOT unit in substantially the same adjacent aligned and or spaced positions or portions of the brake pipe . In this embodiment or aspect the action that may be implemented or facilitated is at least partially based upon a comparison of at least a portion of the pressure data from all of a set of and or specified pressure sensors . For example the selection or identification of the set of or the specified pressure sensors may be configured by the user or operator may be an automated process may be manually selected or set on a per EOT unit basis may be dynamic e.g. based upon the conditions or status of the pressure sensors and or the like. Still further individual additional pressure sensors and or a group or set of additional pressure sensors may be made by different manufacturers use a different technology and or are configured or are selected to have or exhibit different responsive or reactive characteristics with all of the benefits discussed above. By using multiple additional pressure sensors a more robust set of pressure data is obtained and can be used to determine the above discussed trends and patterns relating to EOT unit or its components the pressure sensors the air pressure in the brake pipe and or the like.

In another preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect the air pressure in the brake pipe at or near the EOT unit is determined based at least partially on the pressure data from the first pressure sensor and the at least one additional pressure sensor . Further in one embodiment or aspect and as discussed above in connection with the computer which is configured adapted or programmed to perform at least one of the following steps a receive or determine pressure data from the first pressure sensor b receive or determine pressure data from the at least one additional pressure sensor c compare at least a portion of the pressure data received or determined from the first pressure sensor with at least a portion of the pressure data received or determined from the at least one additional pressure sensor and or d implement or facilitate at least one action based at least partially upon the results of the comparison is located on in or integrated with the EOT unit or a component thereof . Further at least a portion of the pressure data is directly or indirectly communicated to the on board computer and or the central controller such as via the EOT communication device .

In a further preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect the action that is implemented or facilitated by the computer includes the communication or transmission of at least a portion of the pressure data and or information derived from this pressure data or information derived from the first pressure sensor and or the at least one additional pressure sensor to another computer or system. For example the pressure data or information may be directly or indirectly communicated by or to the EOT computer the on board computer the central controller and or some other remote computer or server e.g. a monitoring computer system a data warehouse a manufacturer computer system etc. a train management computer a remote server a back office server central dispatch and or the like. Further this communication may occur directly or indirectly over one or more of the following a wireless network rails of a track a railroad network a cellular network a Bluetooth network a near field network a radio network a portable storage device and or the like.

In another preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect the verification system includes a database whether local to the train TR remote from the train TR e.g. at the central controller and or in any specified remote location or system . This database may be populated with and store one or more of the following pressure data variance data end of train unit data maintenance or service data calibration data replacement data scheduling data compliance data railroad data Federal Railroad Association data and or the like. Through the collection and analysis of the pressure data other data and information can be used to achieve certain additional features. For example the pressure data variance data and or the end of train unit data can be used to determine the need for maintenance service replacement or examination of the EOT unit or any component thereof and or the pressure sensors . The pressure data and maintenance or service data can be used to determine the requirement timing and or occurrence of maintenance or service of the EOT unit or any component thereof and or the pressure sensors . The pressure data and calibration data can be used to determine whether the pressure sensors require calibration and the pressure data and replacement data can be used to determine whether the EOT unit or any component thereof and or the pressure sensors require replacement. The pressure data and scheduling data can be used to schedule timing and location of maintenance service and or replacement of the EOT unit or any component thereof and or the pressure sensors . The pressure data compliance data railroad data and or Federal Railroad Association data can be used to determine whether the train TR the EOT unit or any component thereof and or the pressure sensors are compliant with the policies or requirements of the operator the railroad the manufacturer the Federal Railroad Association and or any other rulemaking governing or interested party.

In another preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect the pressure data includes preventative maintenance data. This preventative maintenance data may include drift data e.g. the drift of the accuracy or measurements of the pressure sensors trend data e.g. how the measurements or accuracy of the measurements of the pressure sensors are trending limit data e.g. the accuracy or measurements of the pressure sensors compared to some threshold or limit tolerance data e.g. the accuracy or measurements of the pressure sensors with respect to certain specified tolerances and or comparison data e.g. the accuracy or measurements of the pressure sensors as compared to each other .

In this embodiment or aspect and at least partially based upon at least a portion of the preventative maintenance data the action that is implemented or facilitated includes one or more of the following a logging the status of the EOT unit b logging the EOT unit as requiring preventative maintenance or service c logging the EOT unit as not requiring preventative maintenance or service d communicating a message to the on board computer of the train TR the message including an indication of the status of the EOT unit e communicating a message to the on board computer the message including an indication that the EOT unit requires preventative maintenance or service f communicating a message to the on board computer the message including an indication that the EOT unit does not require preventative maintenance or service g communicating a message to a remote server e.g. the central controller the message including an indication of the status of the EOT unit h communicating a message to the remote server the message including an indication that the EOT unit requires preventative maintenance or service i communicating a message to the remote server the message including an indication that the EOT unit does not require preventative maintenance or service or any combination thereof. Based upon the preventative maintenance data maintenance or service can be predictively facilitated or implemented with respect to the EOT unit or any component thereof and or the pressure sensors . In this manner potential failures and issues regarding the EOT unit or any component thereof and or the pressure sensors can be proactively addressed.

In another preferred and non limiting embodiment the on board computer is programmed or configured to generate prediction data based at least partially on at least a portion of the results of the comparison. This prediction data may include or be in the form of a prediction of when the first pressure sensor and or the at least one additional pressure sensor will require maintenance. In one example this prediction data is in the form of drift data over time which would allow the user to take preemptive action with respect to maintaining the pressure sensor prior to a predicted failure point time and or date. In this example if it is observed that the variance between the pressure sensors was within acceptable limits but increasing over time it can be predicted at what point the pressure sensor would be out of compliance. In this manner preventative maintenance could be performed on the pressure sensor prior to failure.

In a further preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect and as illustrated in provided is a computer implemented or facilitated verification method for at least one EOT unit for a train TR where the EOT unit includes a first pressure sensor configured adapted or programmed to monitor or sense the air pressure in the brake pipe in the air brake arrangement of the train TR .

In a still further preferred and non limiting embodiment or aspect provided is an end of train unit e.g. EOT unit including a first pressure sensor configured adapted or programmed to monitor or sense the air pressure in the brake pipe in the air brake arrangement of the train TR and at least one additional pressure sensor configured adapted or programmed to monitor or sense the air pressure in the brake pipe in the air brake arrangement of the train TR . In this embodiment or aspect pressure data from the first pressure sensor and the at least one additional pressure sensor is compared and based at least partially on this comparison at least one maintenance related action is implemented or facilitated.

In this manner an improved verification system and method for an end of train unit and an improved EOT unit are provided with particular use in connection with an air brake arrangement of a train. It should be recognized that the above described functions algorithms and determinations may occur on the train TR e.g. by the on board computer or the EOT computer and or at some remote server e.g. the central controller or the like. Similarly some a portion of or all of the data generated within the verification system may be saved locally at the train TR e.g. in the track database and or remotely in some remote system e.g. in a database associated with a remote server e.g. the central controller or the like.
