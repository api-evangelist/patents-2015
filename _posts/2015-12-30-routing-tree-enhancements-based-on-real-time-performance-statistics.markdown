title: Routing tree enhancements based on real time performance statistics
abstract: A call path score that utilizes real time network statistics, sourced from carriers and the public domain that may be provided to LCR and SCPs to determine the net “value” of a route such that, depending on customer choice, a call completion pattern may be created. Calls may be completed optimizing distance, quality or cost based on real time network and carrier database. This function may be further enhanced to provide a customer sourced rating score that enhances call routing. This may be utilized for real time carrier performance statistics to analyze network congestion. Multiple carriers may be assigned based on network performance and carrier congestion.

Toll free may have unique IP requirements. The North American Numbering Plan Administration NANPA administers geographic numbers. Number portability is handled through the Number Portability Administration Center NPAC . Toll free numbers require enhanced number management capabilities for the following primary reasons 

Prior to assigning toll free numbers owners traverse a validation and vetting process to establish identity compared to straight number allocation for a geographic number. Vanity toll free numbers typically may be searched millions of times during a day compared to 100s of searches for a geographic number in an entire year.

Toll free number portability has its own set of rules that may be more strict and different from geographic numbers. Relying solely on the geographic number NPAC would be inadequate since toll free numbers differ in their use and management from geographic numbers.

In embodiments the TFMP may track and report on real time events that will result in charges to toll free providers. A tariff specifies the rate elements that may result in charges on a monthly bill and the rate to be charged. These may include but are not limited by establishment of a system logon ID monthly access to the system reservation of a toll free number report requests or some other type of element. Information provided by the TFMP may be needed to calculate monthly charges and create monthly bills that are sent to each toll free provider.

The current practice of managing toll free numbers and activities and the tools currently available to users for building a complex customer record are very often single threaded and cumbersome. In addition the current industry practices do not provide the ability to define a default customer record for a user in part because it may not be intuitive to build a complex customer record. According to the methods and systems presently disclosed the TFMP may provide tools that work intelligently with the user allowing a natural language input such as English words to translate and map such language to signifiers that may be less familiar to a user such as call routing codes. This translation and mapping of natural language to toll free number management information and data may produce a dynamic complex customer record including using existing user records and usage data to populate information for the user. This may speed the creation of complex routing and other metadata that is associated with a toll free line based at least in part on the TFMP enabling the dynamic querying of the real time status of data that is associated with a toll free number guide the user in providing the necessary natural language information that allows the TFMP to map such language to toll free number metadata e.g. routing codes and store and implement a complex decision tree describing the actions to take for a given toll free number.

In an example the TFMP may provide a user interface in which a user types a command such as Route all incoming calls made to toll free numbers having the extension 571 to the technical support staff. The TFMP may take this natural language input and map it to routing codes or other data corresponding to the natural language. In another example the natural language may be selected from a menu that is provided in the user interface of the TFMP provided via voice command using voice recognition software via scanned text that is input to the TFMP or using some other means of conveying natural language. The Customer Record Template Builder CRTB of the TFMP may allow building a complex customer record template using a user interface enabling that record to be designated as the default customer record. Using the TFMP a toll free provider may build multiple complex customer record templates for their use and define a record as the default customer record allowing the user to select the default with a single click thus reducing their work effort.

In another disclosed non limiting embodiment the CRTB may lead a user through an initial customer data population known as the Customer Administrative Data CAD portion and also the call routing logic Call Processing Record known as the CPR portion that is associated with a toll free number by utilizing the TFMP user interface to construct a decision tree logic structure with defined data nodes derived from the user s natural language inputs.

Based upon the decisions at the nodes in the decision tree that is constructed by the TFMP the user interface may drive down a branch to a new decision node ultimately driving the customer record decision logic to the lowest level. In embodiments decision trees constructed by the TFMP based on a user s input may represent a series of decision points. Each decision point may be called a node and off of each node may be one of more branches. The point at which there are no more decisions to be made may be referred to as a leaf and used as the end point of a branching structure.

In another disclosed non limiting embodiment the CAD portion of the CRTB may logically lead a user to populate information including but not limited to the following 

In another disclosed non limiting embodiment complex customer record CPR decision nodes that may be supported by the TFMP include but are not limited to the following 

In another disclosed non limiting embodiment the leaves that may be supported by the TFMP data model at the ends of a given branch include but are not limited to the following 

With reference to a simplified depiction of a customer record routing created using the TFMP is provided. In this simple example starting from the left most branched path the three decision paths corresponding to the decision trees branched paths may be represented as a routing from a toll free number detecting an area code an exchange carrier and terminating telephone number as in the following example 

Continuing the example of using the TFMP the CRTB toll may be built in such a manner to allow a user to work though the decision tree and anticipate prepopulate information based upon the information already provided in this build or also information provided in previous customer record entries. Once a default customer record template is built the TFMP may invoke this template when creating a customer record for a new number thus reducing the time and effort for a subsequent customer record to be built. Invocation of the default customer record template by the TFMP may also serve to reduce human error associated with the manual creation of such records insofar as the template may already embody necessary data thereby not requiring a user to remember or retrieve the same.

With reference to the methods and systems of the present disclosure may provide for pre populating a call routing template based on natural language inputs including associating a natural language element with a telecommunications routing code the telecommunications routing code associated with decision tree logic associating routing of incoming calls to a toll free number storing the association in a database that is associated with a toll free telecommunications system receiving a natural language input from a user the natural language input may include the natural language element selecting the telecommunications routing code based at least in part on the stored association populating the telecommunications routing code at a node of a call routing decision tree to generate a populated call routing decision tree and storing the populated call routing decision tree as a call routing template that may be identified and presented to a user interface based at least in part on the natural language input.

In embodiments a natural language input may be a text or voice element. A text element may be a scanned text element. A voice element may be obtained by voice recognition software.

In embodiments the decision tree logic may determine the call path taken by an incoming toll free call to a termination number the call path taken by an incoming toll free call based at least in part on the time of day the incoming call is received the call path taken by an incoming toll free call based at least in part on the geographic location of the device from which the incoming call is received the call path taken by an incoming toll free call within a business entities telecommunications system or some other call path outcome.

Further provided herein are methods and systems for creating a call routing decision tree the system comprising a user device of a user configured to receive a natural language input from a user select a stored call routing template wherein the selection is based at least in part on a stored association of the call routing template and a natural language element that is included in the natural language input present the stored call routing template to the user within a graphic user interface receive a command from the user through the graphic user interface to associate the selected call routing template with a toll free number indicated by the user and store the association between the call routing template and the toll free number.

In embodiments the command from the user may be text based such as a text based item that is presented within the graphic user interface in a menu or other location. In embodiments the command may be a voice command.

The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein 

In embodiments and with reference to the TFMP may facilitate determining toll free network congestion in real time. The TFMP system may include a subsystem referred to as a node and in this example embodiment called the Percent Node . This node may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs. The Percent Node may allow a tree to be built so that a certain percentage of the calls are routed to different branches on the call tree. The Percentage may be whole numbers and can range from 0 to 100 with the total percentage for all sibling branches not to exceed 100 . This may allow Resp Orgs to use the TFMP as their disaster recovery routing for a toll free number. In an example a call routing tree may be built with multiple branches to different locations such as terminating numbers. In a normal situation 100 of the calls may go to a main location . In a disaster which could be a carrier system failure for example and which may originate outside of the carrier itself a call routing table created according to the Percent Node and related rules may allow that all calls are diverted to another branch on the tree that uses a different carrier.

In embodiments real time network data may be used by the TFMP to create and allow Resp Orgs to use a congestion threshold node in the call routing tree. This may allow a Resp Org to determine with an end subscriber the appropriate congestion threshold for each branch in a call routing table. For example if one call center can only handle 200 calls per minute before calls are placed in queue and statistics show for this end subscriber that wait times start to creep up to 20 minutes when 1000 calls per minutes are received and they do not want this to occur the ability to obtain real time call counts congestion will allow the SCP to route the calls using call counts congestion in addition to all the other possible call decision nodes. Call counts may be very specific to an end subscriber and congestion thresholds may differ and depend on congestion on the line as a whole. The congestion measurement and threshold value may allow detecting congestion issues and routing to another branch including one that may be in a different area should a congestion threshold be reached. This may occur in real time without a need to change the routing tree. The TFMP may confirm real time call count information that is available from SCPs and use such data to confirm real time network congestion. Call count information may be further organized and analyzed by TSPID to permit tracking for example by service provider.

In embodiments nodes in a call routing table may be mapped to real time information in the SCPs from the network. With the decision nodes embedded in the call tree and loaded into the SCPs real time routing may be provided by the TFMP. In embodiments a call routing table may be a crowd sourced translation table associated with the TSS that may enable mapping of service providers to unique identifiers as described herein. Such a mapping would enable a registry that may be used by third parties to locate the plurality of identifiers that may be associated with a service provider or plurality of service providers.

In embodiments nodes in a call routing table may be used to facilitate predictive analytic services that may be provided to allow a user through the customizable user interface or dashboard to access third party data services sponsored data and information derived from toll free telecommunications networks including but not limited to telecommunications carriers service control points call centers or other parties affiliated with a toll free telecommunication network. Nodes in a call routing table may also be utilized with origination data that may be combined with social media and other public domain third party data and near real time apply a valuation model to display a trends and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP.

In embodiments nodes in a call routing table may be used to facilitate reporting capabilities of the TFMP through a client device such as a personal computer mobile phone tablet computer or some other computing facility and receive data including multimedia to the user s client device. Functionalities of the TFMP include but are not limited to Number Administration NA and Customer Record CR administration.

In embodiments the TFMP may determine accessibility among VoIP and tandem calls. For example with VoIP the TFMP may ping an IP address at regular intervals to determine status. Using real time network information and static call routing information the TFMP may create a real time call path score. SCPs may also be a source of real time call routing data. SCPs are in the call path of every toll free call. The ability to collect real time data about every call and every carrier based on dates times day of week and locations are available to SCPs. Using this information it is possible to extrapolate and determine uptime downtime congestion geographical movement and economic movement of people communicating via calls. Based on real time data that can be obtained from the SCPs and from the network the TFMP may create a score that can be assigned to each call decision node. Similar to a mapping algorithm that uses distance and speed limit given a starting point and a destination the quickest or shortest map may be mapped. Changes in the call routing tree may be dependent upon an update to the routing tree that is then validated by the TFMP and then downloaded to the SCPs. With the use of real time data and more network decisions nodes added to a call routing tree based on the needs of the end subscriber the TFMP may provide the ability to allow an end subscriber to have real time business continuity for their toll free number instead of having to contact their service provider or getting a ticket opened to update their routing tree and then having it download to all the SCPs for the new routing to take place.

In embodiments a call path score and real time routing may be based on the best possible availability score. This may also be modified by the TFMP to allow for lowest cost score based on the per call and per minute cost for particular carrier. The call score may be updated during low activity periods with a date time stamp associated with it. This may allow real time or near real time detection of a path s status. Upon completion of a call down a particular path the TFMP may also update the call path score thereby keeping the score up to date.

In embodiments nodes in a call routing table may be used to facilitate determination of the call path score such that real time routing may be displayed via a distributed computing environment such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment such systems may be hybrid networks including usage of a cellular telephone network and associated mobile communication devices such as smart phones a distributed cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization and any combination or sub combination of such networks .

The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein 

associating a toll free telecommunications network congestion threshold criterion with a first rule regarding the usage of a plurality of call routing tables and a second rule regarding the usage of a plurality of telecommunications carriers wherein the congestion threshold criterion indicates a level of toll free call volumes occurring within the toll free telecommunications network and

switching toll free calls across the telecommunications carriers based at least on the congestion threshold criterion wherein the switched calls are further routing according to at least one of the plurality of call routing tables.

In the current industry practice updates and additions to toll free providers numbers are not available through conventional platform reporting capabilities for up to 24 hours. This makes it difficult for end users to call up information about work done on the current day. If a toll free number is reserved and for whatever reason the user does not record the actual number there is often no way to find it or a laborious search is required to assemble the necessary data elements for retrieval. One reason for the delay in the ability to report is that reporting is sourced from a Report History Data Base RHDB that is only populated with updates once a day. Additionally most reporting from the RHDB is run in the background thus in some cases still further delaying the response.

With reference to in another disclosed non limiting embodiment the TFMP provides the user with the ability to report on its number portfolio in real time or near real time via an online customer dashboard . The online customer dashboard may display simulated gauges and dials business graphics such as pie charts bar charts and graphs to provide overview that summarizes all pertinent data in one or two screens or views. The gauges and dials may be based upon real time data that is stored within the TFMP. The TFMP may include a subsystem referred to as a node that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs for use with the dashboard. The decision tree may be used in various manners as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency.

The online customer dashboard may allow the user to see all its customer data and drill down in the details in near real time. To do so a data source for the dashboard may maintain the data in real time or near real time. The online customer dashboard may also be associated with a user profile and security administration that grants permissions to different groups of users to access embodiments of the system to create view update and activate certain functions. The platform or system can implement a role based access control mechanism.

The online customer dashboard may provide the user with a view into the user portfolio of toll free number information. This may allow a user to see basic number information about the toll free numbers the user has the authority to view. Predictive analytic services may also be provided that allow a user through the customizable user interface or dashboard to access third party data services sponsored data and information derived from toll free telecommunications networks including but not limited to telecommunications carriers service control points call centers or other parties affiliated with a toll free telecommunication network. As elsewhere described origination data may be combined with social media and other public domain third party data and near real time apply a valuation model to display a trends and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP.

A user may also access the reporting capabilities of the TFMP through a client device such as a personal computer mobile phone tablet computer or some other computing facility and receive data including multimedia to the user s client device. Functionalities of the TFMP include but are not limited to Number Administration NA and Customer Record CR administration. Such systems may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment such systems may be hybrid networks including usage of a cellular telephone network and associated mobile communication devices such as smart phones a distributed cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization and any combination or sub combination of such networks .

The online customer dashboard may utilize real time network statistics sourced from carriers and the public domain within an algorithm that provides a call path score. This call path score may be provided to LCR and SCPs to determine the net value of a route for display.

The online customer dashboard may also provide an alert system similar to Internet alerts for toll free numbers. Numbers or groups of numbers may be tagged based on tag groups. The alert system for toll free numbers may use a subscription prioritization engine and offer premium services for service prioritization.

The online customer dashboard for a toll free voice registry may share reserved assigned and working numbers with the Toll Free Texting and Smart Services Registry TSS .

The online customer dashboard may initially provide a main dashboard screen from which the user may drill down within a specific toll free number to investigate more detailed information thereof. In one example the main dashboard screen may provide a base set or minimum list of data elements that are available including but not limited to the following 

The user can then drill down into the particular toll free number by clicking on that particular number to find more detailed information such as Area of Service Carrier s Call Routing Reserve numbers or other information associated with a toll free number.

A user may also view the history of the number i.e. the life of a toll free number. By selecting a particular toll free number the history of use of the toll free number may be readily viewable. Various charts timelines and usage data may be included therein. This functionality may allow a user to view and report on the status and activities of an entire RespOrg in real time rather than parts of a RespOrg s activity and or only at predefined time intervals e.g. once per day .

In another disclosed non limiting embodiment the online customer dashboard is not a view only tool but may provide additional or alternative features to be customized by the user. That is individual users may select their desired types of information available via their dashboard.

Overall the online customer dashboard may provide a single starting point for any user working with toll free numbers. Having a single location may allow a user of the system to use a single user interface the dashboard to view the entirety of activity that is associated with a plurality of toll free numbers.

With reference to the TFMP may include a toll free number rating registry TFRR that functions as a service to provide customers an indication of how often a toll free number is abused such as by fraudulent frequent calling to increase billing costs. The rating may be calculated based on input from users automated systems and or proprietary algorithms that are collecting storing and analyzing call data from throughout the toll free system.

In embodiments the system may collect toll free number abuse information from a plurality of sources including but not limited to a telephone service provider toll free number operators and Resp Orgs. The abuse information may be collected and processed in real time to provide timely rating information for entities. In embodiments the TFMP may publish standard interfaces that reporting parties can invoke to register abuse. Such interfaces may allow clients to connect synchronously and asynchronously. Interfaces may include but are not limited to 

In embodiments the abuse reporting interfaces that are associated with the TFMP may be invoked in a manual or automated manner. In the case of service providers the reporting of abuse may occur during call setup. This may necessitate that the reporting is automated and introduces the least load on the device reporting the abuse. In an example an asynchronous API may be made available to service providers for this purpose. In another example for call centers where toll free numbers terminate such as a technical support department of a company call center processing software may be enhanced to include a module to detect and report abuse.

Additionally the TFMP may also provide a mobile or other application that small business and single toll free number users can use to report abuse. The TFMP may include a subsystem referred to as a node that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs. The decision tree may be used in various manners to facilitate operation of the service as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency. The service may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment such systems may be hybrid networks including usage of a cellular telephone network and associated mobile communication devices such as smart phones a distributed cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization and any combination or sub combination of such networks .

In embodiments to automate the processing of toll free calls and reduce abuse the TFMP system may be enhanced to allow customers to provision an abuse route. This route may be distributed to the SCPs along with current information being shared. When a service provider determines that a call being setup is an abuse call they can use the abuse route specified by the customer.

With reference to an example abuse reporting interface architecture that is associated with the TFMP is provided. This abuse reporting interface may permit toll free customers to report when a toll free number abuse event occurs. The interface may allow for abuse to be reported manually and or programmatically in an automated fashion. In embodiments the abuse collection system described herein may collect information that includes but is not limited to the following 

The abuse database may also collect information about Resp Orgs and other industry details in an offline mode. The abuse information may be captured in the toll free number abuse database . This information may then be processed using a rating engine to compute the toll free number rating. The rating engine may take into account a plurality of factors including but not limited to input provided by Resp Orgs TSPID s associated with service providers frequency of abuse identified source of abuse and the like to compute a rating for the toll free number. In the absence of specific reports of abuse predictive analytics methods of the TFMP as described herein may be used to infer abuse or unusual call activity the results of which may be used in computing a rating. In an embodiment the identification of abuse may be an inference of an abuse event produced by a predictive analytics engine that is associated with the TFMP based on at least a call history and metadata relating to calls placed over the toll free telecommunications number. In an example 100 calls may be placed over a toll free number each of which by itself does not appear to be abusive. For example the calls may be placed from locations that do not appear suspicious. However an inference of abuse based at least in part on the totality of calls placed over the toll free number may be used by the predictive analytics engine that is associated with the TFMP to infer that abuse is occurring or has occurred. For example the totality of the calls may indicate a pattern indicative of abuse or a call frequency that is indicative of abuse or some other criterion that may be used by the predicative analytics engine to infer that an abuse event or plurality of abuse events is occurring or has occurred. In embodiments a toll free number rating may be a number between 0 and 100 that provides an indication of how often the number is abused and or how severe the abuse is. A number with 0 rating may indicate a number that is never abused and a number with a 100 rating may indicate a number for which the majority of activity is abusive in nature. The toll free number rating may be made available to users of the TFMP and may be used to make routing and other decisions about the toll free number.

Based on the rating of a toll free number the service provider may take a specific action to ensure legitimacy of a toll free call. In addition to the number rating the rating engine may also generate routing rules to be shared with service providers. These rules may be imported by the service provider into their call routing engine to automatically route abusive calls in a manner that is consistent with the routing rules. These rules may also be used in combination with user profiles and security administration may grant permissions to different groups of users to access the toll free number rating to create view update and activate certain functions. The system can implement a role based access control mechanism. Predictive analytic services may be provided that allow a user through the customizable user interface or dashboard to access third party data services sponsored data and information derived from toll free telecommunications networks including but not limited to telecommunications carriers service control points call centers or other parties affiliated with a toll free telecommunication network. Origination data may also be combined with social media and other public domain third party data and near real time apply a valuation model to display a trend and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP.

The present disclosure includes a toll free management platform TFMP for providing services to toll free subscribers and providers enabling them to manage a plurality of toll free numbers and tasks associated with such numbers. Functionalities of the TFMP include but are not limited to Number Administration NA and Customer Record CR administration.

The TFMP enables searching for any number random number or to search for a plurality of numbers that are consecutive and or include an indicated combination of digits. Since certain toll free number codes e.g. 800 and combinations of digits e.g. repeating digits digits whose corresponding telephone keypad letter values spell a word or phrase may be considered most desirable the NA function includes capabilities for searches and reservations to be handled so that a toll free provider does not gain an advantage to reserve a given toll free number. The TFMP also enables tracking the overall assignment of numbers for each toll free provider in order to enforce regulations for toll free number allocation specified by a tariff. NA may maintain a status for each number that reflects whether it has been reserved and whether a customer record has been created and sent to service control points SCPs . It is possible to query the TFMP for status and reservation information associated with a number.

The TFMP enables customer record administration allowing toll free providers to create a customer record and to specify when the information should be sent to SCPs. A reserved toll free number may become active when routing information for the number specified in a customer record is uploaded into SCPs. Customer records may be updated or deleted and the send time updated prior to sending. Once a customer record has been sent a new record may be created to update or delete the routing specified by the previous record. The routing information specified in a customer record may include but is not limited to 

Carriers who have arrangements to carry calls for a toll free provider may wish to approve customer records when routing for a toll free number has been assigned to the carrier. The customer record function may maintain a list of carriers and preferences for whether approval is required when a toll free provider indicates the carrier in a customer record. A notification may be sent to a carrier when approval of a customer record is required. In embodiments each customer record may have an associated status. Customer records may be queried to view the status and information contained in the record based on the permissions of the user.

In another disclosed non limiting embodiment the TFMP may include a user interface functionality that allows manual access for human users and mechanized access for systems such as an application programming interface to make use of the NA and CR functions provided by the TFMP. Such systems may be embodied in a distributed computing environment such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment such systems may be hybrid networks including usage of a cellular telephone network and associated mobile communication devices such as smart phones a distributed cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization and any combination or sub combination of such networks . The mechanized interface provided by the TFMP may allow external users to establish data dynamic connectivity with the platform and gain access to its available functions. The TFMP may maintain logins passwords encryption authentication and the like to provide security to limit system access to only authorized users. Permission levels that restrict access to TFMP s functions and to proprietary data may be assigned for each authorized user and stored locally or remotely to an enterprise utilizing the TFMP including within a computing storage facility that is remote to but operatively coupled with the TFMP. In embodiments the user interface functionality may provide real time notifications and other information to external users using mechanisms such as email and File Transfer Protocol FTP .

In another disclosed non limiting embodiment the TFMP may provide an interface to send routing information from CRs to SCPs. The SCP Management Function of the TFMP may enable management of interactions with SCPs including maintaining data connectivity sending CR information at the specified date and time and monitoring responses in order to update customer record status.

In another disclosed non limiting embodiment the SCP administration functions of the TFMP may allow users to establish and modify SCP related reference data in the system and send messages to the SCP node and the Call Management Services Data Base CMSDB within the SCP to manage data tables at the SCP. Network management functions for toll free database services may involve the management of various automatic capabilities intended to monitor and control toll free query traffic and calling volumes at the SCPs Service Switching Points terminating switches terminating subscriber lines and the like. When various call volume thresholds are exceeded the SCPs may trigger Automatic Code Gapping ACG controls at the originating SSPs. The TFMP s management functions may allow network managers to configure and adjust relevant control parameters. Data collection at the SCPs may be requested through the TFMP to provide network managers with surveillance information that is useful to monitor traffic and analyze problems such as the detection of SCP overloads and excessive calling or excessive ineffective attempts to dialed codes.

With reference to in embodiments the TFMP may provide a Toll Free Texting and Smart Services Registry TSS to support toll free telephone numbers and related services such as SMS MMS and streaming media. The TSS may include several components such as but not limited to number administration call control and route provisioning as well as number status assessment. The number administration function may provide number assignment for toll free subscribers as well as provide services to manage the toll free numbering plan. This component may provide for toll free number portability as well as managing the mapping of toll free numbers to geographic numbers. The number administration function may also open new number plan administration codes. The number administration function may forecast the exhaustion of codes and demand for codes for use by organizations such as the FCC.

The call control and routing function may be responsible for providing intelligent routing for calls made to toll free numbers. Toll free subscribers may have the ability to configure call routing to include multiple carriers time of day rules and rules based on the caller s proximity among others. These rules may be downloaded to real time network routing databases or Service Control Points SCPs . The number status assessment function may determine the availability of certain numbers. Numbers may be reserved and assigned according to activation date and then are deployed. The number status function may assess whether numbers are spare reserved assigned or currently deployed.

Providers of various smart services such as voice media or texting services may be able to access the TSS that can be text enabled from a list of reserved assigned and working numbers. After numbers are identified an automated online letter of authorization agency may be executed. The letter of authorization agency may independently demonstrate authorization to a responsible organization that maintains the registration for individual toll free numbers in a distributed database. The distributed database may be associated with a distributed computing network as described herein. Upon execution of the letter of authorization agency the information may then be provisioned to industry routing databases for delivering various services such as SMS text messaging MMS messaging and content streaming including but not limited to video content as well as future services .

Letter of authorization agency as used herein may include but is not limited to communication used by a toll free end subscriber such as during the provisioning phase of a toll free number engagement to enable that end subscriber to switch providers for a given telephone messaging service and the like. In an example an end subscriber may wish to change its long distance provider so that a local company need not be used. The long distance provider to whom the end subscriber wishes to do business would typically walk the end subscriber through an authorization process to enable the end subscriber to switch long distance carriers from the local company to the new company. This authorization may manifest in the carrier s system as a letter of authorization agency that documents the needed approvals from the end subscriber.

In an embodiment of the present disclosure the TSS may enable a letter of authorization agency process for a provider to authorizing texting and other services on a toll free number or plurality of toll free numbers that are used by an end subscriber. The letter of authorization agency may be electronically stored and presented to the responsible organization or owner of record for a given number or service. The letter of authorization agency may further define a time frame during which certain actions such as the turning on of texting services for a toll free number are permitted. Such letters of authorization as defined herein may be further associated with stored profiles of an owner of record and or end subscriber. A letter of authorization agency may allow a toll free number end user or toll free number subscriber to authorize service enablement for services not covered by their existing responsible organization. In this way consumers can have multiple services enabled on a single telephone number across multiple service providers. In an example a letter of authorization agency may authorize a responsible organization or other entity to take a plurality of actions so that additional communication with for example an end subscriber is unnecessary and actions may be taken more quickly and efficiently. This may enable service registrars and others to activate new services such as toll free texting services or bandwidth increases on a shorter timeline which may have commercial benefits as speed activation of needed telecommunications services.

With reference to in an embodiment of the present disclosure the TSS may facilitate the enablement of a letter of authorization agency process used to enable toll free texting capability and capture basic data such as customer name responsible organization service registrar toll free number service enablement date and letter of authorization agency status of services or some other type of data associated with toll free telephone numbers and services. The TSS may facilitate the letter of authorization agency process by programmatically sending a notification to the responsible organization of record to memorialize the transaction. A timer may be set that will give the responsible organization a limited period of time to dispute the transaction. If no action is taken the transaction may proceed and texting service enablement or some other service type may be fulfilled in the TSS Registry. Continuing the example this letter of authorization agency process may be provided for each toll free number that is provisioned in the TSS registry or only a subset of numbers depending on the wishes of the end users.

In order to streamline the letter of authorization agency process a blanket letter of authorization agency may be used whereby the customer of record may authorize a specific service registrar to provision update and deactivate records in the TSS as needed . In such cases a notification may be sent to the responsible organization to memorialize each transaction. In order to further streamline the letter of authorization agency process responsible organization s may choose to put a blanket authorization on specific service registrar s which will allow the transaction to take place in real time .

In embodiments the TSS may allow electronic documentation to be stored and managed providing a library of legal documentation that may be used by the system in real time to facilitate transactions more efficiently and to provide more concrete evidence of formal authorization through a physical electronic document proving for example the end user s identity and validity.

In embodiments the TSS may operate in conjunction with current toll free services including a toll free voice registry. In order to establish unambiguous authority for the use of a toll free number a controlling organization for a toll free number may be the responsible organization of record in the toll free voice registry. Number administration may be the exclusive function residing only in the authoritative toll free voice registry.

In embodiments the TSS may be flexible and extensible to support a plurality of toll free services such as SMS or MMS messaging services and content provisioning. The TSS may additionally provide toll free numbers for services such as videos mobile device applications games or any other software products or services that may be important to an organization to anchor their identity and brand. To support this environment in embodiments the TSS may reside on a stand alone platform using hardware software and support systems independent of those used today in the toll free voice registry. The TSS may be able to connect to a toll free voice registry to obtain number information such as availability and reservation status as well as control responsible organization information such as the responsible organization contact information but may remain otherwise separate in its operation.

A responsible organization may maintain a toll free voice registry that provides number administration route provisioning toll free database services to various service control points or some other type of toll free service. The TSS as described herein may incorporate the services from a toll free voice registry to provide smart services enablement route provisioning and smart services registry to existing SMS MMS routing databases as well as other smart services requiring toll free numbers such as mobile device applications or games.

With reference to in another embodiment a mobile device may utilize an unambiguous support identifier along with a toll free data message and voice service. In this embodiment the mobile device may be assigned a unique Toll Free ID TFID at the time of manufacturing. That is the TFID may be agnostic of type of device and may be hard flashed into the mobile device to identify a customer with a toll free provider that is providing the toll free communication. The TFID may be associated with the carrier identifier such as IMEI MEID if GSM phone CDMA a service provider identifier such as a TSPID as described herein or to another identifier associated with a mobile device. In another embodiment the TFID may be associated with other systems including usage of a cellular telephone network and associated mobile communication devices such as smart phones a distributed cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization and any combination or sub combination of such networks .

A standard support app that is natively installed such as a setting app distributed as part of the device or separately though an app store facilitates a consumer s ability to talk message view browse support related features of merchandise devices or other issues that the consumer may have. The standard support app may further interact with a user profile and security administration that grants permissions to different groups of users to access embodiments of the system to create view update and activate certain functions. The system can implement a role based access control mechanism.

When consumers buy a device the device manufacturers and retailers may auto register the device to the support application at the Point of Sale POS . The TFID may be embedded in the hardware of the device and cannot be changed to provide a definitive way to identify a device when using toll free services.

With reference to in another embodiment the TFID may permit a customer who is purchasing an appliance a device or other merchandise to be presented with an opportunity to associate one or more mobile devices to the merchandise purchased . For example this can be performed at the POS or after the sale as a registration and or warranty process . The process of registration is thereby automated to simplify these somewhat otherwise bothersome processes for the customer.

In one example a TFID Mobile App is operable to permit the mobile device to read QR codes Barcodes RFIDs serial numbers or other merchandise identifiers and then communicate with the manufacturer via toll free service provided by the manufacturer . For example a user may need only point a camera of the mobile device toward the merchandise to capture the merchandise identify and thereby complete a registration warranty support or other process.

On the backend a TFID Mobile App registry may be updated with the added mobile device TFID to merchandise association. Via a separate mechanism merchandise manufactures can then update the registry with the contact information associated with the TFID for registration and user association. The TFID Mobile App registry may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment such systems may be hybrid networks including usage of a cellular telephone network and associated mobile communication devices such as smart phones a distributed cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization and any combination or sub combination of such networks .

Once the merchandise is associated with the particular mobile device the TFID Mobile App may present or otherwise store the various information about the merchandise e.g. product documentation upgrades manufacture contact information etc. This permits the user to readily communicate with the manufacturer via the toll free service provided by the manufacturer and accessed via the TFID. For example once the merchandise is associated with the mobile device a support call registry may be made readily available from the manufacturer via a toll free service. Support such as repair and troubleshooting for the merchandise may then be more readily provided as the initial validation of the merchandise to the particular user e.g. warranty registration and confirmation has already been automatically provided by the registry. That is the registry facilitates more direct access to support from the manufacturer via a toll free communication provided by the manufacturer as supported by the support application on the device.

The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein 

A toll free voice registry may share reserved assigned and working numbers with the TSS. The TSS may then establish available numbers for service enablement. As described herein a service registrar may identify toll free numbers to be provisioned to an organization and may complete a letter of authorization agency and provide owner of record documentation. The TSS may then request approval for service enablement from a responsible organization. The responsible organization may review the service enablement request. If approved the TSS may change the service status of the toll free number from available to assigned. The service registrar may then assign a unique identifier to number such as a Service Provider Identifier SPID or eSPID. The TSS may then provision the service and change the number status from assigned to active. The routing database associated with the TFMP may then provision the toll free number with the unique identifier.

The routing database associated with the TFMP may then provision the toll free number with the unique identifier.

Additionally the TFMP may also provide a mobile or other application that small business and single toll free number users can use to report abuse in combination with the TSS. The TFMP may include a subsystem referred to as a node that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs. The decision tree may be used in various manners to facilitate operation of the service as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency. The TFMP may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment the TFMP may include hybrid networks including usage of a cellular telephone network and associated mobile communication devices such as smart phones a distributed cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization and any combination or sub combination of such networks .

Telecommunication service providers are required by industry guidelines to have a unique company code assigned to them. This unique company code identifies carriers as they interconnect with each other and allows for rating guiding billing and routing functionality. Historically when service providers provided voice only services each service provider was identified by a company code termed an Operating Company Number OCN . With the evolution of the communications industry service providers started introducing additional voice services for example number portability. As these services were introduced the need for uniquely identifying the carriers became of paramount importance. Registries and organizations were set up to facilitate the integration and interactions required to fulfill these services. Such developments prompted service organizations need for additional context based metadata to support these interactions for example number portability . One result was the adding of additional identifiers to each service provider that required integration. These are sometimes referred to as the SPID or Alternate Service Provider Identifier Alt SPID .

With the introduction of over the top OTT providers for example Skype and Internet Protocol based vendors IP Vendors selling traditional communication services over a full Internet Protocol IP network the activities between software and the traditional telecommunications industry become more interactive. IP allowed for a new breed of vendors to integrate with traditional communication service provider networks for delivery and exchange of consumer data. This created a new set of challenges for the unique identification of service providers since the IP Vendors were not traditional carriers and did not meet industry guidelines for OCNs. Additional sometimes proprietary metadata were created to support these new service providers for example an eSPID as described herein. The preponderance of different identifiers from eclectic industry organizations lead to lack of a consistent unique way to identify and interact with service providers with no centralized industry provider organization or registry having a complete view of service provider community.

In an example embodiment of a service provider routing text messages though the network as the text messages are processed the TSS may obtain metadata associated with the messages that includes coding data. By reading these codes the TSS may confirm that a given message is derived from a service provider such as Skype for delivery to an AT T subscriber. Such metadata may be obtained for example in a header file. Fields in the header file may be associated with a SPID. This may allow the TSS to determine that the text message is coming from Skype en route to ATT. If it were the case that many texts were originating from Skype at a particular time or day the TSS may utilize this data to assist third parties in providing targeted advertising content. The TSS may also utilize this data to identify the unnecessary usage of intermediaries in processing communications such as text messages and assist users in avoiding the excess charges for intermediaries by routing messages without using intermediaries. The TSS may utilize a context based unique identifier to distinguish specific services associated with the TSS Registry. The TSPID may be enabled in TSS and applies to such multimedia services such as but not limited to SMS MMS video conferencing and streaming data. Resp Org IDs may also be associated with any toll free number enabled in TSS. The TSPID may further facilitate the value chain of a multimedia service for toll free numbers in order for that service to be delivered.

The Toll Free Service Provider ID TSPID provides an aggregate identifier for Service Registrars who provide services such as but not limited to SMS MMS video conferencing and streaming content that may be registered and distributed by the TSS Registry. That is the TSPID provides a single unified identifier that may include other identifiers over a broad distribution of data to include but not be limited to traditional voice services. The TSPID may also be utilized as an authoritative identifier of the service provider of record for toll free numbers and or ultimately local 10 digit numbers. The TSPID may be enabled by a user profile and security administration that grants permissions to different groups of users to access embodiments of the system to create view update and activate certain functions. The system can implement a role based access control mechanism.

The SPID is the authoritative identifier for telephone number ownership in the Number Portability Administration Center which includes ported numbers associated with Local Number Portability as well as pooled numbers which are associated with assigned pool blocks as administered by the Pooling Administration. Over time many companies may map various identifiers such as the SPIDs to a broader table for use with the TSPID to still further aggregate such data. Further traditional voice services may be mapped as well.

With the introduction of value added mobile services for example SMS exchanges and hubs set up by Inter Carrier Vendors ICV provide communication between multiple mobile network operators. Route tables are stored in industry proprietary databases that provided a call path service to determine in real time the destination service provider for an incoming mobile service. These ICVs further add additional metadata to identify carriers and facilitate integration. This process may have added complexity insofar as countries have their own local and regional authorities and naming conventions.

With the introduction of over the top OTT providers for example Skype and Internet Protocol based vendors IP Vendors selling traditional communication services over a full Internet Protocol IP network the activities between software and the traditional telecommunications industry become more interactive. IP allowed for a new breed of vendors to integrate with traditional communication service provider networks for delivery and exchange of consumer data. This created a new set of challenges for the unique identification of service providers since the IP Vendors were not traditional carriers and did not meet industry guidelines for OCNs. ICVs created additional sometimes proprietary metadata to support these new service providers for example an eSPID as described herein. The preponderance of different identifiers from eclectic industry organizations lead to lack of a consistent unique way to identify and interact with service providers with no centralized industry provider organization or registry having a complete view of service provider community.

In embodiments of the present disclosure the TSS may provide an inclusive view of industry identifiers enabling a single system of record for identifying service providers whether traditional telecommunications provider OTT provider or some other type of service provider. During the on boarding process e.g. toll free number reservation and provisioning service registrars may be required to provide their unique identifiers UIds with the various organizations they interact.

In embodiments the TSS may establish a baseline of UIds by public domain information gathering. Data gathered through the public domain may be further validated through crowd sourcing where a global potentially mechanical human process can be used to identify validate and confirm UIds to create a baseline for the registry. In another embodiment latent sematic indexing may be used to associate data and metadata associated with communications to the actual owner provider or responsible party that is associated with a communication such as a text message. This crowd sourced translation table associated with the TSS may enable mapping of service providers to unique identifiers. Such a mapping would enable the a registry that may be used by third parties to locate the plurality of identifiers that may be associated with a service provider or plurality of service providers.

In order to facilitate proper content delivery service providers may be required by the TSS to periodically update their UIds. A validation verification and certification process may be used to ensure integrity and validity of data entering the TSS. This may provide the industry with a single resource that may be used to identify and validate the identity of service providers. In an example usage scenario a communications company that intends to optimize its network and manage traffic may wish to identify where its end traffic original source is located by looking at packet headers and identifying service providers. In another example a consumer reports based rating service may use the TSS to provide consumers with message or delivery metrics. Bulk advertising pam management companies may use the TSS look at detailed metadata and associate a name to a code. ICVs may use the TSS to streamline establishment and setup of their recipients without requiring expensive and costly set up. Ad agencies may use data derived from the TSS to customize ads to end users by understanding the source and destination as opposed to area codes and personalize content based on the service provider s for example if the content originated on an IP network.

In an example embodiment of a service provider routing text messages though the network as the text messages are processed the TSS may obtain metadata associated with the messages that includes coding data. By reading these codes the TSS may confirm that a given message is derived from a service provider such as Skype for delivery to an AT T subscriber. Such metadata may be obtained for example in a header file. Fields in the header file may be associated with a SPID. This may allow the TSS to determine that the text message is coming from Skype en route to AT T. If it were the case that many texts were originating from Skype at a particular time or day the TSS may utilize this data to assist third parties in providing targeted advertising content. The TSS may also utilize this data to identify the unnecessary usage of intermediaries in processing communications such as text messages and assist users in avoiding the excess charges for intermediaries by routing messages without using intermediaries.

With reference to in embodiments the TSS Texting and Smart Services Registry may establish a baseline of UIds by public domain information gathering for messages sent from a client device . Data gathered through the public domain may be validated through crowd sourcing where a global potentially mechanical human process can be used to identify validate and confirm UIds to create a baseline for the registry. Every Service Provider has a set of unique UIds by which its customers are reached by various methods such as but not limited to voice short messaging service SMS multimedia messaging service MMS video conferencing and streaming content. When any of these Service Providers signs up to be a TSS user it has a unique UId called a TSPID which is assigned. This TSPID provides the baseline for which many other UIds can be mapped. Many Data Providers Messaging Hubs Aggregators and others who are in the business of routing and providing services such as voice SMS MMS video conferencing streaming content and other multimedia services to sign on to consume TSS Data. Each of these entities that consume data will have a unique identifier to which the TSPID will be mapped. Data Providers that consume TSS data will be required to provide to TSS a new toll free specific UId for each established TSPID. The end result is a mapping that extends to any data provider that is consuming TSS data. As distribution widens a fairly comprehensive routing table for each Service Provider is created.

Furthermore each TFN that is enabled in the TSS Registry has the Resp Org ID and Resp Org Entity associated with it and thus is also mapped to the TSPID. The result is the most comprehensive routing table specific to toll free numbers that will map toll free numbers to their voice provider messaging provider as well as the routing information across a plurality of data providers. Once this comprehensive Toll Free routing table is established it can be further extended to layer in other identifiers such as but not limited to local ten digit numbers also known as long codes SPID LRN OCN and LATA.

In another embodiment latent semantic indexing may be used to associate data and metadata associated with communications to the actual owner provider or responsible party that is associated with a communication such as a text message. This crowd sourced translation table associated with the TSS may enable mapping of service providers to unique identifiers. Such a mapping would enable a registry that may be used by third parties to locate the plurality of identifiers that may be associated with a service provider or plurality of service providers. In embodiments toll free number abuse information as described herein from a plurality of sources including but not limited to a telephone service provider toll free number operators and Resp Orgs may also be used for the purposes of creating translation tables including but not limited to crowd sourced translation tables. The TSS routing table once sufficiently established may be used for services such as value added predictive analytics as described herein that service providers can use to gain valuable insights about their customers. Service Providers and other consumers of the data in the routing table would access the information using either an application programming interface API for automated integration into their own analytics engines or a web based GUI for simpler one time lookups. Below are some examples of probable use cases for the routing table.

In order to facilitate proper content delivery service providers may be required by the TSS to periodically update their UIds. A validation verification and certification process may be used to ensure integrity and validity of data entering the TSS. This may provide the industry with a single resource that may be used to identify and validate the identity of service providers. In an example usage scenario a communications company that intends to optimize its network and manage traffic may wish to identify where its end traffic original source is located by looking at packet headers and identifying service providers.

In another embodiment a consumer reports based rating service may use the TSS to provide consumers with message or delivery metrics. Bulk advertising spam management companies may use the TSS to look at detailed metadata and associate a name to a code to streamline establishment and setup of their recipients without requiring expensive and costly set up. Ad agencies may use data derived from the TSS to customize ads to end users by understanding the source and destination as opposed to area codes and personalize content based on the service provider s for example if the content originated on an IP network.

In another embodiment of a service provider routing text messages though the network as the text messages are processed the TSS may obtain metadata associated with the messages that includes coding data. By reading these codes the TSS may confirm that a given message is derived from a service provider such as Skype for delivery to an AT T subscriber. Such metadata may be obtained for example in a header file. Fields in the header file may be associated with a SPID. This may allow the TSS to determine that the text message is coming from Skype en route to AT T. If it were the case that many texts were originating from Skype at a particular time or day the TSS may utilize this data to assist third parties in providing targeted advertising content. The TSS may also utilize this data to identify the unnecessary usage of intermediaries in processing communications such as text messages and assist users in avoiding the excess charges for intermediaries by routing messages without using intermediaries.

In embodiments the TFMP may provide a Toll Free Texting and Smart Services Registry TSS to support toll free telephone numbers and related services such as SMS MMS and streaming media. The TSS may comprise several components such as but not limited to number administration call control and routing as well as number status assessment. The number administration function may provide number assignment for toll free subscribers as well as provide services to manage the toll free numbering plan. This component may provide for toll free number portability as well as managing the mapping of toll free numbers to geographic numbers. The number administration function may also open new number plan administration codes. The number administration function may forecast the exhaustion of codes and demand for codes for use by organizations such as the FCC. The call control and routing function may be responsible for providing intelligent routing for calls made to toll free numbers.

Toll free subscribers may have the ability to configure call routing to include multiple carriers time of day rules and rules based on the caller s proximity among others. These rules may be downloaded to real time network routing databases or Service Control Points SCPs . The number status assessment function may determine the availability of certain numbers. Numbers may be reserved and assigned according to activation date and then are deployed. The number status function may assess whether numbers are spare reserved assigned or currently deployed. Providers of various smart services such as voice media or texting services may be able to access the TSS that can be text enabled from a list of reserved assigned and working numbers. After numbers are identified an automated online letter of agency may be executed. The letter of agency may independently demonstrate authorization to a responsible organization that maintains the registration for individual toll free numbers in a distributed database. The distributed database may be associated with a distributed computing network as described herein. Upon execution of the letter of agency the information may then be provisioned to industry routing databases for delivering various services such as SMS text messaging MMS messaging and content streaming including but not limited to video content.

Letter of agency as used herein may include but is not limited to communication used by a toll free end subscriber such as during the provisioning phase of a toll free number engagement to enable that end subscriber to switch providers for a given telephone messaging service and the like. In an example an end subscriber may wish to change its long distance provider so that a local company need not be used. The long distance provider to whom the end subscriber wishes to do business would typically walk the end subscriber through an authorization process to enable the end subscriber to switch long distance carriers from the local company to the new company. This authorization may manifest in the carrier s system as a letter of agency that documents the needed approvals from the end subscriber. In an embodiment the TSS may enable a letter of agency process for a provider to authorize texting and other services on a toll free number or plurality of toll free numbers that are used by an end subscriber. The letter of agency may be electronically stored and presented to the responsible organization or owner of record for a given number or service. The letter of agency may further define a time frame during which certain actions such as the turning on of texting services for a toll free number are permitted. Such letters of agency as defined herein may be further associated with stored profiles of an owner of record and or end subscriber. A letter of agency may allow a toll free number end user or toll free number subscriber to authorize service enablement for services not covered by their existing responsible organization. In this way consumers can have multiple services enabled on a single telephone number across multiple service providers. In an example a letter of agency may authorize a responsible organization or other entity to take a plurality of actions so that additional communication with for example an end subscriber is unnecessary and actions may be taken more quickly and efficiently. This may enable service registrars and others to activate new services such as toll free texting services or bandwidth increases on a shorter timeline which may have commercial benefits as speed activation of needed telecommunications services.

In an embodiment the TSS may facilitate the enablement of a letter of agency process used to enable toll free texting capability and capture basic data such as customer name responsible organization service registrar toll free number service enablement date and letter of authorization agency status of services or some other type of data associated with toll free telephone numbers and services. The TSS may facilitate the letter of agency process by programmatically sending a notification to the responsible organization of record to memorialize the transaction. A timer may be set that will give the responsible organization a limited period of time to dispute the transaction. If no action is taken the transaction may proceed and texting service enablement or some other service type may be fulfilled in the TSS Registry. Continuing the example this letter of agency process may be provided for each toll free number that is provisioned in the TSS Registry or only a subset of numbers depending on the wishes of the end users. In order to streamline the letter of agency process a blanket letter of agency may be used whereby the customer of record may authorize a specific service registrar to provision update and deactivate records in the TSS as needed. In such cases a notification may be sent to the responsible organization to memorialize each transaction. In order to further streamline the letter of agency process responsible organization s may choose to put a blanket authorization on specific service registrar s which will allow the transaction to take place in real time.

In embodiments the TSS Registry as described herein may be an authoritative database of all or some subset of text enabled toll free numbers in North America. It may also contain the top level routing information in the form of a toll free service provider identifier TSPID used by the texting ecosystem to send messages to the proper toll free subscriber. Since a letter of agency is required for each toll free number that is enabled in the TSS the TSPID may become a centralized and authoritative source identifier and may be used in the provisioning of additional services associated with toll free numbers such as but not limited to MMS video conferencing and streaming data. Furthermore since part of the enablement process includes Responsible Organization authorization and or notification coupled with the direct connection to a voice telecommunications platform associated with the TFMP the TSPID may also serve to validate the authority of a call routing table.

With reference to a system according to various embodiments and which may be referred to in some instances herein as an intelligent platform platform or an architecture is operable to support the ever evolving toll free industry through the use of modern technologies which may include enhanced functionality and deliver improved cost efficiencies and quality of service.

With reference to in embodiments the TFMP may include a subsystem that enables distributed call collectors to collect data from various sources including service control points SCPs toll free service providers interexchange carriers and others. Data may be real time grouped aggregated and reduced based on toll free numbers and relevant parameters including but not limited to origination location originating area of service originating NPA ANI or some other criterion. Call counts may be calculated for high priority numbers. Data may be enriched with call duration information when it is available. This process may assist in reducing the overall data set size and speeding processing. A local NoSQL data store may be used to aggregate local trends and pre process raw data.

In embodiments once pre processing completes data may be shared in real time or near real time to a centralized analytics data store that is associated with the TFMP for more real time mapping and reduction. The analytics NoSQL datamart may combine data feeds from various service providers from the network and further reduce information to call counts call completion rates and call duration for high priority numbers. This subsystem of the TFMP may gather historical macroeconomic data from market sources like Bloomberg and Reuters and create a reference data store that groups and summarizes economic trends month over month. This subsystem may serve as a reference data source for the analysis inference and indexing system.

In embodiments this subsystem may collect historical call completion and call count data from high priority numbers and apply mapping and data reduction techniques to create historical baselines for calls. Calls may be sourced from market data sources data purchases data bartering from call sources or through some other type of data source. Call sampling and aggregation may be iteratively performed until a statistically significant dataset is created e.g. over a tuning period . Multi factor models may be created for correlating toll free call activity with selected macroeconomic trends backed by high priority numbers tied to businesses. For example calls to toll free numbers for employment commissions in the 50 states may be tied to a forward looking indicator for unemployment and consumer sentiment.

In another example historical changes in macroeconomic data may be plotted with changes in call metrics like call volume call duration or some other data related to toll free data. This may provide a correlation between telemetry and economic indicators. Financial modeling techniques may be applied and additional factors may be analyzed including but not limited to consumer sentiment including sentiment that is sourced by social media comments and online behaviors related to relevant topics e.g. questions regarding unemployment benefits or questions regarding food stamps . Interrelationships between indicators may also be analyzed. Credit card spending data may be an additional factor analyzed. These underlying factors may drive stochastic probabilities to determine a prediction model that may be utilized by the TFMP. The TFMP system may include a subsystem referred to as a node that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs to facilitate the stochastic probabilities to determine a prediction model. The decision tree may be used in various manners as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency. The output of the model may be a prediction trend that can forecast the probability of a relative positivity or negativity of the upcoming indicator. Data from the analytics data store and the historical trends data store may be analyzed through a multi factor model for deriving a macro economic trend indicator and a relative level of confidence with the trend.

In embodiments a client device such as an online and or a mobile application may allow users to filter search and sort trend data increase or reduce granularity include or exclude factors and zone in or drill down based on dimensions. For example a user may choose to include or exclude a state from the model to derive a trend prediction and a prediction confidence indicator. Alternatively or in addition a customizable user interface or dashboard may be utilized to provide access for third party data services sponsored data and information derived from toll free telecommunications networks including but not limited to telecommunications carriers service control points call centers or other parties affiliated with a toll free telecommunication network. As elsewhere described origination data may be combined with social media and other public domain third party data and near real time apply a valuation model to display a trends and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP. Further the user profile and security administration grants permissions to different groups of users to access embodiments of the system to create view update and activate certain functions. The system can implement a role based access control mechanism.

In embodiments this analytic subsystem of the TFMP may provide a flexible mapping interface for a user to enter their own data as part of an analysis. Once configured additional data sources may be added in real time or near real time through an API or a web interface to further refine the model based on customer specific data sets to make intelligent business decisions. The system may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment such systems may be hybrid networks including usage of a cellular telephone network and associated mobile communication devices such as smart phones a distributed cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization and any combination or sub combination of such networks .

The system may also provide a marketplace for data trading where subscribers can choose and buy data sources that are of interest to them to include in their analysis to further refine their predictive model. The system may facilitate the sale of data sources and assist in ensuring that the data uploaded and made available on the data market is scrubbed of personally identifiable or other sensitive data. For facilitating the data sale the system may charge a percentage of the sale proceeds in addition to an annual or monthly subscription fees. For consumers interested in a monthly subscription overall sentiment data may be made available through a number trend report. Alerts may be presented to users such as to a client device. The user may also access the reporting capabilities of the TFMP through a client device such as a personal computer mobile phone tablet computer or some other computing facility and receive data including multimedia to the user s client device. Functionalities of the TFMP include but are not limited to Number Administration NA and Customer Record CR administration.

In embodiments the TFMP may provide macroeconomic data trend over a network to a remote client device by providing a user interface dashboard to a user for installation on the remote client device receiving third party social media data modeling at least one of call duration or call count data with the third party social media data to derive a macroeconomic trend receiving a request from the remote client device to present the macroeconomic data trend generating an alert from the macroeconomic data trend that contains a stock name stock price and a universal resource locator URL which specifies the location of the data source and transmitting the alert over a communication channel to the remote client device associated with the user based upon a destination address and transmission schedule that is associated with the remote client device wherein the alert activates the user interface dashboard to cause the alert to display on the remote client device and to enable connection with the user interface dashboard when the remote client device is activated.

The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein 

A method of distributing a macroeconomic data trend over a network to a remote client device the method comprising 

With reference to in another embodiment a toll free management platform TFMP may refine a recommendation for a toll free number search via a recommendation engine that utilizes a searcher s profile to improve the search. The toll free management platform TFMP may utilize other assets of a toll free system generally such as carrier data location information regarding call origination payment data and so forth. The TFMP system may include a subsystem referred to as a node that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs. The decision tree may be used in various manners as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency. In one example the toll free number search may be based upon a customer s historical data such as prior search criteria and existing toll free numbers and thereby provide the customer suggestions or notification of toll free numbers that are available for use. This toll free number search may be based upon previous searches by either that customer and alternatively or in addition upon other customer searches.

The toll free number predictive search is operable to utilize multiple sources of data to extrapolate possible toll free numbers and those included in a Resp Org and or user s search history to include but not be limited to a current Resp Org inventory an overall search history lists of upcoming available numbers or some other type of data. Predictive analytics is an area of data mining that deals with extracting information from data and using it to predict trends and behavior patterns. The toll free number predictive search is operable for the user profile and security administration grants permissions to different groups of users to access embodiments of the system to create view update and activate certain functions. The system can implement a role based access control mechanism.

Predictive analytics utilized for the predictive search may encompass a variety of statistical techniques from predictive modeling machine learning and data mining that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about future or otherwise unknown events. Predictive analytics can be applied to any type of unknown whether it be in the past present or future. Predictive analytic services may also be provided that allow a user through the customizable user interface or dashboard to access third party data services sponsored data and information derived from toll free telecommunications networks including but not limited to telecommunications carriers service control points call centers or other parties affiliated with a toll free telecommunication network. As elsewhere described origination data may be combined with social media and other public domain third party data and near real time apply a valuation model to display a trends and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP.

The toll free number predictive search may check on the availability of a suggested toll free number before making a particular suggestion and may otherwise automatically reserve that toll free number based upon the customer selecting an automatically reserve option. That is the toll free number may be automatically reserved if it meets particular search criteria to essentially automate the reservation thereof. Further the automatic reservation may be a fee based function in which particular bidders are able to prioritize the choice of toll free numbers via particular fee based arrangements.

In embodiments initially a user may be provided the option to opt in to the toll free number predictive search feature as well as the option to automatically reserve toll free numbers determined to be available based upon the predictive search. That is rather than wait for a request a customer desired number is predicted offered and potentially reserved. The user may also access the reporting capabilities of the TFMP through a client device such as a personal computer mobile phone tablet computer or some other computing facility and receive data including multimedia to the user s client device. Functionalities of the TFMP include but are not limited to Number Administration NA and Customer Record CR administration. It should be appreciated that other options may be alternatively or additionally provided.

In one disclosed non limiting embodiment of a method for operation of a toll free number predictive search is initiated via accessing a Resp Org s search history step . Numerous criteria may be used when searching for toll free numbers including the use of wildcards words translated to numbers and the like. The search may be performed at both a Resp Org level and broken down by a user as well. This history may be one of the factors used in providing suggestions. Typically an inventory of toll free numbers associated with a particular Resp Org as well as an inventory of available toll free numbers is accessible. Next the toll free number predictive search feature may utilize an algorithm that would for example using the data noted above produce a list of customer desired toll free numbers for the customer step . For example the algorithm may use any and or all of the following information to make a search recommendation 

The predictive search results may facilitate a standing willingness for a customer to pay for a particular toll free number and thus automatically reserve the predicted toll free number step . For example once a toll free number is identified various offers may be made available via an auction payment to be first in line subscription offerings and others. Finally a plurality of options may be provided when the customer receives the predictive search results step such as but not limited to

A subscriber to basic telephone service is assigned a telephone number that identifies the service and is billed for calls originated from the telephone line associated with the service. In contrast with toll free service the subscriber is assigned a toll free telephone number and is billed for all calls terminated to that number. There is no charge to the originator of the toll free call.

Toll free number portability made it possible for any company to provide service for any available toll free number. FCC Tariff No. 1 800 Service Management system functions specified the functionality of a Service Management system that would be operated by the Bell Operating Companies BOCs . One embodiment of a tariff is Tariff F.C.C. No. 1 800 Service Management System Functions Issued Jan. 31 2013 Effective Feb. 15 2013. A disclosed embodiment originally developed and maintained by Bellcore facilitates a company that wishes to provide toll free service referred to as a Responsible organization Resp Org toll free service provider to obtain control of toll free numbers and provision of the information in the network needed to route calls to a designated terminating number. This information is sometimes referred to as a Customer Record. This tariff outlines the requirements for becoming a toll free service provider the capabilities required of the disclosed embodiment to allow toll free service providers to search for and reserve toll free numbers and provision Customer Record information and how toll free service providers may be to be billed for use of the disclosed embodiment and control of toll free numbers.

With geographic portability made possible through the use of centralized routing databases it became possible for the same toll free number to be dialed from anywhere in the country and for the toll free call to be delivered to different destinations based on routing criteria specified in the Customer Record. Toll free service quickly grew in popularity and the supply of available 800 numbers neared exhaustion. The toll free code 888 was opened in 1996 followed by 877 in 1998 866 in 2000 and 855 in 2010. Plans may be underway for opening of the 844 code in the near future and the FCC tariff has designated the future use of the 833 and 822 codes. As the value of toll free service and the advantages to having a meaningful combination of digits in a toll free number referred to as a vanity number became increasingly apparent numerous companies became toll free service providers and established businesses selling toll free service. Today there may be more than 450 toll free service providers including telecommunications network providers resellers and independent organizations.

To understand routing of toll free calls it may be useful to understand how routing is performed for standard i.e. not toll free calls.

With reference to the North American Numbering Plan NANP introduced in the 1940s established the 10 digit telephone number format used in the United States Canada and neighboring countries in the Caribbean. The format shown in consists of a three digit Numbering Plan Area NPA code and a seven digit telephone number that includes three digits that identify an office code or local exchange and four digits that identify the individual number within the office code. The NPA or area code uniquely identifies a geographic area the office code uniquely identifies a central office switching system historically referred to as an exchange within an NPA and the line number points to the service components and dedicated resources in the switching system that provide the service instance identified by the line number.

When toll free service was introduced in 1967 telephone calls were routed using information provisioned in each Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN local switching system. A routing table specified how the switch should process an originating call based on the digits dialed by the calling party and the arrangement of facilities that connected the switch to other switches. A switch has direct connections to other switches in the same area and connections to intermediate switches called tandems that provide the next hop toward other switches operated by the same company. Additional connections to specialized tandems provide access to long distance networks to transport calls to switches outside the local area. The local area where a company provides services is known as a Local Access and Transport Area LATA .

The NPA or NPA NXX of the dialed called party number identifies an entry in the routing table that points to the route needed to transport the call toward the terminating switch that serves the dialed line number. Initially calls within a local area only required 7 digit dialing just the NXX and the final 4 digits but as the demand for telephone numbers grew additional area codes were opened within a local area and it became necessary to dial 10 digits for both local and long distance calls. If the digits dialed may be for an NPA NXX served by the same switch the routing table can indicate that a call should be offered to the subscriber identified by the telephone number. If the digits dialed indicate a NPA NXX not served by the switch the routing table can point to a route to a neighboring local switch a local tandem or a long distance tandem.

Unlike a typical NPA the 800 code introduced to identify toll free numbers does not identify a unique area to which a call can be routed. To support toll free service additional entries had to be made in each local switch routing table to indicate the route for an 800 NXX code. Calling a particular 800 number was limited to the local switches that had been provisioned with routing information for that number. Additionally further routing information was required at a terminating switch to map the 800 number to the terminating line.

In the early 1980s AT T introduced centralized call routing databases to handle routing of 800 calls. With a centralized database it was not necessary to provision routing information for toll free numbers in every local switch. Instead switches were configured to query the database for routing information when it was recognized that an 800 number had been dialed. The database can be provisioned with routing information to direct a call to a route based on many factors providing flexibility and removing the association of an 800 number to a specific local switch. This made it possible for a company to own a national 800 number and for calls to that number to be routed to a different local switch depending on where the call originated or the time of day. The flexibility provided by centralized call routing databases also enabled any carrier to provide service for any 800 number. Both geographic and carrier portability for toll free service had become possible.

Today in addition to toll free calling services like local number portability operator services and Advanced Intelligent Network AIN features make use of advanced routing capabilities enabled by signaling system 7 SS7 .

With reference to in the SS7 network the local switch is known as a Service Switching Point SSP . A Signal Transfer Point STP provides routing of SS7 messages and databases with call routing and feature information may be known as Service Control Points SCP . To enable advanced routing via a centralized database local switch routing tables may be configured to trigger a query to a database for additional call processing instructions based on various criteria.

In the case of a toll free call origination the switch can recognize the 8XX code in the dialed digits and launch a query to an SCP for routing information using the SS7 Signaling Connection Control Part SCCP protocol to transport a Transaction Capabilities Application Part TCAP query.

As shown in the query may be routed by an STP to an SCP that has been provisioned with the information that describes how to route the toll free call. In some cases the initial SCP that is queried by the local switch can return information that can cause the call to be routed to a switch operated by another carrier where a subsequent query to a different SCP can be performed to obtain the routing information needed to direct the call to the destination.

The routing information consisting of a carrier code and terminating number is returned in a TCAP response to the originating switch. The switch uses the information to select a route from its routing database and continues processing of the toll free call.

Toll free number administration includes management of number assignment and provisioning of customer records. This section describes the toll free business the key stakeholders roles and responsibilities and disclosed embodiment capabilities.

Key aspects of the toll free number business may be described by the FCC tariff. This tariff describing regulations rates and charges applying to the provisioning of functions and support services was first released in 1993. Updates have occurred since with the latest released January 2013 becoming effective in February 2013. This tariff describes the undertakings of the company responsible for the disclosed embodiment and the capabilities required of embodiments of the system itself. It defines key terminology and specifies the responsibilities of toll free service providers who may be the primary users of the disclosed embodiment. It also provides a schedule of rates and charges with regulations for billing toll free service providers for disclosed embodiment access and usage. System requirements defined by this or any other tariff may be provided in Business Rules Section.

Some key participants in the toll free business and the interactions between them may be illustrated in . Note that a primary geographic area for the toll free business is the United States Canada and other areas where the NANP is used.

A toll free subscriber contacts a toll free service provider to order toll free service. The toll free service provider may be a carrier who operates a network or may have a relationship with a network provider in order to enable service. The toll free service provider has an interface to the disclosed embodiment to search the pool of unassigned toll free numbers and reserve one or more for use by the toll free subscriber. Working with the toll free subscriber the Resp. Org determines how calls to the toll free number should be routed.

On behalf of the toll free subscriber the toll free service provider enters a Customer Record in the disclosed embodiment that specifies routing and carrier information for the toll free number. The disclosed embodiment sends this information to the SCPs that control real time routing of calls in the network. When the SCPs have received the routing information in the customer record toll free service is enabled for the toll free number.

The toll free subscriber has a business relationship with the toll free service provider to pay for toll free service. The toll free service provider has a relationship with the TFMP to pay for access to the disclosed embodiment and use of the toll free number assigned to the toll free subscriber.

There may be a number of stakeholders that play key roles in the toll free business which may include those that follow 

FCC The FCC is the federal agency that has responsibility for the FCC tariff that specifies the need for a toll free number Service Management system and defines the regulations rates and charges applicable for the use of system functions and support services. The FCC may approve changes to rates or other aspects of the FCC tariff.

The TFMP The TFMP is responsible for the administration and operations of the disclosed embodiment and enforcement of the regulations outlined by a tariff. The TFMP may retain a number of contractors to assist with the activities required to manage the disclosed embodiment and related functions including maintaining the disclosed embodiment software running the data centers that house the disclosed embodiment performing routine and corrective maintenance activities on the disclosed embodiment hardware handling billing for access and use of the disclosed embodiment and running the help desk to handle questions and requests from disclosed embodiment users.

Administrators and the TFMP Help Desk personnel can access the disclosed embodiment. Administrators can enter and maintain configuration and reference information needed for operation of the disclosed embodiment. Help Desk personnel can assist with troubleshooting access and Customer Record issues complete TFMP Requests and submit trouble reports.

Toll Free Subscribers Toll free subscribers may be the end users of toll free service. Toll free service includes a toll free telephone number and the network capabilities that enable calls to a toll free number to be delivered to a designated terminating number according to conditions specified by the toll free subscriber. Toll free service is obtained from a toll free service provider.

Toll free service providers aka Resp Orgs Toll free service providers may be responsible for the overall coordination required to provision maintain and test toll free service. A toll free service provider may be a carrier that operates a network or instead could be an independent company or organization that interfaces with a carrier to arrange toll free service. Toll free service providers may be the primary users of disclosed embodiment. In embodiments the system may be used to search for and reserve toll free numbers for subscribers and provision Customer Records that provide the network with the information needed to route toll free calls. Toll free service providers may be billed for access and use of the disclosed embodiment and control of toll free numbers on a monthly basis as described by a tariff.

Toll free service providers often maintain sub organizations based on geography or other organization classifications. The toll free service provider entity is the top level organization against which reservation limits may be imposed represented by the first 2 digits of toll free service provider ID in the current system . The sub organization within a toll free service provider entity represented by the full 5 digit toll free service provider ID in the current system is referred to as a toll free service provider unit. The toll free service provider users who access the disclosed embodiment can be associated with a toll free service provider unit and the corresponding toll free service provider entity. A toll free service provider entity may manage many toll free service provider units each having a unique toll free service provider ID.

SCP Owners Operators SCP O O SCPs may be the databases in the SS7 network that contain the information used to route toll free calls. SCP Owners Operators contract with the TFMP to receive updates from the disclosed embodiment. An interface is established between the disclosed embodiment and the SCPs so Customer Record information can be provisioned to SCPs to enable the real time routing of toll free calls. SCP O Os may be billed for this service.

At SCP O O companies the SCP administrator is responsible for establishing reference data about the SCPs and their corresponding SS7 networks. The administrator also manages tables at the SCP node and the Call Management Services Database CMSDB within the SCP to set controls and limits for SCP operations. They may be permitted to access and change data only for the O O s SCPs in the SS7 network.

A network manager is a member of Network Management Center NMC or Network Operations Center NOC at the SCP O O company staff responsible for managing mass calling surveillance and control capabilities in its managed SS7 networks.

Billing Administrator This function coordinates the Billing of all customers using information provided in the disclosed embodiment.

Industry and Regulatory Liaison This function uses information in the disclosed embodiment to respond to inquiries or to make inquiries to the regulatory bodies.

Carriers Actual telephone entity that carries the toll free call. Carriers operate networks that process telephone calls. Local Exchange Carriers LECs operate end office switches that provide access service to subscribers and carry calls within a local area known as a LATA. Interexchange carriers IC carry calls between local areas. A subscriber receives service from a local exchange carrier and designates the default IC to carry calls between LATAs. Historically local carriers and ICs were distinct but today a carrier can be both a LEC and an IC. A carrier may also be an SCP O O or a carrier may obtain SS7 signaling and database services from a separate SCP O O.

With reference to in one disclosed embodiment the architecture for a solution for toll free with key enhancements to support the unique requirements for toll free number administration and call routing is illustrated.

With reference to in one disclosed embodiment the architecture provides number administration capabilities for toll free numbers facilitating integration between PSTN and an IP network. This unified platform can serve both PSTN and IP enabled numbers.

Toll free subscribers work with Resp Orgs to search and reserve toll free numbers. Responsible organizations continue to populate the disclosed architecture with CICs for PSTN numbers and an NS Records for IP enabled numbers.

The disclosed embodiments of the architecture can store additional metadata for example toll free CNAM industry code description license status trade group affiliations BBB ratings and such for the toll free organization. As the transition completes toll free calls would provide consumer assurance through a validated neutral third party trust chain to significantly improve consumer confidence and prevent identity fraud.

In addition to the NS Record for the iSCP Resp Orgs can choose to configure aspects of the routing logic with the disclosed architecture second dip . They can map a SIP URI to a toll free record. In this example scenario a Resp Org would copy over that information with the iSCPs. In addition to the enhanced aspects of the iSCP the iSCP may also facilitate direct IP interconnects between RespOrgs and their service providers if desired through sharing additional metadata about a route.

With reference to Toll free numbers unlike mobile and landline numbers have evolved to be a branding and identity vehicle. Companies are increasingly using their toll free numbers along with their online assets to provide an integrated customer experience. With this growth availability of vanity numbers has become sparse and demand is increasing. In embodiments a toll free tagging service may be provided that includes a subscription based service that is made available to Responsible Organizations Resp Orgs consumers and businesses. The toll free tagging service may provide the ability to tag a toll free number or group of numbers and once a number is tagged to track updates to that number e.g. a change in ownership change in availability increase in search statistics that may then be distributed pushed to customers through emails text messages or other means. Subscribers of the toll free tagging service may also have the ability to create view update and delete tags through a web application mobile application or some other user interface.

The toll free tagging service may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment the toll free tagging service may be utilized via hybrid networks including usage of a cellular telephone network and associated mobile communication devices such as smart phones a distributed cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization and any combination or sub combination of such networks . The toll free tagging service may permit the user to access the reporting capabilities of the TFMP through a client device such as a personal computer mobile phone tablet computer or some other computing facility and receive data including multimedia to the user s client device. Functionalities of the TFMP include but are not limited to Number Administration NA and Customer Record CR administration.

In embodiments subscribers may be provided options to create custom toll free number tags based on keywords using a website. Subscribers may have the option to choose for example 

In embodiments the system may ingest data from a plurality of sources including but not limited to the following 

In embodiments the TFMP may allow for differentiated services based on subscriptions through a user interface . For example service offerings may be tiered 

In embodiments the tagging service of the TFMP may provide an unbiased valuation for a number or group of numbers based on several factors including but not limited to 

In embodiments the tagging service of the TFMP may source data from distributed data sniffers that reside in networks to see dip rate and dip volume for popular numbers. This data may be compiled with other data sources including for example Google and Alexa trends or other web traffic data and analytics for tags and provide a heat map that shows hot spots for where the numbers are in demand and who is calling these numbers nationally and internationally. In another example a view may be provided that is a near real time valuation trend e.g. analogous to a stock ticker for say the top 10 tags numbers by state city. Current methods are limited in that they cannot combine call origination data with social media and other public domain data and near real time apply a valuation model to display a trends and prices on an interactive map however the methods and systems of the TFMP enable such functionality.

The toll free tagging service may alternatively or additionally utilize the TFMP system and may include a subsystem referred to as a node that may be used to build a decision tree that is downloaded to the SCPs. The decision tree may be used in various manners as otherwise described to facilitate call efficiency. Tagging data associated with toll free numbers may be used including with real time network information and static call routing information to create a real time call path score. In an example a toll free number that is associated with spoofing or other fraudulent call activity may be tagged as a problematic number and a call route assigned to it to minimize the financial impact of receiving a high volume of fraudulent calls to the toll free number. SCPs may also be a source of real time call routing data and data used for tagging purposes. Using this information facilitates extrapolation and determination of uptime downtime congestion geographical movement and economic movement of people communicating via calls. Based on real time data that can be obtained from the SCPs and from the network the TFMP may create a score that can be assigned to each call decision node. Such a score may also be used for the purposes of tagging. Similar to a mapping algorithm that uses distance and speed limit given a starting point and a destination the quickest or shortest map may be mapped. Changes in the call routing tree may be dependent upon an update to the routing tree that is then validated by the TFMP and then downloaded to the SCPs. With the use of real time data and more network decisions nodes added to a call routing tree based on the needs of the end subscriber the TFMP may provide the ability to allow an end subscriber to have real time business continuity for their toll free number instead of having to contact their service provider or getting a ticket opened to update their routing tree and then having it download to all the SCPs for the new routing to take place. In embodiments a call path score and real time routing may be based on the best possible availability score. This may also be modified by the TFMP to allow for lowest cost score based on the per call and per minute cost for particular carrier. The call score may be updated during low activity periods with a date time stamp associated with it. This may allow real time or near real time detection of a path s status. Upon completion of a call down a particular path the TFMP may also update the call path score and the data used for the purposes of tagging. Further real time status changes in a telecommunications network the performance of a given call route or some other status change may be used as additional tagging data. In an example a toll free number that may experience a season high demand may begin to operate less efficiently this metadata may be tagged to the toll free number for use in for example predictive analytics provided by the TFMP regarding temporal changes in call activities and the optimization of certain call routes. Toll free numbers tagged as having significant seasonal variation in call volume or some other criterion may have additional enhanced routing trees created for the purpose of handling peak seasonal call demands. A plurality of tagged numbers may be further associated with a TSPID so that a common entity associated with the toll free numbers may be identified.

In embodiments number trend optimization may be provided by the TFMP in order to provide recommendations to target the right audience for a number. Recommendations may include marketing a number on a certain media within a certain geography to promote calls to the right customer. Call origination data in partnership with the call originators and service control points SCPs will be sources to provide effectiveness metrics to users based on for example originating numbers and derived call success rates based on average call duration and call completion. The toll free tagging service may alternatively or additionally be utilized with predictive analytic services that allow a user through the customizable user interface or dashboard to access third party data services sponsored data and information derived from toll free telecommunications networks including but not limited to telecommunications carriers service control points call centers or other parties affiliated with a toll free telecommunication network. As elsewhere described origination data may be combined with social media and other public domain third party data and near real time apply a valuation model to display a trend and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP.

The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein 

With reference to routing information in NS records may be downloaded to originating service provider SP ENUM or similar directory for call control. PSTN Call originations can continue existing PSTN 8xx call flow.

IP call originations can use an intelligent ENUM like and SIP enabled intelligent Service Control Point iSCP . In embodiments many geographically redundant highly available iSCP servers can reside in the originating service providers or provided by independent third parties. iSCPs can operate in mixed mode SIP and PSTN or be exclusively SIP. iSCPs provide ENUM like functionality enhanced with intelligent routing capabilities required for toll free routing.

For IP call originations the originating service provider queries its local naming ENUM like capability server for call routing. The SP ENUM or similar service delegates the 8xx number queries to the iSCPs similar to level 2 DNS . iSCPs execute intelligent call routing logic and return a SIP Redirect with a URI for the SIP gateway of the toll free service provider. The originating service provider can then route the SIP INVITE to the terminating toll free subscriber s service provider.

For IP calls terminating to the PSTN network the originating service provider queries its ENUM server similar to IP termination as described above with the iSCP returning the URI for a PSTN gateway.

Toll free numbers follow the NANP 10 digit format NPA NXX XXXX used for all telephone numbers in North America. A toll free NPA designated by the FCC such as 800 or 888 identifies a number as a toll free number. Toll free numbering may follow the E.164 format for identifying telephone numbers. The disclosed embodiment maintains status and associated information for the complete pool of toll free numbers.

The Number Administration function provides the ability for a user to perform any of the following capabilities 

Except when noted otherwise all number reservations may be taken and processed on a first come first served basis. In embodiments this may be due to a tariff requirement and true regardless of the source of the request.

A status is associated with each toll free number that changes based on user actions to search for and reserve numbers and to provision and delete Customer Records for a number. Other status changes may be made automatically by embodiments of the system based on rules specified by a tariff.

For all statuses except usually SPARE and UNAVAILABLE a toll free service provider entity may be associated with the number. This association begins when the toll free service provider entity takes control of the number by completing a reservation. Except when noted otherwise all number reservations may be taken on a first come first served basis.

With reference to in another embodiment for one click activation a widget may be embedded within a webpage to facilitate reservation of a toll free number via a user interface . The term widget as used herein may refer to a client side browser based application which displays data coming from different sources. In an embodiment the widget may also be used on a mobile device as a mobile app. The embedded widget may communicate with a server using an API such as secure Restful API.

The widget may be embedded within a webpage with HTML tags. The complexity and logic may thus be hidden in the Javascript that resides on the server . Loading the widget on to the hosting webpage may be performed through a bootstrap script that for example may be written as a Javascript file or in some other language that resides in the server . A script tag can then be used to invoke loading this thereby loading the bootstrap.

Generally there are two ways to embed the content on the hosting webpage using IFrame or using DOM in Javascript and placing it within the host site or a combination thereof. The host page may be a client website within which the widget is embedded.

Communication technology may include HTML5 JavaScript CSS JSON and Restful API and services. The client may utilize HTML5 Javascript or CSS whereas the server may provide the Restful API and services. In order for the widget to communicate with the host page or if the widget needs to send data to the server based on what is being used it can be performed using Normal Post AJAX asynchronously or some other process. In order for cross domain communication between the host page embedded code or IFrame HTML 5 s API called postMessage may be used. JSON is a file format that is understood by both client and server and hence may be also be readily used for data representation and transfer.

With reference to various methods may be utilized to secure this communication. The widget may include a login feature in order to use the services. After initial credential validation with username and password tokens may be provided to users. This may be used in the subsequent communication back to the server. In the alternative API keys may be used. On authentication and authorization various search reserve activation and confirmation elements may be provided.

With reference to one disclosed non limiting embodiment of a method may be initiated by loading the webpage step then lazy loading the widget step . That is the lazy loading may be utilized to minimize any effect upon the loading speed of the webpage . Once the widget is loaded step the login and search features step are provided such that reservation activation may be initiated.

The widget may be particularly beneficial to a business owner and or Resp Org Toll Free Service Provider. The business owner who visits a web page may view the widget that includes a statement such as for example Reserve your Toll Free Number or Do you have your Toll Free Number with a ready presented text field to search for a desired Toll Free Number or to enter their business name. A list of appropriate or related toll free numbers and an option to reserve and activate is thereby provided in a one click or relatively one click manner.

For a Resp Org Toll Free Service Provider the widget can be embedded in their portal. The widget provides a login page such that the widget provides a text field to reserve toll free numbers along with a drop down list of numbers that expire in the next month and a popup link to extend. A popup link may also provide historical information such as their last actions. The widget may also display a popup link to display status of the toll free numbers in which a user previously indicated interest.

In the toll free industry it currently is a multi step process to obtain a toll free number and submit a request to active that number. It requires the user to first search and reserve a number and then in a separate transaction often on a separate user screen input the information to create a toll free number routing record that is sent to the service control points SCPs thus activating the number for use. According to embodiments of the present disclosure users may complete such a request related to activation of a toll free number in a single user interaction with the system providing minimal information. This process may provide a one click type functionality hereinafter referred to as one click activate to activate the number and will in the same single step user activation search for the toll free number based upon user criteria. Initiation of the one click activation may be facilitated by the use of a widget as described herein such as a widget operating on a client device. In embodiments a one click activate request may be a request from a user to 1 search for a number or multiple numbers that fit a provided search criteria 2 reserve the number s matching the criteria and 3 activate the number s using a selected customer record template as described herein and producing a pointer record. The final result of this request will be a toll free number assigned to the user s Resp Org that has a customer pointer record assigned to it.

In embodiments a user may utilize a new user interface screen including but not limited to a customizable dashboard as described herein that may be accessed from a landing page of the user interface that is associated with the TFMP. The new screen may be referred to as the Search Reserve Active also referred to herein as the S R A from the landing page. A user may be required to have the correct permissions to be able to perform these actions such as 

The S R A may also provide for predictive analytic services that may be provided to a user through the customizable user interface or dashboard to access third party data services sponsored data and information derived from toll free telecommunications networks including but not limited to telecommunications carriers service control points call centers or other parties affiliated with a toll free telecommunication network. As elsewhere described origination data may be combined with social media and other public domain third party data and near real time apply a valuation model to display a trends and prices on an interactive map via the TFMP.

In embodiments the S R A screen may be a clone of a number search screen that is associated with the TFMP and have but not be limited to the following screen design elements 

With reference to a sample UI design is provided. The UI may alternatively or additionally be embodied in a distributed computing environment such as a cloud based computing network. In another embodiment the UI may be hybrid networks including usage of a cellular telephone network and associated mobile communication devices such as smart phones a distributed cloud network and an enterprise network associated with a carrier or other business organization and any combination or sub combination of such networks .

In embodiments when a user selects the S R A function of the landing page the system may retrieve a list of customer template records that have been defined for a Resp Org. If this Resp Org does not have any customer template records defined the user may receive a message notifying the user of a lack of required definition such as E205 Search Reserve Activate functionality requires the users Resp Org to have at least one customer template record defined. Your Resp Org does not. The user may then be returned to the Landing page. If the Resp Org does have customer template records defined the customer template record names may be displayed in a scrolling list on the screen. The user may then select one of the customer template records for use in the request.

In embodiments a user may select a number search criterion that provides the ability to specify a specific number a number with wildcard selection or the NPA NXX and line number selections. The user may elect to have a set of default information template effective date and service order number and so forth associated with their Resp Org and or user ID. Rather than select these items the user may elect to use default values that are provided thus expediting the process even further. The user may also elect not to use the default values and may then supply the values. The search process may also include utilizing predictive analytics of the TFMP as described herein in order to learn more about the history and metadata that is associated with a number. Toll free numbers including those that are reserved and or activated using the one click activation may be tagged using the methods and systems described herein according to criteria of interest to a user. In an example a user may search for toll free numbers based on a predictive analytic result of toll free numbers the TFMP has determined are active in the New England area. Predictive analytic results may also relate to specific populations of interest to a user e.g. New York residents behavioral data or some other data parameter.

In embodiments a number may then be reserved and or activated and tagged by the user as a number that is relevant to the New England marketplace. Prior to reserving or activating a number a user may also check a TFMP registry to determine if there is a history of reports of abuse associated with the number for example frequent fraudulent calls i.e. spoofing . The user may tag toll free numbers in order to note this history of abuse or other factor of interest for future searches and reserved or activated numbers may be associated with a toll free service provider identifier TSPID . The TSPID may be an existing TSPID that the user has or as part of the one click to activate method and system a new TSPID may be created for the user. The user may select a customer template record from a list to be used when creating a pointer record used to active toll free number s . The user may select only one customer template record to be used and that template record may be used with every number requested in this particular request. The user may select an effective date and time for the request. The user may further specify a future date and time or select now for immediate processing. Formatting and validation criteria may also be provided. The user may complete additional fields as necessary for a pointer record to be created 

In embodiments once all the required fields are populated the user may select the Activate New Number button to start the process. The process may include the search of and reservation for the toll free number s and the submission of a request to create a pointer record for the number s . Errors encountered along the way may result in an error being reported back to the user for that number. In an example requests of more than ten numbers may be processed in the background from the perspective of the user. The user s request may be validated and the user provided a request ID. Control of the one click activate function may be given back to the user with a notice that they will be informed when the request completes. In another example requests for ten or fewer numbers may be processed in real time and the results are returned to the user when the request completes.

In embodiments the one click activate function may perform a search and reserve function for all the requested numbers in blocks of up to ten numbers depending upon how many numbers are requested. The activation function of the process may require a separate system request for each number being activated. The one click activate function may control the processing of the individual requests so that from a user standpoint it appears as a single user interaction with the system and a response does not go back to the user until the process has been completed. Once the request has completed processing the one click activate function may display back to the user in the search results area of the screen e.g. ten or fewer numbers the list of numbers and information about them similar to how it is done with the search and reserve functionality as described herein. For more than for example ten numbers the results may be made available in the communication area off the landing page.

In embodiments a parking lot functionality may allow a user to go through a similar one click activate process but instead of establishing specific routing for a number via a customer record template the user may define the routing for this number as parked. Parked in this context means that the number may have a default routing to a pre defined customer announcement so the number can be activated without a final determination of the routing and when called the user may be presented with this announcement stating the service this number provides is not currently available.

The following are illustrative clauses demonstrating non limiting embodiments of the disclosure described herein 

A representative flow operation showing the current system common number status transitions for activation of a toll free service starting with a number in SPARE status is shown in . Transitions that may not be part of the typical flow may not be illustrated in including transition from WORKING to ASSIGNED and ASSIGNED to RESERVED as well as transitions to and from UNAVAILABLE status. SUSPEND DISCONNECT and TRANSITIONAL features may be provided. This flow is shown to facilitate understanding of system status transitions as may be understood by the customers.

A description of possible number status transitions is provided in the below table. This flow is shown to facilitate understanding of system status transitions as is understood by the customers and is not a dictate of limitations thereto.

The below delineated example use cases may be generic in showing the flow for multiple specific cases as defined in the particular example use case.

In addition to the existing number search and reserve functionality noted above embodiments of the disclosed architecture may support search and reserve features. Description of at least some of these is provided at a relatively high level describing the business functionality required as follows 

As an example use case to update Information such as dates contact info etc. for number s associated with a toll free service provider may be provided as follows 

There may be a number of tasks where a system administrator enters values for configuration parameters that control an aspect of system functionality. A pre condition is that the user is a system administrator with permissions to perform the specific administrative task.

If the user input is not valid or some other condition prevents successful completion of the use case embodiments of the system can inform the user of an error.

There may be additional features the embodiments of the disclosed architecture may include those that follow 

The Customer Record Administration CRA functions may be those concerned with the input validation processing and management of the toll free Customer Records CRs . These may also include the processes by which embodiments of the system can upload relevant customer record data to the SCP toll free databases in the public network to enable their processing of SS7 toll free database queries. Multi number and mass change capabilities impacting CRs may also be included in CRA functionality.

The system s CRA functions support interactions with external users or systems at the toll free service provider to create and update the customer records. Additional interactions may be supported with telecommunications carriers to approve and or be notified of CR updates that impact toll free calling traffic in their respective networks i.e. Carrier Notification and Approval CNA functions. Further interactions may be supported with respect to the Local Exchange Carriers LECs including Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ILECs Competing Local Exchange Carriers CLECs other IntraLATA carriers and CCS network operators whose networks may be involved in terminating the toll free calls to the toll free subscriber lines and whose reference data and others can be used to validate certain call routing instructions in the CRs. These latter capabilities may be referred to as IntraLATA Carrier Management ICM functions.

After a toll free number TFN is reserved by a toll free service provider s toll free service provider it should be assigned to a customer and Customer Records CRs for that TFN may be created in the disclosed embodiment ultimately resulting in their downloading to Service Control Points SCPs and the activation of service for the toll free subscriber the customer in the public network.

A CR contains both customer administrative data and call routing information for a customer s toll free service. In particular it defines important aspects of the service including the originating Area of Service AOS the geographic area from which calls to the toll free number can be allowed and the rules for translation of the toll free number to call routing instructions. The call routing instructions may include Destination Telephone Number s to which the toll free calls may be routed the Carrier Identification Code CICs of telecommunications carriers whose networks may be used for IntraLATA and InterLATA calls and call announcement treatment instructions for those cases in which the toll free calls should not be routed further.

Each TFN may have several CRs associated with it each containing the toll free service information to take effect at a given date and time i.e. the Effective Date and Time of the CR . Once established service for a customer may be modified or disconnected via subsequent future dated CRs. Future pending CRs then replace the active CR when their effective dates and times may be reached.

At the effective date and time a subset of the active CR s data applicable to toll free database query processing is then downloaded to the applicable SCPs in the public network replacing overwriting any previous SCP customer record in effect for that TFN. Only one CR may be the active CR in embodiments of the system reflecting the current toll free service for a given TFN.

Each type of CR may have a required common administrative data portion and more complex optionally populated Call Processing Record CPR data portions for more complex routing scenarios. The CPR portion facilitates a tree structure for the specification of variable branching call routing logic based on various decision criteria decision nodes and the resulting translations to destination numbers and carriers or announcement treatments action nodes . CPRs may be used within Regular CRs and Template Records.

In embodiments the platform may include a customer record template builder. The process and tools currently available for building a complex customer record may be single threaded and cumbersome. In addition a tool may be required that works intelligently with the user to interpret natural language input to produce a complex customer record while using existing user records and usage data to prepopulate information for the user. This tool may be intuitive such that a first time user could build a complex record without hours of training.

The Customer Record Template Builder CRTB can allow toll free providers to easily build a complex customer record template using a simple UI that can then let that record be designated at the default customer record. A toll free provider can build multiple complex customer record templates for their use and to define a record as the default customer record allowing the user to select the default with a single click thus significantly reducing their work effort.

The CRTB can lead the user thru both the initial customer data population known as the CAD portion but also the call routing logic known as the CPR portion utilizing a simple UI using a decision tree logic structure with defined data nodes. Based upon the decisions at those nodes the UI can drive down a branch to a new decision node ultimately driving the customer record decision logic to the lowest level.

A decision tree can represent a series of decision points. Each decision point is called a node and off each node is one of more branches. The point at which there may be no more decisions to be made is called a leaf and is used as the end point of a branching structure. See for a generic visualization of this structure.

The CAD portion of the CRTB can logically lead the user to populate the example following pieces of information 

In this relatively simple example starting from the left most branched path the 3 decision paths corresponding to the decision trees branched paths can be represented as 

The CRTB toll can be built in such a manner to allow a customer works his her way down the decision tree and anticipate pre populate information based upon the information already provided in this build or also information provided in previous customer record entries. Once a default customer record template is built the system can build the capability to invoke this template when creating a customer record for a new number thus reducing the time and effort for a customer record to be built.

The CPR portion of the CR may provide a mechanism for users to specify branching call routing and call treatment logic involving multiple destination numbers and multiple carriers based on one or more decision criteria. The decision criteria include aspects of the toll free call such as its originating geographic area the originating state CCS network NPA LATA NPANXX etc. to be mapped by the SCP based on the calling party number and other attributes of the query and the date time of day and day of week of the query among other variables.

The CPR is linked to the CAD portion of a regular customer record by the referenced TFN and the Effective Date and Time. The CPR portion is also used in Template Records. When used in a Template record the CPR portion is linked to the Template Record by the referenced Template Name and Effective Date and Time in the equivalent TAD portion of the Template Record.

The logical branch points of the CPR decision tree may be specified within one or more decision nodes along each traversable branched path. The resulting call processing actions including the translation of the toll free number to specific destination numbers call routing via specific carriers or the announcement treatment for non routed calls may be specified in action nodes at the ends of each path. Each path logically begins at the dialed toll free number being translated progresses through one or more decision nodes that define the call criteria and ends at one or more action nodes. Each possible path through the decision tree from root to the end of each branched path may be conceived of as a row in a logical data table or matrix. Each row may contain numerous decision nodes defining the set of criteria to be matched by the call attributes for a call routing case path and may end with one or two action nodes.

The CPR decision nodes supported by the data model according to one embodiment can include one or more of the following 

The action nodes supported by the data model according to one embodiment at the ends of a given branch can include 

Logically decision nodes can have more than one argument for their included decision criteria e.g. a list of more than one originating NPA or more than 1 day of the week and there may be multiple decision nodes used in combination to define each branched path row . Each action node may have at most one outcome in the call routing logic. Null empty values for a decision node within a row convey its decision criteria is not to be part of the matched criteria defining the decision case for that row i.e. that any value for that call parameter can suffice . A conceptual view of a CPR routing tree example is illustrated in .

This section has a sample of some of the many use cases that may be covered in this functionality. It does not represent every possible use case and should be a base for determining CRA functionality.

An example use case for Create a New CR for a Reserved toll free number New Service Connect is as follows 

There may be additional features the embodiments of the disclosed architecture may support such as the examples that follow.

The Customer Record CR Status indicates the status of the Customer Record with respect to its validation in embodiments of the system and its activation status at the SCPs. The CR Status is automatically generated by the current system. Because these states as used by the legacy system may be well known to the user community and may be regarded as fundamental to CR processing they may be preserved as much as possible in the next generation system.

With reference to customer record state diagrams for activation and output refer to the processes by which CRs can be translated and transmitted to the appropriate SCPs after they may be validated and receive any necessary carrier approvals through various nodes such as invalid saved hold pending and must check. This can occur when their Effective Dates and Times may be reached or immediately in the case of CRs for which and Effective Date and Time of now has been specified by the user at input and no carrier approvals may be required. Note that the standard processing of CR output download to SCPs is done via TM 798 data links.

In embodiments the system may translate the information in the Customer record either a CR a TR template record or a PR Pointer Record to the TM 798 format for transmission to the SCPs.

The CR SCP Resend function may be used to resend a single CR to specific SCPs and use the SCP s CR update confirmation responses to update the CR s activation status. At the end of the CR resend process for a CR embodiments of the system may update the CR s activation status and time as maintained for each SCP on the CR s Active SCP list. An example use case is as follows 

There may be a number of tasks where a system administrator enters values for configuration parameters that control an aspect of system functionality. A pre condition is that the user is a system administrator with permissions to perform the specific administrative task.

If the user input is not valid or some other condition prevents successful completion of the use case embodiments of the system inform the user of an error.

With reference to the CIC 0110 validations from the perspectives of each of the involved service providers including the Incumbent LEC ILEC CCS Network Provider that operates the SSP the terminating CCS network the Network Provider the ILEC or CLEC that has been assigned the NPA NXX code and offers service to the terminating subscriber lines the Carrier and their relationship to the CR s toll free service provider Control toll free service provider which may all be the same or different entities.

With reference to the series of reference data lookups that may be performed to validate the use of CIC code OTC 0110 with specified POTS destination telephone numbers in the CPR may be depicted. Functional requirements for the specifics of validation processing then follow.

The Carrier notification function facilitates authorized carrier users to receive and review notifications about CR changes affecting their CICs. The Carrier Notification and Approval CNA functions allow telecom carriers to define business agreements with toll free service providers set up permissions for the use of their Carrier Identification Codes CICs in toll free service CRs receive notifications of when their CICs may be used or modified on CRs and approve when their codes may be used on specific CR s controlled by other service providers.

In embodiments the system can validate the CICs used in CRs to specify call routing based on carrier permissions and restrictions specified in carrier and CNA reference data generate notifications to the carriers and correlate those against carrier approvals before the CRs containing the carrier s CICs may be activated.

The toll free service providers View of Carrier Approval Status facilitates toll free service providers to query carrier approval status information for their CRs at both a summary level and a detailed level per carrier when multiple carriers may be involved.

An example use case to notify an affected carrier of CIC routing or toll free service provider change is as follows

In embodiments the system can be required to provide various logs of detailed CRA activity in order to support a number of key reports. In embodiments the system can also provide a variety of measurements of CRA activity and associated resource usage both in aggregate for the system and where attributable to the respective toll free service providers whose CRs may be being processed.

There may be certain items that may be validated in embodiments of the system as a result of outside carriers or partner s rules. One such rule is 

A Mass Change is an event that requires embodiments of the system to perform a large volume of changes in a short period of time. Depending on the Mass Change event it may be necessary to update system reference data and a large number of impacted AoS labels and customer records. In embodiments the system thus provides functionality for management and administration of Mass Changes.

The setup of Mass Changes may for example be performed online and the execution of the job processing the Mass change is done in the background.

This section has a sample of some of the many use cases that may be covered in this functionality. It does not represent every possible use case and should be but an example base for determining CRA functionality.

In embodiments the system may identify records impacted by a mass change. Using the mass change criteria embodiments of the system can search for records that may be impacted by the mass change and determine if the record can be updated for the mass change information or if manual intervention is required. The identification process can be repeated after verification of the results and manual action has been taken for those records that cannot be updated automatically.

In embodiments the system can identify and update records that are impacted by a mass change. Updated records may be assigned an appropriate effective date and time.

SCP administration and network management may be two important functions defined under SCP management. SCP administration functions in embodiments allow users to establish and modify SCP related reference data in embodiments of the system and send messages to the SCP nodes and their Call Management Services Database CMSDB subsystems to manage data tables that reside there.

Network management functions for the toll free Service involve the management of various parameters for automatic capabilities intended to monitor and control toll free query traffic and calling volumes at the Service Control Points SCPs Service Switching Points SSPs terminating switches and terminating subscriber lines. When various call volume thresholds may be exceeded the SCPs trigger Automatic Call Gapping ACG code controls at the originating SSPs.

The disclosed embodiment of the Network Management functions allow network managers to configure and adjust the relevant control parameters on SCP. Data collection at the SCPs can be configured through the disclosed embodiment to provide network managers with relevant surveillance information useful to monitor traffic and analyze problems such as the detection of SCP overloads and excessive calling or excessive ineffective attempts to dialed codes.

The SCP Management SCP M functions may be used by SCP administrators at the SCP Owner Operator SCP O O companies and by network managers for the SS7 CCS networks which may be typically operated by the same SCP O O entities or otherwise affiliated with them. SCP M functions may interact directly with the SCPs via the SCP Interface as defined in TM 798. An example of these interactions is illustrated in .

There may be additional features supported by the disclosed architecture such as the examples which follow 

SCP administration functions of the disclosed embodiment allow users to establish and modify SCP related reference data in embodiments of the system and send messages to the SCP nodes.

The principal users of SCP M functionality may be assumed to be SCP administrators at the SCP Owner Operator SCP O O companies and network managers at Network Management Centers NMCs or Network Operations Center NOCs at the telecom network providers who operate the SS7 Common Channel Signaling CCS networks. Secondary users may be administrators who have global privileges to access the data and facilitate administrative and control actions of the SCP administrators and network managers.

The current system SCP Administration supports the management of SCP data tables or similar data structures. Functionality provided by a current system may be supported in embodiments of a new system. Design of disclosed embodiments may vary. These may include the following 

A common practice among SCP owner operators is the running of periodic typically annual batch audits of extracted files of SCP customer records against the database in order to detect outdated or missing SCP CRs. The process is known as a reverse audit because it uses the extracted SCP records as a basis for the audit comparison instead of the database. The typical practice for each SCP O O has been to periodically audit each toll free NPA s range of CRs by extracting a SCP generated CR audit file for that NPA.

The audit file is not a complete view of the CRs but is rather an extracted listing of each loaded CR s Customer Record Number CRN i.e. the TFN or numeric Template ID in NPA NXX XXXX format Effective Date and Time and toll free service provider ID. The audit file is then loaded to the TFMP administration. The reverse audit process then compares the records to the corresponding CRs. The discrepancies may then trigger CR resends to the target SCP via the TM 798 interface or may be written to file for a subsequent batch resend.

The SCP Administration function supports actions performed by SCP administrators and disclosed embodiment administrators. The following may be sample use cases addressing SCPs SCP mates SSP lists and SCP NPA NXX lists among other administrative controls and limits for SCP Operations. These do not cover every possible action.

The disclosed embodiment may interface with all the SCPs using the TM 798 standard interface protocol. The embodiments of the disclosed architecture can maintain that interface standard as have each SCP change the interface may not be a viable approach.

The SCP interface is a dedicated Wide Area Network WAN link supporting the establishment of TCP IP socket connections between embodiments of the system and each SCP. In embodiments the system may maintain a set of data related to the interface for each SCP such as an IP address and TCP port number as described by SR 4959 SCP TFMP TCP IP Interface Specification.

The embodiments of the disclosed architecture may need to translate the necessary information from its internal data stores into a standard interface for transmission to the SCPs.

Network management is performed automatically by the SCP implementing overload controls whenever call volume thresholds may be exceeded. The disclosed embodiment defines the controls and sets thresholds. Data collection at the SCPs can be requested through disclosed embodiment to provide network managers with information to analyze problems.

Mass Calling Thresholds may be used to provide the SCPs with surveillance and control thresholds for each of 15 destination threshold level classes defined by the disclosed embodiment. Each of these thresholds is expressed in terms of the number of call attempts during for example a 2.5 minute period.

The disclosed embodiment automatically assigns a threshold level class to a particular destination telephone number of a toll free number based on the number of lines associated with it as specified on the Customer Record CR .

The SCP detects focused overloads by counting call attempts for each destination number and comparing the accumulated count to the surveillance and control thresholds for the threshold level class assigned to the destination number.

If the call attempts during an example 2.5 minute measurement period exceed the surveillance threshold for a destination telephone number then the number is placed on a surveillance list.

A destination telephone number remains on the surveillance list until it either does not exceed its surveillance threshold during a full 2.5 minute measurement period or it exceeds its control threshold when it s moved to the control list.

The Excessive Calling Controls may be used to set and change the calling thresholds for 6 digit and 10 digit vacant toll free and out of area numbers. These excessive calling thresholds may be expressed in terms of the number of call attempts in a defined time interval for e.g. 5 minute period . When the thresholds may be met the numbers may be added to the control list and the calling rate is automatically limited by the SCP. In addition a threshold is defined to automatically take these numbers off of the control list when the calling rate decreases sufficiently.

The disclosed embodiment does not enforce the ACG Automatic Call Gapping . A set of control parameter thresholds may be used to invoke the ACG. Once the thresholds may be reached the ACG is triggered at the SCP SSP level.

The Special Studies Request is done when a potential problem is suspected in the network and is done by sampling traffic to a specific number Telecom Owner Operator Network or an SSP Service Switching Point . A toll free service provider administrator or a network manager can request an SCP owner operator for a special study into their SCP and they can either accept or reject the request to enable the study.

The study is conducted to allow a maximum of 100 calls in a maximum duration of 168 hours 7 days which ever limit is reached first i.e. the collection of data can end when the specified number of call attempts have been monitored or when the specified time limit is reached first.

The special study can be requested for a toll free number Destination Telephone Number carrier or for an SSP. A toll free number or a Destination Telephone Number of either 6 digit NPA NXX or a full 10 digit number NPA NXX XXXX can be requested for the study.

In embodiments the system is operable to generate a billing event record whenever an event occurs that results in a charge to toll free service provider entity in control of a toll free number. Billing event records may be collected and transferred to an external billing system. Currently not all billable events result in a billing event record being generated by embodiments of the system and a manual Billing event record may be generated external to the current system. It may be desirable to automate the creation of as many of the billing event records as possible.

In embodiments the system generates a record when an event related to a billable function occurs. The event record can provide the information needed to calculate a bill for the charges incurred by each organization that makes use of the embodiments of the disclosed architecture according to embodiments. The event record can include the identification of the user the action performed and the date and time of the occurrence.

The interface to the billing system should remain intact and require minimal changes to the current billing system to support disclosed embodiments. The current Billing system Interface format of the file and the records it contains is described in TM NWT 021766 and TFMP Bill 800 Interface Requirements.

Billing Event records illustrate changes to toll free service provider entity control of toll free numbers that may be used to calculate charges to toll free service provider Entities. On a periodic basis and in response to an on demand request embodiments of the system can compile a list of toll free numbers with the controlling toll free service provider entity current status and date the number entered that status and transfer the data to an external billing system. Only numbers with a controlling toll free service provider entity may be included.

In one example a system administrator can specify when billing audit data is to be collected and transferred. It is also possible to make an on demand request for data to be collected and transferred as in the example use case as follows.

Due to the localized nature of call routing prior to the introduction of centralized routing databases the same toll free number may need to be controlled by a different toll free service provider and provide service to a different toll free subscriber in different geographic regions. In some instances arrangements still exist where the same number supports different toll free service in different U.S. states and different service in the U.S. and Canada and other jurisdictions. A number involved in this type of arrangement is referred to as a duplicate number. The terms toll free number toll free system toll free telecommunications network toll free carrier and related terms as used herein are not limited to the United States or North America but have equivalents throughout the world in other political geographic and technological regions. The methods systems and functionalities as described herein are applicable to and operable within such equivalent jurisdictions.

On a periodic basis embodiments of the system can compile a list of duplicate numbers and transfer the data to an external billing system. The data consists of the toll free number providing duplicate service the toll free service provider entity for the number the current status of the number and data related to the Customer Record for the number. The CR data includes the status of the CR and the effective date and time of the CR. For the current system this also includes indications if the CR includes Call Processing Record CPR and Label Definition LAD structures. Additional data is included from remarks entered in the CR that indicates the actual toll free service provider that controls the number for each area where service is provided.

In embodiments of the disclosed architecture a subset of the series of reports can be provided. The system will provide a warehouse of data for reporting and analytics. The warehouse will enable a user to pull either standard aka canned reports or to generate user specific reports. Listed below are a series of reports that the current TFMP system provides. As an example of what reporting may be required is a high level description of the reporting of the disclosed embodiment provides the following types of reports 

Most scheduled reports can also be accessed on demand. The differences are how the report is kicked off and where the results of the report are sent stored. The reports below are required at a minimum but the Provider is expected to propose additional reports for example 

The Exception reports may be automatically generated by embodiments of the system when exclusive events occur either in the disclosed embodiment or in an SCP. For example the Misrouted Queries Exception Report is sent each time an SCP receives a call processing query for a toll free number having NXX not in the SCP s database.

The user can query the database tables and extract information as mentioned in the following examples 

There may be additional features that the embodiments of the disclosed architecture may support such as the examples which follow 

The system will provide a platform for Analytics of TFMP data and usage. The Analytics platform should be flexible in providing some canned analytics as well as to allow the user to define and produce analytics on an ad hoc basis. The analytics should be able to be reports on current day actions as well as historical actions. Categories of analytic reports are 

In embodiments the system is architected designed and implemented with security as a key attribute. The system shall ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of information assets. Controls will be implemented that protect IP and data against unauthorized use disclosure transfer modification or destruction. Measures will be implemented such that legitimate users continue to have access to the system for the expected services levels. The security functionality will address two perspectives. One is the potential security threats and types of attacks that may be targeted at the system or service. The other is a framework for a systematic analysis of the measures available to protect the system or service from attack. One is the potential security threats and types of attacks that may be targeted at embodiments of the system or service. The other is a framework for a systematic analysis of the measures available to protect embodiments of the system or service from attack.

All aspects of a system including the physical plant and facilities operating system and application software signaling interfaces and protocols operations interfaces for configuration surveillance and administration and data storage and processing functions have security vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited.

At a high level the security threats include damage or destruction of information and or other system or service resources corruption or modification of information illicit use theft or removal of information and or other system or service resources disclosure of information and denial or interruption of services.

A security framework identifies the aspects of a system or service that require security and the methods available to address the security threats for each. From a security perspective a system or service can be viewed as consisting of User Control and Management planes. Each plane includes infrastructure services and application layers.

Security services provide capabilities to prevent attacks. At each plane and layer one or more of the following example security services may be applicable 

There may be additional features the embodiments of the disclosed architecture may support such as the examples that follow 

Some primary functions provided by the embodiments of the disclosed architecture include the ability to search for and reserve toll free numbers and provision customer records that may be uploaded to SCPs to enable toll free service. This can be done via an online interface HUI as well as by a machine to machine API interface. These interfaces allow manual and mechanized access to embodiments of the system for these functions such as those that follow 

The embodiments of the disclosed architecture may include a Web Services API for functionality supported in the Human User Interface HUI .

The Human User Interface HUI provides user interface functions to the human users to access the system. The HUI may be accessed by many types of users. For example a user can be administrator a toll free service provider user SCP administrator and network manager. Access to the HUI functions by a user can depend on the security permissions that have been assigned for the user by the administrator.

The HUI provides the following logical groups of functions which can be accessed by a user User Profile and Security Administration Number Administration Customer Record Administration SCP Management Reports and Administration

The administrator and or others may use the user profile and security administration functions provided by the HUI to protect embodiments of the system data from being viewed or updated deleted by unauthorized users. The user profile and security administration grants permissions to different groups of users to access embodiments of the system to create view update and activate certain functions. The system can implement a role based access control mechanism.

The HUI provides functions to perform number search reserve or cancel reservation for one or more toll free numbers change parameters associated with already reserved numbers and query numbers for determining the number status and other number administration parameters. The HUI interacts with the Number Administration Requirements functional area to perform the number administration functions.

The HUI interacts with the Customer Record Administration functional area to perform the functions described in this section.

The CAD function is used to enter the date and time for the toll free number service subscriber customer information for the toll free number the Areas of Service AOS to be supported for the toll free number the carriers that and others can be used to route calls to the toll free number and other associated service data for the toll free number.

An example CAD can be associated with a Call Processing Record CPR for complex call routing data and can be associated with a Labels Definition LAD record for additional complex call routing data that is entered on the CPR.

The HUI interacts with the SCP Management Requirements functional area to perform the Service Control Point administration and network management functions.

The administrator or other toll free service provider s users can request the Scheduled and On demand reports via the Report Request function of the HUI. The HUI interacts with the Reporting Requirements functional area to perform RRR request.

The disclosed embodiment Administration functions of the HUI may be used for Bulletin Board Messages System Processing Options SPO and Downtime Default Effective Time for CR DDT . An Administrative Console may facilitate the system administrators and Help Desk personnel administrative functions for managing the system.

There may be additional features the embodiments of the disclosed architecture may support such as the examples that follow 

The API interface operates as a liaison between the toll free service provider client systems CS and the disclosed embodiment disclosed embodiments thereby providing a mechanism through which interactions between the client systems and embodiments of the architecture can take place. The API interface may for example be used by Customer Record Administration and Number Administration components of the disclosed embodiment on one end and the toll free service provider client systems on the other end. This interaction is schematically illustrated in .

It is expected that disclosed embodiments can define a REST SOAP API for machine interfaces. There is a current Mechanized Generic Interface MGI interface that supports many of our customers today and the embodiments of the disclosed architecture according to embodiments. The MGI interface is being used across the network by all client systems and there has to be backward compatibility. The move from MGI to an API interface cannot be overnight and has to be phased accordingly. The MGI Interface specification is available in SR 4592 MGI Interface specification.

In embodiments the system provided alerts for certain situations. These alerts can be in the form of emails or via a logon notification or a console alert. Examples of these alerts may include 

This section provides a summary of characteristics of reference data. This need not define the absolute data needs but can provide some insight into the data stored and used.

General reference data about each telecommunications carrier that may be involved in carrying toll free calls and might thus be an involved carrier included in the CRs of various toll free service providers 

IntraLATA carrier management reference data Used to support Local Exchange Carriers LECs and other network service providers with the capability to control and or manage the use of their networks for IntraLATA toll free calls to a destination POTS number that terminates on their network include 

In order to run a system there is a need to understand the performance requirements of embodiments of the system and the processing throughput. This includes embodiments of the system availability needs as well as the capacity and performance requirements. The performance of the system must meet or exceed the performance of the existing legacy system for all parameters described in this section.

This section addresses the expected availability of the disclosed embodiment. The approach used for this section is based on industry standards related to availability.

This section establishes an understanding of terminology and establish context in this area in order to provide clear requirements regarding the reliability of the disclosed embodiment. A defined time period is needed to support an availability measurement. A typical calculation involves setting an availability objective or determining the actual availability of a system or service over a year. It may be necessary to identify exclusions from the time period such as planned periods when it is known that embodiments of the system or service cannot be available. It can also be specified that unexpected circumstances that would impact availability such as excessive demand unusual operating conditions or unexpected or disastrous events e.g. earthquake fire etc. may be to be excluded from availability calculations.

Discussion related to availability often involves a number of 9s i.e. five 9s availability. This refers to an availability objective or measurement of 99.999 . Applied for a year this means the availability subject can provide the expected functionality across the given domain for 525594.744 minutes and therefore not be available to provide the expected functionality across the given domain for 5.256 minutes during the year.

When considering availability requirements it is necessary to understand the functions it provides and its overall role in supporting toll free service. Certain functions of the system namely Number Administration Customer Record Administration and SCP Management may be essential for supporting toll free service. More specifically the expected functions of embodiments of the system when it is available may be to 

The disclosed embodiment may be considered an operations system. Unlike an SCP it is not involved in real time routing of toll free calls. If this were not functioning callers would still be able to make toll free calls and the calls would be routed to the correct toll free service subscriber. In embodiments the system does however provide real time services such as toll free number and customer record administration to toll free service providers. An additional consideration is that access to toll free numbers may be provided to all users equally so that one toll free service provider entity does not gain a competitive advantage over others for reserving desirable numbers. This underscores the importance of consistent availability across user interfaces.

In embodiments the system may also allow time and processing for the loading of industry reference data during routine maintenance windows.

Business continuity encompasses the strategic and tactical capability of the organization to plan for and respond to incidents and business disruptions in order to continue business operations at an acceptable predefined level.

Disaster recovery capabilities include the strategies and plans for recovering and restoring the organizations technological infrastructure and capabilities after a major system failure.

It may be necessary to establish objectives for unusual external events like earthquake or fire and non routine activities like major infrastructure upgrades or transitions to new platforms. Overall solution design including operations processes and procedures may be needed to maintain business continuity during unusual circumstances and recover from disasters. Solution design considerations for business continuity and disaster recovery include geographic redundancy for solution components deployment of backup systems and capabilities and selection of the sites where equipment and operating personnel may be located.

In embodiments the system can facilitate the required optimal use of disaster recovery sites and expenses such that analytics or other non critical workloads can be run out of a warm hot DR site thus avoiding Cold DR. Redundant disaster recovery site may be greater than 100 miles away range listed in ISO 27001 as 30 to 100 miles 

Capacity planning involves a judgment regarding the anticipated usage of the functions of a system and a correlation to embodiments of the system resources needed to support the anticipated usage of a function. Based on the usage forecast the quantity of each system resource needed to meet the demand is determined. Capacity is directly related to performance. If load or demand surpasses the level used to plan capacity system resources can become overloaded and the ability of embodiments of the system to provide its intended function is likely to degrade. Once a system is operational capacity management is a continuous operational process. Usage and performance may be monitored to recognize trends and capacity resource quantities may be adjusted accordingly. The objective is to maintain system performance and efficient use of resources as usage and demand change.

There may be a number of components that provide the resources needed to support the functionality provided by a system. Depending on embodiments of the system resource capacity is expressed as a fixed size or quantity or in terms of the demand load or usage the resource is expected to support. Capacity related to system usage is generally planned based on the average period of largest usage of the system taking into account the cost of system resources the probability of excessive usage beyond the average peak and the impact of degraded performance when the anticipated peak is exceeded. For example there may be three main areas for which the capacity may be considered as indicated in the following table 

In order to understand the system capacity requirements some current metrics having to do with capacity and utilization are provided .

Capacity related to system usage is generally planned based on the average period of largest usage taking into account the probability of excessive usage beyond the average peak as well as the impact of degraded performance when the anticipated peak is exceeded. The following assumptions were made when developing the capacity and performance requirements. In embodiments the performance of the system may meet or exceed the performance of the current system for parameters 

Usage measurement and monitoring is required to provide fair and equal system access to all toll free service providers. In order to do that the system may measure monitor and alert the system usage for any instances where one provider s utilization is at a point where it is impacting the other provider s use of the system. The measurements must be on a toll free service provider level.

Reference data may be required to represent routing and numbering in the POTS network and the service areas supported by SCP O O networks. The information provides the relationships between SCP O O CCS networks and the LATAs NPAs and NPA NXXs each network serves and is used to validate the information in customer records. There may be 8 CCS networks supported by the system.

There are 164 LATAs in the NANP roughly 380 NPAs in use or planned for use for POTS call routing and roughly 160 000 NPA NXXs assigned to central offices for call routing.

The system can provide memory capacity for the reference data needed to capture the relationships between States LATAs NPAs and NPA NXXs required to represent the POTS network.

The system can provide memory capacity for the reference data required to represent the network relationships supported by each SCP O O CCS network.

The system must also allow time and processing for the loading of industry reference data during routine maintenance windows.

In embodiments of the system functional data is the data required by each function supported by the system. The system maintains functional data for each NPA NXX within a toll free NPA and each toll free number with each NPA NXX. Currently the toll free NPAs 800 888 877 866 855 and 844 are open and NPA 833 is anticipated to open in 2017 making a total of 7 toll free NPAs. Note that 822 and 889 are also reserved as a potential future toll free NPAs.

For each toll free NPA NXXs 000 199 911 and 555 are not used. Additionally in NXX 250 XXXX numbers 0000 1499 are not used. This results in 7 988 500 toll free numbers per NPA. Assuming 8 toll free NPA the system will need to maintain data for roughly 64 million toll free numbers.

In embodiments of the system initial minimum memory capacity for the data required to support 64 million toll free numbers. Toll free service is enabled when a toll free number is reserved by a toll free service provider a customer record is provisioned against the number and information from the record is downloaded to SCPs. Numbers that are not currently controlled by a toll free service provider i.e. numbers in SPARE status and numbers not available for toll free service i.e. numbers in UNAVAILABLE status do not have customer records. Customer records are provisioned in advance of an effective date and the system maintains current and pending customer records so it is possible for multiple customer records to be associated with a number.

A percentage of toll free numbers will be in SPARE status and therefore not have an associated customer record. Additionally many working numbers have not had changes to the provided toll free service and therefore have a single active customer record. However some numbers may have an active and pending customer record and old records are stored by the system for a period of time. For the purposes of capacity planning and to account for the differences in size between simple and complex customer records it is assumed that there is an average of 2 customer records per toll free number. Therefore the system will need to maintain 128 million customer records.

The system can provide initial minimum memory capacity for the data required to support 128 million customer records.

During peak usage periods 25 of user logins are logged into the system. The system must provide capacity for 16 250 login IDs and anticipating 30 peak concurrent usage capacity for 4 875 concurrent HUI sessions. Note that not all users who are logged into the system will be actively and continuously sending requests to the system.

During a time of extreme usage such as the opening of a new toll free NPA there will a significant increase in the number of concurrent sessions. In the event of an extreme system usage situation the system should be able to quickly scale up to handle up to four times 4 the normal peak usage period.

Instantaneous response time is the time for a response when performing an action regarding objects on the screen such as using a mouse to select on an on screen object or drag a scroll bar.

When a human user takes an action related to an object on a screen the system can provide an initial acknowledgment response in 0.1 0.2 seconds.

When a human user takes action to request an operation or execute a command requiring system process of the request the system can provide a response in 0.5 1 second.

For transactions that take longer than 5 seconds the system will provide the user feedback that the transaction has been accepted and that the response will be available at a later time.

In embodiments the system can provide an API interface for machine to machine transaction processing. The system can provide resources to support having API connections from each toll free Providers number of expected providers defined above .

The system can minimally have the capacity to support interfaces to 30 SCPs at launch with the ability to add more as the number of users grow.
