The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for load balancing and message routing in a short message peer to peer session.

A large and growing amount of information is communicated between computing devices over mobile telephone and other communication networks. This information consumes bandwidth and other resources. Insufficient message handing and routing of information communicated through these networks can delay or prevent communications through a network.

Systems and method of the present disclosure are directed to performing load balancing and message routing by an intermediary device for a short message peer to peer SMPP session. SMPP protocol provides a flexible data communications interface for transfer of short message data and can be used for transfer of short messages between External Short Messaging Entities ESME Routing Entities RE and Message Centers MSC . SMPP is often used to allow third parties e.g. value added service providers like news organizations to submit messages often in bulk. An intermediary device intermediary to the ESME RE and MSC can perform load balancing of requests and messages coming from clients among a plurality of servers and can route the messages coming from servers to a plurality of clients. The intermediary device can also load balance requests and messages coming from the servers if multiple clients can handle the requests or messages.

For example when an SMPP client connects to intermediary device e.g. Load Balancing LB vserver the SMPP client can send a bind request which contains various information including a connection type and address information corresponding to the SMPP client. The intermediary device can select an SMPP server using different load balancing methods. Once a SMPP server is selected the intermediary device can identify if there is a connection available to that SMPP server. If a connection is available the intermediary device can reuse it otherwise it can open a new connection to the SMPP server and send the bind request. When the SMPP server transmits a response to the bind request the intermediary device can forward the client request to SMPP server.

In some embodiments the messages are concatenated messages for example an SMPP message split across multiple SMPP packets. The intermediary device can route the multiples SMPP packets of the concatenated message so that all segments of the concatenated message from a client server should go to same server client. In some embodiments SMPP also provides ancillary operations for SMPP clients through which they can request the status of the previously issued request. The intermediary device can route the ancillary operation request for the already submitted request to ensure that the request goes to the same SMPP server where the original request was forwarded. In some embodiments the intermediary device establishes only one connection each server from each NS core. The intermediary device can perform multiplexing for both SMPP client side connections requests from multiple servers can go through same client side connection as well as SMPP server side connections request from different clients can go to same server connection .

Some CPU manufacturers may add additional cores to their processors to provide additional performance. Products such as those of software and networking vendors that rely on CPUs for performance gains may improve their performance by leveraging these multi core CPUs. The software designed and constructed for a single CPU may be redesigned and or rewritten to take advantage of a multi threaded parallel architecture or otherwise a multi core architecture.

A multi core architecture of the appliance referred to as nCore or multi core technology allows the appliance in some embodiments to break the single core performance barrier and to leverage the power of multi core CPUs. In the previous architecture described in connection with a single network or packet engine is run. The multiple cores of the nCore technology and architecture allow multiple packet engines to run concurrently and or in parallel. With a packet engine running on each core the appliance architecture leverages the processing capacity of additional cores. In some embodiments this provides up to a 7 increase in performance and scalability.

Illustrated in are some embodiments of work task load or network traffic distribution across one or more processor cores according to a type of parallelism or parallel computing scheme such as functional parallelism data parallelism or flow based data parallelism. In brief overview illustrates embodiments of a multi core system such as an appliance with n cores a total of cores numbers 1 through N. In one embodiment work load or network traffic can be distributed among a first core A a second core B a third core C a fourth core D a fifth core E a sixth core F a seventh core G and so on such that distribution is across all or two or more of the n cores N hereinafter referred to collectively as cores . There may be multiple VIPs each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. There may be multiple packet engines each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. Any of the approaches used may lead to different varying or similar work load or performance level across any of the cores. For a functional parallelism approach each core may run a different function of the functionalities provided by the packet engine a VIP or appliance . In a data parallelism approach data may be paralleled or distributed across the cores based on the Network Interface Card NIC or VIP receiving the data. In another data parallelism approach processing may be distributed across the cores by distributing data flows to each core.

In further detail to in some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores according to functional parallelism . Functional parallelism may be based on each core performing one or more respective functions. In some embodiments a first core may perform a first function while a second core performs a second function. In functional parallelism approach the functions to be performed by the multi core system are divided and distributed to each core according to functionality. In some embodiments functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to functional parallelism can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input output management NW I O A secure sockets layer SSL encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol TCP functions C. This may lead to a work performance or computing load based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core 1 may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core 2 performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core 3 may perform SSL offloading while core 4 may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core 1 A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core 1 A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core 2 B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core 4 D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core 2 B may handle SSL offloading while Core 4 D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP1 A VIP2 B and VIP3 C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC1 D and NIC2 E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core 1 A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core 1 A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core 1 A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core 1 A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core 1 A because the load A on Core 1 is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core 1 A the amount of load A on Core 1 A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core 4 D because Core 4 D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

In some instances the packet engine s A N can be configured to carry out the any of the functional and or data parallelism schemes illustrated in .

Each core A N in one embodiment can be associated with a particular packet engine such that load balancing can be carried out by the packet engine. Load balancing may in this embodiment require that each packet engine A N associated with a core communicate with the other packet engines associated with cores so that the packet engines A N can collectively determine where to distribute load. One embodiment of this process can include an arbiter that receives votes from each packet engine for load. The arbiter can distribute load to each packet engine A N based in part on the age of the engine s vote and in some cases a priority value associated with the current amount of load on an engine s associated core .

A core may have or use memory that is shared or assigned to multiple cores. The memory may be considered public or shared memory that is accessible by more than one core. A core may use any combination of private and public memory. With separate address spaces for each core some level of coordination is eliminated from the case of using the same address space. With a separate address space a core can perform work on information and data in the core s own address space without worrying about conflicts with other cores. Each packet engine may have a separate memory pool for TCP and or SSL connections.

In other embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of an appliance or a single device the functionality may be deployed across multiple devices in any arrangement. For example one device may comprise two or more cores and another device may comprise two or more cores. For example a multi core system may include a cluster of computing devices a server farm or network of computing devices. In some embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of cores the functionality may be deployed on a plurality of processors such as a plurality of single core processors.

In one embodiment the cores may be any type and form of processor. In some embodiments a core can function substantially similar to any processor or central processing unit described herein.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

In some embodiments the RSS module uses the MICROSOFT receive side scaling RSS scheme. In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The hash function may be a secure hash of any security level or is otherwise cryptographically secure. The hash function may use a hash key. The size of the key is dependent upon the hash function. For the Toeplitz hash the size may be 40 bytes for IPv6 and 16 bytes for IPv4.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values. The following are example of hash types that may be used by RSS 

The hash result or any portion thereof may be used to identify a core or entity such as a packet engine or VIP for distributing a network packet. In some embodiments one or more hash bits or mask are applied to the hash result. The hash bit or mask may be any number of bits or bytes. A NIC may support any number of bits such as seven bits. The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. Any portion of the hash result or the hash result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. The indirection table may comprise any number of buckets for example 2 to 128 buckets that may be indexed by a hash mask. Each bucket may comprise a range of index values that identify a core or processor. In some embodiments the flow controller and or RSS module may rebalance the network rebalance the network load by changing the indirection table.

In some of these embodiments a software steering module not shown or a software embodiment of the RSS module within the system can operate in conjunction with or as part of the flow distributor to steer packets to cores within the multi core system .

The flow distributor in some embodiments executes within any module or program on the appliance on any one of the cores and on any one of the devices or components included within the multi core system . In some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the first core A while in other embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the NIC . In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Although illustrates the flow distributor as executing within the multi core system in some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on a computing device or appliance remotely located from the multi core system . In such an embodiment the flow distributor can communicate with the multi core system to take in data packets and distribute the packets across the one or more cores .

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core 1 may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core 1 A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

As discussed in the previous section to overcome limitations on transistor spacing and CPU speed increases many CPU manufacturers have incorporated multi core CPUs to improve performance beyond that capable of even a single higher speed CPU. Similar or further performance gains may be made by operating a plurality of appliances either single or multi core together as a distributed or clustered appliance. Individual computing devices or appliances may be referred to as nodes of the cluster. A centralized management system may perform load balancing distribution configuration or other tasks to allow the nodes to operate in conjunction as a single computing system. Externally or to other devices including servers and clients in many embodiments the cluster may be viewed as a single virtual appliance or computing device albeit one with performance exceeding that of a typical individual appliance.

Referring now to illustrated is an embodiment of a computing device cluster or appliance cluster . A plurality of appliances or other computing devices sometimes referred to as nodes such as desktop computers servers rackmount servers blade servers or any other type and form of computing device may be joined into a single appliance cluster . Although referred to as an appliance cluster in many embodiments the cluster may operate as an application server network storage server backup service or any other type of computing device without limitation. In many embodiments the appliance cluster may be used to perform many of the functions of appliances WAN optimization devices network acceleration devices or other devices discussed above.

In some embodiments the appliance cluster may comprise a homogenous set of computing devices such as identical appliances blade servers within one or more chassis desktop or rackmount computing devices or other devices. In other embodiments the appliance cluster may comprise a heterogeneous or mixed set of devices including different models of appliances mixed appliances and servers or any other set of computing devices. This may allow for an appliance cluster to be expanded or upgraded over time with new models or devices for example.

In some embodiments each computing device or appliance of an appliance cluster may comprise a multi core appliance as discussed above. In many such embodiments the core management and flow distribution methods discussed above may be utilized by each individual appliance in addition to the node management and distribution methods discussed herein. This may be thought of as a two tier distributed system with one appliance comprising and distributing data to multiple nodes and each node comprising and distributing data for processing to multiple cores. Accordingly in such embodiments the node distribution system need not manage flow distribution to individual cores as that may be taken care of by a master or control core as discussed above.

In many embodiments an appliance cluster may be physically grouped such as a plurality of blade servers in a chassis or plurality of rackmount devices in a single rack but in other embodiments the appliance cluster may be distributed in a plurality of chassis plurality of racks plurality of rooms in a data center plurality of data centers or any other physical arrangement. Accordingly the appliance cluster may be considered a virtual appliance grouped via common configuration management and purpose rather than a physical group.

In some embodiments an appliance cluster may be connected to one or more networks . For example referring briefly back to in some embodiments an appliance may be deployed between a network joined to one or more clients and a network joined to one or more servers . An appliance cluster may be similarly deployed to operate as a single appliance. In many embodiments this may not require any network topology changes external to appliance cluster allowing for ease of installation and scalability from a single appliance scenario. In other embodiments an appliance cluster may be similarly deployed as shown in or discussed above. In still other embodiments an appliance cluster may comprise a plurality of virtual machines or processes executed by one or more servers. For example in one such embodiment a server farm may execute a plurality of virtual machines each virtual machine configured as an appliance and a plurality of the virtual machines acting in concert as an appliance cluster . In yet still other embodiments an appliance cluster may comprise a mix of appliances or virtual machines configured as appliances . In some embodiments appliance cluster may be geographically distributed with the plurality of appliances not co located. For example referring back to in one such embodiment a first appliance may be located at a first site such as a data center and a second appliance may be located at a second site such as a central office or corporate headquarters. In a further embodiment such geographically remote appliances may be joined by a dedicated network such as a T1 or T3 point to point connection a VPN or any other type and form of network. Accordingly although there may be additional communications latency compared to co located appliances there may be advantages in reliability in case of site power failures or communications outages scalability or other benefits. In some embodiments latency issues may be reduced through geographic or network based distribution of data flows. For example although configured as an appliance cluster communications from clients and servers at the corporate headquarters may be directed to the appliance deployed at the site load balancing may be weighted by location or similar steps can be taken to mitigate any latency.

Still referring to an appliance cluster may be connected to a network via a client data plane . In some embodiments client data plane may comprise a communication network such as a network carrying data between clients and appliance cluster . In some embodiments client data plane may comprise a switch hub router or other network devices bridging an external network and the plurality of appliances of the appliance cluster . For example in one such embodiment a router may be connected to an external network and connected to a network interface of each appliance . In some embodiments this router or switch may be referred to as an interface manager and may further be configured to distribute traffic evenly across the nodes in the application cluster . Thus in many embodiments the interface master may comprise a flow distributor external to appliance cluster . In other embodiments the interface master may comprise one of appliances . For example a first appliance may serve as the interface master receiving incoming traffic for the appliance cluster and distributing the traffic across each of appliances . In some embodiments return traffic may similarly flow from each of appliances via the first appliance serving as the interface master. In other embodiments return traffic from each of appliances may be transmitted directly to a network or via an external router switch or other device. In some embodiments appliances of the appliance cluster not serving as an interface master may be referred to as interface slaves A N.

The interface master may perform load balancing or traffic flow distribution in any of a variety of ways. For example in some embodiments the interface master may comprise a router performing equal cost multi path ECMP routing with next hops configured with appliances or nodes of the cluster. The interface master may use an open shortest path first OSPF In some embodiments the interface master may use a stateless hash based mechanism for traffic distribution such as hashes based on IP address or other packet information tuples as discussed above. Hash keys and or salt may be selected for even distribution across the nodes. In other embodiments the interface master may perform flow distribution via link aggregation LAG protocols or any other type and form of flow distribution load balancing and routing.

In some embodiments the appliance cluster may be connected to a network via a server data plane . Similar to client data plane server data plane may comprise a communication network such as a network carrying data between servers and appliance cluster . In some embodiments server data plane may comprise a switch hub router or other network devices bridging an external network and the plurality of appliances of the appliance cluster . For example in one such embodiment a router may be connected to an external network and connected to a network interface of each appliance . In many embodiments each appliance may comprise multiple network interfaces with a first network interface connected to client data plane and a second network interface connected to server data plane . This may provide additional security and prevent direct interface of client and server networks by having appliance cluster server as an intermediary device. In other embodiments client data plane and server data plane may be merged or combined. For example appliance cluster may be deployed as a non intermediary node on a network with clients and servers . As discussed above in many embodiments an interface master may be deployed on the server data plane for routing and distributing communications from the servers and network to each appliance of the appliance cluster. In many embodiments an interface master for client data plane and an interface master for server data plane may be similarly configured performing ECMP or LAG protocols as discussed above.

In some embodiments each appliance in appliance cluster may be connected via an internal communication network or back plane . Back plane may comprise a communication network for inter node or inter appliance control and configuration messages and for inter node forwarding of traffic. For example in one embodiment in which a first appliance communicates with a client via network and a second appliance communicates with a server via network communications between the client and server may flow from client to first appliance from first appliance to second appliance via back plane and from second appliance to server and vice versa. In other embodiments back plane may carry configuration messages such as interface pause or reset commands policy updates such as filtering or compression policies status messages such as buffer status throughput or error messages or any other type and form of inter node communication. In some embodiments RSS keys or hash keys may be shared by all nodes in the cluster and may be communicated via back plane . For example a first node or master node may select an RSS key such as at startup or boot and may distribute this key for use by other nodes. In some embodiments back plane may comprise a network between network interfaces of each appliance and may comprise a router switch or other network device not illustrated . Thus in some embodiments and as discussed above a router for client data plane may be deployed between appliance cluster and network a router for server data plane may be deployed between appliance cluster and network and a router for back plane may be deployed as part of appliance cluster . Each router may connect to a different network interface of each appliance . In other embodiments one or more planes may be combined or a router or switch may be split into multiple LANs or VLANs to connect to different interfaces of appliances and serve multiple routing functions simultaneously to reduce complexity or eliminate extra devices from the system.

In some embodiments a control plane not illustrated may communicate configuration and control traffic from an administrator or user to the appliance cluster . In some embodiments the control plane may be a fourth physical network while in other embodiments the control plane may comprise a VPN tunnel or communication via one of planes . Thus the control plane may in some embodiments be considered a virtual communication plane. In other embodiments an administrator may provide configuration and control through a separate interface such as a serial communication interface such as RS 232 a USB communication interface or any other type and form of communication. In some embodiments an appliance may comprise an interface for administration such as a front panel with buttons and a display a web server for configuration via network or back plane or any other type and form of interface.

In some embodiments as discussed above appliance cluster may include internal flow distribution. For example this may be done to allow nodes to join leave transparently to external devices. To prevent an external flow distributor from needing to be repeatedly reconfigured on such changes a node or appliance may act as an interface master or distributor for steering network packets to the correct node within the cluster . For example in some embodiments when a node leaves the cluster such as on failure reset or similar cases an external ECMP router may identify the change in nodes and may rehash all flows to redistribute traffic. This may result in dropping and resetting all connections. The same drop and reset may occur when the node rejoins. In some embodiments for reliability two appliances or nodes within appliance cluster may receive communications from external routers via connection mirroring.

In many embodiments flow distribution among nodes of appliance cluster may use any of the methods discussed above for flow distribution among cores of an appliance. For example in one embodiment a master appliance master node or interface master may compute a RSS hash such as a Toeplitz hash on incoming traffic and consult a preference list or distribution table for the hash. In many embodiments the flow distributor may provide the hash to the recipient appliance when forwarding the traffic. This may eliminate the need for the node to recompute the hash for flow distribution to a core. In many such embodiments the RSS key used for calculating hashes for distribution among the appliances may comprise the same key as that used for calculating hashes for distribution among the cores which may be referred to as a global RSS key allowing for reuse of the calculated hash. In some embodiments the hash may be computed with input tuples of transport layer headers including port numbers internet layer headers including IP addresses or any other packet header information. In some embodiments packet body information may be utilized for the hash. For example in one embodiment in which traffic of one protocol is encapsulated within traffic of another protocol such as lossy UDP traffic encapsulated via a lossless TCP header the flow distributor may calculate the hash based on the headers of the encapsulated protocol e.g. UDP headers rather than the encapsulating protocol e.g. TCP headers . Similarly in some embodiments in which packets are encapsulated and encrypted or compressed the flow distributor may calculate the hash based on the headers of the payload packet after decryption or decompression. In still other embodiments nodes may have internal IP addresses such as for configuration or administration purposes. Traffic to these IP addresses need not be hashed and distributed but rather may be forwarded to the node owning the destination address. For example an appliance may have a web server or other server running for configuration or administration purposes at an IP address of 1.2.3.4 and in some embodiments may register this address with the flow distributor as its internal IP address. In other embodiments the flow distributor may assign internal IP addresses to each node within the appliance cluster . Traffic arriving from external clients or servers such as a workstation used by an administrator directed to the internal IP address of the appliance 1.2.3.4 may be forwarded directly without requiring hashing.

G. Systems and Methods for Performing Load Balancing and Message Routing of Short Message Peer to Peer SMPP Messages by an Intermediary Device for a Short Message Peer to Peer Session.

The present disclosure is directed towards systems and methods for performing load balancing and message routing of short message peer to peer SMPP messages by a device intermediary to a plurality of clients and a plurality of servers. SMPP protocol is used for the transfer for short messages between different entities and messaging centers such as between an external short messaging entity ESME a routing entity RE and a message center MSC . The intermediary device can perform load balancing of SMPP servers and routing of the messages coming from a server to appropriate clients. The intermediary device can perform load balancing of messages among the plurality of clients if multiple clients can handle a request or message. The systems and methods described herein can be used for sequence number management reference number management message queuing client connection pool management and ancillary operations handling.

In some embodiments for sequence number management the SMPP can be a completely asynchronous protocol and responses for a request can be identified by the sequence number. The intermediary device can track sequence numbers by having its own generated sequence number for each request or message received. For example when a request is received a new sequence number is created and a map entry is created. The map entry may include the client sequence number the device generated sequence number and client connection server connection information. The request is forwarded with generated sequence number. When response comes back the intermediary device can use the mapping to original sequence number in the request and send the response with original sequence number.

In some embodiments for reference number management a single message can be fragmented into multiple SMPP packets. The intermediary device can track the fragments by using at least one of a reference number segment number or a total segments value. All the segments of a message should go to same other side client server connection. To do this the intermediary device maintains a mapping for a reference number and the corresponding other side connection. The map entry can be created when first segment is created and removed when last segment of the message is received. The intermediary device can generate a new reference number to avoid collision of reference number from different client server side connection and forward the request with new reference number.

In some embodiments for message queuing the intermediary device can queue a message until an appropriate client is available. For example in SMPP load balancing a client connects with address range specifying the range of addresses it can handle. The intermediary device can connect with servers with address ranges which means the intermediary device can handle all the messages from server to any client. It is possible that one or more clients may not be available when intermediary device receives messages for them from the server. In such embodiments the messages are queued by the intermediary device until an appropriate client is available and passed on to clients when they connect to the intermediary device.

In some embodiments for client connection pool management the intermediary device maintains pools of connections based on address range for each client. The pools can be used for routing messages coming from the servers to the clients. When the intermediary device receives a message from a server the intermediary device can iterate through the client connection pool to find the best pool and even in that pool connections to a specific client can be selected in round robin fashion so all the clients are load balanced. In some embodiments clients can be available on different cores nodes in n core cluster environment in such embodiments messages can be forwarded to appropriate intermediary device e.g. core for handling the message.

In some embodiments for ancillary operations handling a message submitter can track the status of the previously submitted messages. For example when a message is submitted by an SMPP server the SMPP server can provide a message identifier e.g. message id . For performing ancillary operations message id is required. The intermediary device can keep track of from which server the message was received and the message identifier so that ancillary operations request can be forwarded to that server. Each server can be assigned a unique server identifier e.g. unique id uid and the server identifier can be appended to message identifier with an intermediary device signature in the following format message id ns uid. When ancillary operation request is received the intermediary device can look for the intermediary device signature first and then extracts the server identifier. Using the server identifier the intermediary device can select the server and forward the ancillary operation request to the selected server.

Now referring to a block diagram of an embodiment of system for performing load balancing and message routing of short message peer to peer SMPP messages by an intermediary device through a network . The intermediary device can be an appliance intermediary to a plurality of SMPP clients and to a plurality of SMPP servers . In some embodiments the SMPP clients are the same or similar to the clients and the SMPP servers are the same or similar to the servers as described above with respect to .

In many embodiments SMPP protocol is used for the transfer of short messages between different entities and message centers for example between an external short messaging entity ESME a routing entity RE and a message center MSC via a network . In some embodiments the SMPP clients can be at least one of an ESME or an RE and the SMPP servers can be a MSC. The intermediary device e.g. Citrix NetScaler devices can perform load balancing on messages originating from either SMPP clients or SMPP servers and distribute them among a plurality of either SMPP clients or SMPP servers based on various load balancing methods or techniques. For example in one embodiment the intermediary device can load balance the requests coming from the SMPP servers when multiple SMPP clients can handle the requests using round robin methods.

In some embodiments the intermediary device can route the messages coming from the SMPP servers to the SMPP clients. The messages can originate or terminate at either an SMPP client or an SMPP server . The SMPP clients can include mobile telephones smart phones personal digital assistants tablet computers laptop computers desktop computers personal computers and other computing devices having message sending and receiving capabilities.

The intermediary device includes a vServer a table and a SMPP manager . The vServer may include software executable on a device hardware or any combination of software and hardware. The vServer may include any type and form of program service task process or executable instructions or any combination thereof in the intermediary device . The vServer may include any logic functions rules or operations to receive a request response or message from an SMPP client process the request response or message and transmit or forward the a response to the SMPP client . The vServer may include any logic functions rules or operations to communicate with an SMPP server such as a remote desktop host . The vServer may be configured to receive a request to establish a connection to the intermediary device through a network . In some embodiments the vServer may be configured to establish a connection for the intermediary device through a network to an SMPP server . The vServer can be the same or similar to the vServer described above with respect to .

In some embodiments the intermediary device includes a table . The table may be a listing object table or mapping to store information and data for different requests responses and messages transmitted by an SMPP client and an SMPP server . In one embodiment the table can be a hash table. The table can also store information and data for SMPP client connections and SMPP server connections established with or by the intermediary device . The table may include a mapping that associates each element of a given set with one or more elements of a second set or a plurality of sets of data. In some embodiments the table may be a data structure used to implement an associative array or a structure that can map keys to values or information. For example in one embodiment the table may use hash functions to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots from which the correct value can be found. The table may be any form of mapping used to organize information and data including a table lookup structure search tree associative arrays database indexing or caches.

In some embodiments the intermediary device includes a SMPP sequence module an SMPP reference module a SMPP pool module and an SMPP status module . In some embodiments the SMPP manager controls and manages each of the modules. The SMPP manager can perform load balancing and message routing for requests responses and messages received by the intermediary device . In some embodiments the SMPP manager can perform message queuing when an SMPP client is not available to receive a message. For example when the intermediary device receives a message with a destination address for an SMPP client that is not available the SMPP pool module can hold the message such that the messages are queued and pass the message on the SMPP client when the SMPP client connects to the intermediary device .

The SMPP manager can utilize any of the SMPP sequence module the SMPP reference module the SMPP pool module and the SMPP status module to perform the load balancing and the message routing. In some embodiments the modules e.g. the SMPP sequence module the SMPP reference module the SMPP pool module and the SMPP status module are implemented as processor executable software modules which may reside on a computer readable medium of the intermediary device . In some embodiments the modules are implemented in a combination of hardware and software. The modules may be packaged combined designed or constructed in a form of the virtualized appliance delivery controller deployable as one or more software modules or components executable in a virtualized environment or non virtualized environment on any server such as an off the shelf server. Each of the modules may be designed and constructed as a software component or module to run on any operating system of a computing device intermediary device and or of a virtualized environment. The modules can be configured to perform each of the functions procedures or methods as described herein.

In some embodiments the intermediary device includes an SMPP sequence module . The SMPP sequence module can generate manage and organize sequence numbers for requests responses and messages transmitted between the SMPP clients and the SMPP servers though the intermediary device . SMPP can be a completely asynchronous protocol. Each message may have its own sequence number. The sequence number may be generated by the originator of the message. In some embodiments the SMPP sequence module extracts the sequence number from a message and replaces with a new sequence number generated by the intermediary device or the SMPP sequence module . In other embodiments the SMPP sequence module inserts the new sequence number in the message such that the message contains both the sequence number generated by the originator and the sequence number generated by the intermediary device . The SMPP sequence module can keep track of the messages by having its own always increasing sequence number.

In some embodiments the SMPP sequence module can keep track of each sequence number including those received in the messages and the ones generated by the intermediary device by storing the sequence numbers in a mapping or table such as table . For example whenever a request comes a new sequence number can be created e.g. by increasing the always increasing number and a map entry including at least one of a client sequence number a generated sequence number and a client connection server connection is created and the request is forwarded with the generated sequence number. When response to the request is received by the intermediary device the SMPP sequence module can identify in the mapping the original sequence number for the request and sends the response with original sequence number.

In some embodiments the intermediary device includes an SMPP reference module . The SMPP reference module can generate manage and organize reference numbers for messages received from either an SMPP client or an SMPP server . For example a single message can be fragmented into multiple SMPP packets. The SMPP reference module tracks the fragments using at least one of a reference number a segment number or a total segments number. The total segments number indicates what segment or portion of the full message the individual fragment is or what order it stands in comparison to the full message. The segments of a message should go to same other side client server connection. In some implementations all the segments of the message should go or to be communicated to the same other side connection. The SMPP reference module can maintain a mapping for a reference number and the corresponding other side connection. The map entry can be created by the SMPP reference module when first segment is created or received. The SMPP reference module can remove or delete the map entry when last segment of the message is received. The SMPP reference module can identify whether the segment is the first middle or last segment using the total segments number included in the segment. In some embodiments the SMPP reference module can generate a new reference number to avoid collision of reference numbers from different client server side connection and forward the request with new reference number.

In some embodiments the intermediary device includes an SMPP pool module . The SMPP pool module can keep and maintain a listing or table of SMPP client connections or SMPP server connections connected to the intermediary device . In some embodiments the SMPP client connections are organized into a plurality of pools of connections based on an address range associated with each SMPP client in the respective pool. In some embodiments the SMPP pool module establishes either upon request by a client or pre established before such a request one or more connections to a server and shares reuses or multiplexes communications over the one or more connections.

For example when the intermediary device receives a message from an SMPP server the SMPP pool module can iterate through the client connection pool listing to find the best preferred or desired client pool based on a destination address associated with the message. The SMPP pool module can identify and select in that pool an SMPP client to receive the message. In some embodiments the SMPP client connections are selected using different load balancing methods such as in round robin fashion so all the clients are load balanced. In other embodiments the SMPP client connections can be selected based on a utilization value associated with the respective SMPP client .

In some embodiments for example in a cluster environment with a plurality of intermediary devices different cores nodes the SMPP pool module maintains a listing or table of client connections available on the other intermediary devices. The SMPP pool module can identify and select pools of client connections and specific SMPP clients connected to the other intermediary devices in the cluster environment.

In some embodiments the intermediary device includes an SMPP status module . The SMPP status module can maintain a listing or mapping for a status of a request response or message transmitted between SMPP clients and SMPP servers . The SMPP status module can track the statuses of previously submitted messages for performing ancillary operations to the message. For example when a message is submitted by an SMPP server the message includes an SMPP message identifier e.g. message id . The SMPP message identifier can be used in performing ancillary operations to the message. The SMPP status module can track each message using the SMPP message identifier to keep track of from which SMPP server the message was received. In some embodiments the SMPP status module receives a modification request from the originator of a message such as an SMPP client or an SMPP server . The modification request can be an ancillary operation request and can include the SMPP message identifier of the message to be modified. The SMPP status module can use the SMPP message identifier to identify the correct SMPP server or SMPP client to forward the modification request by parsing or searching the listing using the SMPP message identifier.

In some embodiments each SMPP server is assigned by the SMPP status module a unique identifier uid and it is appended to the SMPP message identifier message id with a signature associated with the intermediary device in following format message id ns uid. Therefore when a modification request is received by the intermediary device the SMPP status module can look for intermediary device signature first and then extracts the unique identifier uid assigned to the SMPP server and select the SMPP server based on unique identifier and then forward the modification request to the selected SMPP server .

Now referring to a flow diagram of a method for load balancing and message routing by an intermediary device in short message peer to peer SMPP session. In brief overview at step the method includes a device intermediary to a plurality of SMPP clients and a plurality of SMPP servers receiving a request from an SMPP client to establish an SMPP session. The request may include a first sequence identifier of the SMPP client. At step the intermediary device replaces the first sequence identifier in the request with a second sequence identifier generated by the intermediary device. At step the intermediary device stores a mapping of the second sequence identifier to the first sequence identifier and a connection between the intermediary device and the SMPP client. At step the intermediary device selects an SMPP server from the plurality of SMPP servers to forward the request with the second sequence identifier. At step the intermediary device receives a response from the SMPP server with the second sequence identifier. At step the intermediary device identifies from the mapping the first sequence identifier and the connection to the SMPP client using the second sequence identifier and forwards the SMPP response with the first sequence identifier to the SMPP client.

In further detail at step the method includes the intermediary device receiving a request from an SMPP client to establish an SMPP session. The request may be a bind request to connect to a SMPP server a LB vserver or a device intermediary to a plurality of SMPP clients and a plurality of SMPP servers. The request may include a first sequence identifier for the SMPP client. In some embodiments the request includes a bind type indicating a type or mode of connection such as a transmitter connection a transceiver connection or a receiver connection. e.g. TRANSMITTER TRANSCEIVER or RECEIVER . The request may include a type of number e.g. addr ton a number plan indicator e.g. addr npi and address information corresponding the SMPP client. For example the address information may include an address range of the SMPP client addr range . In some embodiments the request may include a sequence identifier generated by the SMPP client.

At step the intermediary device replaces the first sequence identifier in the request with a second sequence identifier generated by the intermediary device. When the intermediary device receives a request from either a SMPP client or SMPP server the request may include a sequence number generated or corresponding to the SMPP client or SMPP server that transmitted the request. To organize and manage the incoming requests i.e. deliver sm submit sm the intermediary device can generate a new sequence number for each request received from either an SMPP client or an SMPP server. The intermediary device can then replace the original sequence number in the request with the device generated sequence number. In some embodiments the sequence numbers are monotonically increasing. In other embodiments the sequence numbers are generated in a pre determined order. Each sequence number can be unique to the received request. For example if a request is split into multiple packets or portions each packet or portion of the request will be given the same device generated sequence number to identify where e.g. client server the request originated. The device generated sequence number can be used to ensure any response to the request is forwarded to the same SMPP client or SMPP server that sent the request.

At step the intermediary device stores a mapping of the second sequence identifier to the first sequence identifier and a connection between the intermediary device and the SMPP client. To organize the different sequence numbers received from the incoming requests responses and messages the intermediary device can create a mapping of the device generated sequence identifier to the SMPP client server generated sequence identifier and a connection between the intermediary device and the SMPP client server. For example in one embodiment the intermediary device may create hash table which contains entries for each request. The entry for the request may include the intermediary device generated sequence number the original e.g. SMPP client server generated sequence number and a connection from the intermediary device to the SMPP client or the SMPP server that sent the request.

At step the intermediary device selects an SMPP server from the plurality of SMPP servers to forward the request with the second sequence identifier. In some embodiments the intermediary device can select a SMPP server based on a load balancing method. For example in one embodiment the intermediary device may select an SMPP server from a plurality of SMPP servers using round robin load balancing. In some embodiments the SMPP server may be selected based on a utilization of the plurality of SMPP servers. The intermediary device may compare the utilizations on different SMPP servers in the plurality of SMPP servers and select one with a lowest utilization. The utilization may include a current load on the SMPP server or a number of requests being handled by the SMPP server. In some embodiments the intermediary device will determine if any connections are available to the selected SMPP server. If a connection is available the intermediary device may re use that connection to the SMPP server. If no connections are available the intermediary device may establish and open a new connection to the SMPP server to send the request.

At step the intermediary device receives a response from the SMPP server with the second sequence identifier. The response includes the intermediary device generated sequence number e.g. the second sequence number . The intermediary device can use the second sequence number to organize the responses received and to determine where to forward the response. In other embodiments the intermediary device may receive a response from an SMPP client with the device generated sequence number.

At step the intermediary device identifies from the mapping the first sequence identifier and the connection to the SMPP client using the second sequence identifier and forwards the SMPP response with the first sequence identifier to the SMPP client. When the intermediary device receives a response the intermediary device can extract the second sequence identifier from the response and use it to identify which SMPP client should receive the response. For example the intermediary device can search the mapping using the second sequence identifier to identify which SMPP client sent the original request and which connection was used to transmit the request. In some embodiments the intermediary device can search a hash table using the second sequence identifier to identify the SMPP client information.

In some embodiment prior to forwarding the request the intermediary device can replace the second identifier with the first sequence identifier e.g. original sequence identifier in the response. The intermediary device can then forward the response to the SMPP client with the first sequence identifier and via the same connection the request was sent.

In some embodiments the intermediary device receives a response from an SMPP client for an SMPP server with the second sequence identifier. The intermediary device may use the second sequence identifier to identify which SMPP client should receive the response. For example the intermediary device can search the mapping using the second sequence identifier to identify which SMPP server sent the original request and which connection was used to transmit the request. In some embodiments the intermediary device can search a hash table using the second sequence identifier to identify the SMPP server information.

In some embodiments the intermediary device may perform multiplexing for an SMPP client side connection or an SMPP server side connection. For example requests from multiple servers can be transmitted through the same client side connection and requests from different SMPP clients can be transmitted through the same server side connection. In some embodiments the intermediary device maintains only one connection to either an SMPP client or SMPP server. In other embodiments the intermediary device may maintain more than one connection to either the SMPP client or SMPP server.

In some embodiments after forwarding the response the intermediary device deletes the entry in the mapping for the original request. The intermediary device may re use the sequence identifier associated with the respect for a subsequent request. In some embodiments the intermediary device maintains a table of available sequence identifiers instead of generating a new sequence identifier each time a request is received.

In some embodiments the intermediary device receives an SMPP message from an SMPP client. The SMPP client may transmit the SMPP message responsive to establishing a connection to the intermediary device or responsive to receiving a response from the intermediary device. The intermediary device may identify from the mapping the SMPP server and a connection e.g. second connection to an SMPP server from a plurality of SMPP servers to forward the SMPP message. In some embodiments the intermediary device uses a load balancing method to select the SMPP server. For example the intermediary device may select an SMPP server in round robin fashion or based on a utilization of the SMPP server. When the SMPP server has been selected the intermediary device may identify an existing connection to the SMPP server to re use or establish an new connection to the SMPP server.

In some embodiments the SMPP message is a concatenated message that is fragmented across multiple SMPP packets or into multiple SMPP messages. All portions of the same concatenated message should be transmitted to the same client server connection. To organize these messages the intermediary device maintains a mapping or a hash table and creates entries for each message received. Each concatenated message contains an SMPP message identifier e.g. sar msg ref num TLV parameter which uniquely identifies the concatenated message. The SMPP message identifier is used a key for the mapping to identify the corresponding SMPP client connection e.g. client pcb or SMPP server connection e.g. server pcb . For example when the intermediary device receives a packet of a concatenated message the intermediary device extracts the SMPP message identifier. Using the SMPP message identifier the intermediary device searches the mapping for an entry with the SMPP message identifier. If an entry is found the intermediary device forwards the SMPP message to the respective SMPP server client connection identified in the mapping. All packets of the concatenated message can have the same SMPP message identifier to ensure all packets of the concatenated message are transmitted to the same SMPP server client. If no entry is found this may mean this is the first packet of the concatenated message and the intermediary device can select an SMPP server from a plurality of SMPP servers using a load balancing method. Further the intermediary device can create a new entry in the mapping for the SMPP message and input the corresponding SMPP message identifier and the respective server client connection information e.g. sar msg ref num key client pcb server pcb .

In some embodiments the intermediary device can receive a second or another packet of the SMPP message with the SMPP message identifier. The intermediary device can search the mapping using the SMPP message identifier to identify the SMPP server and the connection to the SMPP server. The intermediary device can then forward the second packet of the SMPP message to the same SMPP server that received the first packet.

In some embodiments the intermediary device may receive a concatenated message coming from an SMPP server that includes an SMPP message identifier e.g. sar msg ref num and a destination address. The intermediary device can search the mapping or hash table for the received SMPP message identifier. If no entry is found the intermediary device can select the appropriate SMPP client based on the destination address for the SMPP message and add an entry for the concatenated request in the mapping containing the SMPP message identifier e.g. sar msg ref num key . If an entry is found and the client server connection e.g. client pcb server pcb matches then the intermediary device can forward the concatenated message to the respective SMPP client based on the client server connection identified.

In some embodiments the SMPP message identifier may indicate how many total packets are in the concatenated message and the packet number for the received SMPP messages. For example the SMPP message may include 6 packets each packet may indicate that the concatenated message includes 6 packets and also indicate which one of the 6 packets the received packet is. Upon receiving the last packet the intermediary device may determine that all of the packets of the concatenated message have been received and transmitted e.g. if the sar segment seqnum TLV value for the message is equals to the sar total segments TLV value that means that the last message of the concatenated message is received . Responsive to receiving the last packet of a concatenated message the intermediary device may remove the entry form the mapping or hash table.

In some embodiments ancillary operations can be used to query cancel replace an already submitted SMPP message. For example a modification request can be used to query cancel replace an already submitted SMPP message. In some embodiments the intermediary device receives a modification request from the SMPP client to modify a status of the SMPP message. The modification request should be forwarded to the same SMPP server client that the SMPP message was sent. To ensure the modification request is sent to the correct SMPP server client the modification request may include the SMPP message identifier of the original request and a second SMPP message identifier from the server that received the SMPP message. For example when an SMPP server sends a response a tag that includes a server identifier which is unique to the SMPP server can be appended in response such as the second SMPP message identifier to identify the server from where the SMPP message was received.

In some embodiments the preferred length of second SMPP message identifier server id may be two characters so that minimum padding can be done. The modification request may include the SMPP message identifier client id or the second message identifier server id or both. The intermediary device may search the mapping to identify the SMPP server that received the SMPP message using either the SMPP message identifier or the second message identifier. The intermediary device can then forward the modification request to the SMPP server. The modification request may include instructions for the SMPP server to perform at least one of cancel the SMPP message replace the SMPP message or request a status update for the SMPP message.

Now referring to a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for client establishing a connection to an intermediary device and SMPP server by an SMPP client is shown. To establish an SMPP session with an SMPP server and to transmit messages to the SMPP server an SMPP client initially establishes a connection to an intermediary device . For example the SMPP client sends a request to the intermediary device . In some embodiments the request is a bind request or bind message and includes a client sequence number generated by the SMPP client . The request may include at least one of a type of connection to be established e.g. TRANSMITTER TRANSCEIVER or RECEIVER . type of number e.g. addr ton number plan indicator e.g. addr npi and an address range of the SMPP client addr range . The different types of connections may include a transmitter connection a transceiver connection or a receiver connection. Based on the type of connection established the direction in which messages are transmitted may be controlled. For example a transmitter connection may allow the SMPP client to submit messages and not receive messages. A receiver connection may allow the SMPP client to receive messages and not transmit messages. A transceiver connection allows the SMPP client to transmit messages and receive messages.

In some embodiments the intermediary device generates a unique sequence identifier for the request when it is received. The device generated sequence number can be used by the intermediary device to track and organize incoming requests . An entry in a mapping can be created by the intermediary device to store information about the request including the originating SMPP client connection information for the SMPP client the client sequence number and the device generated sequence number. In some embodiments each time a request is received a new entry in the mapping is created.

In some embodiments the intermediary device selects an SMPP server from a plurality of servers to receive the request . The SMPP server may be selected based on a load balancing method for example in round robin fashion. The intermediary device may then determine if a connection to the SMPP server is available. If a connection is available the intermediary device can re use that connection to the SMPP server . If no connections are available the intermediary device may establish and open a new connection to the SMPP server to send the request . The intermediary device can store SMPP server information in the entry created in the mapping for the request . In some embodiments prior to forwarding the request to the selected SMPP server the intermediary device replaces the client sequence number in the request with the device generated sequence number. The intermediary device transmits the request with the device generated sequence number to the selected SMPP server.

The SMPP server transmits a response to the request to the intermediary device . The response includes the device generated sequence number. In some embodiments the SMPP server includes a server identifier in the response to indicate the SMPP server that transmitted the response . The intermediary device searches the mapping using the device generated sequence number to identify the corresponding request and the SMPP client that originally transmitted the request .

In some embodiments the intermediary device replaces the device generated sequence number in the response with the original client sequence number transmitted in the message . The intermediary device forwards the response to the SMPP client with the client sequence number. In some embodiments the response includes the server identifier. Upon establishing a connection to the intermediary device the SMPP client can submit SMPP messages to the intermediary device to be forward to the SMPP server . The intermediary device can load balance the messages received from the SMPP client among a plurality of SMPP servers .

Now referring to flow chart of an embodiment of a method for load balancing and routing messages from an SMPP client among a plurality of SMPP servers by an intermediary device is shown. In some embodiments an SMPP client may transmit two SMPP messages a first SMPP message and a second SMPP message to an intermediary device . Each SMPP message may include a client sequence number. Responsive to receiving the SMPP messages the intermediary device may generate sequence numbers to track the SMPP messages in addition to the client sequence numbers. Each SMPP message may have unique device generated sequence number. The intermediary device may create a record or entry in a mapping to store the client sequence number the device generated sequence number and client connection information for each SMPP message received.

In some embodiments prior to forwarding the SMPP messages the intermediary device may modify the SMPP messages to include the device generated sequence number. For example in one embodiment the intermediary device may replace the client sequence number in the first SMPP message with the device generated sequence number. Similarly the intermediary device may replace the client sequence number in the second SMPP message with the device generated sequence number.

The intermediary device may select SMPP servers from a plurality of SMPP servers to receive the SMPP messages . In some embodiments the intermediary device uses a load balancing method to select the SMPP server . The intermediary device may select an SMPP server in round robin fashion or based on a utilization of the SMPP servers . For example the intermediary device may select a first SMPP server to receive the first SMPP message and a second SMPP server to receive the second SMPP message

The first SMPP server may transmit a first response to the intermediary device . The first response may include the device generated sequence number. In some embodiments the first response includes a SMPP server identifier to indicate which SMPP server transmitted the first response and SMPP server connection attributes.

The second SMPP server may transmit a second response to the intermediary device . The second response may include the device generated sequence number. In some embodiments the second response includes a SMPP server identifier to indicate which SMPP server transmitted the second response and SMPP server connection attributes.

The intermediary device may use the device generated sequence numbers to identify the appropriate SMPP clients to transmit the responses . For example the intermediary device may search the mapping using the device generated sequence number to identify the appropriate entry for the corresponding SMPP message . The intermediary device may identify the appropriate SMPP clients to receive the responses from the SMPP servers . Responsive to identifying the correct SMPP client information the intermediary device may modify the responses prior to forwarding the responses to the SMPP client . For example the intermediary device may replace the device generated sequence number in the first response and forward the first response to the SMPP client . Similarly the intermediary device may replace the device generated sequence number in the second response and forward the second response to the SMPP client .

Now referring to a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for routing messages among clusters of SMPP clients is shown. In some embodiments SMPP clients are organized into SMPP client clusters e.g. pools of client connections based on an address range associated with each SMPP client . Each SMPP client cluster may include one or more SMPP clients . Each of the client connections established from the SMPP clients to an intermediary device can be grouped such that each SMPP client in a SMPP client cluster falls within a pre determined address range i.e. addr ton addr npi and addr range . For example two requests that have the same destination address can be forward to the same cluster of clients.

In some embodiments the SMPP server can transmit an SMPP message e.g. deliver sm with a destination address to the intermediary device . The SMPP message may include a server identifier and server connection information. The intermediary device may establish an entry in a mapping for the SMPP message that includes the server identifier and the server connection information. In some embodiments the intermediary device can identify an SMPP client cluster to forward the SMPP message by matching the destination address of the SMPP message with an address range of an SMPP client cluster .

For example in one embodiment the SMPP clients are organized three SMPP client clusters a first client cluster a second client cluster and a third client cluster . The first client cluster includes SMPP clients who have address range numbers starting with 888765. The second client cluster includes SMPP clients who have address range numbers starting with 24457. The third client cluster includes SMPP clients who have address range numbers starting with 11144. The intermediary device can search a table or listing containing client cluster connections information to identify the appropriate SMPP client cluster using the destination address.

In some embodiments responsive to identifying an SMPP client cluster to forward the SMPP message the intermediary device can select an SMPP client in the SMPP client cluster using a load balancing method or based on an address range associated with the SMPP client . For example an SMPP client in a given SMPP client cluster can selected in round robin fashion. In other embodiments the SMPP client may be selected based on a comparison of a utilization of the SMPP clients in an SMPP client cluster . The intermediary device can then forward the SMPP message to the SMPP client in the cluster. Information for the selected SMPP client cluster and the selected SMPP client can be added to the record in the mapping for the SMPP message once it has been forwarded to the SMPP client . The record in the mapping may include at least one of the following client connection information server connection information a client sequence number a server sequence number or device generated sequence information e.g. containing SERVER REQ RECORD client conn server conn client seqno server seqno . In some embodiments when an SMPP client transmits an SMPP message submit sm the intermediary device can select any available SMPP servers using various load balancing methods.

Now referring to a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for transmitting messages in a cluster system is shown. In some embodiments the network may include one or more intermediary devices such as a cluster of intermediary devices with each intermediary device connected to different pools of SMPP clients and SMPP servers . Each intermediary device in the network may communicate with each other through core to core node to node C2C N2N messaging. In some embodiments each intermediary device core node stores information about SMPP clients and SMPP servers connected to it locally as in a local pool.

In some embodiments the intermediary devices can collect and store information e.g. address range about SMPP clients and SMPP servers connected to the other intermediary devices core nodes in the network as well. For example each intermediary device may maintain a mapping or table of connections for all of the intermediary devices in the network. In some embodiments when an intermediary device receives a request or SMPP message with a destination address that doesn t correspond to any of the pools or cluster of SMPP clients connected to it locally the intermediary device can identify which intermediary device in a plurality of intermediary devices should receive the request or SMPP message . For example a first intermediary device that receives the SMPP message may identify the correct second intermediary device by searching a mapping or table of client connections and forward the SMPP message to the second intermediary device .

In some embodiments when processing an SMPP message transmitted thought C2C N2N messaging the owner intermediary device creates a mapping for the SMPP message to include the SMPP message identifier sequence ref number . The owner intermediary device may refer to the intermediary device that is connected to the destination SMPP client or SMPP server . The intermediary device that originally received the SMPP message can also create a mapping with the SMPP message identifier. When a response to the SMPP message is received a reverse mapping may be done by the owner intermediary device to identify which intermediary device originally received the SMPP message and the response can be passed to that intermediary device . The intermediary device that originally received the SMPP message can then forward the response to the originating SMPP server through the original server side connection that the SMPP message was originally sent.
