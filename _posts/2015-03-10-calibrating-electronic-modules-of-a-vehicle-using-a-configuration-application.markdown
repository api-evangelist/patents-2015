It will be appreciated that the calculation related processing may occur at the telematics unit or may occur at a communications center .

The telematics unit also supports infotainment related services whereby music Web pages movies television programs video games and or other content is downloaded by an infotainment center operatively connected to the telematics unit via the vehicle bus and an audio bus . In one example downloaded content is stored for current or later playback.

The above listed services are by no means an exhaustive list of the current and potential capabilities of the telematics unit as should be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The above examples are merely a small subset of the services that the telematics unit is capable of offering to users. For example other service include but are not limited to vehicle door unlocking diagnostic monitoring firmware software updating emergency or theft related services etc. Moreover the telematics unit may include a number of known components in addition to those explicitly described above.

The telematics unit may establish a communications channel with the mobile wireless network system for example using radio based transmissions so that both voice and data signals can be sent and received via the communications channel. In one example the mobile wireless component enables both voice and data communications via the mobile wireless network system . The mobile wireless component applies encoding and or modulation functions to convert voice and or digital data into a signal transmitted via the dual function antenna . Any suitable encoding or modulation technique that provides an acceptable data rate and bit error can be used. The dual function antenna handles signals for both the mobile wireless component and the GNSS component .

The microphone provides the driver or other vehicle occupant with a way to input verbal or other auditory commands and can be equipped with an embedded voice processing unit utilizing human machine interface HMI technology. The speaker s provides verbal output to the vehicle occupants and can be either a stand alone speaker specifically dedicated for use with the telematics unit or can be part of an audio component . In either case the microphone and the speaker s enable the hardware and the communications center to communicate with occupants of the vehicle through audible speech.

The hardware also includes the buttons and or controls for enabling a vehicle occupant to activate or engage one or more components of the hardware within the vehicle .

A set of vehicle sensors connected to various ones of a set of sensor interface modules are operatively connected to the vehicle bus . Examples of the vehicle sensors include but are not limited to gyroscopes accelerometers magnetometers emission detection and or control sensors and the like. Examples of the sensor interface modules include ones for power train control climate control and body control.

The wireless network system is for example a cellular telephone network system or any other suitable wireless system that transmits signals between mobile wireless devices such as the telematics unit of the vehicle and may further include land networks such as the land network . In the illustrative example the mobile wireless network system includes a set of cell towers as well as base stations and or mobile switching centers MSCs as well as other networking components facilitating supporting communications between the mobile wireless network system with the land network . For example the MSCs may include remote data servers.

As appreciated by those skilled in the art the mobile wireless network system includes various cell tower base station MSC arrangements. For example a base station and a cell tower could be located at the same site or they could be remotely located and a single base station could be coupled to various cell towers or various base stations could be coupled with a single MSC to name but a few of the possible arrangements.

Land network can be for example a conventional land based telecommunications network connected to one or more landline end node devices e.g. telephones and connects the mobile wireless network system to the communications center . For example land network includes a public switched telephone network PSTN and or an Internet protocol IP network as is appreciated by those skilled in the art. Of course one or more segments of the land network can be implemented in the form of a standard wired network a fiber or other optical network a cable network wireless networks such as wireless local networks WLANs or networks providing broadband wireless access BWA or any combination thereof.

The communications center is configured to provide a variety of back end services and application functionality relating to the vehicle hardware . The communications center includes by way of example network switches servers databases live advisors as well as a variety of other telecommunications equipment including modems and computer communications equipment known to those skilled in the art. These various call center components are for example coupled to one another via a network link e.g. a physical local area network bus and or a wireless local network etc. . Switch which may be a private branch exchange PBX switch routes incoming signals so that voice transmissions are in general sent to either the live advisors or an automated response system and data transmissions are passed on to a modem or other component of the telecommunications equipment for processing e.g. demodulation and further signal processing .

The telecommunications equipment includes for example an encoder and can be communicatively connected to various devices such as the servers and the databases . For example the databases comprise computer hardware and stored programs configured to store subscriber profile records subscriber behavioral patterns and other pertinent subscriber information. Although the illustrated example has been described as it would be used in conjunction with a manned version of the communications center it will be appreciated that the communications center can be any of a variety of suitable central or remote facilities which are manned unmanned and mobile fixed facilities to or from which it is desirable to exchange voice and data.

It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the execution of the various machine implemented processes and steps described herein may occur via the computerized execution of computer executable instructions stored on a tangible computer readable medium e.g. RAM ROM PROM volatile nonvolatile or other electronic memory mechanism. Thus for example the operations performed by computing devices such as the telematics unit communications center equipment and other computing devices may be carried out according to stored instructions and or applications installed thereon.

In another exemplary implementation a calibration application is provided at a remote computing device which may be for example a personal computer laptop tablet smartphone or other computing device. The calibration application utilizes a computing device HMI e.g. touchscreen keyboard and mouse with display etc. to interface with a user and the calibration application utilizes communication interface e.g. a transceiver such as a cellular transceiver or Bluetooth transceiver a Universal Serial Bus USB interface etc. of the computing device to communicate with vehicle electronic modules via a communication pathway that includes a communication interface of the vehicle e.g. a transceiver such as the NAD or a Bluetooth transceiver a USB interface etc. .

In other exemplary implementations both the calibration application at the computing device and the calibration application of the vehicle are utilized together and the two applications interact with one another to facilitate development and validation processes for the vehicle electronic modules . In this example calibration data provided from a remote computing device over the network may be further processed by the calibration application at the vehicle . For example a general calibration related command sent to the vehicle may be converted to a specific calibration related command adapted particularly for a specific vehicle electronic module configuration of the vehicle . In another example the calibration application provides an in vehicle user the opportunity to confirm whether a remote command from computing device is to be executed or not via the vehicle HMI .

The calibration application according to implementations of the invention whether in vehicle or at a remote computing device or some combination thereof provide for an efficient cost effective and user friendly way in which users can perform development and validation processes for electronic modules of a vehicle. The calibration application provides a direct interface for the user into controllers embedded within the vehicle that previously would have only been accessible via an ALDL or OBD port. Thus using these implementations of the invention the difficulties and expenses associated with performing development and validation through specially trained personnel using complex toolchains can be avoided.

In different implementations of the invention the calibration application communicates with the electronic vehicle modules in different ways. In one exemplary vehicle architecture where each vehicle electronic module has its own controller associated therewith the calibration application is configured with appropriate programming to allow the calibration application to communicate with each of the different controllers according to suitable communication protocols. For example the calibration application may use an application programming interface API to communicate with host gateway or master modules and use serial data payload delivery to communicate with conventional electronic interfaces in some cases serial data payload delivery may be used to communicate with the host gateway or master modules via APIs as well .

In another exemplary implementation the calibration application utilizes conventional physical messaging protocols e.g. according to standard CAN protocols between vehicle modules and adapts the content of the physical messaging protocols for testing purposes. For example the calibration application uses binary download and boot code processing to cause an electronic control unit of a first vehicle module to send physical messages to a second vehicle module i.e. a target module to be calibrated or configured via a CAN communication pathway. In this example the calibration application controls the first vehicle module to serve as a service programming device for the second vehicle module via diagnostic CAN communication pathways that are conventionally present in a vehicle.

In another exemplary implementation the calibration application uses functional messaging between various points of the vehicle s internal network of modules. By modifying the data payloads of such messages the calibration application is able to send commands and data requests to various modules without requiring the modules to change their serial databases. The use of functional messaging further allows for flexibility for the content of the commands data requests as functional messaging is able to use a multi frame transport protocol that is not constrained like the conventional physical messaging protocols used with traditional service tools and the CAN standards. Thus while physical messaging communication pathways can still be utilized for the sending of the functional messages relatively longer and more sophisticated messages can be sent via those pathways. Since different vehicle electronic modules have different numbers of calibration partitions different programming complexity etc. the use of functional messaging with a multi frame transport protocol provides the calibration application with the capability of specifically configuring or calibrating a particular vehicle electronic module based on the specific characteristics of that particular vehicle electronic module using point to point messaging.

According to any of the foregoing described manners of communication the calibration application provides a conduit that a user may use to efficiently and cost effectively perform validation and development processes with respect to a variety of different vehicle electronic modules. An exemplary process may include the calibration application sending a request to one or more of the electronic vehicle modules for current configuration information e.g. status of one or more calibration parameters which for example may be accomplished by sending of a physical message to an electronic control unit of a vehicle module requesting such information. Then the calibration application determines whether any calibration parameters need to be changed for example by communicating with a telematics service provider or other external network source. If the determination is made to change one or more calibration parameters the calibration application then sends a message to the corresponding vehicle electronic module via one or more of the communication pathways discussed above.

In an alternate example if a user of the calibration application had chosen to calibrate the icons of the vehicle HMI via the HMI module screen presented at stage the user may be presented with the option to select an icon to be calibrated e.g. a weather icon a traffic icon a text messaging icon a voice call icon etc. . Then using the calibration application the user is able to select an option to toggle the icon on or off for the vehicle HMI and the calibration application generates appropriate corresponding calibration data to configure the vehicle HMI accordingly. The process may further include the user choosing an option to begin calibration processing for the icon and to end calibration processing for the icon.

Table 1 is provided below to further illustrate certain exemplary vehicle modules the features and parameters corresponding thereto that may be calibrated as well as the communication pathways involved in such calibrations.

Further for host gateway or master modules such as for various vehicle tuning applications including for example chimes click clacks initial phone volumes mode balancing vehicle speed volume compensation etc. the vehicle electronic modules communicate with the calibration application via application programming interfaces APIs to efficiently and cost effectively provide various calibration functionality to a user via the calibration application.

The features of a vehicle that are configurable by the calibration application such as those depicted in and Table 1 have various appropriate development and validation processes that may be performed by a user using the calibration application.
