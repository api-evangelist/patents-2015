This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 927 472 filed on Jan. 14 2014 and titled EXTRACTION OF RANDOM NUMBERS FROM PHYSICAL SYSTEMS the entire disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.

This invention was made with government support under CCF1216729 CCF1318070 and CCF1017335 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present disclosure relates to generating random numbers and more particularly to techniques for extracting random numbers from untrusted quantum devices.

The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventor to the extent it is described in this background section as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.

Randomness is an indispensable resource for modern day information processing. Without randomness randomized algorithms statistical scientific simulations and secure cryptography would not exist. However generating randomness is a fundamental problem that is far from fully solved. In fact many secret keys currently in use can be broken by exploiting the insufficient randomness used in generating the keys.

Quantum mechanics is inherently random therefore offers promising approaches to this problem. Indeed commercial products to this end have started to emerge. However numerous challenges remain. As classical beings users of those quantum based products cannot directly verify if the quantum states and quantum operations conform to the specifications. Implementations of quantum operations are at least in the foreseeable future far from ideal e.g. the implementations include unpredictable deviations or errors . These imperfections call for secure protocols that tolerate deviations of quantum devices from ideal specifications. Furthermore users requiring high levels of security often have to purchase devices from a vendor who is not necessarily trusted. Further still while some proposed techniques are suggested to have higher levels of security such techniques require quantum conditions that are not attainable in the real world settings.

In accordance with an example a method of generating a random bit string comprises receiving from a min entropy source a binary input string creating copies of the binary input string received from the min entropy source and providing each of the copies of the binary input string to one of a plurality of randomness extractors each randomness extractor configured to perform a different randomness extraction on the received copy of the binary input string to produce a respective extracted output binary string. The method further includes for each randomness extractor providing the respective extracted output binary string to one of a plurality of quantum devices where each of the plurality of quantum devices is configured to i receive the extracted output binary string as a locally random input signal string random only to that respective quantum device and ii transform the received locally random input string into a globally random output signal string random to each other of the plurality of quantum devices. Still further the method includes combining the plurality of globally random output signal strings from the plurality of quantum devices to generate the random bit string.

In accordance with one example a method of generating a random bit string comprises receiving from each of one or more min entropy sources a binary input string and interacting with one or more input output devices where each input output device is an untrusted system configured to produce a global randomness output from a local randomness input seed. The method further includes determining whether to accept the global randomness output from each of the input output devices or to reject the global randomness output from each of the input output devices and outputting the random bit string if the global randomness output from each of the input output devices is accepted.

In accordance with an example a system for generating a random bit string comprises a classical controller configured i to receive from a min entropy source a binary input string ii to duplicate the binary input string to create copies of the binary input string and iii provide each of the copies of the binary input string to one of a plurality of randomness extractors each randomness extractor configured to perform a different randomness extraction on the received copy of the binary input string to produce a respective extracted output binary string. The system further includes a plurality of quantum devices each configured to i receive the extracted output binary string as a locally random input signal string random only to that respective quantum device and ii transform the received locally random input string into a globally random output signal string random to each other of the plurality of quantum devices and a combination stage configured to combine the plurality of globally random output signal strings from the plurality of quantum devices to generate the random bit string.

In accordance with an example a system for generating a random bit string comprises a classical controller configured to receive from each of one or more min entropy sources a binary input string and interact with one or more input output devices where each input output device is an untrusted system configured to produce a global randomness output from a local randomness input seed. The classical controller is further configured to determine whether to accept the global randomness output from each of the input output devices or to reject the global randomness output from each of the input output devices and output the random bit string if the global randomness output from each of the input output devices is accepted.

The techniques of the present disclosure provide random number generation determined using randomness extractors. In comparison to conventional random number generators the present techniques allow for a more expansive set of sources for random number generation. For example the present techniques may be used with min entropy and physical sources that have a certain amount of inherent randomness. The techniques employ extractors employing a deterministic process that interact with multiple physical sources with the purpose of outputting true randomness. The physical systems may be subject to easily verifiable constraints imposed by certain physical theories such that the security of an extractor may be based on the validity of those physical theories.

In this way the present techniques can circumvent the independent sources limitations of conventional techniques through the use of physical sources such as spatially separated untrusted physical sources of quantum randomness. For this latter implementation with untrusted quantum sources the only additional source of randomness used is a single classical signal source of a guaranteed min entropy. For implementation the only additional quantum source would be a min entropy input signal source. This combination of a weak random input source min entropy and spatially separated untrusted quantum device physical sources is able to produce an output that is secure against adversary. Thus the present techniques can be used for random number generation random number expansion quantum key distribution and secured communications and other applications.

With conventional techniques for random number generation there is a fundamental limit requiring two or more independent sources that the present techniques overcome. The research on the minimum assumptions under which true randomness can be obtained has led to theories of randomness extractors. An extractor is a deterministic process that transforms several sources of weak randomness into near perfect randomness. A basic component of conventional theories on extractors is that the amount of randomness in each weak source is quantified by the notion of min entropy or conditional quantum min entropy when the adversary is quantum . The choice of this description is supported by the fact that the min entropy of a source characterizes the maximum amount of securely extractible randomness with the help of additional randomness. On the other hand deterministic extraction i.e. in the absence of additional randomness is considered to be impossible. To get around this perceived impossibility some have settled on making additional independence assumptions and aiming for a randomness extractor either with one short truly random seed or by using two or more independent weak sources. In either case independence is crucial for randomness extraction to be possible. A classical signal source such as a random binary string is said to be of min entropy k if no classical adversary can guess the signal correctly with more than 2 k probability. Likewise the source is said to have k conditional quantum min entropy if no quantum adversary can guess it correctly with more than 2 k probability.

In contrast to conventional techniques the present techniques provide random number generation that does not require independent sources is quantum secure achieving close to optimal error parameters and randomness that expands at an exponential or unbounded rate from a weak min entropy source. The techniques can tolerate a constant or uniform level of imprecision in implementing each quantum operation. That is with the present techniques any honest implementation performing below an optimal level by a small constant amount on average may still pass randomness and or security tests with overwhelming and unexpected probability.

The present techniques deploy quantum devices that exhibit protocols which may be considered sub protocols to the over all system level protocol that enable practical random number generation with the minimal assumption on the weak random source and on the generating device. In some examples the techniques work with any min entropy source instead of requiring a source possessing additional structure or quantum randomness. Requiring additional structures such as independent sources presents difficult challenges to achieve practically therefore these challenges be avoided.

The present techniques may be resilient to the implementation imprecisions of the quantum devices used. That is the present techniques offer greater robustness over what was generally considered achievable with conventional techniques. Robustness which includes allowing for a certain amount of inaccuracy in operation is valuable for quantum information processing in part because quantum states are extremely fragile and quantum operations are inaccurate. Moreover the present techniques may achieve a security parameter close to the best possible. The techniques have lead to a striking conclusion that any min entropy source of a fixed length can be used to extract robustly and securely from untrusted quantum devices an arbitrarily long output randomness random number of close to the best possible quality.

In addition to the above implications on randomness extraction these techniques can be used to create inherently random events in the laboratories with confidence of their unpredictability.

In some implementations the quantum device may include a plurality of components also labeled as D D . . . Din where each of the plurality of components includes a corresponding input interface output interface and quantum system . Generally the quantum systems may include any suitable systems governed by quantum mechanical principles and capable of performing operations on data or input based on those quantum mechanical principles. The quantum systems may represent data or input via quantum mechanical properties such as spin charge polarization optical properties thermal properties magnetic properties etc. and in some cases each of the quantum systems may include one or more qubits such as two state quantum mechanical systems.

The quantum systems may by implemented as physical sources such as spatially separated untrusted quantum devices. These physical sources may be constructed from different physical devices in some examples. In some examples the physical sources may be separate physical sources of a single physical device. Each of the quantum systems may be execute a protocol to convert a locally random input into a globally random output as described below as discussed in reference to for example. In some examples the quantum systems may represent single quantum sources employ a protocol. In some examples each quantum system may represent multiple sub systems each employing the protocol.

By way of example and without limitation the quantum systems may include i an Ising spin glass in which data is represented by Ising spins ii non Abelian topologically ordered phases of matter in which data is represented by braiding of anyonic quasiparticles iii three dimensional 3D lattice cluster states in which data is represented by topologically protected quantum gates iv superconducting systems in which data is represented by small superconducting circuits e.g. Josephson junctions v trapped atoms ions or molecules e.g. trapped by electromagnetic fields or optical lattices in which data is represented by two or more energy levels such as hyperfine levels vi one or more quantum dots or quantum wells in which data is represented by confined excitations vii linear optical elements in which data in represented by optical modes of photons or viii Bose Einstein condensates in which data is represented by one or more energetically protected two level states. It is understood that any suitable quantum system may represent data or input via quantum mechanical properties and perform operations on that data based on the quantum mechanical properties.

Preparation or manipulation of the quantum systems and obtaining of results from the quantum systems may include measurements performed by the corresponding input interfaces and the corresponding output interface in some implementations. For example in a case in which the quantum systems include topologically ordered phases of matter e.g. as in a topological quantum computer the input interfaces and the output interfaces may include one or more interferometers to perform quasiparticle braiding topological charge measurement and or other topologically transformative manipulations. Alternatively in the case in which the quantum systems include superconducting systems the input interfaces and the output interfaces may include various superconducting quantum interference devices SQUIDs to measure magnetic properties with high sensitivity. It is understood however that the input interfaces and the output interfaces may include any appropriate combination of hardware classical computer processing and or software components configured to measure manipulate and or otherwise interact with the quantum systems . Moreover in some examples the input interfaces may include a duplicator and extractor as described hereinbelow that receives a common input signal and sends an extracted signal to the different sub protocol portions of the quantum devices . In some other examples the duplicator and extractor are within the quantum systems 

Further some or all of the input interfaces and the output interfaces may be controlled by or communicate with the classical controller in order to measure manipulate and or otherwise interact with the quantum systems in an implementation. For example the input interfaces may receive input data values e.g. input bits from the classical controller that are subsequently encoded in the quantum systems via operations e.g. measurements performed by the input interfaces . Likewise the output interfaces may communicate results obtained via measurements performed on the quantum systems to the classical controller for further processing or utilization. In some cases the classical controller may implement software applications via computer readable instructions that control all or some of the functionality of the input interfaces and the output interfaces . For example the classical controller may control when e.g. periodically or at pre defined times and how e.g. with what parameters such as intensity voltage etc. the input interfaces and the output interfaces perform measurements on the quantum systems 

In some implementations the plurality of components are configured such that information cannot be exchanged among the plurality of components during certain quantum operations such as random number generation randomness expansion or quantum key distribution. For example the plurality of components may be disposed in locations far apart from one another so as to ensure that during the period of generating a bit of a random number the plurality of components cannot exchange information due to a limit imposed by special relativity i.e. information cannot travel faster than the speed of light . Such a separation of the plurality of components may be referred to as isolated or in isolation herein. In general quantum communication or a quantum exchange of information may include any intentional or accidental coupling with an environment e.g. a coupling that includes a decoherence of quantum states .

In other implementations the plurality of components are configured such that information cannot be exchanged among the plurality of components during certain stages or phases of a quantum operation while information can be exchanged during other stages or phases of the quantum operation. For example the plurality of components may be disposed in locations such that during one iteration of a protocol such as the protocols discussed with reference to information cannot be exchanged between the plurality of components while information can be exchanged in between iterations. Such a configuration of the plurality of components may be referred to as resettable or being reset herein. In this manner protocols may be implemented with reduced complexity in some cases. For example the quantum device may establish entanglement on the fly and needs only to maintain the entanglement e.g. with a constant level of fidelity for the duration of a single protocol iteration.

Communications between the classical controller and the input interfaces and the output interfaces may include classical communications in an implementation facilitated by a control and measurement link . The control and measurement link may carry communications from the classical controller to the interfaces and via electromagnetic signals e.g. current signals on a current carrying conductor such as a ribbon coaxial twisted pair universal serial bus USB or other cable. The control and measurement link may in some implementations carry encoded digital signals between the classical controller and the interfaces and such as signals encoded according to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP Virtual Instrument Software Architecture VISA standard Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments SCR High Speed LAN Instrument Protocol HiSLIP LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation LXI PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation PXI File Transfer Protocol FTP Transmission Control Protocol TCP User Datagram Protocol UDP etc. In general the control and measurement link may include any suitable wired and or wireless components links modems routers cables buses etc. allowing the classical controller to communicate with and or control the quantum device .

The classical controller may include various interfaces implemented in any suitable combination of hardware and software allowing the classical controller to communicate with the quantum device and various other devices or components. In particular the classical controller may include an instrument control interface configured to send receive control signals voltages currents digitally encoded messages etc. to and from the quantum device respectively. The classical controller may also include a data acquisition DAQ interface such as a DAQ PCI card to receive measurement values from the quantum device e.g. from the output interfaces and a network interface allowing the classical controller to communicate with various other network enabled devices .

Users of the network enabled devices may interact with the classical controller via a network and network interface . The network enabled devices may include by way of example a network enabled cellular wireless terminal a phone a tablet computer a desktop computer a server computer a cluster of server computers a personal digital assistant PDA a smartphone a laptop computer a wearable wireless communication device such as a wearable computer a portable media player an e reader or other similar devices not shown . Of course any network enabled device appropriately configured may interact with the classical controller to for example generate a random number expand a random number and or generate or retrieve a quantum key. In some examples the network enabled devices represent a network enabled enterprise in communication with the classical controller of another network enabled enterprise. Example enterprises including any two enterprises desiring to establish shared secured communications such as a design enterprise creating intellectual property e.g. an integrated circuit designer and a manufacturing enterprise fabrication enterprise or foundry .

The network may be a proprietary network a secure public Internet a virtual private network or some other type of network such as dedicated access lines plain ordinary telephone lines satellite links combinations of these etc. Where the network comprises the Internet data communication may take place over the network via an Internet communication protocol. The network may communicate with the network enabled devices through wireless or wired connections. Further in some examples the network is a mobile or cellular communication network.

The network enabled devices need not necessarily communicate with the network via a wired connection. In some instances the network enabled devices may communicate with the network via wireless signals and in some instances the network enabled devices may communicate with the network via an intervening wireless or wired device which may be a wireless router a wireless repeater a base transceiver station of a mobile telephony provider etc. or other access point.

The classical controller also includes a program memory and one or more processors e.g. microcontrollers or microprocessors . The program memory may include an assortment of computer readable media implemented as semiconductor memories magnetically readable memories and or optically readable memories for example. Computer readable media may be any media that may be accessed by the classical controller . By way of example and not limitation the media may include both volatile and nonvolatile media removable and non removable media. Media may also include computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media may include volatile and nonvolatile removable and non removable media that stores information such as computer readable instructions program modules data structures or other data. Computer storage media may include RAM ROM EEPROM or other memory technology optical storage disks magnetic storage devices and any other medium that may be used to store computer accessible information. Communication media may be computer readable instructions data structures program modules or other data in a modulated data signal or other transport mechanism. Communication media may include wired media such as a wired network or direct wired connection and wireless media such as RF infrared and other wireless media.

The program memory may store a basic input output system BIOS containing algorithms to transfer information between components within the classical controller . Also data or program modules that are immediately accessible or are presently in use by the one or more processors may be stored in the program memory . Data normally stored in the program memory while the classical controller is in operation may include an operating system application programs program modules and program data. In particular the program memory may store a random number generation program a randomness expansion program and a quantum key distribution program as discussed further with reference to . Programs such as the programs and may in some implementations provide input to or process output from the quantum device . That is some functionality related to random number generation randomness expansion and quantum key distribution may be implemented by the classically executed programs and whereas other functionality related to random number generation randomness expansion and quantum key distribution may be implemented according to quantum mechanical principles by the quantum device .

The classical controller may also be communicatively coupled to a database . The database may include storage media such as a hard disk drive that may read from or write to non removable non volatile magnetic media a magnetic disk drive that reads from or writes to a removable non volatile magnetic disk and an optical disk drive that reads from or writes to a removable nonvolatile optical disk. Other storage media that may be used includes magnetic tape cassettes flash memory cards digital versatile disks digital video tape solid state RAM and solid state ROM. The database may store results from computations performed by the quantum device such as random numbers quantum keys etc. In addition the database may store instructions rules or other information allowing the classical controller to execute corresponding functionality.

In particular is a block diagram of an example system in which a network enabled device labeled A in and a network enabled device labeled B in may interact with a classical controller where the classical controller is communicatively and or operatively connected to a quantum device . Although illustrated as laptop computers in it is understood that the network enable devices and may include any suitable network enabled devices such as those discussed with reference to . The network enabled devices and may communicate with the classical controller via the network

Each of the network enabled devices and may have access to e.g. be able to interact with via the classical controller one or more quantum components and respectively. These quantum components and may represent physical sources of quantum randomness for example where each device D or where pairs of devices D execute a protocol converting a locally random input into a globally random output for example as discussed in reference to the example of . In particular the network enabled device may interact with through communications with the classical controller the quantum components which are j in number. Likewise the network enabled device may interact with through the communications with the classical controller the quantum components which are n j in number. That is the total number n of components of the quantum device are split between the network enabled devices and in an implementation. In general the number j may be any suitable number such as one two three etc. up to n 1. Further in some cases the quantum components and the quantum components may be isolated from one another and in other cases the quantum components and the quantum components may be resettable allowing quantum communication between protocol iterations. As physical sources these quantum components and may be spatially separated untrusted quantum devices for example.

Access of the multiple network enabled devices and to the corresponding quantum components and may allow multiple network enabled device to carry out quantum computations simultaneously or cooperatively in an implementation. For example the network enabled devices and may initiate a quantum key generation scheme as further discussed with reference to where each of the network enabled devices and are able to initiate respective random number generation protocols via the corresponding quantum components and . In general however the network enabled devices and may perform quantum operations via the corresponding quantum components and independently and for any suitable purpose.

The network enabled devices and may also communicate with each other in some implementations via the network . For example the network enabled devices and may communicate as part of a quantum key distribution protocol and may communicate securely after sharing a generated quantum key.

The networks and may be different types of networks in an implementation. For example the network may include a wired network and the network may include a wireless network. Alternatively the network may include a private network and the network may include a public network. In general the networks and may differ based on any parameters or properties such as privacy network type network carrier or provider etc. Further communication via the networks and may differ based on required types of security. As such the network enabled devices and may communicate with the classical controller such that a common level of security may be established e.g. via the generation of a quantum key on the quantum device and subsequent communications between the network enabled devices and may adhere to security requirements of both of the networks and in an implementation.

In addition to interacting with the classical controller via separate or different networks network enabled devices may interact with a quantum device via separate or different classical controllers in an implementation. As in an example system illustrated in network enable devices and may interact with the quantum device via a classical controller and a classical controller respectively. The network enabled devices and may be communicatively coupled to the classical controllers and via the networks and and the network enabled devices and may only interact with corresponding quantum components and of the quantum device in an implementation. In this manner interactions or communication with the quantum device from the network enabled devices and are shielded from one another. That is the network enabled devices and may perform quantum computations via the quantum device independent of one another e.g. via separate or different classical controllers and networks . As with the other described examples the quantum components and may represent physical sources of quantum randomness for example where each device D or where pairs of devices D execute a protocol converting a locally random input into a globally random output.

In the illustrated example each extractor produces an instance that is used as the input to a corresponding modules where each module may be implemented as a different physical source of randomness for example. In particular the physical sources may be spatially separated untrusted quantum devices for example. The modules each execute a protocol also termed a sub protocol to convert a locally random input into a globally random output. In this way the modules can be thought of a sub protocol modules. In some examples such as those described in reference to below the sub protocol modules employ a quantum randomness decoupling RD protocol which makes use of a untrusted quantum device and transforms an input random to the device to an output almost perfectly random to all systems other than the device. The randomness decoupling protocol is also described herein as a randomness certification protocol.

In the illustrated example each of the modules includes a protocol that makes a randomness certification decision from which the module produces an accept abort decision G along producing the bit output string Y which is the output string of the i th instance of the randomness certification of the sub protocol of modules . That is the modules reflect a deterministic operation as well as a quantum randomness operation. As such while the modules can be implemented using physical source that includes a quantum device the modules may be implemented partially using quantum devices and a classical controller e.g. and such as control logic providing deterministic processes. In any event the accept abort decisions are provided to a decision module which in the illustrated example is a stage that computes a threshold function of all decisions. In particular the decision module will accept if the percentage of the acceptances is at least some threshold 0 

In the illustrated example the extractors need not trust the corresponding sub protocol modules as the protocols within the modules can make a randomness accept abort decision. As a consequence of this lack of trust each extractor may simultaneously minimize two types of errors the soundness error that is for accepting the output of less than desired quality and the completeness error that is for rejecting the output of an honest device.

The extractors are quantum secure randomness extractors which turn a weak input source into a collection of outputs where at least one of those outputs is near perfectly random to an adversary but nevertheless resides in an unknown location. That is one of the extractors will produce a near perfectly random bit or string but the exact extractor may be unknown to the system and as such to an adversary. To obtain the desired output randomness from this quantum secure somewhere randomness the output from each extractor is applied to a respective quantum device employing a protocol that turns a local perfect randomness input signal into a global randomness output signal a task we call randomness decoupling. The output of each of these protocols of modules is combined into the bit wise XOR aggregator stage .

Example extractors that may be used in the system include Trevisan s extractors which have been shown to be quantum secure by De et al. Anindya De Christopher Portmann Thomas Vidick and Renato Renner. Trevisans extractor in the presence of quantum side information. SIAM Journal on Computing 067 258932 2012. which is hereby incorporated by reference. The quantum devices can be those as described below in reference to for example. Other suitable quantum devices include those applying Vazirani Vidick s device independent quantum key distribution DI QKD protocols and device independent randomness expansion DI RE protocols described in U. Vazirani and T. Vidick Certifiable quantum dice. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences 370 1971 3432 3448 2012 and U. Vazirani and T. Vidick Fully device independent quantum key distribution. arXiv 1210.1810v2 25 Nov. 2012 which are both hereby incorporated by reference. However in contrast to these later described devices the system is configured to tolerate noise levels assumed non existent in theoretical systems but that we recognize as valuable for practical systems. The present techniques for example suggest protocols that allow for noise levels not achievable in theoretical and conventional systems and may be achieved when outputting only a single bit.

In the illustrated example each sub protocol module exhibits a protocol IT which may be a classical algorithm interacting with an untrusted quantum device with multiple spatially separated components. Such a protocol is a randomness decoupling alternatively referred to as a randomness certification protocol and its goal is to generated certified uniform randomness from any weak source with sufficient entropy using untrusted devices. The protocol may be made to satisfy two properties i completeness which generally provides that when the devices are honest i.e. following the prescribed design and the source has sufficient entropy the protocol should accept with high probability and the output should be close to uniformly random and ii soundness which generally provides when the devices are malicious the probability of accepting their low quality output is negligibly small. The definitions in 4.2 and 4.3 capture both properties for a random certification protocol respectively. In particular the protocol may include a randomness certification protocol for n k source with completeness error and soundness error if it satisfies the following completeness and soundness properties respectively.

1. Completeness There exists a quantum admissible strategy for devices D such that for every source X the probability that the protocol fl accepts the input signal is greater than the completeness error expressed as accepts 1 . 4.2 

2. Soundness For every joint system of the source devices and the environment such that H X D k and let id then we have 4.3 

The source X e.g. source need only have k bits of min entropy conditioned on the devices D and not conditioned on both the devices and the environment E. This isolation of the min entropy source gives better confidence on the amount of entropy in X that is sufficient of randomness generation using untrusted sources.

In examining 4.3 it is noted that the choice of H ND may be extended easily to a smooth min entropy source H X D by allowing an extra error in the soundness error. That is the present randomness generation techniques are still able to sufficiently function and produce random bit strings within the added error tolerance with the configurations described.

In some examples the desired properties for a randomness amplification protocol applied by sub protocol modules would be as follows. With the system it is desirable to take a small amount of min entropy k and efficiently generate a long and high quality certified randomness measured by output length l and soundness error where the efficiency can be measured by the number of devices t and the query and time complexity of the protocol l. Note that since the sub protocol modules can generate randomness one can expect that the output length l is larger than the investigated entropy k that is to achieve expansion property. High quality randomness is useful for some applications such as cryptography and it is desirable to have soundness error to be poly logarithmic in the investigated entropy k and the complexity of protocol .

Moreover to implement the protocol in physical systems robustness should be achieved that is a strengthening of completeness such that the protocol accepts an input with high probability even when a small constant amount of noise is present in the sub protocol modules . This robustness is beneficially achieved by specifying a noise model for the protocol as described where in some examples the noise model is dependent at least partially upon the type of quantum device i.e. physical sources used as sub protocol modules . Further examples are detailed hereinbelow in reference to .

In addition to employing a quantum processes the modules can employ a randomness certification protocol where the goal is to certify uniform randomness produced by the devices against the environment based on the uniform seed. In an example protocol includes a randomness certification sub protocol with seed length n and having a completeness error and soundness error that satisfies the following conditions respectively. Again while the values 4.2 and 4.3 may be satisfied for the protocol overall for the randomness certification protocol the following additional expressions for completeness and soundness may be used.

1. Completeness There exists a quantum admissible strategy for devices D such that for every source X not necessarily uniform accepts 1 . 4.4 

2. Soundness For every joint system of the source devices and the environment such that U and let id then we have 4.5 

For randomness expansion conventional techniques require the certified randomness output is longer than the original seed input. In contrast the present techniques do not place such limits on the randomness output. Instead the output may be close to uniform against the environment E with a min entropy seed input X such that the entropy comes from the quantum devices disconnecting the output from the input seed input. Indeed because the output is not limited by the size of the original seed input the randomness certification protocol may certify just a single bit from a long seed input.

In any event demonstrates an entire randomness amplification protocol or flame for random number generation based on an input bit or string X from a weak source applying a randomness amplification protocol to X which includes using the extractor Ext to turn X into a somewhere random source S . . . S where d is the seed length of Ext and S Ext X i and then for each i 2 applying a randomness certification protocol with seed Sand distinct set of quantum devices D each of which outputs O Z . If the percentage of acceptances is outside of some threshold 0 

At a high level relies upon the output of some extractor S being close to uniform and thus can be used as the seed in which certifies that the output Zfrom the modules is close to uniform even conditioned on everything except D which includes source X environment E the devices Dused by other blocks. This implies that Zis close to uniform conditioned on the outputs Zof other blocks and thus Z Z Z is close to uniform.

As discussed below illustrate implementations using an example protocol for the quantum devices of . For example each of the quantum devices may include a plurality of quantum sub device each operating according to a non local game in a random bit generation cycle wherein each quantum device i maintains isolation among the plurality of quantum sub devices in the quantum device during the random bit generation cycle so that each of the plurality of quantum sub devices of the quantum device maintains at least one of superposition or entanglement during the random bit generation cycle and ii causes communication among the plurality of quantum sub devices of the quantum device after the random bit generation cycle.

In any event as explained this example protocol may be used for random number generation unbounded randomness expansion and quantum key distribution. While the examples are discussed in reference to the protocol of the present techniques may be applied with any suitable protocol implementing quantum devices. Other suitable quantum devices include those applying Vazirani Vidick s device independent quantum key distribution DI QKD protocols and device independent randomness expansion DI RE protocols described respectively in U. Vazirani and T. Vidick. Certifiable quantum dice. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences 370 1971 3432 3448 2012 and U. Vazirani and T.

In some implementations the game G is a non local game. Generally non local games may differ in scenarios in which the games are played by or implemented in systems operating according to classical mechanics as compared to scenarios in which the games are played by or implemented in systems operating according to quantum mechanics. An example non local game is a cooperative game involving two or more players e.g. quantum systems . The players cannot communicate but may share common random bits or a common quantum state. A controller or other suitable device may send an input to one of the players who then responds with an answer. Winning in the non local game may include satisfying a condition dependent on the inputs from the controller e.g. inputs from a known probability distribution .

During each iteration of the protocol which iteration produces a random value or bit the quantum device plays the game G. That is the quantum device receives an input g for a single round of the game and operates such that a result is produced. G may include any binary Exclusive Or XOR game such as a game with inputs and outputs are binary and with a scoring function depending on the inputs and the XOR of the outputs where the binary XOR game is strongly self testing in an implementation. The game G may be strongly self testing or non local in that any strategy that is close within an value E or E close to optimal in its winning probability must be O close to a unique optimal strategy in both its state and its measurements in an implementation. In this case the term strongly refers to the O term which is the best possible asymptotic bound for a non local game. By way of example strong self testing games may include the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt CHSH game and the Greenberger Horne Zeilinger GHZ game but it is understood that the protocol may utilize any such binary XOR game. Although strong self testing or non local games are discussed above and below by way of example and for clarity some implementations of protocols for generating random numbers may utilize other contextuality games along with or as an alternative to non local games as further illustrated in .

The protocol may include the following parameters in an implementation i N a positive integer e.g. the output length ii a real 0 1 e.g. the abort threshold iii q a real 0 e.g. the test frequency iv G an n player non local game that is a strong self test v D an untrusted quantum device e.g. from an untrusted party that can play G repeatedly and cannot receive any additional information. In a single iteration i.e. use of the protocol the components and may not be allowed to communicate but in between iterations there may be inter component communication. For any real 0 1 the protocol with appropriate parameters converts any k uniform bits to exp k extractible bits with exp k error under a constant level of noise in an implementation.

In some implementations quantum proof randomness extractors are applied to the outputs of the protocol to produce near perfect random output from the protocol . The quantum proof randomness extractors may be deterministic functions Ext X S on two arguments i X being the source which in this case may be the output of the protocol and ii S being a perfectly random seed. The extractors Ext X S may in an implementation convert any N bits X that have min entropy Q N to a near perfect output randomness of length N .

To begin a bit g 0 1 is determined block . In an implementation the bit input bit g may be determined according to a biased 1 q q distribution. It is understood however that the input bit g may be received from a random or quasi random e.g. based at least partially on a deterministic function source or determined according to any suitable distribution as further discussed with reference to .

Next it is determined if g 1 block . If g 1 the iteration of the method is determined to be a game round and an input string is determined at random block . In some cases the input string may be determined from 0 1 according a probability distribution specified by the game G and given to a quantum device executing the method . On the other hand if g 0 an input string 00 . . . 0 is input to components of the quantum device implementing the method block .

After inputting or coupling the binary input g into the components of the quantum device the outputs of the quantum device components are measured block . Depending on i.e. based on the measured output of the quantum device components and the rules of game G a result value is determined and recorded block . For example in the case of a game round a P pass or an F fail may be recorded according to the rules of the game G. In the case of g 0 a H heads may be recorded when the output from the first component is zero otherwise a T tails may be recorded. In general any type of binary numeric alphabetic or symbolic result values may be determined based on the output of the quantum device components.

It is then determined if N result values have been calculated based on the procedure of blocks block . If the number of result values that have been generated is less than N the flow reverts back to block where the process of generating another result value is initiated. If the number of result values equals N the resulting sequence of values e.g. N length sequence from the alphabet P F H T is output for subsequent storage or utilization. For example the resulting sequence may be stored by a classical controller such as the classical controller for use as a random number or key. Alternatively a classical controller may communicate the result sequence to a network enabled device such as one or more of the network enabled devices .

In some implementations a quantum device implementing the example method may also determine if the failure rate e.g. out of all the game rounds exceeds 1 w where wis the highest probability with which a quantum strategy can win the game G. If the failure rate exceeds 1 w the example method may abort restart output an error etc. Also if more than 2qN game rounds have occurred the example method may abort in an implementation.

Although the above protocol is described with reference to non local games the game G need not be non local game or strong self testing game defined in the manner described above. Generally the game G may be a contextuality game such as the game further described in Simple test for hidden variables in spin 1 systems A. Klyachko M. Can S. Binicioglu and A. Shumovsky 101 020403 2008. A contextuality game may be a game played by a single quantum player e.g. quantum system where a compatibility requirement specifies a collection of subsets of the player s quantum measurements. Those subsets of measurements must be mutually commutative in some cases. A contextuality game G with m measurement setting includes a multilinear polynomial f encoding rules for the game. For example a multilinear function satisfying f 1 may encode rules for a games as follows. Let D be a contextual measurement device whose set of contexts includes Supp f that is includes every element T1 2 . . . m for which f . To play this example game a subset T is chosen at random under the probability distribution f and given as input to the device D. If b . . . b are output bits the score of the game may be given by 

In fact some protocols utilized to generate random numbers may utilize a contextuality game played or implemented by a single quantum system. illustrates such an example protocol including a contextuality game played by a single quantum system. illustrates a flow of such a protocol e.g. referred to as Protocol K .

Generally protocols utilized in systems such as the example system to generate random numbers may be implemented by any suitable number of quantum devices or systems and may utilize non local games contextuality games or suitable combinations of these games. The above described protocols and are examples of such protocols. For further clarity a general or abstract protocol describing both of these example protocols and is illustrated in . When the protocol illustrated in utilizes a non local game e.g. a binary XOR game the protocol may reduce to the example protocol and when the protocol illustrated in utilizes a contextuality game the protocol may reduce to the example protocol . In any event protocols and may have security guarantees for all noise levels that are within a maximum noise level e.g. when the devices implementing the protocols and cease to output randomness .

For clarity certain quantities that may describe properties of randomness expansion protocols of the current disclosure are discussed briefly below. A Classical Quantum C Q state may be considered ideal with y a positive integer extractible bits if the first bit of the classical part indicates Success or Failure and conditioned on Success the C Q state has conditional min entropy y.

A randomness expansion protocol may have a yield y with soundness error if for any device D the output is always within trace distance of an ideal state with y extractable bits. The protocol may tolerate a noise level A with completeness error if any device that plays each game independently with an expected score no less than w will abort with probability at most . If both the soundness and the completeness errors are . The error of the protocol may be referred to simply as . Note that in an implementation may be reals in 0 1 .

The implementation of may use soundness and completeness errors as follows where these errors satisfy the randomness amplification protocols and randomness certification protocols described above. For any strong self test G and any 0 there may exist positive constants g N b c such that the following holds when a randomness expansion protocol of the current disclosure is executed with parameters q q and N N 

Note input bits g . . . gmay be generated by O Nh q uniformly random bits with an error exp qN where h denotes the Shannon entropy function. Therefore when q is chosen to be small a randomness expansion protocol may need only log N initial bits and one device to achieve N extractable bits with negligible error.

For any real 0 a randomness expansion protocol with appropriate parameters may convert any k uniform bits to exp k near uniform bits with exp error under a constant level of noise. Once a near perfect random output is generated the output may be utilized as the input to another instance of the protocol thus expanding further with an accumulating error parameter. As the error parameters decrease at an exponential rate they may be dominated by the first set of errors.

An input extractor of the protocol may obtain an input bit g from a portion of X. The portion of X from which g is obtained may include a preprocessed portion of X in an implementation. Then the input extractor may obtain m bits x either from the source X when g is one or m bits of 0 otherwise. These m bit may then be passed from the input extractor to m quantum components of a quantum device such as the quantum device to play the game G as illustrated in the box . The protocol may also include an output determination and randomness extraction which outputs result values from the game G based on the output of the quantum components playing the game G and the input x. Note although the box is illustrated as a protocol utilizing a non local game the box may be replaced with a protocol utilizing a contextuality game as described further with reference to .

To begin parameters for the randomness expansion are received and or set block . The parameters for the randomness expansion may include desired output length N output randomness quality failure probability and the noise level tolerated as discussed above. In some implementations these parameters are programmed into or determined by executing computer readable instructions stored in the memory of a classical controller such as the classical controller . Alternatively a user or operator may set the parameters via manual interaction with a user interface keyboard touchscreen mouse etc. operatively connected to a classical controller or network enabled device. By way of example the parameters may be selected chosen or set according to security requirements for the generation of random numbers and or the parameters may be selected to provide an appropriate balance between realistic tolerances or failure rates and desired output properties. In some cases the received or set parameters allow the rate of randomness expansion and or the number of output bits as a function of the number of input bits to range between a linear function and an exponential function.

Next random values are received from a source X block and an input extractor extracts one or more input values g from X. In some cases the input extractor extracts g from a preprocessed portion of X. If the input value g 1 as determined at block m values x x . . . x from X are coupled into the m components of the quantum device executing the method block . However if the input value g 0 m zero values are coupled to the m components of the quantum device block .

After the m values are coupled to the quantum device and the device plays the game G such as the game an output is measured from the m quantum device components block . For example an output may be measured via the output interfaces controlled via the classical controller . The measurements of the output may include measurements of any suitable quantum mechanical properties representing data within the method such as charge spin etc.

One or more result values are then determined based on the measured output from the quantum device components block . For example a raw output bit z may be determined and recorded e.g. by a classical controller as the result of the game. In some implementations the raw output bit may equal one for winning and zero for losing according to the scoring rule of the game G the observed output of the quantum device and the input x.

Subsequent to the determination and recording of the output bit or result value it is determined if the number of result value generated thus far is equal to the desired output length N block . If less than N result values have been generated the flow reverts to block where the generation of further result values is initiated.

Otherwise if N result values have been generated the flow continues to block where it is determined if a number of failures of the method is greater than a threshold. In some implementations this determination includes determining if the number of failed game plays among those with g equal to one e.g. game rounds exceeds the threshold parameter received or set in block . In some cases the quantum device executing the method satisfies an uncertainty principle that ensures that the quantum devices either fails the game G or has high quality output randomness. If the number of failures is greater than the threshold the flow may continue to block where the method aborts. However if the number of failures is less than the threshold the flow continues to block where result values are output.

In some implementations the result values generated via the above procedure are output to a known quantum secure strong randomness extractor and back to the source X to supply the required random seed for the extractor. In such a case the output of the extractor may be the final output y of the example method .

That the O log N iterations of the randomness expansion protocol require only two quantum devices in some implementations. This utilization of only two quantum devices may be based on the fact that when the input to a randomness expansion protocol is independent of the device but not necessary the adversary. The output of the randomness expansion protocol may still be as good as it would be had the input been perfectly random to both the device and the adversary.

A fixed number of random values X is received block . The fixed number of random values may be obtained from a trusted source of random values in an implementations as discussed further with respect to . The fixed number of random values X may contain any number of random values such as one two three four etc. In some cases a first of the quantum devices implementing the method may receive the random values X from a classical controller such as the classical controller .

Subsequently the first of the quantum devices implementing the method generates a number of random values Y block where the number of random values corresponding to Y is greater than the number of random values corresponding to X. The number of random values Y may be exponentially greater than the number of random values X depending on parameters of the randomness expansion protocol utilized by the method. However it is understood that the random values Y may be greater in number than the random values X in any suitable manner such as greater in number by a fixed number linearly greater in number etc.

Next the random values Y are input into a second of the quantum devices implementing the method such that the second of the quantum devices generated random values Y where the number of random values corresponding to Y is greater than the number of random values corresponding to Y. As above Y may be greater in number than the random values Yin any suitable manner. Further the first and second of the quantum device may implement the same or different randomness expansion protocols and generate increasing random number values at different expansion rates. In some cases however the first and second of the quantum devices may implement similar protocols and expand randomness at similar rates.

It is then determined if the number of random values Y is greater than or equal to N block the desired output length of desired number of output result values. If the output is of the desired length the result values Y are output for utilization or further manipulation block . For example the output values may be communicated to the classical controller and or the network enabled device .

If the number of random values Y is less than N the flow continues to block where Y is relabeled as X. Then the flow reverts to block where the new input X or Y is utilized as input to the first of the quantum devices. As illustrated in such a protocol may iterate 2N times each Y labeled as Y Y . . . Y and each Y labeled as Y Y . . . Y where the output of a first randomness extraction protocol is input to a second randomness extraction protocol and the output of the second randomness extraction protocol is input to the first randomness extraction protocol .

In some cases a first and second quantum device implementing the method may be isolated from one another even if corresponding components of each of the devices may be internally resettable. For example a quantum device executing the first randomness extraction protocol may be isolated from a quantum device executing the second randomness extraction protocol .

In the illustrated example N is determined for the method . In other examples N may be determined during operation of the method for example to allow for unbounded expansion until an external decisional control such as from a classical controller concludes the expansion process.

The above discussed protocols for random number generation and randomness expansion may be applied to untrusted device quantum key distribution QKD between two example parties Alice and Bob e.g. the network enabled devices and respectively in an implementation. Alice may interact with a first component of a quantum device while Bob may interact with all the other components of the quantum device. Alice and Bob may share randomness for executing a protocol as well as randomness for later stages of information reconciliation and randomness extraction.

In some implementations Alice and Bob use a public channel to compare their device outputs e.g. the network for those game rounds or protocol iterations in which an input bit g is one. Once a QKD protocol succeeds Alice and Bob may apply a standard post processing method to obtain a shared near uniformly random key.

To begin a party A and a party B retrieve or receive random values X block . The party A and the party B may retrieve X from a trusted source of random numbers and in some cases only one of the parties A and B retrieve X. For example a one of the parties A and B initiating communication with the other of the parties A and B may retrieve the random values X or vise versa.

The random values X are then shared between the parties A and B block . In some implementations this sharing may involve a message from party A to party B or vise versa and in other example cases the source of the random values X may simply send the same random values to both of the parties A and B.

After sharing the random values X the parties A and B each generate a random number based on X using the quantum device components corresponding to party A and the party B respectively blocks and . In an implementation the parties A and B may utilize one of the example protocols or to generate the random number. However each of the parties A and B may utilize any suitable combination of protocols similar to the protocols and to generate a random value or sequence of random values.

The output e.g. measure output of the quantum components corresponding to party B is then communicated with party A. In some implementations only the output corresponding to game rounds e.g. g 1 is communicated from party B to party A. The communication may be a classical communication and may include electronic communication via one or more private or public networks.

Next it is determined if the output from the quantum components is to be accepted block . In some implementations only one of the parties A and B such as party A determines if the output from the quantum components is to be accepted. The determination may be based on any type of pre or otherwise determined parameters such as failure rates thresholds etc. as discussed further with respect to . If the output is determined to not be acceptable the flow may revert to block to restart the method or the method may abort not shown .

If the output from the quantum components is accepted the flow continues to block where information is reconciled between the parties A and B. The reconciliation may include a known method for information reconciliation in an implementation. Next a final shared key is output based on the output of the quantum components corresponding to both party A and party B block . The final shared key may be output to the devices corresponding to the parties A and B and or to other computing devices or network components storing security information or granting access or communications permissions.

Further proofs theorems corollaries definitions protocols etc. relevant to the protocols techniques systems and methods described above are presented below. These proofs theorems corollaries and definitions are provided by way of example and clarification. Some or all of the quantum systems protocols etc. discussed above in the example methods and systems may utilize and or adhere to some or all of the proofs theorems corollaries and definitions. However any suitable quantum systems as described above may implement the methods described herein for generating random numbers expanding randomness and or distributing quantum keys.

Some of the proofs and theorems depend on the quantum Renyi entropies. For any 1 and any density matrix p and any positive semidefinite operator let 

Suppose that Q is a qubit and E is a quantum system that is entangled with Q. Let be a density operator which represents the state of E. Let and represent the states that arise when Q is measured along the 0 1 basis and the basis. We prove the following 

Theorem. There is a continuous function 0 satisfying 0 0 such that the following holds. For any operators . representing states arising from anti commutative measurements if

The above theorem asserts that if the quantity determined by the 0 1 measurement is small then the outcome of the measurement must be uncertain as measured by the 1 e Renyi divergence . This parallels other uncertainty principles that have been used in quantum cryptography. The proof of this result is based on a known matrix inequality for the 2 2 Schatten norm.

Say that a device with trusted measurements D is a single part input output device which receives a single bit as an input and depending on the value of the bit performs one of two perfectly anti commutative binary measurements on a quantum system. The measurements of the device are trusted but the state is unknown.

Also suppose that we make the following modifications to the procedure that defines a protocol similar to the protocol discussed with reference to referred to herein as Protocol R 

1. Instead of a multi part binary device we use a single part binary device with trusted measurements.

2. Instead of playing a nonlocal game at each round we simply use the bit g as input to the device and record the output.

Note that Protocols A and R both involve conditioning on a success event. One of the central difficulties found in establishing quantum security is in determining the impact that this conditioning has on the randomness of the device D. In the classical security context one can show that once we condition on the success event most uses of the device D in an appropriate sense generate random outputs. By elementary arguments the outputs therefore accumulate min entropy linearly over multiple iterations and randomness expansion is achieved.

A successful way to interpret the success abort events in the quantum context may involves two adjustments to the classical approach outlined above. First the quantum Renyi entropy is used in place of the smooth min entropy. The quantum Renyi entropies have elegant arithmetic properties which make them more amenable to induction. Secondly rather than directly considering success and abort as discrete events a graded measurement of performance interpolates between the two.

Suppose that E is a quantum system which is initially entangled with D. For the purposes of this discussion assume that E and D are maximally entangled and the state is totally mixed. Then the state of E after one iteration can be expressed as 1 1 .

Suppose that the randomness of a state is measured with respect to a second party who knows the value of the bit g. Then an appropriate measure of randomness may be the Renyi divergence d with respect to the operator 1 q 1 q q q . For the parameter it turns out that simply taking 1 q is useful.

One could hope that this quantity is strictly smaller than d but this is not always so for example for measurements on a maximally entangled Bell state . But consider instead the modified expression 

Theorem 2.1 implies that this quantity is always less than Cd p where C 1 is a fixed constant. Essentially this is because if the quantity is large then the introduction of the coefficient lowers the value of the expression significantly and if is small then the desired bound is implied .

One can think of the function d p as an error tolerant measure of performance. The presence of the coefficient 2compensates for the loss of randomness when the device failure quantity Tr p is large.

Now let B denote the output register of Protocol R and let denote the joint state of E and B at the conclusion of the protocol. Let be an operator on BE defined by 

An inductive argument proves that d C. This inequality is sufficient to deduce that the Renyi entropy of the success state s grows linearly in N. One can therefore deduce that for appropriate parameters the outputs of Protocol A contain a linear number of extractable quantum proof bits.

It may be further proved that if Protocol A is executed with a partially trusted measurement device i.e. a measurement device whose measurements are anticommunicative only with a certain positive probability then it produces a linear amount of randomness. This generalization may be crucial for the carrying over of results into a fully device independent setting.

A second insight enabling at least in some cases properties of the protocols discussed herein is that nonlocal games simulate partially trusted devices. When certain nonlocal games are played even with a device that is completely untrusted their outcomes may match the behavior of a device that is partially trusted.

To illustrate this a class of devices is formalized as follows. Definition Let n be a positive integer. A binary quantum device with n components D D . . . D include the following 

2. For any k 0 and any transcript T representing the collective previous inputs and outputs during previous rounds a unitary operator U Q Qand a collection of Hermitian operator Mon Qsatisfying M 1.

The behavior of the device D is as follows at round i the devices first collectively perform the unitary operation U and then according to their inputs b each performs binary measurements specified by the operators M. This device model allows communication in between rounds in an implementation 

Now a somewhat more specific type of device is defined. Suppose that E is a single part binary quantum device. Say that E is a partially trusted device with parameters u v if the measurement operators Nthat E uses on input 1 decompose as where Pis perfectly anti commutative with the other measurement N and Qsatisfies Q 1 and is otherwise unspecified . Essentially the device behaves as follows. On input 0 it performs a perfect measurement. On input 1 it does one of the following at random it performs a perfectly anti commuting measurement probability v or it performs an unknown measurement probability u v or it ignores its quantum system and merely outputs a perfect coin flip probability 1 u . The second possibility is referred to herein as a dishonest mistake and the third is referred to herein as an honest mistake. 

Proving that untrusted devices can be simulated by partially trusted devices is an example of a task that is fairly easy in the classical security context but difficult in the quantum context. For example if one knows that a quantum device performs at a superclassical level at a particular nonlocal game then one knows that its outcomes are at least partly random and thus can be simulated by a biased coin flip or a partially trusted coin flip . But to prove quantum security one needs a stronger notion of simulation one that allows for the possibility quantum side information.

The basis for a simulation result may be certain known properties of quantum self testing. Games from the class of strong self tests are considered although as discussed further above contextuality games may also be implemented in one or more protocols discussed herein 

Theorem. Let G be a strong self test and let D be an untrusted binary device with n components. Then the behavior of D Protocol R can be simulated by a partially trusted device.

Reducing to the case where dim Q 2 each measurement operator being projective and after an appropriate choice of basis 

Proving the existence of the sequence . . . is matter of manipulations of complex numbers. One surprising aspect of this proof is that depends critically on the fact that G is not only a self test but a strong self test.

Another protocol Protocol A see further description with reference to is the same as Protocol A except that a partially trusted measurement device is used. Protocol R can be simulated by Protocol A for an appropriately chosen partially trusted device. This means not only that the probability distributions of the outputs of the two protocols are exactly the same but also that there is a simulation of the behavior of any external quantum environment that may be possessed by an adversary. Since the Protocol A with a partially trusted device produces a linear amount of min entropy the same is true of Protocol R. This completes the proof.

For further clarity and by way of example a formalization of some terminology and notation for describing certain example quantum devices is presented below 

Definition Let n be a positive integer. Another example binary quantum device with n components D D . . . D includes the following 

1. Quantum systems Q . . . Qwhose initial state is specified by a density operator Q . . . Q Q . . . Q .

2. For any k 0 and any function T 0 1 1 2 . . . k 1 2 . . . n 0 1 a unitary operator U Q . . . Q Q . . . Q and a collection of Hermitian operators

The device D may behave as follows. Suppose that k iterations of the device have already taken place and suppose that T is such that T 0 i j E 0 1 and T 1 i j E 0 1 represent the input bit and output bit respectively for the jth player on the ith round i k . T is the transcript function. Then 

2. Each component D . . . D receives its input bit b then applies the binary nondestructive measurement on Q given by 

Suppose that one binary quantum device D simulates another binary quantum device D if for any purifying systems E and E for D and D respectively and any input sequence i . . . i 0 1 the joint state of the outputs of D together with E is isomorphic to the joint state of the outputs of D together with E on the same input sequence. Similarly let us say that a protocol X simulates another protocol Y if for any purifying systems E and E for the quantum devices used by X and Y respectively the joint state of E together with the outputs of X is isomorphic to the joint state of E together with the outputs of Y.

Definition Say that a binary quantum device D is in canonical form if each of its quantum systems Qis such that Q Cfor some m 1 and each measurement operator pair M M M M has the following 2 2 diagonal block form 

Definition Let u v 0 1 be positive real numbers such that v u 1. Then a partially trusted device with parameters u v includes the following data 

2. For every pair i o of binary strings of equal length two Hermitian operator M Mon Q e.g. representing measurements satisfy the following conditions a there exist perfectly anti commuting measurement pairs T T such that M Tfor all i o and b the operator Mdecomposes as M v T u v N with N 1.

Intuitively a partially trusted device is a device D which always performs a trusted measurement Ton input 0 and on input 1 selects one of the three operators T N 0 at random according to the probability distribution v u v 1 u .

Consider example protocol A with the trusted device replaced by a partially trusted device. The outputs of Protocol A may be as follows let g denote the bit g from the ith round of the protocol and let G denote a classical register which consists of the bits g g . . . g. Let obe equal to 0 if the outcome of the ith round is P or H and let o be equal to 1 if the outcome of the ith round is F or T. Let O be a classical register consisting of the bits o o . . . o. Also succ may denote the success event in Protocol A .

For example where the hardware modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connects the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of the example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but also deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but also deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or a server farm . In other example embodiments the one or more processors or processor implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.

Unless specifically stated otherwise discussions herein using words such as processing computing calculating determining presenting displaying or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine e.g. a computer that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical e.g. electronic magnetic or optical quantities within one or more memories e.g. volatile memory non volatile memory or a combination thereof registers or other machine components that receive store transmit or display information.

As used herein any reference to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular element feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase in one embodiment in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

Some embodiments may be described using the expression coupled and connected along with their derivatives. For example some embodiments may be described using the term coupled to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. The term coupled however may also mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other but yet still co operate or interact with each other. The embodiments are not limited in this context.

As used herein the terms comprises comprising includes including has having or any other variation thereof are intended to cover a non exclusive inclusion. For example a process method article or apparatus that comprises a list of elements is not necessarily limited to only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process method article or apparatus. Further unless expressly stated to the contrary or refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following A is true or present and B is false or not present A is false or not present and B is true or present and both A and B are true or present .

In addition use of the a or an are employed to describe elements and components of the embodiments herein. This is done merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the description. This description and the claims that follow should be read to include one or at least one and the singular also includes the plural unless it is obvious that it is meant otherwise.

This detailed description is to be construed as an example only and does not describe every possible embodiment as describing every possible embodiment would be impractical if not impossible. One could implement numerous alternate embodiments using either current technology or technology developed after the filing date of this application.
