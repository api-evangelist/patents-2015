One embodiment is directed generally to a device and more particularly to a device that produces haptic effects.

Haptics is a tactile and force feedback technology that takes advantage of a user s sense of touch by applying haptic feedback effects i.e. haptic effects such as forces vibrations and motions to the user. Devices such as mobile devices touchscreen devices and personal computers can be configured to generate haptic effects. In general calls to embedded hardware capable of generating haptic effects such as actuators can be programmed within an operating system OS of the device. These calls specify which haptic effect to play. For example when a user interacts with the device using for example a button touchscreen lever joystick wheel or some other control the OS of the device can send a play command through control circuitry to the embedded hardware. The embedded hardware then produces the appropriate haptic effect.

Such devices can also be configured to play audio data such as a digital audio signal. For example such devices can include applications configured to play video data such as a movie or video game that contains an audio portion or audio data such as a song. Similar to haptics calls to additional embedded hardware capable of generating audio effects such as speakers can be programmed within the OS of the device. Thus the OS of the device can send a play command through control circuitry to the additional embedded hardware where the additional embedded hardware then produces the appropriate audio effect.

The system further generates a haptic signal based on the maximum value and the modulated data frame. The system further sends the haptic signal to an actuator to generate the one or more haptic effects.

In the illustrated embodiment haptic conversion module is comprised of three sub modules reverb module boombox module and band pass filter . However this is merely an example embodiment and in alternate embodiments haptic conversion module can be comprised of any number of sub modules or haptic conversion module can be a single module.

According to the embodiment reverb module is configured to intercept the one or more audio buffers that audio track module streams to speaker . Reverb module is further configured to send each audio data frame of each audio buffer to boombox module .

Boombox module is further configured to send each audio data frame of each audio buffer to band pass filter . Band pass filter is configured to band pass filter each audio data frame of each audio buffer. By band pass filtering each audio data frame band pass filter can filter on one or more frequency bands of frequency signals of any given range in a given audio buffer e.g. a single frequency band of frequency signals in the 0 500 Hz range . Thus all signals within this frequency range can be extracted to create a new audio buffer of only these signals. The effect yielded from this filtering can be a bass boost or subwoofer type of signal. Band pass filter is further configured to return each band pass filtered audio data frame to boombox module . In alternate embodiments band pass filter is not a filter but a transformation module such as a digital signal processor DSP process a state machine or other type of programmatic logic . In these alternate embodiments the transformation module can transform the received audio data frame into a new audio data frame where the transformation is not necessary a filtering transformation.

Boombox module is further configured for each band pass filtered audio data frame to generate a sine wave periodic carrier frequency also identified as a sine carrier waveform based on the maximum value of the band pass filtered audio data frame.

For each band pass filtered audio data frame boombox module is further configured to add the generated sine wave periodic carrier frequency to the band pass filtered audio data frame also identified as mixing the generated sine wave periodic carrier frequency with the band pass filtered audio data frame thus modulating the band pass filtered audio data frame. Boombox module is further configured to return each modulated audio data frame to reverb module .

The haptic conversion system also includes a haptic effect player module and an actuator . Haptic effect player module is a module that is embedded within a device such as a mobile device and that is configured to play one or more haptic effects at an actuator by sending one or more haptic signals to the actuator.

According to the embodiment reverb module is configured to determine whether each maximum value of each audio data frame is greater than a specific threshold. When the maximum value of the audio data frame is greater than the specific threshold reverb module is configured to call an application program interface API of haptic effect player module and send haptic effect player module the corresponding modulated audio data frame as a parameter of the API. When the maximum value of the audio data frame is not greater than the specific threshold reverb module is configured to ignore the audio data frame and not send the corresponding modulated audio data frame to haptic effect player module . In certain embodiments the API of haptic effect player module is a ImmVibeAppendWaveformEffect API of a TouchSense Player module by Immersion Corporation. In other embodiments the API could be ImmVibePlayMagSweepEffect or ImmVibePlayPeriodicEffect. The API of haptic effect player module sends the modulated audio data frame to actuator where actuator is configured to play an appropriate waveform based on the modulated audio data frame. According to the embodiment the modulated audio data frame serves as a waveform that is played by actuator where the waveform includes one or more frequency bands that are emphasized in addition to a periodic haptic signal and where the modulated audio data frame can control a precision of the waveform played by actuator .

According to the embodiment the haptic conversion system includes an operating system a reverb module a boombox module and an infinite impulse response UR filter . Operating system is an operating system of a device such as a mobile device . In the illustrated embodiment operating system is an Android operating system for a mobile device. Reverb module boombox module and IIR filter are sub modules of a haptic conversion module such as haptic conversion module of . In certain embodiments reverb module boombox module and IIR filter are identical to reverb module boombox module and band pass filter respectively of .

According to the embodiment at an application configured to create an audio signal is created. The application is any application that can be executed within operating system . In the illustrated embodiment the application is an Android application. The flow proceeds to . At a SoundPool object is created by the application where a SoundPool object is an instance of a SoundPool API which is an Android API and where a SoundPool object manages and plays audio resources for the application. The SoundPool object can include a collection of audio samples that can be loaded into a memory of a device from a resource stored within the device or from a file stored within a file system of the device. The SoundPool object can decode the collection of audio samples into a raw 16 bit PCM mono or stereo buffer. The flow proceeds to . At other audio objects are created by the application where the other audio objects are instances of other audio APIs. The other audio objects can also decode audio samples into a 16 bit PCM audio buffer. The flow proceeds to . At an AudioTrack object is created by either the SoundPool object or one of the other audio objects. An AudioTrack object is configured to receive one or more PCM audio buffers and stream the one or more PCM audio buffers.

The flow proceeds to . At a reverb object is created. A reverb object is an instance of reverb module where the reverb object is configured to process one or more audio data frames of a PCM audio buffer sent by the AudioTrack object as previously described in relation to . The flow proceeds to . At one or more settings of the reverb object are set. Example of reverb settings include enable disable haptic conversion enable disable haptic conversion for media select a strength of haptic conversion from three selections e.g. light moderate and strong and select one or more applications for example from a list for which haptic conversion is enabled. In certain embodiments the above settings are stored in an extensible markup language XML file. The above settings can be read from the XML file and stored within the reverb object where the reverb object can be enabled for certain applications and disabled for other applications. In certain embodiments three values identified as strength density and sharpness are based on three factors 1 strength setting e.g. light moderate and strong 2 haptic theme that maps user interface events with haptic effects and 3 actuator type. The strength density and sharpness values can be generated and stored within the reverb object. The flow proceeds to . At a boombox object is created by the reverb object. A boombox object is an instance of boombox module where the boombox object is configured to receive an audio data frame from the reverb object generate a maximum value of the audio data frame send the maximum value of the audio data frame to the reverb object send the audio data frame to IIR filter to be filtered generate a sine wave periodic carrier frequency and mix the generated sine wave periodic carrier frequency with the filtered audio data frame as previously described in relation to . In certain embodiments the strength and density values that are generated and stored within the reverb object can also be stored within the boombox object.

The flow proceeds to . At the reverb object sends an audio data frame of a PCM audio buffer that is received from an AudioTrack object to the boombox object. The flow proceeds to . At the boombox object samples data contained within the audio data frame. Such sampling is further described in greater detail in relation to . The flow proceeds to . At the boombox object translates the data contained within the audio data frame into a single voltage value i.e. a maximum value . Such translation is also further described in greater detail in relation to . The boombox object then returns the single voltage value to the reverb object.

The flow proceeds to . At the reverb object performs a thresholding task. More specifically the reverb object determines whether the maximum value of the audio data frame received from the boombox object is greater than a specified threshold. The maximum value returned is first linearly mapped to a force value which in one embodiment can vary between 0 and 10 000. For example the threshold may be specified as 1 000. In this example if the value of the force is greater than 1 000 then the audio data frame is written to an audio buffer to be subsequently sent to an actuator. If the value of the force is less than or equal to 1 000 then the audio data frame is dropped i.e. is not written to the audio buffer and is not subsequently sent to an actuator. Thus according to the embodiment not every audio data frame is necessarily played at the actuator. The flow proceeds to . At the reverb object reads the audio data frame from the audio buffer assuming that the audio data frame was not dropped at .

The flow proceeds to . At the reverb object sends the audio data frame that was stored within the audio data buffer to the boombox object. The flow proceeds to . At the boombox object resamples the audio data frame for example at 8 KHz mono audio. The boombox object subsequently sends the resampled audio data frame to the IIR filter . The flow proceeds to . At IIR filter low pass filters the received audio data frame for example at 500 Hz. In the example by low pass filtering the audio data frame IIR filter filters on a single frequency band of low frequency signals within the audio data frame e.g. 0 500 Hz . IIR filter subsequently returns the low pass filtered audio data frame to the boombox object. In alternate embodiments IIR filter is not a filter but a transformation module such as a DSP process a state machine or other type of programmatic logic . In these alternate embodiments the transformation module can transform the received audio data frame into a new audio data frame where the transformation is not necessary a filtering transformation.

The flow proceeds to . At the boombox object boosts the audio data signal contained within the filtered audio data frame. Boosting the audio data signal can involve multiplying all the PCM values of the audio data signal by a constant. The flow proceeds to . At the boombox object creates a sine carrier waveform also identified as a sine wave periodic carrier frequency or sine wave at a resonant frequency of an actuator or any other frequency desired and mixes the sine carrier waveform with the audio data signal contained within the filtered audio data frame. More specifically the boombox object scans the filtered audio data frame for its maximum value i.e. amplitude identified as A. Then the boombox object utilizes a sine function such as a C programming language sin function to retrieve a calculated sine value of the filtered audio data frame using the formula val sin 2 pi frequency phase where frequency is a frequency of the filtered audio data frame and phase is a phase of the filtered audio data frame. Subsequently the boombox object multiplies the calculated sine value i.e. val by the maximum value or amplitude of the filtered audio frame i.e. A . This calculation creates a full sine carrier waveform. The boombox object then calculates a mixed value where the mixed value represents a mix of the filtered audio data frame and the full sine carrier waveform. More specifically the boombox object calculates the mixed value according to the formula final mix bpSample 1 mix A val where final is a mixed value representing a mix of the filtered audio data frame and the full sine carrier waveform bpSample is the filtered audio data frame mix is a decimal value between 0 and 1 A is the maximum value or amplitude of the filtered audio frame and val is the calculated sine value of the full sine carrier waveform. Thus according to the embodiment the mix of the filtered audio data frame and the full sine carrier waveform is normalized by ensuring the mixed value representing a mix of the filtered audio data frame and the full sine carrier waveform i.e. final never exceeds 1. If instead the filtered audio data frame i.e. bpSample is merely added to a product of the maximum value or amplitude of the filtered audio frame i.e. A and the calculated sine value of the full sine carrier waveform i.e. val then the result yields an overpowering undesired and noisy haptic signal. This can be avoided by normalizing the mix of the filtered audio data frame and the full sine carrier waveform as described above. The boombox object then returns the mix of the filtered audio data frame and the full sine carrier waveform to the reverb object. In other embodiments multiple simultaneous carrier signals at different frequencies may be used to create a high bandwidth output signal. In these embodiments summation of individual carriers is performed using an extension of the algorithm presented here.

The flow proceeds to . At the reverb object plays a waveform effect at an actuator using the mix of the filtered audio data frame and the full sine carrier waveform. By playing the waveform effect at the actuator the reverb object causes the actuator to produce a haptic effect.

As previously described a haptic conversion module such as haptic conversion module of processes an audio signal contained within a PCM audio data buffer. As also previously described the processing of the audio signal includes sampling each audio data frame of a PCM audio data buffer calculating a maximum value for each audio data frame of a PCM audio data buffer and magnitude filtering. Such processing of the audio signal is now described in greater detail.

According to certain embodiments an envelope of the audio signal is first extracted. An envelope can be extracted using all frequencies of an original audio signal or a filtered version of the original audio signal. However the envelope itself does not have the same frequency content as the original audio signal.

In one embodiment an audio data frame is taken from the audio signal. As an example an audio data frame may have a frame length of 1 ms. As another example the audio data frame may have a frame length of 10 ms. A 1 ms audio data frame captures the envelope of frequencies above 500 Hz but lower frequencies are not captured and leak through. A 10 ms frame captures the envelope of frequencies above 50 Hz etc. In one embodiment an absolute value of each sample in the frame is computed. In an alternate embodiment a square of each sample in the frame is computed rather than an absolute value. Such processing constitutes the sampling of an audio data frame performed by a haptic conversion module such as haptic conversion module of .

A maximum value V of the absolute sample values or the square sample values in an alternate embodiment is computed. The maximum value V can then be converted using a linear conversion function as described below in relation to .

Thus according to the embodiment an envelope of an audio signal is mapped to an amplitude of a haptic signal where the amplitude of the haptic signal is filtered. In an alternate embodiment the envelope of the audio signal can first be filtered and then the filtered envelope of the audio signal can be mapped to an amplitude of a haptic signal.

Magnitude filtering performed by a haptic conversion module such as haptic conversion module of is now described in greater detail. A magnitude or strength V of a haptic effect is computed using the previous value V. In certain embodiments V can be mapped to a frequency. In other embodiments V can be mapped to a set of frequency values. If V of iteration i is smaller than V of iteration i 1 then the output V can be set to zero or some other small value or else the output remains unchanged V V . This specific technique can capture the peak values of the signal that represents a haptic event and automatically associate to that haptic event an independent haptic effect. This technique can also be used to let an actuator settle down before the next haptic event is played and thus avoiding saturating a user with too much haptic information. In an alternate embodiment smoother decay can be used rather than a sharp drop to 0 when V of iteration i is smaller than V of iteration i 1 . A sharpness parameter ranging from 0 to 100 can be used to define the amount of decay to be applied to V V V sharpness m where m is an integer divisor starting from 1 and increments as long as V of iteration i is smaller than V of iteration i 1 . According to the embodiment m is reset back to 1 when V of iteration i is greater or equal to V of iteration i 1 or in other words when V V . In certain embodiments a sharpness value that is generated and stored within a reverb object is used as the sharpness parameter.

Each frame of certain ms duration is processed in the frequency domain. Thus in certain embodiments a fast fourier transformation FFT of the frame can be used to extract the frequency content. In other embodiments band pass filters can be used to extract the frequency content.

In one embodiment the frame information can be divided in bass or low frequency for example lower than 200 Hz middle frequency for example between 240 Hz and 4000 Khz and high frequency for example higher than 4400 KHz where the middle frequency content and high frequency content is extracted using the content of the signal.

According to the embodiment when the signal starts to be processed the first frame contains more middle frequency content i.e. graph given the maximum value obtained which is bigger than a frequency value in the low frequency band i.e. graph and high frequency band i.e. graph .

According to the embodiment a haptic effect can be played when the content frequency of the frame is different from the frequency content of the previous frame. As illustrated in the haptic effect will be played at the locations signalized by arrows .

In alternate embodiments variations of this technique can include playing a pulse at every frequency change with magnitude as follows maximum magnitude of the unprocessed frame maximum magnitude corresponding to the frequency band maximum magnitude allowed in TouchSense software only for the first frame.

In certain alternate embodiments if the following frames have the same frequency content then the magnitude of the unprocessed frame can be played or the magnitude of the processed frame can be played or a constant vibration perhaps small can be played as long as the frame has the same frequency content or the magnitude can be varied based on power content in the frequency band.

In certain alternate embodiments a different haptic effect can be played when a frame with a different frequency content is found.

Furthermore human perception of sounds is not linear and depends on frequency of the sound. More particularly humans are more sensitive to low frequencies than to high frequencies. Gender and age also affect the perception. Thus in certain embodiments there could be a compensation factor that boosts certain frequencies. The boosting factor can be based on human perception of sound or even preference of users where some frequency bands are enhanced manually. The software can enhance in general the high frequency content where it is known that users have a lower sensitivity to sound. This will allow the haptic effect for a specific band to be of greater strength and thus enhancing the sound that while perceived and noticed by a user s auditive system might not have enough power.

In certain embodiments a user of the haptic conversion system can customize the sound to haptic effect conversion algorithm. More specifically the user can choose whether a digital audio signal is filtered using a low pass filter a high pass filter or a band pass filter. Alternatively or in addition to customizing a filter type the user can specify filter parameters rather than choosing between pre defined parameters. According to these embodiments a haptic conversion system can display one or more user defined parameters within a graphical user interface. The user can then either choose from one or more user defined parameters or specify one or more user defined parameters using the graphical user interface. For example a user can choose a type of filter utilized in the sound to haptic effect conversion algorithm from among a low pass filter a band pass filter and a high pass filter. As another example the user can specify one or more cut off frequencies where instead of a value between 250 and 500 Hz the user can specify any values. As yet another example the user can specify a gain that is used in the sound to haptic effect conversion algorithm.

In certain embodiments rather than utilizing pre defined filter parameters the haptic conversion system can calculate filter parameters at runtime based on user defined parameters. More specifically a user can select a filter type. For example a user can select a Butterworth design a Bessel design or a Chebyshev design where for each design a user can select a low pass filter a high pass filter a band pass filter or a band stop filter. If a user selects a Chebyshev design a user can also specify a ripple. A user can also specify a filter order and a sample rate. A user can also specify one corner frequency if the user selected a low pass filter or a high pass filter and two corner frequencies if the user selected a band pass filter or a band stop filter. A user can also select an optional additional zero value and an optional lower limit of a magnitude scale. Furthermore a user can also select whether the filter is designed by a bilinear transform method or a matched z transform method. The haptic conversion system can then calculate one or more filter parameters at runtime based on the parameters specified by the user.

At a maximum value of the data frame is generated. In certain embodiments the maximum value is generated by sampling the data frame to generate one or more sample values of the data frame wherein the maximum value is a maximum value of the one or more sample values. In one embodiment the one or more sample values are absolute values. In an alternate embodiment the one or more sample values are square values. In certain embodiments the maximum value is converted from an original maximum value using a linear conversion function. The flow proceeds to .

At the data frame is transformed. In certain embodiments the data frame is band pass filtered using a band pass filter. In these embodiments a single frequency band of frequency signals within the data frame is filtered on. In alternate embodiments the data frame is low passed filtered using an IIR filter. In these embodiments a single frequency band of frequency signals within the data frame can be filtered on. For example a band of 0 500 Hz can be filtered on. In certain embodiments before the data frame is transformed the data frame is resampled. In certain embodiments after the data frame is transformed the digital audio signal contained with the data frame is boosted. The flow proceeds to .

At at least one sine carrier waveform is generated based on a maximum value of the transformed data frame. In certain embodiments the transformed data frame is scanned and the maximum value of the transformed data frame is determined. Next a sine function is used to retrieve a calculated sine value of the transformed data frame based on a frequency of the transformed data frame and a phase of the transformed data frame. Subsequently the calculated sine value is multiplied by the maximum value of the transformed data frame in order to create the at least one sine carrier waveform.

At the transformed data frame is mixed with the at least one sine carrier waveform to generate a modulated data frame. In certain embodiments the transformed data frame is mixed with the at least one sine carrier waveform according to a formula where the mix of the transformed data frame and the at least one sine carrier waveform is normalized.

At a haptic signal is generated based on the maximum value and the modulated data frame. In certain embodiments the maximum value determines whether the haptic signal is generated and the modulated data frame defines a precision of the haptic signal. In certain embodiments where the maximum value determines whether the haptic signal is generated the haptic signal is generated only when the maximum value is greater than a specified threshold. The flow proceeds to .

At the haptic signal is sent through an actuator to generate the one or more haptic effects. In certain embodiments the haptic signal is a waveform effect. Also in certain embodiments the generating and the sending the haptic signal further includes passing the modulated data frame as a parameter to an application programming interface of a haptic effect player module.

Thus according to an embodiment a haptic conversion system intercepts audio data frames that are part of an audio signal converts the audio data frames into a haptic signal where a maximum value of each audio data frame defines a sine wave periodic carrier frequency that is mixed with each filtered audio data frame to define a waveform of the haptic signal and plays the converted haptic signal through an actuator to generate haptic effects. The modulation of each audio data frame performed by the haptic conversion system showcases a large amount of precision and realism felt within the actuator itself and results in more flexibility in the haptic signal that is played at the actuator.
