The present invention relates to an electroconductive roller for use as a charging roller and to an image forming apparatus employing the electroconductive roller.

In an electrophotographic image forming apparatus such as a laser printer an electrostatic copying machine a plain paper facsimile machine or a printer copier facsimile multifunction machine an image is generally formed on a surface of a sheet such as a paper sheet or a plastic film through the following process steps.

First a surface of a photoreceptor body having photoelectric conductivity is evenly electrically charged and in this state exposed to light whereby an electrostatic latent image corresponding to an image to be formed on the sheet is formed on the surface of the photoreceptor body charging step and exposing step .

Then toner minute color particles preliminarily electrically charged at a predetermined potential is brought into contact with the surface of the photoreceptor body. Thus the toner selectively adheres to the surface of the photoreceptor body according to the potential pattern of the electrostatic latent image whereby the electrostatic latent image is developed into a toner image developing step .

Subsequently the toner image is transferred onto the surface of the sheet transfer step and fixed to the surface of the sheet fixing step . Thus the image is formed on the surface of the sheet.

Further a part of the toner remaining on the surface of the photoreceptor body after the transfer of the toner image is removed for example by a cleaning blade or the like cleaning step . Thus the photoreceptor body is ready for the next image formation.

In the charging step out of the aforementioned process steps a charging roller is used which is kept in contact with the surface of the photoreceptor body to evenly electrically charge the surface of the photoreceptor body.

Widely used as the charging roller is an electroconductive roller having an outer peripheral surface to be kept in contact with the surface of the photoreceptor body at least the outer peripheral surface being made of a crosslinking product of an electrically conductive rubber composition and having lower resistance.

Generally usable as the rubber composition for the electroconductive roller is a rubber composition imparted with ion conductivity by blending a rubber component including at least an ion conductive rubber e.g. an epichlorohydrin rubber and a diene rubber a crosslinking component for crosslinking the rubber component and the like.

In order to further reduce the resistance of the electroconductive roller a slat of an anion containing a fluoro group and a sulfonyl group and a cation of a metal element or an ionic liquid is often blended in the rubber composition Patent Document land the like or electrically conductive carbon is blended in the rubber composition.

If the resistance of the overall electroconductive roller is reduced by blending the salt of the cation and the anion in the rubber composition however a great amount of the salt is required. This may result in cost increase of the electroconductive roller because the salt is expensive. In addition the reduction of the resistance by the blending of a great amount of the salt has limitation about 10 and further reduction of the resistance is difficult.

Where an electron conductive agent such as electrically conductive carbon is blended in the rubber composition the resistance of the electroconductive roller can be further reduced to less than the limitation. In this case however the voltage dependence of the roller resistance of the electroconductive roller is increased making it difficult to handle the electroconductive roller. Further the resistance of the electroconductive roller is steeply reduced by the addition of the electrically conductive carbon. Therefore it is difficult to control the resistance of the electroconductive roller to a desired level. In addition the electroconductive roller produced by blending the electrically conductive carbon has a higher hardness and when being used as the charging roller for example cannot easily follow the surface unevenness of the photoreceptor body failing to evenly electrically charge the photoreceptor body. This may result in uneven charging.

Patent Document 2 proposes that a surface layer containing graphite or carbon dispersion is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the electroconductive roller in order to stably electrically charge the photo receptor body for prevention of fogging of a formed image. However it is difficult to further reduce the resistance of the electroconductive roller with the provision of the surface layer of the conventional structure.

It is an object of the present invention to provide an electroconductive roller which is imparted with lower resistance than the prior art electroconductive roller without the addition of the expensive salt and the electron conductive agent liable to cause various problems or by adding the electron conductive agent in a smaller proportion that hardly causes the aforementioned problems and to provide an image forming apparatus employing the electroconductive roller.

The present invention provides an electroconductive roller which includes a tubular base layer made of an ion conductive elastic material and a surface layer provided on an outer peripheral surface of the base layer wherein the roller resistance R of the base layer and the surface resistance R of an outer peripheral surface of the surface layer satisfy all the following expressions 1 to 3 log log 2.5 1 log 7.0 2 log 4.0 3 

The present invention also provides an image forming apparatus which incorporates the inventive electroconductive roller as a charging roller.

According to the present invention the electroconductive roller is configured such that the surface layer is provided on the outer peripheral surface of the flexible base layer and the resistances of the base layer and the surface layer satisfy all the above expressions 1 to 3 . Thus the electroconductive roller is imparted with lower resistance than the prior art electroconductive roller without the addition of the expensive salt and the electron conductive agent liable to cause various problems or by adding the electron conductive agent in a smaller proportion that hardly causes the aforementioned problems. The image forming apparatus employing the electroconductive roller is also provided.

Referring to an electroconductive roller according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a tubular base layer made of an ion conductive elastic material and having a center through hole a surface layer provided on an outer peripheral surface of the base layer and a shaft inserted through and fixed to the through hole .

The shaft is a unitary member made of a metal such as aluminum an aluminum alloy or a stainless steel.

The shaft is electrically connected to and mechanically fixed to the base layer for example via an electrically conductive adhesive agent. Alternatively a shaft having an outer diameter that is greater than the inner diameter of the through hole is used as the shaft and press inserted into the through hole to be electrically connected to and mechanically fixed to the base layer . Thus the shaft and the base layer are unitarily rotatable.

In the present invention the roller resistance R of the base layer and the surface resistance R of an outer peripheral surface of the surface layer should satisfy all the following expressions 1 to 3 log log 2.5 1 log 7.0 2 log 4.0 3 

In general the electrical resistance is proportional to the volume resistivity and the length of a path along which electric current flows and inversely proportional to the sectional area of the path.

In the case of an ordinary electroconductive roller having no surface layer as shown in for use as a charging roller for example the path of the electric current flowing through the electroconductive roller is the shortest linear region indicated by a broken line in through which a contact with the photoreceptor body is connected to a shaft inserted through the electroconductive roller as seen in the section of the electroconductive roller and hence has a very small sectional area. Therefore the reduction of the resistance has limitation even if an attempt is made to reduce the volume resistivity by adjusting the composition of the material for the electroconductive roller.

In the inventive electroconductive roller configured such that the surface layer is provided on the outer peripheral surface of the flexible base layer as shown in and the resistances of the surface layer and the base layer satisfy all the above expressions 1 to 3 on the other hand the surface layer serves as an electrical conductor directly connected to the contact with the photoreceptor body . Therefore as shown by broken lines in the entire circumferential base layer functions as the electric current path extending to the shaft and hence the path has a significantly increased sectional area.

Therefore the volume resistivity of the base layer is significantly reduced to a lower level than the prior art without the addition of the expensive salt and the electron conductive agent liable to cause various problems in the absence of the salt and the electron conductive agent or by adding the electron conductive agent in a smaller proportion that hardly causes the aforementioned problems. Thus the resistance of the electroconductive roller can be further reduced to a lower level than the prior art.

More specifically the roller resistance R of the overall electroconductive roller including the base layer and the surface layer provided on the base layer can satisfy the following expression 4 log 4.7 4 That is the roller resistance of the electroconductive roller can be reduced to a level of not higher than 10 that is unachievable by the prior art.

The roller resistance R can be controlled at any intended level principally by properly selecting an ion conductive elastic material for the base layer . Even if the electron conductive agent is blended in a material for the surface layer in order to satisfy all the expressions 1 to 3 therefore it is possible to easily control the roller resistance R while reducing the voltage dependence of the roller resistance.

In addition the surface layer can be formed as having a significantly smaller thickness than the base layer . Where the electroconductive roller is used as the charging roller therefore the electroconductive roller can follow the surface unevenness of the photoreceptor body to evenly electrically charge the photoreceptor body . Thus the uneven charging can be suppressed.

In the present invention the resistances of the base layer and the surface layer should satisfy all the expressions 1 to 3 for the following reasons. If at least one of the expressions is not satisfied the roller resistance R of the overall electroconductive roller cannot be sufficiently reduced due to the mechanism described above.

The difference log R log Rdefined by the expression 1 is preferably not greater than 5.5 in the aforementioned range.

In order to increase the difference log R log Rto greater than 5.5 it is necessary to increase the roller resistance R of the base layer or to reduce the surface resistance R of the outer peripheral surface of the surface layer .

In the former case however the roller resistance R of the base layer is liable to fall outside the range of log R 7.0 defined by the expression 2 making it impossible to reduce the roller resistance R of the overall electroconductive roller .

Even if the electron conductive agent such as the electrically conductive carbon is blended the reduction of the surface resistance R of the outer peripheral surface of the surface layer has limitation making it substantially difficult to reduce the surface resistance R as in the latter case to increase the difference log R log Rto greater than 5.5.

If log Ris less than this range it is necessary to reduce the surface resistance R of the outer peripheral surface of the surface layer in order to maintain the resistance difference log R log Rat not less than 2.5. However the reduction of the surface resistance R has limitation as described above making it substantially difficult to reduce log Rto less than 5.5 while maintaining the difference log R log Rat not less than 2.5.

In order to further reduce the roller resistance R of the overall electroconductive roller log Ris particularly preferably log R 6.0 in the aforementioned range of log R 7.0.

The surface resistance R of the outer peripheral surface of the surface layer defined by the expression 3 is preferably 1.0 log R 4.0.

The base layer of the inventive electroconductive roller may be made of any of various ion conductive elastic materials.

Particularly the base layer is preferably formed from an ion conductive rubber composition which contains a rubber component including an epichlorohydrin rubber and a diene rubber.

Examples of the epichlorohydrin rubber for the rubber component include epichlorohydrin homopolymers epichlorohydrin ethylene oxide bipolymers ECO epichlorohydrin propylene oxide bipolymers epichlorohydrin allyl glycidyl ether bipolymers epichlorohydrin ethylene oxide allyl glycidyl ether terpolymers GECO epichlorohydrin propylene oxide allyl glycidyl ether terpolymers and epichlorohydrin ethylene oxide propylene oxide allyl glycidyl ether quaterpolymers which may be used either alone or in combination.

Of these epichlorohydrin rubbers the ethylene oxide containing copolymers particularly the ECO and or the GECO are preferred.

These copolymers preferably each have an ethylene oxide content of not less than 30 mol and not greater than 80 mol particularly preferably not less than 50 mol .

If the ethylene oxide content is less than the aforementioned range however it will be impossible to sufficiently reduce the roller resistance R .

If the ethylene oxide content is greater than the aforementioned range on the other hand ethylene oxide is liable to be crystallized whereby the segment motion of molecular chains is hindered to adversely increase the roller resistance R . Further the base layer is liable to have a higher hardness after the crosslinking and the rubber composition is liable to have a higher viscosity when being heat melted before the crosslinking.

The ECO has an epichlorohydrin content that is a balance obtained by subtracting the ethylene oxide content from the total. That is the epichlorohydrin content is preferably not less than 20 mol and not greater than 70 mol particularly preferably not greater than 50 mol .

The GECO preferably has an allyl glycidyl ether content of not less than 0.5 mol and not greater than 10 mol particularly preferably not less than 2 mol and not greater than 5 mol .

Allyl glycidyl ether per se functions as side chains of the copolymer to provide a free volume whereby the crystallization of ethylene oxide is suppressed to reduce the roller resistance R of the base layer .

However if the allyl glycidyl ether content is less than the aforementioned range it will be impossible to provide this function and hence to sufficiently reduce the roller resistance R .

Allyl glycidyl ether also functions as crosslinking sites during the crosslinking of the GECO. Therefore if the allyl glycidyl ether content is greater than the aforementioned range the crosslinking density of the GECO is increased whereby the segment motion of molecular chains is hindered. This may adversely increase the roller resistance R .

The GECO has an epichlorohydrin content that is a balance obtained by subtracting the ethylene oxide content and the allyl glycidyl ether content from the total. That is the epichlorohydrin content is preferably not less than 10 mol and not greater than 69.5 mol particularly preferably not less than 19.5 mol and not greater than 60 mol .

Examples of the GECO include copolymers of the three comonomers described above in a narrow sense as well as known modification products obtained by modifying an epichlorohydrin ethylene oxide copolymer ECO with allyl glycidyl ether. In the present invention any of these modification products may be used as the GECO.

The proportion of the epichlorohydrin rubber to be blended is preferably not less than 10 parts by mass and not greater than 80 parts by mass particularly preferably not greater than 70 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the overall rubber component.

The diene rubber is at least one selected from the group consisting of a styrene butadiene rubber SBR a chloroprene rubber CR an acrylonitrile butadiene rubber NBR and a butadiene rubber BR for example.

Usable as the SBR are various SBRs synthesized by copolymerizing styrene and 1 3 butadiene by an emulsion polymerization method a solution polymerization method and other various polymerization methods. The SBRs include those of an oil extension type having flexibility controlled by addition of an extension oil and those of a non oil extension type containing no extension oil. Either type of SBRs is usable.

According to the styrene content the SBRs are classified into a higher styrene content type an intermediate styrene content type and a lower styrene content type and any of these types of SBRs is usable.

The CR is synthesized for example by polymerizing chloroprene by an emulsion polymerization method. The CR is classified in a sulfur modification type or a non sulfur modification type depending on the type of a molecular weight adjusting agent to be used for the emulsion polymerization. Either type of CRs is usable in the present invention.

The sulfur modification type CR is prepared by plasticizing a copolymer of chloroprene and sulfur molecular weight adjusting agent with thiuram disulfide or the like to adjust the viscosity of the copolymer to a predetermined viscosity level.

The non sulfur modification type CR is classified for example in a mercaptan modification type a xanthogen modification type or the like.

The mercaptan modification type CR is synthesized in substantially the same manner as the sulfur modification type CR except that an alkyl mercaptan such as n dodecyl mercaptan tert dodecyl mercaptan or octyl mercaptan for example is used as the molecular weight adjusting agent. The xanthogen modification type CR is synthesized in substantially the same manner as the sulfur modification type CR except that an alkyl xanthogen compound is used as the molecular weight adjusting agent.

Further the CR is classified in a lower crystallization speed type an intermediate crystallization speed type or a higher crystallization speed type depending on the crystallization speed.

In the present invention any of these types of CRs may be used. Particularly CRs of the non sulfur modification type and the lower crystallization speed type are preferably used either alone or in combination.

Examples of the other comonomer include 2 3 dichloro 1 3 butadiene 1 chloro 1 3 butadiene styrene acrylonitrile methacrylonitrile isoprene butadiene acrylic acid acrylates methacrylic acid and methacrylates which may be used either alone or in combination.

The NBR is classified in a lower acrylonitrile content type an intermediate acrylonitrile content type an intermediate to higher acrylonitrile content type a higher acrylonitrile content type or a very high acrylonitrile content type depending on the acrylonitrile content. Any of these types of NBRs is usable.

The NBRs include those of an oil extension type having flexibility controlled by addition of an extension oil and those of a non oil extension type containing no extension oil. Either type of NBRs is usable.

Particularly a higher cis content BR having a cis 1 4 bond content of not less than 95 and having excellent lower temperature characteristic properties and a lower hardness and hence a higher flexibility at a lower temperature at a lower humidity is preferred.

The BRs include those of an oil extension type having flexibility controlled by addition of an extension oil and those of a non oil extension type containing no extension oil. Either type of BRs is usable.

The rubber composition further contains a crosslinking component for crosslinking the rubber component. The crosslinking component includes a crosslinking agent an accelerating agent an acceleration assisting agent and the like.

Examples of the crosslinking agent include a sulfur crosslinking agent a thiourea crosslinking agent a triazine derivative crosslinking agent a peroxide crosslinking agent and monomers which may be used either alone or in combination.

Examples of the sulfur crosslinking agent include sulfur such as sulfur powder and organic sulfur containing compounds. Examples of the organic sulfur containing compounds include tetramethylthiuram disulfide and N N dithiobismorpholine.

Examples of the thiourea crosslinking agent include tetramethylthiourea trimethylthiourea ethylene thiourea and thioureas represented by CHNH C S wherein n is an integer of 1 to 10 which may be used either alone or in combination.

The sulfur and the thiourea crosslinking agent are preferably used in combination as the crosslinking agent.

The proportion of the sulfur to be used in combination with the thiourea crosslinking agent is preferably not less than 0.2 parts by mass and not greater than 3 parts by mass particularly preferably not less than 0.5 parts by mass and not greater than 2 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the overall rubber component.

The proportion of the thiourea crosslinking agent to be blended is preferably not less than 0.2 parts by mass and not greater than 3 parts by mass particularly preferably not less than 0.5 parts by mass and not greater than 1 part by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the overall rubber component.

Examples of the accelerating agent include inorganic accelerating agents such as lime magnesia MgO and litharge PbO and organic accelerating agents which may be used either alone or in combination.

Examples of the organic accelerating agents include guanidine accelerating agents such as 1 3 di o tolylguanidine 1 3 diphenylguanidine 1 o tolylbiguanide and a di o tolylguanidine salt of dicatechol borate thiazole accelerating agents such as 2 mercaptobenzothiazole and di 2 benzothiazolyl disulfide sulfenamide accelerating agents such as N cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazylsulfenamide thiuram accelerating agents such as tetramethylthiuram monosulfide tetramethylthiuram disulfide tetraethylthiuram disulfide and dipentamethylenethiuram tetrasulfide and thiourea accelerating agents which may be used either alone or in combination.

Different types of accelerating agents have different functions and therefore are preferably used in combination.

The proportion of the accelerating agent to be blended may be properly determined depending on the type of the accelerating agent but is preferably not less than 0.1 part by mass and not greater than 5 parts by mass particularly preferably not less than 0.2 parts by mass and not greater than 2 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the overall rubber component.

Examples of the acceleration assisting agent include metal compounds such as zinc white fatty acids such as stearic acid oleic acid and cotton seed fatty acids and other conventionally known acceleration assisting agents which may be used either alone or in combination.

The proportion of the acceleration assisting agent to be blended is preferably not less than 0.1 part by mass and not greater than 7 parts by mass particularly preferably not less than 0.5 parts by mass and not greater than 5 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the overall rubber component.

As required various additives may be added to the rubber composition. Examples of the additives include an acid accepting agent a plasticizing agent a processing aid a degradation preventing agent a filler an anti scorching agent a lubricant a pigment an anti static agent a flame retarder a neutralizing agent a nucleating agent a co crosslinking agent and the like.

In the presence of the acid accepting agent chlorine containing gases generated from the epichlorohydrin rubber and the CR during the crosslinking of the rubber component are prevented from remaining in the base layer . Thus the acid accepting agent functions to prevent the inhibition of the crosslinking and the contamination of the photoreceptor body which may otherwise be caused by the chlorine containing gases.

Any of various substances serving as acid acceptors may be used as the acid accepting agent. Preferred examples of the acid accepting agent include hydrotalcites and Magsarat which are excellent in dispersibility. Particularly the hydrotalcites are preferred.

Where the hydrotalcites are used in combination with magnesium oxide or potassium oxide a higher acid accepting effect can be provided thereby more reliably preventing the contamination of the photo receptor body.

The proportion of the acid accepting agent to be blended is preferably not less than 0.5 parts by mass and not greater than 6 parts by mass particularly preferably not less than 1 part by mass and not greater than 4 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the overall rubber component.

Examples of the plasticizing agent include plasticizers such as dibutyl phthalate DBP dioctyl phthalate DOP and tricresyl phosphate and waxes such as polar waxes. Examples of the processing aid include fatty acids such as stearic acid.

The proportion of the plasticizing agent and or the processing aid to be blended is preferably not greater than 5 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the overall rubber component. This prevents the contamination of the photoreceptor body for example when the electroconductive roller is mounted in the image forming apparatus or when the image forming apparatus is operated. For this purpose it is particularly preferred to use any of the polar waxes out of the plasticizing agents.

The anti oxidants serve to reduce the environmental dependence of the roller resistance of the electroconductive roller and to suppress the increase in roller resistance during continuous energization of the electroconductive roller. Examples of the anti oxidants include nickel diethyldithiocarbamate NOCRAC registered trade name NEC P available from Ouchi Shinko Chemical Industrial Co. Ltd. and nickel dibutyldithiocarbamate NOCRAC NBC available from Ouchi Shinko Chemical Industrial Co. Ltd. 

Examples of the filler include zinc oxide silica carbon carbon black clay talc calcium carbonate magnesium carbonate and aluminum hydroxide which may be used either alone or in combination.

The proportion of the filler to be blended is preferably not less than 5 parts by mass and not greater than 25 parts by mass particularly preferably not greater than 20 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the overall rubber component.

An electron conductive agent electrically conductive filler such as electrically conductive carbon black may be blended as the filler to impart the base layer with electron conductivity.

Preferred examples of the electrically conductive carbon black include DENKA BLACK registered trade name available from Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K. and KETJEN BLACK registered trade name EC300J available from Lion Corporation which may be used either alone or in combination.

The proportion of the electrically conductive carbon black to be blended is preferably not less than 1 part by mass and not greater than 10 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the overall rubber component.

Examples of the anti scorching agent include N cyclohexylthiophthalimide phthalic anhydride N nitrosodiphenylamine and 2 4 diphenyl 4 methyl 1 pentene which may be used either alone or in combination. Particularly N cyclohexylthiophthalimide is preferred.

The proportion of the anti scorching agent to be blended is preferably not less than 0.1 part by mass and not greater than 5 parts by mass particularly preferably not greater than 1 part by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the overall rubber component.

The co crosslinking agent serves to crosslink itself as well as the rubber component to increase the overall molecular weight.

Examples of the co crosslinking agent include ethylenically unsaturated monomers typified by methacrylic esters metal salts of methacrylic acid and acrylic acid polyfunctional polymers utilizing functional groups of 1 2 polybutadienes and dioximes which may be used either alone or in combination.

alkyl meth acrylates such as methyl meth acrylate ethyl meth acrylate n propyl meth acrylate i propyl meth acrylate n butyl meth acrylate i butyl meth acrylate n pentyl meth acrylate i pentyl meth acrylate n hexyl meth acrylate cyclohexyl meth acrylate 2 ethylhexyl meth acrylate octyl meth acrylate i nonyl meth acrylate tert butylcyclohexyl meth acrylate decyl meth acrylate dodecyl meth acrylate hydroxymethyl meth acrylate and hydroxyethyl meth acrylate

polyfunctional meth acrylates such as ethylene glycol di meth acrylate trimethylolpropane tri meth acrylate ethylene dimethacrylate EDMA polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate and isobutylene ethylene dimethacrylate. These monocarboxylic acid esters may be used either alone or in combination.

The rubber composition containing the ingredients described above can be prepared in a conventional manner. First the rubbers for the rubber component are blended in the predetermined proportions and the resulting rubber component is simply kneaded. After additives other than the crosslinking component are added to and kneaded with the rubber component the crosslinking component is finally added to and further kneaded with the resulting mixture. Thus the rubber composition is provided. A kneader a Banbury mixer an extruder or the like for example is usable for the kneading.

The base layer is formed by first extruding the aforementioned rubber composition into a tubular body by means of an extruder then cutting the tubular body to a predetermined length and crosslinking the resulting tubular body in a vulcanization can by pressure and heat.

In turn the crosslinked tubular body is heated in an oven or the like for secondary crosslinking then cooled and polished to a predetermined outer diameter. Thus the base layer is formed.

The roller resistance R of the base layer is controlled to fall within the range defined by the expression 2 by variably setting the type and the proportion of the ion conductive rubber such as the epichlorohydrin rubber described above or when the electrically conductive carbon black is blended in the rubber composition by variably setting the type and the proportion of the electrically conductive carbon black.

The base layer may be controlled to have a desired hardness and a desired compressive permanent set. The hardness and the compressive permanent set of the base layer may be controlled for example by controlling the type and the amount of the rubber component the type and the amount of the crosslinking component and the types and the amounts of the filler and other ingredients.

The thickness of the base layer may be properly determined depending on the construction and the size of an image forming apparatus in which the electroconductive roller is to be incorporated.

The base layer is preferably formed as having a nonporous single layer structure for simplification of the structure and improvement of the durability.

The surface layer is formed from a material prepared for example by blending an electrically conductive agent in a binder resin in order to satisfy the aforementioned expressions 1 to 3 defined with respect to the base layer made of the ion conductive elastic material.

An electron conductive agent such as carbon or graphite is preferably used as the electrically conductive agent. Particularly carbon having an iodine adsorption amount of not less than 80 mg g and an oil adsorption amount of not less than 60 ml 100 g is preferred.

The iodine adsorption amount and the oil adsorption amount of the carbon are limited to the aforementioned ranges for the following reasons 

If the carbon has an iodine adsorption amount of less than 80 mg g it will be impossible to impart the surface layer with a higher electrical conductivity satisfying the surface resistance R defined by the expression 3 . If a greater amount of the carbon is blended in the binder resin to impart the surface layer with a higher electrical conductivity the surface layer is liable to have a higher hardness or have a reduced film strength.

If the carbon has an oil adsorption amount of less than 60 ml g it will be impossible to impart the surface layer with a higher electrical conductivity satisfying the surface resistance R defined by the expression 3 . If a greater amount of the carbon is blended in the binder resin to impart the surface layer with a higher electrical conductivity the surface layer is liable to have a higher hardness or have a reduced film strength.

The proportion of the carbon or the graphite to be blended is preferably not less than 60 mass based on the mass of solids in the surface layer .

If the proportion of the carbon or the graphite is less than the aforementioned range it will be impossible to impart the surface layer with a higher electrical conductivity satisfying the surface resistance R defined by the aforementioned expressions 1 to 3 particularly by the expression 3 .

If the proportion of the carbon or the graphite is excessively great the surface layer is liable to have a reduced film strength. Therefore the proportion of the carbon or the graphite to be blended is preferably not greater than 70 mass based on the mass of the solids in the aforementioned range.

The binder resin to be used in combination with the carbon or the graphite for the formation of the surface layer may be any of various binder resins which permits proper dispersion of the carbon or the graphite and proper adhesion to the outer peripheral surface of the base layer formed from the rubber composition described above.

The surface layer is formed by dissolving or dispersing the electrically conductive agent such as the carbon or the graphite and the binder resin in a given solvent to prepare a coating material applying the coating material on the outer peripheral surface of the base layer by a given coating method such as a spraying method drying the resulting coating film and where the binder resin is curable curing the coating film.

The coating material preferably has a viscosity of not higher than 1.0 Pa s at 23 C. . If the viscosity is higher than this range it will be difficult to form a surface layer having a uniform thickness on the outer peripheral surface of the base layer .

The surface layer preferably has a thickness of not less than 1 m in order to function as the conductor as described above to reduce the resistance of the overall electroconductive roller .

If the thickness is excessively great the surface layer is liable to have a higher hardness to reduce the flexibility of the overall electroconductive roller or liable to be separated from the base layer . The thickness of the surface layer is preferably not greater than 100 m in the aforementioned range.

In order to control the surface resistance R of the outer peripheral surface of the surface layer in the range defined by the expression 3 the proportion of the carbon or the graphite based on the amount of the solids in the surface layer may be properly adjusted or the type of the carbon or the graphite to be blended or the type of the binder resin may be properly selected.

Referring to the roller resistance R of the base layer and the roller resistance R of the overall electroconductive roller are measured in an ordinary temperature and ordinary humidity environment at a temperature of 23 C. at a relative humidity of 55 with an application voltage of 100 V by the following method in the present invention.

More specifically an aluminum drum rotatable at a constant rotation speed is prepared and the outer peripheral surface of the base layer or the outer peripheral surface of the electroconductive roller is brought into contact with an outer peripheral surface of the aluminum drum from above with the shaft preliminarily inserted through and fixed to the base layer .

A DC power source and a resistor are connected in series between the shaft and the aluminum drum to provide a measurement circuit . The DC power source is connected to the shaft at its negative terminal and connected to the resistor at its positive terminal. The resistor has a resistance r of 100 .

The rubber composition thus prepared was fed into an extruder and extruded into a tubular body having an outer diameter of 20.0 mm and an inner diameter of 7.0 mm. Then the tubular body was fitted around a temporary crosslinking shaft and crosslinked in a vulcanization can at 160 C. for 1 hour.

Subsequently the crosslinked tubular body was removed from the temporary shaft then fitted around a shaft having an outer diameter of 7.5 mm and an outer peripheral surface to which an electrically conductive thermosetting adhesive agent was applied and heated in an oven at 160 C.

Electroconductive rollers of Examples 1 to 6 and Comparative Examples 1 to 6 were produced by employing the base layers I to IV in combination with the surface layers i to iv as shown in Tables 2 and 3.

The roller resistance R of each of the overall electroconductive rollers thus produced was measured with an application voltage of 100 V by the aforementioned measuring method.

Further the roller resistance R of each of the overall electroconductive rollers was measured with an application voltage of 10 V by the aforementioned measuring method. Then a difference was calculated from the following expression 5 log log 5 Based on the difference the electroconductive rollers were each evaluated for the voltage dependence of the roller resistance. A smaller difference Rindicates that the voltage dependence is smaller and the roller resistance of the electroconductive roller is more stable.

Further a difference log R log Rwas calculated based on the roller resistance R of the base layer and the surface resistance R of the surface layer employed in combination with the base layer. Based on the roller resistance R of the base layer and the roller resistance R of the overall electroconductive roller a change in roller resistance due to the provision of the surface layer was calculated from the following expression 6 log log 6 A positive value of the change indicates that the roller resistance was reduced and a negative value of the change indicates that the roller resistance was increased.

The results for Examples 1 to 6 and Comparative Examples 1 to 6 in Tables 2 and 3 indicate that where the roller resistance R of the base layer is log R 7.0 and the surface resistance R of the outer peripheral surface of the surface layer is log R 4.0 and the difference between these resistances is log R log R 2.5 the roller resistance R of the overall electroconductive roller can be reduced to log R 4.7 and the voltage dependence of the roller resistance can be reduced by the layered structure to stabilize the roller resistance of the electroconductive roller.

The results for Examples 1 to 6 in Table 2 indicate that the roller resistance R of the base layer is preferably 5.5 log R 6.0.

Further the results for Examples 1 to 6 indicate that the surface resistance R of the outer peripheral surface of the surface layer is preferably 1.0 log R.

The potential distributions of the electroconductive rollers of Example 4 and Comparative Example 4 were each determined through simulation in which a 100 V electrode was kept in contact with the outer peripheral surface at a single point and the shaft was kept at 0 V. The results for Example 4 and Comparative Example 4 are shown in respectively.

In contrast indicates that in the electroconductive roller of Example 4 configured such that the surface layer is provided on the outer peripheral surface of the base layer and the resistances of the surface layer and the base layer satisfy all the expressions 1 to 3 according to the present invention the entire surface layer functions as the circumferential electric current path connected to the shaft and hence the electric current path has a significantly increased sectional area.
