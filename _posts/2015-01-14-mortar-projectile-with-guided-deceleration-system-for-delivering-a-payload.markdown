The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention generally relates to the field of munitions such as tube launched projectiles. Particularly the present invention relates to a mortar projectile having a guided deceleration system such as a parafoil for delivering a payload to a remotely located target location.

Conventional artillery systems with guided parafoils include for example the miniature parafoil Mosquito system developed by Stara Technologies and the miniature guided parafoil Snowflake system developed by the Naval Postgraduate School and the University of Alabama at Huntsville. In addition the precision airdrop JPADS system described in Robert Wright et al. Precision Airdrop System 18th AIAA Aerodynamic Decelerator Systems Technology Conference and Seminar AIAA 2005 1644 pages 1 14 2005 can be used for aerial replenishment of large payloads beyond the scope of what would fit into a mortar or artillery projectile.

These conventional systems are GPS guided. Of these systems only the Mosquito and Snowflake systems fit into a mortar or an artillery projectile. However the Snowflake and JPADS systems are not designed for high G launch survivability. The Mosquito system is designed to be launched from a countermeasure type environment which is significantly softer than the setback experienced during a high charge mortar launch.

Furthermore another conventional means of rapid resupply is a helicopter airdrop. During this resupply the drop site has to be set up and guarded during the delivery. This places the soldiers and assets in a vulnerable situation that is neither quick nor stealthy. The use of the helicopter could also be relatively expensive.

In terms of accuracy of the actual location of delivery the variance increases with the increasing range of the projectiles. Factors that contribute to the increased variance are winds aloft meteorological data propellant temperature variations and marginal errors in gun elevations. Winds aloft present one form of disturbance in that crosswinds can send a projectile left or right relative to the intended target and head and tail winds can propel the projectile too far or too short of the intended target.

There is therefore a still unsatisfied need for a mortar projectile having a guided deceleration system such as a parafoil for accurately delivering a payload to a remotely located target location without interference of terrain or enemy action.

The present invention addresses the concerns of the conventional delivery systems and presents a new tube launched or mortar projectile for use to resupply various payloads to distant troops. The mortar projectile has the capability of rapidly and accurately transporting the payloads to forward disposed combatants without interference of terrain or enemy action.

The mortar projectile includes a shell body for housing the payload to be delivered. As used herein a payload includes but is not limited to logistic supplies medical supplies ammunition such as bullets and grenades and other supplies that might be needed by the distant troops. Additionally the payload could be data gathering equipment such as meteorological surveillance. Alternatively the invention could be weaponized.

To this end the present invention includes a novel mortar shaped projectile for deploying an autonomous GPS guided parafoil while in flight. Once deployed a guided decelerator system or aerial delivery system ADS will navigate to a downrange target via GPS guided parafoil and softly land a payload of replenishment ammunition or consumables to a stranded warfighter.

The mortar projectile is designed to withstand the loading associated with a mortar artillery tube launch as well as an expulsion event. Additionally the payload of ammunition is properly supported during the launch event so as to enhance the survivability of the ammunition. In order to adapt the present mortar projectile to a high G launch riser actuators and motors have to be specifically designed a ruggedized battery has to be implemented and the guidance electronics need to be hardened.

More specifically the tube launched or mortar projectile generally includes a payload deployment section and a tail section that is secured to the payload deployment section. The payload deployment section separates or is expelled from the tail section during the flight. The descent of the separated payload deployment section is guided toward the distant target by means of a guided decelerator system that includes a steerable parafoil. The final delivery pattern is an elongated ellipse with the major axis in the direction of flight of the parafoil.

The shell body forms part of the payload deployment section and houses the payload It is made from a rigid light weight material that is less dense than steel.

Although payload is described herein as including bullets or cartridges it should be understood that the payload is not limited to these munitions. In general the payload could include ammunition equipment for data gathering meteorological data measurement surveillance weaponized sub munition or any other suitable items that are amenable to be stored within the mortar projectile.

The payload deployment section further includes a deployment mechanism that is housed within the tail section and a guided deceleration container that houses the steerable parafoil. The payload deployment section further includes a guidance decelerator system comprised of guidance electronics a power supply at least one servo motor and a parafoil steering mechanism.

The payload deployment section also includes a payload container that houses the payload. The payload can range from a single cartridge to a plurality of various items. In a preferred embodiment the payload includes an ammunition that is stored in the payload container and that is oriented rearwardly toward the tail section.

The payload container is fitted with a packaging assembly for securely supporting the payload. The packaging assembly includes a plurality of preformed chambers that are geometrically shaped to snuggly receive support and conform to the shape of the payload.

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

With reference to the present invention provides a new mortar projectile for use to deliver various payloads to targeted distant troops . More specifically the mortar projectile has the capability of rapidly and accurately transporting the payloads to forward disposed combatants without interference of terrain or enemy action.

To this end the mortar projectile generally includes a payload deployment section or forward section and a tail section or aft section . These two sections separate during flight so that only the payload deployment section is guided to the target .

The tail section is generally comprised of a known or available fin and boom assembly and a deployment housing that are secured together so that the tail section becomes an integral component. The deployment housing is hollow and has a generally conical shape so that at its narrower end it includes a spacer shim that fits into a receptacle of the fin and boom section assembly .

The deployment housing includes an inner deployment chamber . When the tail section is assembled with the payload deployment section the deployment housing receives a deployment mechanism of the payload deployment section and a screw secures the deployment housing to the deployment mechanism .

The fin and boom assembly is either frangible and or uses a decelerator such as a drogue chute to slow its descent upon deployment of the payload deployment section so as not to cause collateral damage. The trailing edges of the fins exhibit a bevel or cant angle that is sufficiently low e.g. between about 1 and about 5 in order to induce a very slow roll e.g. a fraction of a Hertz for dampening part of the asymmetric flight loads due to aerodynamics or physical balance.

The payload deployment section generally includes in addition to the deployment mechanism a guided deceleration container or housing a payload container and a reusable nose section . The deployment mechanism generally includes an ejection plunger a pusher plate and the drogue chute .

The guided deceleration container is hollow and open ended at both ends. As better illustrated in the guided deceleration container includes a generally conically shaped rearward section that fits inside the deployment chamber of the deployment housing . The rearward section extends forwardly into a generally cylindrically shaped forward section . When the mortar projectile is assembled part of the forward section fits within the deployment chamber with the remaining structure fitting within a shell body of the reusable nose section as also illustrated in .

The shell body and the deployment housing are preferably made of a material that enables the fabrication of a light weight yet sturdy structure i.e. less dense than steel so that the mortar projectile is able to survive the high G launch. The shell body is readily accessible to allow rapid loading of different consumables or payloads .

As also illustrated in the guided deceleration container defines an internal parafoil chamber . In preparation for deployment a means for decelerating the payload deployment section toward the target is stowed within the parafoil chamber . In a preferred embodiment the deceleration means is a GPS guided parafoil which allows more guidance control over the descent flight path of the payload deployment section . In a simpler embodiment the deceleration means could be for example a parachute.

The payload deployment section further includes a payload container that carries and provides safe support to the payload . As it will be further described in connection with the payload container is generally cylindrically shaped and fits tightly and securely within the shell body . As also illustrated in the payload deployment section defines an internal payload chamber within which the payload is housed.

In addition the payload deployment section includes a guided decelerator system reference is also made to which is positioned within the shell body . The guided decelerator system is intended to be located in the forward section of the light weight projectile body. The projectile body is comprised of the shell body the deployment housing and the tail section .

The forward section includes a known or available impact absorbing tip that deforms upon impact with the target so that it absorbs the shock energy and prevents it from propagating to the guided decelerator system . As a result the electronic components contained within the forward section can be reused.

The guided decelerator system generally includes a guidance and navigation system which is located in the nose section the payload chamber that houses the payload container the parafoil a riser mechanism that includes a plurality of parafoil risers some of which are use for control and others for support a deployment charge and the ejection plunger .

In use and with further reference to a request for resupply of ammunition or other expendables is received by a forward operating base FOB . The payload container of the payload deployment section being readily accessible for loading the requested payload is loaded accordingly. The call for resupply also provides the GPS coordinates of the target . The GPS information is loaded into the guidance and navigation system via an inductive setter that communicates with the guidance and navigation system by means of an inductive bobbin .

The inductive bobbin forms part of the guidance and navigation system that further includes ruggedized servo motors circuitry a power supply such as a battery and a CPU . These components are housed within the ogive shaped section of the shell body . An antenna also forms part of the guidance and navigation system and is embedded within the shell body .

After launch from a mortar tube and as illustrated by positions A B C the GPS antenna allows for the acquisition of GPS satellites for pre deployment guidance. The aim point is selected so that the guided decelerator system has optimal winds aloft. The time of separation of the payload deployment section and the tail section position D is determined by the guidance system algorithm stored on a memory within the circuitry . At the time of separation a small explosive charge is set off. The guidance system algorithm calculates the deployment time based upon the quadrant of elevation and the charge level for launching.

Preferably the time of separation is about the apogee of the flight path position D . At or near the maximum ordinate the payload deployment section and the tail section separate allowing the tail section to decelerate via a drogue chute .

More specifically the gas generated by the explosion of the charge creates pressure that pushes the ejection plunger forward with respect to the projectile shell body . The ejection plunger applies a force on the guided deceleration container housing the parafoil . In turn the guided deceleration container pushes on the payload container . A shearing load is created on the radially oriented pins that retain the fin and boom assembly of the tail section assembled to the shell body . As a result of the shearing load the pins that retain the payload deployment section shear causing the tail section to separate from the shell body .

With further reference to following the separation event the ejection plunger is fully extended and captured by its own housing . The small drogue chute is shown folded but ready to be deployed to slow the descent of the tail section to a less than lethal velocity.

The payload deployment section continues its flight forward until the parafoil housing is discarded and the parafoil canopy is un reefed. At this point the payload deployment section is located at point E in the intended flight path as illustrated in . As further illustrated between points E and F in the payload deployment section guides under inertial measurement unit IMU of the guidance and navigation system .

During this time the onboard global positioning system GPS is acquiring signals from the satellites. Upon GPS satellite signals acquisition at location F the onboard algorithm will make corrections based on its own wind measurements and determine an optimal approach to the target landing in the upwind direction. Once the payload deployment section is delivered to the target location at position G the recovered payload deployment section with the exception of the tip may be reused. A new power supply or battery a new payload and a new tail section will be required for another delivery mission.

One of the design concerns that the present invention overcame is the GPS signal acquisition. GPS guided missiles and artillery projectiles are typically provided with a GPS signal prior to launch. For the purpose of the present invention the guidance and navigation system is integral with the mortar projectile shell body . This prohibits the guidance and navigation system from acquiring GPS signal during launch.

In addition the present mortar projectile incorporates a wrap around GPS antenna into the shell body of the mortar projectile with the other guidance electronics and components i.e. the inductive bobbin the ruggedized servo motors the circuitry and memory the power supply and the processor being incorporated into the shell body .

In an alternative embodiment the GPS antenna is incorporated into a fuze like section on the front end of the shell body . Additionally this fuze like section could contain an inductive setter interface which is common with other modern fuzes thus allowing programming information to be entered into the present mortar projectile prior to launch.

If GPS signals are not acquired during the initial launch and ballistic trajectory event then upon deployment of the parafoil an additional guidance tactic will be required for the first 20 seconds otherwise the mortar projectile might drift with the wind and potentially out of range from the target . To this end the guidance and navigation system will be provided with an ultra light weight ULW aerial deliver system ADS which is equipped with a sophisticated inertial measurement unit IMU so that it can guide the parafoil in a pre determined direction regardless of shifts in the wind direction at high altitudes.

Another design concern that is addressed by the present invention is the ability of the components of the mortar projectile to survive a cannon launch where axial accelerations are experienced as high as 18 000 Gs. This high pressure could pose a threat to both the guidance and navigation system and the payload .

With regard to the guidance and navigation system all the electronic components are secured ensuring the absence of loose wires. Additionally the riser mechanism for controlling the parafoil risers and the power supply are sufficiently rugged to survive the cannon launch loads.

To this end reference is now made to which illustrate a preferred means to package the payload e.g. ammunition in order to survive the cannon launch because loosely supported ammunition will be damaged unsafe and therefore unusable.

The desired cargo must be properly supported during the launch event but must also be easy to access and reload. Initial test results indicate that cartridge based ammunition like the M855 5.56 mm must be launched with the bullet oriented aftward with respect to projectile launch. The cartridge shoulder and the bullet must be supported simultaneously or the cartridge will debullet. The cartridge needs to be restrained axially. Testing has indicated that the cartridges will survive loads associated with a mortar launch. If the cartridges are to be fired in an artillery shell the side walls of the cartridge casings have to be supported to keep the cases from crimping and acquiring damage.

To this end the payload container is fitted with a packaging assembly for an exemplary payload e.g. M855 cartridges . The payload is contained within the payload container that contains a packaging insert . The packaging insert includes a plurality of preformed chambers that are shaped to receive specific cartridges . illustrates the preformed chambers that are capable of carrying M855 ammunition. Packaging could be reconfigured to carry any other ammunition such as grenades. A central channel is included to house the riser mechanism.

Each cartridge is contained within a dedicated chamber e.g. of the packaging insert . The chamber is conformly shaped to tightly match the dimensions and shape of the desired cartridge . Preferred exemplary materials for the packaging insert include hard rubber or supportive polymer.

The packaging assembly further includes an endcap that keeps the cartridge from sliding out of its chamber . A conformal support simultaneously supports the cartridge and its shoulder. A preferred exemplary material for the endcap includes hard rubber or supportive polymer. Another endcap of similar composition to the endcap is placed on the forward end of the cartridges to complete the containment of the payload .

While illustrates the payload as including a plurality of items it should be understood that the payload may consist of a single item.

The entire payload the payload deployment section and the guidance and navigation system fit within the limited cargo space of the mortar projectile . As an example for an M930 120 mm mortar projectile this corresponds to a maximum of 115 inof available space. As a result the present invention utilizes the entire forward body section of the new mortar projectile as the payload and guidance system container. This provides more room for the payload and the guidance hardware in addition to allowing easier extraction of the payload . As the payload is intended to land gently near the stranded soldier the payload deployment section is designed to be recoverable and reusable.
