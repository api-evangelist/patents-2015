Hereinafter illustrative embodiments of the disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings. In the meantime the illustrative embodiments that will be described later are just examples of the disclosure and can be appropriately changed without departing from the gist of the disclosure.

As shown in the complex machine mainly has a printer unit a scanner unit a FAX unit a display an input device a communication unit a beacon receiver a CPU a storage and a communication bus . The respective constitutional elements configuring the complex machine are connected each other through the communication bus . The complex machine is an example of the image forming apparatus.

The printer unit is configured to execute recording processing of recording an image which is represented by image data onto a recording sheet that is an example of the sheet. Although a recording method of the printer unit is not particularly limited a well known method such as an inkjet method and an electrophotographic method may be adopted. The scanner unit is configured to execute scan processing of reading an image recorded on a recording sheet to generate image data. The FAX unit is configured to execute FAX processing of transmitting and receiving FAX unconformity to a FAX protocol. The printer unit the scanner unit and the FAX unit are examples of the image forming device configured to form an image.

The display has a display screen for displaying a variety of information. Although a specific configuration of the display is not particularly limited an LCD abbreviation of Liquid Crystal Display an OELD abbreviation of Organic Electro Luminescence Display and the like may be adopted for example.

The input device is configured to receive a user s operation of selecting an object displayed on the display screen of the display . Specifically the input device has push buttons for example and is configured to output a variety of operation signals associated with the pressed push buttons to the CPU . The input device may have a film shaped touch sensor superimposed on the display screen of the display . That is the display may be configured as a touch panel display.

In the meantime the term object indicates an image that can be selected by a user s operation on the input device . For example the object is a character string displayed on the display . When a direction key of the input device is pressed one of the objects may be highlighted and when an enter button of the input device is pressed the highlighted object may be selected. In another example when the input device is configured as a touch panel the object may be an icon a button a link and the like displayed on the display and the object displayed at a touched position may be selected.

The input device implemented as a touch panel is configured to receive a user s operation of touching the display screen of the display . The input device is configured to output position information indicating a position on the display screen touched by the user. The position information can be expressed by coordinates x y on an x y plane in which a left and upper end of the display screen is defined as an origin a right direction is defined as a positive direction of an x axis and a down direction is defined as a positive direction of a y axis. As the touch sensor a well known sensor such as an electrostatic capacitance type a resistance film type and the like may be adopted.

In the specification the term touch includes a variety of operations of contacting an input medium to the display screen. That is a tap operation of separating a touched input medium from the display screen within a predetermined time period a long touch operation of immobilizing a touched input medium on the display screen a slide operation of sliding a touched input medium on the display screen a flick operation where an acceleration of an input medium sliding on the display screen is equal to or greater than a threshold a pinch in operation of sliding two input media touched at different positions on the display screen in a direction of bringing the same into close to each other a pinch out operation of sliding two input media touched at different positions on the display screen in a direction of separating the same from each other and the like are examples of the touch.

An operation of bringing an input medium close to a position spaced from the display screen by an extremely slight gap even though the input medium is not contacted to the display screen may be included to the concept of the touch . The input medium may be a user s finger a touch pen and the like.

The communication unit is an interface for performing communication with an external apparatus through a communication network. That is the complex machine is configured to output a variety of information to the portable terminal through the communication unit and to receive a variety of data or information from the portable terminal through the communication unit . Although the specific communication protocol of the communication unit is not particularly limited Wi Fi registered trademark of the Wi Fi Alliance may be adopted for example.

The beacon receiver is configured to receive a beacon signal transmitted from the portable terminal . The beacon signal is based on any one of NFC abbreviation of Near Field Communication Bluetooth registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG Inc. Bluetooth Low Energy Bluetooth Smart and iBeacon registered trademark of Apple Inc. for example.

The CPU abbreviation of Central Processing Unit is configured to control the entire operations of the complex machine . The CPU is configured to acquire and execute a variety of programs which will be described later from the storage based on the variety of information output from the input device and the variety of information acquired from the external apparatus through the communication unit . That is the CPU and the storage configure an example of the controller.

The storage has a program storage area A and a data storage area B. In the program storage area A an OS abbreviation of Operating System and a control program are stored. In the meantime the control program may be a single program or a combination of a plurality of programs. In the data storage area B data or information necessary to execute the control program is stored.

In the data storage area B beacon information about the beacon signal received at the beacon receiver is stored as shown in for example. When the beacon signal is received through the beacon receiver the control program newly adds the beacon information of the beacon signal to the data storage area B.

In the meantime the beacon information of the illustrative embodiment is stored in a volatile memory such as a RAM. That is when the power feeding to the complex machine is stopped the beacon information stored in the data storage area B is erased. Alternatively when a predetermined threshold time period elapses after the beacon signal is received the control program may delete the corresponding beacon information from the data storage area B.

As shown in the beacon information includes timing information which indicates a receiving timing at which the beacon signal is received a terminal ID included in the beacon signal and intensity information which indicates a radio field intensity of the received beacon signal. In the meantime the plurality of beacon information shown in is aligned from top down in order of the older receiving timings. That is the lowest beacon information in is the beacon information of which the receiving timing is latest.

The terminal ID is an example of the identification information for identifying the portable terminal . Although a specific example of the terminal ID is not particularly limited the terminal ID may be a MAC abbreviation of Media Access Control address allotted to the communication unit of the portable terminal or may be arbitrarily set by the user for example. In the illustrative embodiment the terminal ID of the portable terminal A is 001 the terminal ID of the portable terminal B is 002 and the terminal ID of the portable terminal C is 003 .

The timing information may be any information capable of specifying the past receiving timing of the beacon signal the past receiving timing being specified from a present time to the past. The timing information shown in is expressed by a combination of hour minute second and millisecond at which the corresponding beacon signal was received. The timing information may include year month and date at which the corresponding beacon signal was received. A format of the timing information to be stored in the data storage area B is not limited to the above example. For example a time stamp format or a count value of a clock counter not shown may be used.

As shown in in the data storage area B definition information which defines respective screens shown in is stored. In the example of common standby screen definition information which defines a common standby screen FAX transmission screen definition information which defines a FAX transmission screen and first standby screen definition information to third standby screen definition information which define individual standby screens are stored in the data storage area B. In the meantime the common standby screen and the individual standby screen may also be collectively referred to as standby screen . Although not shown definition information which defines the other screens capable of being displayed on the display is also stored in the data storage area B.

The definition information defines a layout of messages and icons included in a corresponding screen processing associated with an icon and the like. The definition information may be described by an XML abbreviation of Extensible Markup Language for example. The definition information may be stored in advance in the data storage area B upon shipment of the complex machine may be acquired from a server apparatus not shown through the communication unit or may be arbitrarily prepared or edited by the user.

As shown in the common standby screen definition information and the FAX transmission screen definition information are not associated with the terminal ID. That is the screens which are to be expressed by the common standby screen definition information and the FAX transmission screen definition information are screens that are to be commonly used by all users. The screen which is to be expressed by the definition information not associated with the terminal ID is displayed on the display even when the portable terminal is not close to the complex machine .

On the other hand the first to third standby screen definition information is associated with the terminal IDs. In the example of the individual standby screen defined by the first standby screen definition information is a screen customized for a user of the portable terminal A identified by the terminal ID 001 . The second standby screen definition information and the third standby screen definition information are also the same. The screen which is to be represented by the definition information associated with the terminal ID is in principle displayed on the display when the portable terminal identified by the terminal ID comes close to the complex machine . At this time when the user of the portable terminal identified by the terminal ID logs in the complex machine or when an administrator of the complex machine logs in and instructs a display of a standby screen for a specific user the standby screen may also be displayed.

In the meantime data and information in the specification have a common feature that data and information are bits or bit string which can be handled by a computer. The term data indicates that a semantic content represented by each bit can be handled by a computer without considering the semantic content. In contrast the term information indicates that an operation of the computer is branched by a semantic content represented by each bit. Further the term instruction indicates a control signal for urging an apparatus of a transmission destination to perform a next operation and may include the information or may have a property as the information.

 Data and information are handled as the same data and information even though the formats for example a text format a binary format a flag format and the like are changed for each computer inasmuch as they are recognized as the same semantic content. For example the information representing two may be kept as information of a text format 0x32 which is the ASCII code in one computer and may be kept as information of a binary format 10 which is the binary representation in another computer.

However the distinction of data and information is not strict and an exceptional handling is also allowed. For example the data may be temporarily handled as the information and the information may be temporarily handled as the data. One that is handled as the data in an apparatus may be handed as the information in another apparatus. Further the information may be extracted from the data and the data may be extracted from the information.

The storage is configured by a RAM abbreviation of Random Access Memory a ROM abbreviation of Read Only Memory an EEPROM abbreviation of Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory an HDD abbreviation of Hard Disk Drive a buffer provided for the CPU or a combination thereof.

In the meantime the storage may be a computer readable storage medium. The computer readable storage medium is a non transitory medium. The non transitory medium includes a recording medium such as a CD ROM and a DVD ROM too. The non transitory medium is a tangible medium. In the meantime an electric signal for carrying a program to be downloaded from a server and the like on the Internet is a computer readable signal medium which is one kind of the computer readable medium but is not included in the non transitory computer readable storage medium.

The program stored in the program storage area A is configured to be executed by the CPU . However in the specification the operations of each program may be described while omitting the CPU . That is in below descriptions the description program A is configured to execute processing A may indicate that CPU is configured to execute processing A described in the program A . This is also the same for the portable terminal which will be described later.

The OS is a basic program for providing an API abbreviation of Application Programming Interface configured to control the printer unit the scanner unit the FAX unit the display the input device the communication unit the beacon receiver and the like which are the hardware configuring the complex machine . That is each program described above is configured to call the API provided by the OS thereby controlling the respective hardware. However in the specification the operations of each program may be described while omitting the OS . That is in below descriptions the description program B is configured to control hardware C may indicate that program B is configured to control hardware C through the API of the OS . This is also the same for the portable terminal which will be described later.

As shown in the portable terminal mainly has a display an input device a communication unit a beacon transmitting unit a CPU a storage and a communication bus . Since the display the input device the communication unit the CPU the storage and the communication bus which are included in the portable terminal are common to the display the input device the communication unit the CPU the storage and the communication bus which are included in the complex machine the overlapping descriptions are omitted. The CPU and the storage configure an example of the controller. Although a specific example of the portable terminal is not particularly limited a smart phone a portable phone and a tablet terminal may be exemplified.

In the program storage area A of the storage an OS and a control program are stored. The beacon transmitting unit is configured to transmit a beacon signal of a radio wave having a preset output. The control program is configured to enable the beacon transmitting unit to repeatedly transmit the beacon signal at a predetermined time interval. The control program adds the terminal ID of the portable terminal to the beacon signal that is to be transmitted by the beacon transmitting unit .

Display control processing of the illustrative embodiment is described with reference to . The display control processing is processing of switching a screen which is to be displayed on the display of the complex machine on the basis of the beacon signal to be transmitted from the portable terminal .

In the meantime the complex machine of the illustrative embodiment can be switched between a login state and a non login state. The non login state is a state where only an operation which is permitted to all users can be received through the input device . On the other hand the login state is a state where an operation which is specially permitted to a logged in user can be received through the input device in addition to the operation permitted at the non login state. The operation which is specially permitted at the login state includes an operation of adding editing and deleting a destination in a telephone directory for a logged in user an operation of initializing the settings of the complex machine an operation of making a setting about a security and the like for example. The setting about a security includes a switching of validity and invalidity of a so called secure printing which requires an input of a password upon recording processing an input of personal information of a logged in user and the like.

When a login screen is displayed on the display and a combination of right login ID and password is received through the input device for example the complex machine enters the login state. On the other hand when a user s operation of tapping a position of a log out icon in a log out screen is received through the input device for example the complex machine enters a log out state. In the below descriptions it is assumed that the processing is performed at the non login state except that the login state is explicitly indicated.

When a power supply of the complex machine becomes on for example the control program of the complex machine displays the common standby screen on the display . This processing is an example of the display control processing. depicts an example of the common standby screen defined by the common standby screen definition information. The common standby screen shown in includes a FAX icon a COPY icon a SCAN icon and a setting icon . The respective icons to included in the common standby screen are examples of the screen transition object for instructing transition of the screen.

The common standby screen is a screen that is to be displayed on the display when a non operation time period of the input device reaches a first time period after a new screen is displayed on the display . The common standby screen may be a so called top screen that is first to be displayed on the display when the power supply of the complex machine becomes on for example. At this time a so called splash screen in which a logo of a vendor is displayed is not here considered. The common standby screen may be a so called top screen that is to be displayed on the display when the screen transition object for instructing transition to the top screen is selected. The common standby screen may be a so called return screen that is to be displayed at a point of time that a sleep state is released.

The control program stands by at a state where a user s operation of selecting each of the icons to can be received through the input device S . When a user s operation of tapping a position of the FAX icon is received through the input device S Yes the control program displays a FAX transmission screen on the display instead of the common standby screen S . In other words the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the common standby screen to the FAX transmission screen. The processing of step S is an example of the first reception processing and the processing of step S is an example the screen transition processing.

When a user s operation of tapping a position of the ten key is received through the input device the control program displays a number of the tapped position in the text box as a part of the FAX number. When a user s operation of tapping a position of the START icon is received through the input device the control program enables the scanner unit to read a document set on a contact glass or ADF abbreviation of Auto Document Feeder and enables the FAX unit to FAX transmit scan data generated by the scanner unit to the FAX number displayed in the text box . After the FAX transmission processing is completed the control program again changes the screen displayed on the display from the FAX transmission screen to the common standby screen.

The FAX transmission screen is associated with the FAX icon . The FAX transmission screen is an example of the transition destination screen for inputting the operation information for instructing the scanner unit and the FAX unit to execute the FAX transmission processing. That is the operation of tapping the positions of the ten key and the operation of tapping the position of the START icon are examples of the input of the operation information. Like this the operation information includes the instruction for example selection of the START icon for starting the operation of the image forming device too in addition to the information for example FAX number necessary to operate the image forming device.

When a user s operation of tapping a position of Telephone Directory icon is received through the input device the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the FAX transmission screen to a telephone directory screen for displaying FAX numbers registered already in the telephone directory in a list form and receives a user s operation of selecting one of the listed FAX numbers through the input device . When a user s operation of tapping a position of the Favorite Registration icon is received through the input device the control program associates the FAX number displayed in the text box with a shortcut icon which will be described later .

That is the Telephone Directory icon is an example of the screen transition object for instructing transition to the telephone directory screen. The telephone directory screen is an example of the transition destination screen for inputting the operation information indicative of a destination of the FAX transmission processing. That is the screen transition object may be included in not only the common standby screen but also the transition destination screen. The transition destination screen is not limited to the screen that is to be changed when the screen transition object displayed in the common standby screen is selected and may be a screen that has been further changed from the transition destination screen.

When a user s operation of tapping a position of the COPY icon in the common standby screen is received through the input device S Yes the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the common standby screen to a copy screen for execution of copy processing S . The copy processing is processing of enabling the printer unit to record an image which is represented by the scan data generated by the scanner unit onto a sheet. Then the control program again changes the screen displayed on the display from the copy screen to the common standby screen after the copy processing is completed. The copy screen is an example of the transition destination screen for inputting the operation information such as selection of the number of sheets to be copied selections of a sheet size and a sheet type selection of color or monochrome copy and start of the copy processing for example.

When a user s operation of tapping a position of the SCAN icon in the common standby screen is received through the input device S Yes the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the common standby screen to a scan screen for enabling the scanner unit to execute scan processing S . After the scan processing is completed the control program again changes the screen displayed on the display from the scan screen to the common standby screen. The scan screen is an example of the transition destination screen for inputting the operation information such as designation of a resolution of the scan processing selection of a preservation destination of scan data and start of the scan processing for example.

When a user s operation of tapping a position of the setting icon in the common standby screen is received through the input device S Yes the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the common standby screen to a detail setting screen for receiving a setting change of the complex machine S . The detail setting screen is an example of the transition destination screen for inputting the operation information such as a size setting of a sheet to be used by the printer unit a setting of a default value of a resolution of scan data to be generated by the scanner unit and a setting of a preservation destination of FAX received data for example. Like this the operation information that is to be input through the transition destination screen is not limited to the information for immediately operating the image forming device.

The control program monitors with a timer whether an elapse time from the display of the common standby screen reaches a second time period S . When the second time period elapses while the input device does not receive the user s operation S No S Yes the control program stops feeding the power to the display S . The processing of step S is an example of the sleep processing. In the meantime the timer monitoring of the second time period starts at a timing at which a screen except for the common standby screen is displayed on the display too. The timer configured to measure the second time period is reset at a timing at which a screen displayed on the display is switched.

When the power supply of the complex machine becomes on for example the control program makes the beacon receiver stand by at a state where a beacon signal can be received. Here it is assumed that the complex machine is provided in a common space so that the users of the portable terminals A to C can use the same for example. That is it is assumed that the user carrying the portable terminal can come close to the complex machine .

It is assumed that the portable terminal repeatedly transmits a beacon signal having a predetermined output at a predetermined time interval. This processing is an example of the transmission processing. The beacon signal transmitted from the portable terminal propagates in the air with gradually attenuating. That is a radio field intensity of the beacon signal that is to be received at the beacon receiver has a tendency that it becomes stronger as a distance between the complex machine and the portable terminal is shorter and it becomes weaker as the distance between the complex machine and the portable terminal is longer.

When the beacon signal transmitted from the portable terminal is received through the beacon receiver the control program stores the beacon information in the data storage area B shown in S . That is the control program stores in the data storage area B the beacon information including the terminal ID included in the received beacon signal the timing information indicative of the receiving timing at which the beacon signal is received and the intensity information indicative of a receiving intensity of the beacon signal.

Meanwhile when the receiving intensity of the beacon signal is equal to or greater than a threshold for example 1.5 dBm the control program may store the beacon information of the beacon signal in the data storage area B in step S. In other words when the receiving intensity of the beacon signal is less than the threshold the control program may skip over step S.

When the power supply of the complex machine becomes on for example the control program repeatedly executes repeating processing shown in at a predetermined time interval. The predetermined time interval may be 10 msec to 1 sec for example. In the meantime the repeating processing may be executed when the beacon signal is received through the beacon receiver in addition to the above timing or instead of the above timing.

First the control program determines whether the common standby screen is displayed on the display S . When the common standby screen is being displayed S Yes the control program executes standby screen switching processing S . On the other hand when a screen rather than the standby screen i.e. the transition destination screen is being displayed S No the control program does not execute the standby screen switching processing. That is the standby screen switching processing is processing that is to be executed only when the standby screen of the standby screen and the transition destination screen is being displayed. The standby screen switching processing is processing of switching the standby screen that is to be displayed on the display . The standby screen switching processing is described in detail with reference to .

First the control program determines whether the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within a monitoring time period is stored in the data storage area B shown in S . The monitoring time period is a preset past time period from the present time to the past time. The monitoring time period may be 1 sec to 30 sec for example. When the standby screen switching processing of step S is executed the beacon information added in step S is stored. When the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period is stored in the data storage area B S Yes the control program determines whether the individual standby screen is displayed on the display S . When the standby screen switching processing of step S is executed the common standby screen is displayed on the display .

Then the control program extracts the terminal ID included in the beacon information which includes the maximum radio field intensity of the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period S . The terminal ID extracted in step S is an example of the target identification information. In the example of the terminal ID 001 having the radio field intensity of 4.0 dBm is extracted. Then the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the common standby screen to the individual standby screen associated with the terminal ID 001 S . The processing of step S is an example of the switching processing. The processing of steps S S and S is will be described later in step S.

The shortcut icon may be included in the individual standby screen by logging in the complex machine with the user ID allotted to the user of the portable terminal A and using the function of the Favorite Registration icon in the FAX transmission screen. In this case the terminal ID of the portable terminal and the login ID of the user of the portable terminal are associated with each other. The individual standby screen may be used instead of the common standby screen in the complex machine logged in by the corresponding user ID.

The number of the shortcut icon included in the individual standby screen is not limited to one. The difference between the common standby screen and the individual standby screen is not limited to a configuration where the shortcut icon is provided or not. For example the individual standby screen may not include an icon which is included in the common standby screen may include an icon which is not included in the common standby screen or may have a layout of the icons different from the common standby screen in conformity to a taste of the corresponding user. The types and layout of icons which are to be included in the individual standby screen may be arbitrarily set by the user for example.

Then the control program having displayed the individual standby screen on the display executes processing shown in . That is the control program stands by at a state where a user s operation of selecting the icons to included in the individual standby screen can be received through the input device S . The processing of step S is another example of the first reception processing. The control program monitors with the timer whether an elapse time from the display of the individual standby screen on the display reaches a first time period S . In the meantime the first time period is set to be shorter than the second time period. For example the first time period is selected from a range of 1 min to 10 min and the second time period is selected from a range of 3 min to 15 min so that it is longer than the first time period.

When a user s operation of tapping a position of the shortcut icon is received through the input device S Yes for example the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the individual standby screen to a destination screen S . depicts an example of the destination screen. The destination screen shown in includes a name of the destination Brother Taro and the FAX number 072 xxxx yyyy of the destination registered in the telephone directory and a START icon .

When a user s operation of tapping a position of the START icon is received through the input device the control program enables the FAX unit to FAX transmit the scan data generated by the scanner unit to the displayed FAX number. That is the destination screen is associated with the shortcut icon and an example of the transition destination screen for inputting the operation information for instructing the scanner unit and the FAX unit to execute the FAX transmission processing. After the FAX transmission processing is completed the control program again changes the screen displayed on the display from the destination screen to the individual standby screen.

When the first time period elapses without receiving the user s operation on the individual standby screen S No S Yes the control program executes the standby screen switching processing S . Here the description of the standby screen switching processing shown in which has been already described is omitted and the processing of steps S S S is described.

When the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period is not stored in the data storage area B S No the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the individual standby screen to the common standby screen S . The processing of step S is an example of the return processing. The control program extends the second time period for which the timer monitoring starts upon the display of the individual standby screen S . That is when the screen is switched to the common standby screen in step S the control program extends the second time period without resetting the timer configured to monitor the second time period.

On the other hand when the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period is stored in the data storage area B and the individual standby screen is displayed on the display S Yes S Yes the control program excludes the terminal ID 001 corresponding to the individual standby screen being displayed from the extraction target in step S S . Then the control program extracts the terminal ID from the beacon information which does not include the terminal ID 001 S and displays the individual standby screen corresponding to the terminal ID on the display S .

In the example of the terminal ID 002 having the radio field intensity of 3.2 dBm is extracted S and the screen displayed on the display is changed from the individual standby screen corresponding to the terminal ID 001 to the individual standby screen corresponding to the terminal ID 002 S . That is when the input device does not receive the user s operation after the individual standby screen corresponding to the terminal ID 001 is displayed until the first time period elapses the control program switches the screen to the individual standby screen corresponding to the terminal ID 002 different from the terminal ID 001 .

In the meantime the exclusion of the terminal ID 001 in step S may be released when the number of display times of the individual standby screen corresponding to another terminal ID reaches M M natural number of 1 or greater times or greater when the sleep processing is executed or when the beacon signal including the terminal ID 001 is received at a radio field intensity stronger than the maximum radio field intensity upon the exclusion.

According to the illustrative embodiment when the user carrying the portable terminal comes close to the complex machine during the display of the standby screen the standby screen is switched to the individual standby screen for the user of the portable terminal . Thereby it is possible to provide an interface appropriate to the user who comes close to the complex machine so as to use the same. In the meantime even when the user carrying the portable terminal comes close to the complex machine during the display of the transition destination screen the switching to the individual standby screen is not made. Thereby it is possible to suppress the operation of the user who is operating the complex machine from being disturbed.

In the meantime when the users of the plurality of portable terminals A to C are close to the complex machine it is preferably to switch the screen to the individual standby screen for the user closest to the complex machine i.e. the user having the largest possibility that the user will use the complex machine . In the meantime the extraction method of the terminal ID in step S is not limited to the above example.

For instance the control program may be configured to extract as the target identification information the terminal ID included in the beacon signal received most recently. That is the control program may be configured to extract as the target identification information the terminal ID included in the beacon signal in which the receiving timing is newest. In the example of the terminal ID 003 is extracted.

As another example when N or greater pieces N natural number of 2 or greater of the beacon information of N including the same terminal ID is stored within the monitoring time period the control program may extract the terminal ID. For example in case of N 2 the terminal IDs 001 and 002 are extracted in the example of . Thereby when a user just passes by the vicinity of the complex machine the screen is suppressed from being switched to the individual standby screen for the corresponding user.

As shown in when a plurality of the terminal IDs 001 002 is included in N or greater pieces of the beacon information the control program may extract as the target identification information the terminal ID included in the beacon information which includes the maximum radio field intensity of the beacon information including the extracted terminal ID. In the example of comparing the maximum value of the radio field intensity of the beacon information including the terminal ID 001 and the maximum value of the radio field intensity of the beacon information including the terminal ID 002 the terminal ID 001 having the greater maximum value is extracted as the target identification information. In the meantime comparing average values of the radio field intensities the terminal ID 002 having the greater average value is extracted.

According to the illustrative embodiment when the user s operation is not made after the individual display screen is displayed until the first time period elapses the screen is switched to the individual standby screen for another user. Thereby for example when a user having no intention to use the complex machine is close to the complex machine it is possible to suppress the individual standby screen for the corresponding user from being continuously displayed.

When there is no user carrying the portable terminal in the vicinity of the complex machine at the timing at which the first time period elapses the individual standby screen is switched to the common standby screen. As a result it is possible to provide the complex machine that can be easily used by a user who does not carry the portable terminal too. Further since the second time period is extended at the timing at which the first time period elapses the sleep processing is suppressed from being executed just after the common standby screen is displayed. As a result it is possible to suppress a user who intends to operate the complex machine through the common standby screen from additionally executing an operation for releasing the sleep state.

In the meantime the individual standby screen displayed on the display may be operated by a user rather than the corresponding user. Therefore in the illustrative embodiment the destination screen corresponding to the shortcut icon is permitted to all users as regards the operation on the destination screen. Like this the screen transition object included in the individual standby screen is preferably associated with the transition destination screen on which an input of the operation information is permitted to all the users. In other words the screen transition object for transition to the transition destination screen on which an input of the operation information is specially permitted to a logged in user is not preferably included in the individual standby screen.

Subsequently operations of the image forming system according to a first modified embodiment are described with reference to . In the meantime the descriptions of the common features to the above illustrative embodiment are omitted and the differences are mainly described. The image forming system according to the first modified embodiment is configured to display a switching icon in the common standby screen without immediately switching the screen to the individual standby screen when the user carrying the portable terminal comes close to the complex machine . When the switching icon is selected the image forming system according to the first modified embodiment changes the screen displayed on the display from the common standby screen to the individual standby screen corresponding to the switching icon.

When the power supply of the complex machine becomes on for example the control program of the complex machine repeatedly executes the repeating processing shown in at a predetermined time interval. The predetermined time interval may be 10 msec to 1 sec for example. That is when the common standby screen is being displayed S Yes the control program extracts the terminal ID included in the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period and adds the switching icon corresponding to the terminal ID to the common standby screen S . The processing of step S is an example of the object addition processing.

That is when only the terminal ID 001 is included in the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period the control program displays the common standby screen shown in on the display . In the meantime when only the terminal IDs 001 and 002 are included in the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period the control program displays the common standby screen shown in on the display . In the meantime the extraction condition of the terminal ID in step S is not limited to the above example. For example the control program may extract the terminal ID included in the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period and the radio field intensity is equal to or greater than a threshold intensity.

Then the control program stands by at a state where the user s operation of selecting each of the icons to can be received through the input device S . The control program stands by at a state where the user s operation of selecting each of the switching icons can be received through the input device S . The processing of step S is an example of the second reception processing.

Then when the user s operation of tapping a position of each of the icons to included in the common standby screen is received through the input device S Yes the control program changes the screen displayed on the display transition from the common standby screen to the transition destination screen corresponding to any of the icons to of the tapped position S . Since the processing of steps S S is common to the processing of steps S S shown in the detailed descriptions thereof are omitted.

In the meantime when a user s operation of tapping a position of the switching icon of the switching icons included in the common standby screen shown in is received through the input device S the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the common standby screen to the individual standby screen shown in S .

According to the first modified embodiment when a plurality of users is close to the complex machine it is possible to simply switch the screen to the individual standby screen for a user who wants to use the complex machine . In the meantime the switching icon may be added to not only the common standby screen but also the individual standby screen. That is the processing shown in may be executed during the display of the individual standby screen too.

Subsequently operations of the image forming system according to a second modified embodiment are described with reference to . In the meantime the descriptions of the common features to the above illustrative embodiment are omitted and the differences are mainly described. When the selection of the screen transition object by the user carrying the portable terminal is received through the input device the image forming system of the second modified embodiment displays the transition destination screen associated with the selected screen transition object and customized for the user on the display .

In the second modified embodiment the data storage area B is configured to store therein the standby screen definition information the common FAX transmission screen definition information and the first to third FAX transmission screen definition information instead of the definition information shown in as shown in . In the example of the standby screen definition information defining the common standby screen shown in and the common FAX transmission screen definition information defining the FAX transmission screen shown in are not associated with the terminal ID. That is the screens that are to be defined by the corresponding definition information are screens that are to be commonly used for all users. In the meantime the first to third FAX transmission screen definition information associated with the different terminal IDs defines the FAX transmission screens customized for corresponding users respectively.

When the beacon signal transmitted from the portable terminal is received through the beacon receiver the control program of the complex machine executes the processing shown in . When the common standby screen shown in is displayed on the display the control program executes the processing shown in . That is the control program stands by at a state where the user s operation of selecting each of the icons to can be received through the input device S .

Then when a user s operation of tapping the position of the FAX icon is received through the input device S Yes for example the control program determines whether the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period is stored in the data storage area B shown in S . In the meantime the processing of step S and thereafter is also executed in the same manner when the other icons to included in the common standby screen are selected.

When the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period is not stored S No the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the common standby screen shown in to the FAX transmission screen shown in S . In the second modified embodiment the FAX transmission screen shown in is an example of the common transition destination screen. The processing of steps S S S and S is another example of the screen transition processing.

On the other hand when the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period is stored S Yes the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the common standby screen shown in to the FAX transmission screen shown in S S . Specifically the control program extracts the terminal ID included in the beacon information which includes the maximum radio field intensity of the beacon information of which the receiving timing is within the monitoring time period in step S. Then in step S the control program displays the FAX transmission screen which is defined by the definition information associated with the extracted terminal ID of the FAX transmission screen associated with the FAX icon on the display .

The FAX transmission screen shown in is a screen defined by the first FAX transmission screen definition information associated with the terminal ID 001 for example. The FAX transmission screen shown in is different from the FAX transmission screen shown in in that it includes a shortcut icon . The function of the shortcut icon may be common to the shortcut icon shown in for example. That is when a user s operation of selecting the shortcut icon is received through the input device the control program changes the screen displayed on the display from the FAX transmission screen shown in to the destination screen shown in . The FAX transmission screen shown in is an example of the individual transition destination screen.

According to the second modified embodiment for example when the user carrying the portable terminal A selects the FAX icon the FAX transmission screen shown in is displayed. Thereby the user of the portable terminal A can enable the FAX unit to execute the FAX transmission processing through the FAX transmission screen customized for the user. On the other hand when the FAX icon is selected by a user who does not carry the portable terminal the FAX transmission screen shown in is displayed. That is it is possible to provide the interface that can be easily by the user who does not carry the portable terminal too.

In the complex machine of the illustrative embodiment the various programs stored in the program storage area A of the storage are executed by the CPU so that the respective processing to be executed by the controller of the disclosure is implemented. However the configuration of the controller is not limited thereto and a part or all thereof may be implemented by the hardware such as an IC abbreviation of Integrated Circuit .

The disclosure may be implemented as not only the complex machine but also the program for enabling the complex machine to execute the processing. The program may be provided with being recorded in a non transitory recording medium. The non transitory may include a CD ROM a DVD ROM and a storage mounted on a server apparatus that can be connected to the complex machine or the portable terminal through the communication network. The program stored in the storage of the server apparatus may be delivered through the communication network such as the Internet as the information or signals representing the program.

According to the above configuration when a user carrying a portable terminal configured to transmit a beacon signal comes close to the image forming apparatus if the standby screen is being displayed the screen is switched to an individual standby screen for the user and if the transition destination screen is being displayed the display switching is not performed. As a result it is possible to display the individual standby screen customized for a close user without disturbing other user s operation.

In the meantime standby screen may be a so called top screen that is to be displayed when starting processing of the image forming apparatus is over or a so called return screen that is to be displayed when a sleep state is released for example. In the meantime transition destination screen may include a screen for setting execution conditions sheet size number of sheets to be printed magnification percentage and the like of print processing a screen for setting execution conditions resolution number of colors file format and the like of scan processing a telephone directory screen for selecting a FAX transmission destination an execution instruction screen for instructing the print processing the scan processing and the FAX transmission processing and the like for example.

According to the above configuration when a user just passes by the vicinity of the image forming apparatus the screen is suppressed from being switched to the individual standby screen for the corresponding user.

According to the above configuration it is possible to switch the screen to an individual standby screen for a user closest to the image forming apparatus i.e. a user having the largest possibility that the user will use the image forming apparatus.

According to the above configuration for example when a user having no intention to use the image forming apparatus is close to the image forming apparatus it is possible to suppress the individual standby screen for the corresponding user from being continuously displayed.

According to the above configuration it is possible to suppress the sleep processing from being executed just after a user who intends to use the image forming apparatus is detected. As a result it is not necessary to make the user perform processing for releasing the sleep state.

Thereby when a plurality of users is close to the image forming apparatus it is possible to simply switch the screen to the individual standby screen for a user who wants to use the image forming apparatus.

According to the above configuration when there is no user carrying the portable terminal in the vicinity of the image forming apparatus the screen is switched to the common standby screen. Therefore it is possible to provide the image forming apparatus that can be easily used by a user who does not carry the portable terminal too.

In the image forming apparatus having the above configurations the individual standby screen displayed on the display may be operated by a user not the corresponding user. For this reason it is preferably not include a screen transition object for transition to a transition destination screen on which an input is permitted to a specific user in the individual standby screen.

According to the disclosure the screen can be switched to the individual standby screen during the display of the standby screen and the display switching cannot be made during the display of the transition destination screen. Therefore it is possible to display the individual standby screen customized for a close user without disturbing the other user s operation.
