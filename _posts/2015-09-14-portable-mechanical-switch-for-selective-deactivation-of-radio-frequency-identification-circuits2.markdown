title: Portable mechanical switch for selective deactivation of radio frequency identification circuits
abstract: Systems and methods for providing security for authentication devices—such as electronically readable cards or ID badges with embedded RFID chips or NFC capability—may include an envelope or pocket-like case for carrying an electronically readable card, having an electrically conductive, non-opaque sleeve that can be moved to cover or expose the electronically readable card and that prevents information on the card from being electronically read when covered yet still allows the card to be seen when covered. In one or more embodiments, the sleeve may be a wire mesh that is flexible enough to be compressed to expose the card yet stiff (or rigid) enough to be extended to cover the card and that is transparent enough to allow reading visual information on the surface of the card when covering the card. Protection can be switched off by a mechanical switch that leaves the protection normally on.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 689 432 filed Nov. 29 2012 which is also hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to security for radio frequency identification RFID and more particularly to protecting cards having embedded RFID radio frequency for which the protection can be conveniently deactivated yet allows the card to remain visible even while protected.

Radio frequency identification RFID chips which can be remotely activated to wirelessly transmit information from the chip are widely used in many types of authentication devices including for example credit cards passports and identity badges in which a tiny RFID chip may be embedded. Information contained in an RFID chip is however often insecure for a number of reasons. For example the information may not be encrypted due to encryption being expensive for manufacturers attackers may be able to remotely identify read and copy the information stored on an RFID chip using an RFID skimmer that electronically reads and copies the information and the equipment necessary to skim an RFID authentication device may be obtainable at relatively low cost.

Currently owners of RFID badges RFID embedded credit cards such as payWave or PayPass credit cards and other authentication devices using RFID or near field communication NFC for example may sometimes use pouch like enclosures impregnated with metals to guard against surreptitious duplication or sabotage of their credentials. Such enclosures may take the form of homemade wallets consisting of tinfoil and duct tape for example or more sturdy products made with nylon and steel. While these enclosures can be quite effective they are often cumbersome and require the user to fully remove and then replace the credential device. This type of protection is also unsuitable for credentials such as identification badges that must be worn and displayed visibly even when not being used for electronic authentication.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures in which the showings therein are for purposes of illustrating the embodiments and not for purposes of limiting them.

Broadly speaking methods and systems are provided in one or more embodiments for providing security for cards and authentication devices having embedded radio frequency identification RFID in which the authentication device e.g. a credit card or identification ID badge is protected from being read electronically while still being visible e.g. visually readable such as a photo ID badge and the protection can be conveniently deactivated by a user allowing the authentication device or card to be read electronically.

Items with embedded radio frequency identification RFID or near field communication NFC chips often lack a means to easily disable transceiver components when they are not needed or during times when their operation would constitute a security risk. For example RFID enabled bank credit cards have been the object of some concern because of the readiness with which criminals can clone or skim them using modified readers similar to those of legitimate merchants and getting near enough to a credit card to coax its response signals. In addition the vulnerability of RFID circuits to directed electromagnetic radiation could for example enable a skilled social engineer to permanently deactivate an unsuspecting employee s ID badge from a distance and then exploit a power relationship e.g. posing as a security guard or helpful information technology IT specialist to con the employee into revealing other identity information.

Embodiments may address such scenarios improving ID badge security by guarding against surreptitious duplication and chip destruction while at the same time preserving other functionality of the card or badge such as visibility of a photo identification affixed to an ID badge. The selective RFID deactivation system that allows the read protection to be deactivated upon a user s selection of a switch position may allow users to travel freely and securely in the knowledge that until the user pushes down the deactivation switch the user s badge is non readable electronically while remaining visually readable . As a consequence an ID badge protected by one embodiment can compensate for unforeseen circumstances for example a lack of cautiousness on the part of a user protecting the user in situations where the user might otherwise inadvertently or guilelessly expose the ID badge to unauthorized electronic reading outside of a secure work environment.

In one embodiment for example a carrying case like apparatus may allow a user to place an RFID embedded badge credit card or other chip embedded item generally referred to as electronically readable authentication device or card inside the case and selectively enable or disable reading of the card by simply pressing down on a switch e.g. button lever or slider . Activation and deactivation of electronic read protection for the item may be achieved in one or more embodiments by way of a flexible electrically conductive mesh or sheath that runs along a channel between layers of protective plastic in the case. The mesh may be compressed moving the mesh to electronically expose the item allowing the item to be electronically read whenever the user presses the switch. The mesh or sheath when uncompressed may act according to the physical principles of a Faraday cage preventing the electronically readable card from being accessed or read electronically by surrounding or enclosing the item and obscuring the item from electric fields and electromagnetic radiation. The mesh or sheath however may be virtually transparent or at least semi transparent so that the item remains visible and information on the item such as an ID photo and text information can still be seen or read optically. Embodiments may differ from other products for protecting electronically readable cards that are more similar to a conventional wallet and completely cover the chip embedded card so that it is not visible. Faraday cages are typically rigid rather than flexible requiring a door like opening or flap to be opened to move objects into and out of the cage.

In one or more embodiments systems and methods provide an envelope or pocket like case for carrying an electronically readable card having an electrically conductive non opaque sheath that can be moved to cover or expose the electronically readable card and that prevents information on the card from being electronically read when covered yet still allows the card to be seen e.g. preserving visual functionality when covered. In one or more embodiments the sheath may be a wire mesh that is flexible enough to be compressed to expose the card yet stiff or rigid enough to be extended to cover the card and that is transparent enough to allow reading visual information on the surface of the card when covering the card.

For example according to one embodiment a system may include a case having an opening for inserting an authentication device and an inside shaped to accept the authentication device in which the case allows the authentication device to remain visible when the authentication device is inside the case and a flexible electrically conductive sheath inside the case the sheath having a first position and a second position and readily moveable between the two positions such that in the first position when the authentication device is inside the case the electrically conductive sheath encloses the authentication device and the authentication device remains visible through the sheath and in the second position the sheath does not enclose the authentication device.

Also according to one embodiment a method may include protecting an electronically readable card from being electronically read while maintaining visual readability of the electronically readable card mechanically switching off a protection of the electronically readable card for presentation to an electronic card reader and mechanically switching the protection back on so that the electronically readable card is protected from being electronically read yet is still visually readable.

Reader device may communicate via network with a website that may be operated by a commercial entity such as a security service or a merchant website that is a seller of retail goods for example. For example website may be a merchant website may sell goods online and may communicate with reader device e.g. a POS terminal by operating a server e.g. a computer processor that presents a website for selling goods. The server may respond to client devices e.g. client running on reader device by communicating over network . Website may also maintain a database and provide user accounts for its customers. Database may provide convenience for customers of the merchant e.g. merchant website by allowing for example users to keep their shipping information on file with the merchant so as not to have to re enter information with every order or for example the merchant may like to offer promotions for users with an account on merchant website . Merchant website may operate a backend server that is limited in its communications over network and may communicate with server and database through a firewall for providing more secure operations than would be possible with server . In another example website may provide a security service that for example tracks authentication devices e.g. authentication device may be an employee ID badge .

Website may also communicate for example using server with a financial service provider FSP through FSP server over network . For example website may communicate with FSP in the course of various services offered by FSP to website such as payment intermediary between customers e.g. consumer user of merchant website and merchant website itself. For example merchant website may use an application programming interface API that allows it to run apps and offer sale of goods in which customers are allowed to make payment through FSP while consumer user may have an account with FSP that allows consumer user to use the FSP for making payments to sellers that allow use of authentication authorization and payment services of FSP as a payment intermediary. Financial service provider services may also include for example an online payment service operating between consumers and merchants and may also be a service provided by a financial service provider FSP such as PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. in which a user of the service may have an account with the FSP referred to as an FSP account . Also as shown in FSP may provide electronic data storage in the form of database . Database may be used to keep track of user s accounts with FSP merchant s accounts with FSP and transactions between customers merchants and stores including payments between the various entities for example. FSP server may execute various application programming interfaces APIs that may enable various different types of relationships between FSP and the different parties shown in . In addition FSP may provide various APIs to its customers such as website e.g. API that enable those websites to implement embodiments of authentication authorization and password reset services.

For example the size of holes or openings e.g. any part of the cage s uninterrupted open areas measured in any dimension or direction in a Faraday cage may be related to the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation that it is intended for the Faraday cage to block according to a general empirical rule that the size of any opening should be no larger than about 1 10 to 1 20 of the smallest wavelength intended to be blocked. So for example for the 900 mega Hertz MHz frequency band commonly employed in RFID schemes the wavelength is approximately 33 centimeters cm so that a Faraday cage with openings for which the maximum dimension of any opening is no greater than about 1.65 cm based on 1 20 of a wavelength should be more than sufficient to provide protection from being electronically read at 900 MHz or less for a card enclosed within the Faraday cage e.g. a card enclosed within a sheath .

As shown in case may have an opening for inserting card and the opening may determine by being more or less perpendicular to the opening an axis of case along which card may be inserted into case as indicated by the arrow in . Sheath may be collapsible and expandable axially with reference to axis as can be seen by comparison between and of the positions of sheath . In a protected or default first position shown in sheath may enclose and protect card from being electronically read but still allow information on card to remain visible or capable of being visually read . In an unprotected or exposed second position shown in sheath may leave enough of card electronically exposed to be electronically readable by a card reading device such as card reader as well as still being visible . A button such as a slider lever catch or other mechanism may be provided for convenient finger operation in moving sheath between its first and second positions.

For example a mechanism may be so arranged e.g. using spring tension or elasticity of the sheath material itself that button needs to be held to maintain sheath in the exposed position shown in so that sheath automatically returns to the default protected position shown in when button is released. In another example a mechanism may be so arranged that button catches and remains in the last position selected by a user. For added convenience and accessibility case may further include a hole or other suitable attachment point e.g. for a clip attachment for attaching the case for example to clothing a lanyard or a key ring.

In another example instead of having a button on the side of the case the entire sheath assembly including spring tension or compression may be inverted so that the sheath is compressed only when a lanyard or similar attachment device is pulled. In this example sheath may be attached to a sliding component of the case so that sheath compresses in an upward direction with respect to the orientation of the security badge and the wearer instead of downward as seen in .

In general sheath may be regarded as a cylinder with cylindrical axis surrounding card . Sheath may also surround an inner sleeve also regarded as generalized cylinder having cylindrical axis as shown in cross section in . Both case and inner sleeve may be made of transparent plastic case may be made of a harder plastic and inner sleeve may be more flexible. Inner sleeve may be configured so that card may slide into inner sleeve and inner sleeve is surrounded by sheath which is surrounded by case so that a space or channel is formed between inner sleeve and case also referred to as outer sleeve in which sheath may be retained. Both the inner and outer sleeves may be somewhat flexible but the two sleeves should act in concert as a channel that both guides the movement of sheath and prevents sheath from rubbing against the enclosed ID card or chip e.g. card . To ensure relative stability of the disposition of inner sleeve with respect to outer sleeve case inner and outer sleeves may be provided with anchor points see at which the inner and outer sleeves are joined through sheath near or at the bottom of sheath so that effectiveness of sheath for electronic readability protection is not compromised e.g. bottom of sheath is closed sufficiently to provide Faraday cage shielding as described above .

A sufficiently tensile and plastic metal or other electrically conductive material may be selected for the sheath so that the edges of the top opening of sheath will close or snap together when sheath is moved e.g. releasing button to the protected or default position but will separate to allow a card edge and the top of inner sleeve to pass through when sheath is moved to the unprotected or exposed position e.g. depressing button . To achieve this type of closure for the top of sheath the outside top edges of the inner plastic sleeve may be beveled see so that the inner sleeve beveling guides the top edges of sheath away from each other as the sheath slides down the inner sleeve . Alternately or in addition to inner sleeve beveling the inner sides of the outer sleeve may be angled or beveled such that outer sleeve beveling drives the top edges of sheath toward each other when the as the sheath slides up the inner sleeve for example as spring pressure elongates sheath back to the default position upon release of button .

Depending on the material and construction of sheath the movability of sheath may be variously described as collapsible extendable e.g. for a spring loaded scissor gate style lattice compressible expandable e.g. for a springy or elastic material such as a mesh or telescoping e.g. for segments that can nest inside each other .

The totality of the sheath may elongate and contract axially e.g. in the direction of axis by any of or any combination of the following means for example hinged connections inserted in a lattice to create a conventional scissor gate lattice exploiting the plastic or elastic properties of certain metals such as shape memory and conventional alloys which will temporarily deform and then spring back to their original shape or allowing segments of the sheath s sides to telescope within each other or along a track or groove. For a mesh sheath a wire mesh may be made of steel copper or a similarly pliable metal which also is electrically conductive so as to provide shielding form electromagnetic radiation. The material may be forged welded or soldered such that the intersections are permanently joined together and much of the movement may be effected mainly via compression of the metal. Alternatively the intersecting strands of the mesh material may be riveted together to form a scissor like joint on which the intersecting strands may pivot allowing for use of a thicker or less pliable metal. In this latter configuration the rivets may be of a sufficiently conductive material so as to not break the continuity of the grid s conductivity.

At step protective device may be closed so that the sheath encloses or surrounds the card or authentication device so as to effectively form a Faraday cage around the card protecting the card from being electronically read while allowing the device to remain visible enough that visual information on the card can still be discerned or visually read. For example a user or wearer of protective device may release pressure on a compression switch e.g. button to allow the sheath to expand and rise to cover the length of the card at its first or default position as seen in . An opening in the top of the sheath may be closed sufficiently using bevel features or tensile properties of the material of sheath described above for example that electronic read protection for card remains effective at the first or default position of sheath .

At step the protective device may be switched to the unprotected or exposed second position shown in for presentation to an electronic reading device e.g. a card reader and electronic reading of the card or authentication device by the electronic reading device . For example when a user or wearer of protective device is presented with a situation in which the card may be used e.g. for making a credit card payment or passing an ID checkpoint the user may depress a compression switch e.g. button for as long as needed for using the card e.g. long enough to briefly hold the card near a card reader which in turn may expose an RFID chip or NFC circuit embedded in card to electromagnetic fields for the duration that the user keeps button depressed as would be seen in if the card were already inserted into protective device .

At step protective device may be switched back to protected or default position either by simply releasing the switch e.g. button or by switching button back in an embodiment for which the switch has a catch at both first and second positions of sheath for resuming electronic read protection of the card or authentication device.

For example once a user or wearer of protective device no longer needs to use authentication device for being electronically read the user may release pressure on the switch e.g. button returning the sheath sleeve system referring to sheath and inner sleeve to an electronically non readable state while card may still be visually readable and shield the card from electromagnetic fields as seen in .

In an example according to one embodiment when the user lets go of the compression switch e.g. button spring pressure e.g. elasticity of sheath itself or a separate return spring may cause the metal lattice e.g. sheath to expand and enclose the card to act as a protective Faraday cage. While the system e.g. protective device is in this default position the chip of card effectively cannot be scanned or shorted using conventional technology.
