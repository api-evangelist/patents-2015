An electric vehicle may travel from a point of origin to a destination in a vehicle transportation network using power stored in a battery of the electric vehicle. Whether and how to operate an electric vehicle may depend on accurate determinations regarding the operating range of the electric vehicle. For example a driver may determine whether to use an electric vehicle to travel from the origin to the destination based on a determination of the expected operational range of the electric vehicle after traversing the vehicle transportation network from the origin to the destination. However in some implementations a determination of the expected operational range of the electric vehicle after traversing the vehicle transportation network from the origin to the destination may be unavailable prior to traversing the vehicle transportation network from the origin to the destination.

Furthermore the efficiency of power utilization for operating an electric vehicle may be affected by factors such as the characteristics of the electric vehicle the driving behavior of the driver of the vehicle and operating conditions for driving the electric vehicle such as the ambient temperature. However in some implementations determinations of the expected operational range of the electric vehicle after traversing the vehicle transportation network from the origin to the destination may be inaccurate because one or more of these factors is ignored.

Implementations of electric vehicle range prediction may include accurately determining the expected operational range for an electric vehicle after traversing the vehicle transportation network from the origin to the destination prior to traversing the vehicle transportation network from the origin to the destination based on the characteristics of the electric vehicle the driving behavior of the driver and the expected ambient temperature. Furthermore electric vehicle range prediction may be performed by a portable electronic computing and communication device independent of the electric vehicle. Implementations of electric vehicle efficiency profile management may include generating and maintaining user specific efficiency information and user specific efficiency profiles for use in electric vehicle range prediction.
