This patent arises from a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 806 820 entitled NETWORK SERVER ARRANGEMENT FOR PROCESSING NON PARAMETRIC MULTI DIMENSIONAL SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL HUMAN BEHAVIOR OR TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS MEASURED PERVASIVELY AND RELATED METHOD FOR THE SAME which was filed on Dec. 24 2012 and which is a U.S. national stage filing of PCT Application Serial No. PCT FI2010 050548 filed on Jun. 24 2010. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 806 820 and PCT Application Serial No. PCT FI2010 050548 are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The present invention generally relates to wireless devices and communications networks. In particular however not exclusively the disclosure pertains to processing and distributing data related to observations performed in one or more mobile devices in a server side system through layered data processing activities and conversion of non parametric data into parameterized form including the utilization of applicable techniques such as statistical filtering and semantic data structures.

More and more data can be collected from mobile devices such as mobile terminals like smartphones and transactional feeds can be created based on the associated observations. However these feeds are not self containing in thoroughly or even sufficiently characterizing a mobile device user in question although the feeds may admittedly tell some details about related e.g. transaction oriented time dependent point in time and contextual event can be linked to attributes like location or weather events like the user s movements during a course of daily life.

Second when behavioral data or technical observations need to be processed the present database and data processing solutions are non optimized in the light of multiple factors such as processing speed memory requirements or the general availability of historical data and making it available for sophisticated further processing or statistical analysis.

Third despite the fact there are in principle huge amounts of information available about people s life contemporary systems unfortunately mostly dismiss the linkage between historical data models and real time data i.e. the practical applications and fail to ascertain that their technical implementation is feasible given widely available database storage and data processing hardware.

Nevertheless a number of prior art publication still describe how to collect data points position the user or to make contextual data points locally available to other applications of a mobile device. For example a prior art publication WO2008118119 discloses a mobile device and a method for communicating positioning data of the mobile device to a server at a periodic interval automatically generating in the mobile device in response to the server a present location profile associated with a present geographic location of the device simultaneously generating in the mobile device a set of adjacent profiles provided by the server as being a direction away from the present geographic location of the mobile device and refreshing in the mobile device the present location profile and the set of adjacent profiles at the periodic interval.

Notwithstanding the various prior art solutions for storing mobile device related events and in view of the foregoing there still exists room for improvement and a need to describe how especially multi dimensional data in particular on human behaviour can be stored and processed through a layered mechanism not only to optimize performance or to enable more complex analysis procedures but also to generate more meaningful semantic indicators and profiles out of the data and to physically separate different abstraction levels for both technical and legal reasons.

The objective of the present invention is to alleviate at least one or more of the aforesaid drawbacks of the prior art solutions and preferably satisfy the associated aforementioned needs.

The objective is achieved through the provision of a more intelligent flexible and adaptive alternative for physically storing and technically analysing data feeds of human behaviour potentially on a continuously basis and utilizing a layered approach.

A server arrangement in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention may be configured to receive and process observation data in multiple co ordinated ways and the data may be further cultivated into an output that is understandable from the standpoint of the observer and advantageously contains relationships that may even be used for predictive purposes. In various further supplementary or alternative embodiments metrics relative to the life of one or more users may be produced preferably with relevant feedback loop s to the data processing activities so as to enable calibrating the technical procedures constantly or upon a specific need or instance of a triggering condition. Various embodiments of the present invention enable determining how non parametric data as collected by wireless devices may be used efficiently in building derived more abstract higher level data entities such as vectors that describe a user s usage and life habits or technical factors surrounding the user in connection with the utilization of mobile services for example. This information may be produced using multiple abstraction layers facilitating virtually any kind of further aggregation procedure and physically saving the required storage capacity and number of actions in processing the data. Some embodiments of the suggested solution may indeed be arranged to convert raw level data into higher level information that can be used in a variety of applications including mobile advertising or network performance analysis optimization for example. Further a mobile user s physical presence and past actions can be linked or compared in real time with patterns that are stored into databases based on previously received data. Future behavior of the user may be predicted. The solution may be optimized for different potentially continuous data streams that contain non parameterized multi dimension data such as sensor data received from wireless mobile and or other applicable devices acting as data sources or data intermediaries.

Thereby in one aspect of the present invention a network server arrangement comprises a data input entity configured to receive multi dimensional non parametric data such as sensor data obtained from a number of mobile devices such as smartphones a processing entity configured to parametrize the multi dimensional non parametric data a memory entity configured to store the parametrized data preferably on a plurality of different abstraction layers as multi layered data an aggregation engine configured to target a number of aggregations and or data modeling activities such as time series averaging and or sum operations to the parametrized data in batches optionally relative to certain time period location mobile application or application category mobile user and or a user group so as to determine from a data batch a number of descriptive higher level behavioral and or technical indicators the functioning thereof being preferably substantially activated at any particular time instant upon at least predetermined sufficient amount of data or information becoming available or a trigger is released and a data export entity such as an API Application Programming Interface configured to provide the number of behavioural and or technical indicators or information derived therefrom to an external entity such as to a mobile marketing entity for selecting personalized ads to one or more mobile users or to a network analyzing or management entity for assessing network performance and or user experience and optionally enable it to further optimize the performance and or the user experience on the basis thereof respectively.

The procedure of determining behavioural indicators may comprise various innovative items for securing smooth operation.

Namely in one embodiment a common ontology may be defined for the stored and processed data which may be achieved with the data structuring feature of the present invention which structures received data based on the content and or dynamic attributes thereof such as location user identification or time into at least one specific data entity such as a table preferably adding thereto process categorization information to facilitate easier processing later on.

In another either supplementary or alternative embodiment non parametric input data that can be collected from one or several software modules running in wireless devices may be turned into a richer more structured and advantageously parametric data and preferably at the same time a number of procedures may be conducted for the data that are executable on the fly and which thereby reduce the load of potential other modules. This goal may be achieved with an entity configured to process the incoming data streams before handling them over to a memory module.

In a further either supplementary or alternative embodiment dynamic time stamped vectors that reflect the true behaviour of mobile users in a given number of dimensions may be determined which may be achieved through utilization of an entity that produces a rich variety of pre defined statistics e.g. through a number of scripts that process chunks of data in batches and apply advanced statistics techniques processing activities and or other scripted actions in generating user level and time stamped statistics periodically. The vectors are advantageously of a form that facilitates straightforward future conversions including for example transformation of a given set of day level behavioural vectors into a weekly vector through the utilization of a given statistical method for example arithmetic averaging.

Yet in a further embodiment the arrangement may be configured to utilize in a smart way already calculated behavioural indicators and vectors in producing more complete sets of statistics. For this a feature called vector aggregations may be applied which can process average and extrapolate data from earlier calculated more granular data and generate as an output meaningful statistics with slightly different scope outputting statistics into different time periods or to groups of users instead of an individual user.

Still in a further either supplementary or alternative embodiment a number of measures may be calculated regarding either dynamic behaviour of a given user trend analysis or alternatively differences between any two users of the arrangement which may be implemented with a feature called correlation of behavioural vectors which in essence can output measures that communicate the type and reach of key differences between the studied entities e.g. users or time periods .

In some embodiments the present invention also strives for understanding significant differences and to generate alarms or actions based on those differences. This goal is achieved with a feature called vector triggers which are a set of pre defined configurations which tell in which conditions after correlating any two particular vectors or calculating new behavioural indicator a certain alarm should be generated and passed to either an internal or external module through signalling.

Still according to some embodiments of the present invention the suggested solution may advantageously distinguish between various sources of data related to user behavior. An ontology of incoming data feeds to make a semantic structure out of e.g. separate tables may be formed and possibly stored in separate databases. In the background there lies the logic of archiving data into bigger batches with semantics in place and multi level aggregation procedures and or averaging are preferably applied together with e.g. cluster analysis and or pattern recognition to the incoming data. Multi dimensional behavioral vectors may be calculated for each user which involves also the time dimension for enabling dynamic applications. The vectors can be calculated for a specific period of time like for a week and the vector is multi dimensional in the sense of incorporation of e.g. so called activity measures actions per period of time and or frequency of usage on how many of smaller time periods a certain activity happened out of all time periods included in the calculation of the vector into the same vector. The vectors reflect semantic understanding of user behavior exemplary vectors described including traveling activity movement activity music consumption activity extent of stress and sleeping activity.

The behavioral indicators vectors may be calculated based on the technical routines and scheduling innovations described herein taking into account the nature of data obtained from data sources such as smartphones potentially involving for example significant number of black periods i.e. periods with no data available sporadic synchronization of data and in many cases incomplete and or non standardized data streams possibly in non parametric form with no predefined structures i.e. typical sensor data collected by independent client applications . The vectors can be calculated relative to overlapping time periods the invention proposing an applicable technique to store dynamic vectors without consuming too much storage space. A behavioral vector can be furthermore used to define behavioral classes for each user based on the relative portion of reference users in other words the percentile of the current users within a larger group who obtain lower scores than the user in question in a particular behavioral dimension for example. The vectors of separate users Pearson correlation can also be correlated with each other to derive a metric called similarity index for any pair of users which furthermore serves as a basis of user segmentation models. Advantageously the behavioral vectors can be calculated automatically and dynamically as new information comes available ascertaining that the outputs of the arrangement are reflecting the most recent available information content in optimized form at any particular time. With the triggers that are tied to analysis of standardized vectors significant changes in the behavior can be identified. This disclosure also describes how the suggested solution may be used to increase the intelligence and dynamic performance of mobile advertising.

Preferably the suggested solution may be executed seamlessly all the time and through intense and non standardized data flows at times. For this purpose some embodiments of the invention includes a feature called caching which enables directing incoming data flows through one or more systematic pipelines that ensure that data is processed in the correct order through a structured processing chain and that the parametrization processes can be supported in an optimal way. Caching also facilitates advantageous actions like conversion of non parametric data into parametric data and coordinated and well managed processing where certain actions need to be completed before moving to the next actions and inputted data may need to be organized in specific ways for example temporally sorted.

In some embodiments substantially real time calculation of meaningful behavioral metrics for mission critical purposes like mobile advertising or optimization actions based on real time analytics may be desired which may be achieved via a feature called real time processing which is tied to the functioning of the cache and based on pre defined rules calculates simple indicators like Boolean variables regarding certain behavioral events or counters to reflect the frequency of certain actions.

To separate different kinds of data from each other and to structurally divide data points based on the needs related to the utilization of these data points or based on possible interactions with various aggregation layers so that the calculus load and required time can be optimized an advantageous feature of various embodiments of the present invention called layered data mining with behavioral data may be implemented which manages data flows through a layered model where raw data may be differentiated from more polished data where polishing may refer to modifying filtering and or enriching transactional data in particular dimensions to make it more understandable concise and easier to process during the following steps and polished transactional data may be differentiated from aggregations and statistics which are compressing the relevant information into more concrete numbers and indicators and better reflecting individual behavioral and or technical patterns and facilitating more straight forward utilization of information by either internal or external systems.

In one further either supplementary or alternative embodiment a scalable means to access behavioral data and build customized views or statistics on top of that may be provided. A feature called middle layer tables may be configured to effectively store at least partially aggregated data into a form that is easy to direct to other systems for further aggregations or visualizations.

In one further either supplementary or alternative embodiment one of the associated goals may be to avoid taking a fixed standpoint in the light of data processing or aggregations what kind of statistics are needed in the final outputs and or reports whereupon a feature of further aggregations may be provided to effectively rely on the behavioral indicators arranged into middle layer tables described hereinafter and generate desired kind of statistics to internal or external purposes.

In one further either supplementary or alternative embodiment the goals of ensuring minimum required storage capacity protecting consumers rights and or facilitating speedy processing of data a feature called periodic cleaning may be provided which means that the solution may automatically periodically go through the stored raw and derived data tables and dispose the unneeded data points from the storage all together according to predetermined criteria.

In one further either supplementary or alternative embodiment data processing and storage may be flexibly distributed. The suggested solution may include a feature of managing distributed data mining which effectively keeps track regarding wherefrom a user is coming where his or her data points are stored and if e.g. time stamps affect somehow where the data processing and storage should take place.

Data that is incoming from a wireless device or other data sources may be first stored in a database that is responsible for caching datasets and preparing them for batched processes. At this step data may be also processed for example sorted because e.g. XML processed eXtensible Mark up Language data is not always in a predetermined target form when cached. After caching the data may be firstly archived into raw level database so called sensor database that store all original data and secondly it may be directed to different analysis procedures that typically after processing aggregations and or averaging store data in an optimized form into so called middle layer tables.

The aggregations and other processing actions that are needed prior to storing data into middle layer tables are something that may be triggered based on the amount and nature of data already in the cache storage for example. Middle layer tables may contain data in a more concise and reduced form that can be more quickly analyzed and aggregated further in potentially complex ways. These middle layer tables can be used periodically or in real time to produce so called derived tables which contain readily understandable information and well defined statistics.

The derived tables may be directly used by external applications and they are preferably periodically cleared from old data entries. In this kind of data structure also data that is in a sensor database is periodically cleared to save only data that is meaningful enough and can be potentially needed in further aggregations at some point in the future. The whole structure is designed scalable as individual instances of the bigger database system can be implemented locally for example in different countries. At different levels in physically separate levels of data model different levels of privacy e.g. storing of personal ID information can be guaranteed.

There may be a centralized system that knows which users data is stored into which regional or functional database and therefore the load regarding incoming data can be distributed as well as the load regarding the analysis of data. Similarly the programming interfaces to fetch data may use the centralized pointers to know where to search for the data. In this proposed system the database servers advantageously not only distribute among themselves the storing of data but also processing of data functionality wise. For example derived databases can reside in a different server than the needed middle layer data and servers can coordinate by themselves the data fetching and processing activities. The whole system may be seen as a pipeline of data that follows the logic of e.g. FIFO First In First Out queuing but at the same time applies novel solutions for data processing and partial reducing of storage resolution step by step.

In a further supplementary or alternative embodiment potentially numerous e.g. hundreds of users may be facilitated to query for the calculated data points and statistics by a feature called virtual access which makes an abstraction of the user s behavioral indicators and virtualizes the middle layer tables so that they are easier to access. The virtual access feature may connect multiple network servers together to provide a homogenous user experience for customers who are using the API actively.

According to a further either supplementary or alternative embodiment a semantic data model may be built whereupon the suggested solution could tell about different concepts like sleeping or movements separately preferably attaching important data points like location and time periods to them periodically and forgetting the raw observation data collected. A conversion feature may add semantic information to the data points and enable more natural language oriented semantic queries.

According to one embodiment of the present invention filtering and or exclusion tasks may be performed for the processed data. As large amounts of information can be requested from the provided arrangement by external users it is preferred that there exists a set of filtering and exclusion tasks that are capable of checking for specific things in the data and either drop or manipulate data points so that the output is more structured and meaningful.

The suggested solution may generally define a platform that provides a virtual database interface to external wireless devices or network servers to access real time behavioral and contextual information located in another network server. The platform may not only provide individual data points but also conduct more intelligent complex actions with data to reduce the needed processing time or functional processing requirements complexity at the querying device and is capable of providing semantic meaning for the output data through batched data processing.

According to an embodiment a query language model is proposed for the interface based on which it can either actively the requesting device initiates or passively when e.g. a change occurs fetch information and in practice to deliver prepared answers on a timely basis to the querying device. Instead of or in addition to providing for example the latest location the interface can provide the distance traveled during a predetermined period such as the past 60 minutes or alternatively the location points from e.g. 60 minutes ago and the current location point that can be then processed to calculate the needed information at the querying device .

So called statistical filters may be embedded into the solution so that potentially complex feeds of data can be directed through filters that pre process most of the data sometimes converting it from form to another and performing processes that were programmed for it earlier. This makes it easier to provide a profile based solution for selected analytics so that depending on the queried data points and identification of the data source e.g. a wireless device ID number different kinds of filters and predefined analysis procedures may be executed and standardized vectors provided in return. The platform is suitable for supporting a variety of different physical data sources a variety of applications that need to be served with analytics data may be supported.

In a further either supplementary or alternative embodiment in view of not only understanding user behavior through metrics and time stamped transactions but also of generating higher level descriptors regarding behavioral patterns a feature called abstractions may be provided which effectively combines multi dimensional vectors out of available behavioral vectors e.g. hour level location dynamics . With this feature it is possible to generate vectors that can be characterized as behavioral traces every time with a little bit different parameters but nevertheless describing a certain behavioral pattern. After this kind of aggregation oriented abstractions of data as one should notice that the behavioural vectors are already one kind of abstractions though the user s life is easier to analyze through tools of machine learning and pattern recognition.

In one further embodiment a goal of predicting what people are likely to do next given historical behavior and current context is set. For achieving this goal a model of user behavior is dynamically built including abstractions of behavior as elements thereof with for example. Markov chain kind of dynamics depicted in between elements. As one use case this prediction model may be utilized in dynamically calculating weights and likelihoods of different shifts in the system and practically at any time providing a vector with likelihoods for possible next states of the system.

In some embodiments learning from the arriving data may be realized. A feature called feedback loop may be configured to optionally continuously update the prediction model and calculate a potentially continuous metric depicting how successfully the model s predictions are at any given time. Through certain selected thresholds the performance of the prediction engine can be addressed in real time. The feedback loop enables the prediction engine to be truly self learning

In some embodiments predictions may be given dynamically for example for the purposes of mobile advertising context tied predictive and targeted advertising . For such a purpose a state machine e.g. a Markov model may continuously give predictions for the next state e.g. the next location name of the next person the user calls the music artist he is going to listen next based on dynamic queries and through the calculated performance indicators how likely the model is to be right and external or internal modules that provide the pool of specified ads the system might trigger specific actions like a pop up of a certain ad if the conditions are prospective enough.

In another aspect a method for processing observation data to be performed by an electronic arrangement comprises receiving non parametric multi dimensional spatial and temporal human behavior and or technical observation data such as sensor data obtained from a number of mobile devices such as smartphones parametrizing optionally categorizing and or structuring the received data subjecting the parametrized data in batches to a number of aggregation and or data modeling activities in order to determine from a data batch a number of descriptive higher level behavioural and or technical indicators and providing the number of behavioural and or technical indicators or information derived therefrom to an external entity such as to a mobile marketing entity for selecting personalized ads to one or more mobile users or to a network analyzing or management entity for assessing network performance and or user experience and optionally enable it to further optimize the performance and or the user experience on the basis thereof respectively.

The various considerations presented herein concerning the embodiments of the arrangement may be flexibly applied to the embodiments of the method mutatis mutandis and vice versa as being appreciated by a skilled person.

Further regarding the utility of the present invention the invention is applicable in various use scenarios for example in conjunction with systems where precise digital profiles of users need to be built on e.g. continuous basis and the profiles need to be dynamically linked to one or several actions triggered by emerging characteristics in the data. A number of semantic indicators and profiles may be determined on the basis of the observation data feed with potentially logically and physically separate abstraction levels. Metrics about users life or surrounding technical context may be built in a real time fashion. Behavioural handling of e.g. smartphone based observations and related technical procedures is thus arranged. Accordingly feed content relative to mobile observations may be provided as input and relevant behavioral vectors generated through a combination of e.g. a state machine approach and data clustering approaches as an output.

The suggested solution facilitates e.g. batched processing of chunks of data and eventual removal of historical data which is preferable for sparing the storage capacity. On the other hand new incoming data is ready for analysis quickly and even historical data is available for analysis if desired. A novel technical database solution is therefore provided to support analysis processes and time series analysis being capable of dividing data into distinct layers based on the requirements of handling thereof Also due to technical and legal reasons data storage may be distributed physically across different servers or other entities.

Sensor data may be differentiated from more polished data physically and sustainable automation can be built for producing continuously refreshed insights about the mobile device user s life. A high number of applications may need to use behavioral and contextual data about human behavior. In order to perform meaningful operations with the data the suggested solution is configured to facilitate multiple kinds of data requests to reduce the bandwidth demands to comply with real time requirements to support more intelligent queries that need dynamic data processing at the serving end of the system and to support triggered actions and partial automation of data distribution. Physically separate systems can exchange behavioral information and divide responsibilities in data handling specifically in the case of sensor data collected from wireless devices and being further processed by one or several network servers the data containing multiple types of different data points and aggregate vectors.

Finally reverting to the availability and usability of historical data accumulation of databases of behavioral and contextual data enables building understanding of people s likely actions in other words to build predictive features into commercially available solutions like social networks.

As a practical example of the applicability of the present invention an external web application may be considered automatically reflecting significant events happening in a selected user s life for example by sending an email report to one s friend when he she has visited at least 3 countries during any given 7 days .

One other application may be configured to send automated and targeted advertising to the user of a mobile device based on learning from the user s recent behavior for example sending Metallica record discount coupons to one when he she is nearby a record store which has an active Metallica discount and the likelihood for the one to listen to Metallica during the next 10 days is determined as higher than 2 .

As one more example the present invention may be applied to dictate how different kinds of data should be first of all stored into databases so that they can be cleverly accessed by application programming interfaces located in different layers of abstraction. As a practical embodiment storing of location information that can take multiple forms including cellular tower IDs. WiFi hotspot IDs and GPS fixes is explained hereinafter and the way of abstracting the actual way of storing data points is also disclosed. Based on the descriptions key processes are further explained regarding the recognition of context sensitive and repetitive patterns in user behavior and calculation of statistics that reflect the uniqueness and significance of identified patterns.

Yet as a practical embodiment it is described hereinlater how the obtained data may be processed in multiple batches and how the physically separate sources of information for example the geo coordinates of cellular towers and precise transaction logs of cellular towers may be used in parallel in the processing and modeling processes. Output logs of the user s life patterns including behavioral indicators and relevant aggregated data streams and behavioral or predictive models may be dynamically linked to new incoming data and certain filters and or triggers may be programmed to execute selected actions when one or more predetermined conditions are fulfilled and the prediction engine may calculate the likelihood of something happening.

The associated signaling procedures are further reviewed in this document. The proposed solution is able to match separately defined estimation models and e.g. derived Markov scenarios to real time data feeds making effectively real time guesses about the user s next move. A physical mechanism may be provided to indicate to the prediction engine if the predictions were successful or not.

The expression behavioural indicator refers herein to e.g. numerical or categorical value in the case of one dimension specific indicator or multiple values in the case of multi dimensional behavioural indicator like the average distance moved during a certain day and the average direction of such a movement or as another example a behavioural vector describing e.g. a user s frequency of voice calling and average time spent with voice calling per unit of time which communicate a user s behavioural activity potentially including a possible scale and semantic categorization and or labelling for reflected frequency activity type and or other kinds of metrics of the action.

 Technical is used here with reference to data aggregations indicators and statistics that relate to observed technical context or event instead of behavioural context or event meaning for example parameters measured from the cellular network including signal strengths and type of network being accessed.

 Non parametric refers to data points that do not directly to link to other data points in other words the data is in silos each data entity being from one specific group without a defined relation to any other data point being explicit.

 Parametric refers to data points that link to each other for example a network base station observation includes at the same time also a measurement for the current throughput and signal strength.

An internal module refers to a logical module inside the physical system or device arrangement or other entity that the present invention is depicting.

An external module is correspondingly a module that sits outside of the physical reflection of the realization of the present invention disclosed herein.

An API refers to an application programming interface substantially referring to a preferably programmable framework of pulling or pushing data from to the arrangement in a coordinated way.

 Analytics refers herein to a conduct of decision making based on factual and or quantitative information.

 Observers refer herein to processes capable of generating data items based on e.g. queries and use of the wireless device s operating system capabilities. Observers are functionally and sometimes also physically sensors potentially but not always residing in a wireless device and running continuously which may automatically sense for example changes identified in a cellular base station usage when the device jumps from the coverage of one tower to the next for instance . Observers may also refer to channels of user generated content for example blog entries or written text messages .

 Triggers refer to rules and processes that trigger induce a certain action. In particular they may define how the observations can be more effectively and automatically be done in wireless devices. Triggers can be based on time intervals contextual changes and observations external requests or internal requests e.g. in a situation in which more data is needed for some other data points.

The concept of intelligence is used in this document in referring to a set of rules algorithms databases and or processes that coordinate the overall procedure or individual micro processes for example the triggering logic of the associated entity. Intelligence is something that makes the related system to work smarter in a more optimal way saving energy and improving accuracy for example. It may be based on fixed and or self learning adaptive algorithms as well as on external input.

A server generally refers herein to a node or at least a logical aggregate of several nodes present in and accessible via one or more networks for example the Internet. The server may serve clients e.g. mobile agents running in wireless devices and other entities such as various network services. Clients may thus communicate with one or more centralized servers. Client server architecture is a commonly used topology of building systems in the Internet.

The concept of processing is used in this document to refer to various kinds of actions that may be performed for data either in a static or more dynamic on the fly manner. These include data conversions transformations formulations combinations mash ups enrichment correlations clustering factoring normalizing and or filtering among others. Some forms of processing may be actively used in various embodiments of the present invention including combinations and mash ups linking data points together and building relational data structures for instance conversions generating for example meaningful streams of information entities from raw level unsorted data items such as observed location points enrichment for instance adding metadata and making the data richer than originally and or filtering leaving out data that is not relevant or needed anymore for example .

A smartphone is defined in this document as a wireless device capable of running an operating system facilitating installation of add on applications and enabling a packet data connection to a target network such as the Internet.

An arrangement refers herein to an entity such as an apparatus like a server apparatus or a system of a number of at least functionally interconnected apparatuses.

The expression a plurality of refers herein to any integer starting from two 2 . e.g. two three or four.

In the light of the foregoing and in particular with reference to the general concept of the present invention is described via an embodiment of the network server arrangement wherein the arrangement comprises a data input entity such as log reader for inputting and caching data provided by a number of preferably wireless mobile devices optionally via at least one communications network such as a mobile network or other access network and or the Internet for example a processing entity for processing data a multi layered memory entity for storing data a centralized logic module that coordinates various levels of data analysis aggregation and advantageously hosting of the units for querying and analyzing the data based on triggers and one or more output entities modules for organizing the results of the analysis and .

The input entity may be thus configured to execute a predetermined potentially reconfigurable logic to physically structure data into different data tables and processing entities in a correct order for instance.

The processing entity may be configured to secure scalable receiving and caching of incoming data into batches and comprise or be at least functionally connected to e.g. a filtering module capable of modifying and processing the data incoming data to standardize the data streams going to the internal or connected analysis modules.

The centralized logic entity being also called as an aggregation entity module may be further capable of processing e.g. batches of data and preferably determining a predefined number of indicators describing the batches. It may contain or be at least functionally connected to a prediction entity module capable of preferably continuously finding vectors of patterns and so called vector identifiers and matching this these with incoming real time information and triggering predictions dynamically and or contain or be at least functionally connected to a feedback entity module providing information back to the prediction module to reflect if the predictions were right or not the prediction and feedback modules being described in more detail hereinafter.

Yet the arrangement may include a database management entity capable of storing data using various layers of abstraction and distributing physically the storing of data if required either based on the level of aggregation or alternatively based on other criteria like the segment of the user to be described in more detail hereinafter.

Accordingly various embodiments of the present invention e.g. from the standpoint of the related arrangement may be generally applied to define a common ontology for basically all the stored and processed data which may be achieved with an embodiment of the data structuring feature of the present invention being configured to structure potentially all incoming data based on their content and dynamic attributes like location user identification or time into at least one specific table preferably adding during the procedure categorization information to facilitate easier processing later on. Typical category assortment may include at least one category selected from the group consisting of Application usage data clickstreams Mobile web browsing usage data clickstreams Network performance data Device feature usage data. Device system data e.g. battery status WiFi network performance data. Memory system data Alarm clock data Calendar data Phone book content Message logs and Voice call logs.

One or more entities of the present invention such as the processing entity and or entities included therein or connected thereto may advantageously turn non parametric input data that can be collected using one or several software modules e.g. agents running in wireless mobile devices into a richer more structured and or parametric data on the network side and at the same time conduct procedures for the data that are doable on the fly thereby reducing the load of other modules of the arrangement or external thereto. An entity of the arrangement e.g. processing entity may be assigned a responsibility to process incoming data streams before handing them over to a memory module.

For example any one or more of the following actions may be done in connection with parametrization 1. Adding application categorization s app category and app class to application name s through first mapping any specific application name into a harmonized application ID e.g. all the different localizations of the default web browser will be translated into a unique application ID and then mapping category names app type and class names into the same row 2. Adding information site page category etc. on web domain and 3. Adding location tag to an observation.

In the parametrization process either systematic relations between different tables through location or time proximity or alternatively heuristic procedures including the identification of other common demonitors including for example technical data like network base station cell IDs or WiFi hotspot indices may be advantageously used in combining from separate and non parametric observations much richer parametric data including also parameters potentially acquired outside of the system including for example weather data geographic place names network status information among others.

Meaningful vectors may be calculated continuously so that they reflect the true behaviour of mobile users and a module such as centralized logic aggregation entity and or entities included therein or connected thereto may be configured to produce a rich variety of pre defined statistics e.g. through scripts that process chunks of data in batches and apply advanced statistics techniques processing activities or other scripted actions in generating user level and time stamped statistics periodically.

For example any one or more of the following kinds of behavioural indicators may be calculated based on the data that is collected from mobile devices 1. Average browsing face time in predetermined units such as minutes per predetermined period such as a day per usage 2. Average sleeping time during a predetermined period such as December 2009 for a certain user in hours 3. Average span of daily movements in predetermined units such as km or miles per day per user 4. Average entropy of location dynamics for a certain user for a certain date.

The feasible metrics depend on the applications and needs but typically the metrics are in the form of minutes sessions transactions or other events per unit of time frequency metrics on the other hand communicating about the relative occurrence of events during a defined time period and likelihood measures communicating about the relative propensity for certain things to happen either conditionally to something else or unconditionally in which case the likelihoods may be more static figures in given set of conditions and context such as a period of time. Key metrics are typically meaningful per se and they facilitate all kinds of derives metrics including for example Boolean variables for usage if a certain usage activity threshold is exceeded.

In order to utilize already calculated behavioural indicators and or vectors in producing more complete sets of statistics an embodiment of the arrangement may comprise the aforementioned feature called vector aggregations which can process average and or extrapolate previously calculated more granular data and generate as an output meaningful statistics with slightly different scope determining statistics e.g. relative to different time periods or groups of users instead of an individual user for instance.

Regarding the point above an embodiment of the arrangement in accordance with the present invention may be configured to calculate e.g. daily statistics and derive for example at least any one of the following similar statistics on the basis of the daily statistics Weekly statistics usage activity frequency user penetration Monthly statistics and Annual statistics.

In order to calculate measures regarding either dynamic behaviour of a given user trend analysis or alternatively differences between any two users of the system correlation of behavioural vectors may be determined which may lead to output measures that communicate e.g. the type and or reach of the key differences between the studied entities as mentioned hereinbefore. The differences may be pinpointed through a deduction of normalized vectors from each other. Correlations may be found for example through multi dimensional Pearson correlation coefficients.

To understand differences in user behaviour and or to generate alarms or actions based on the differences vector trigger s may be utilized. The vector triggers are a set of pre defined configurations which describe the conditions in which after correlating any two particular vectors or calculating new behavioural indicator a certain alarm should be generated and optionally passed to either an internal or external module through signalling. In practice this kind of a trigger could be for example a trigger reflecting that a user has woken up is in movement or is about to get some sleep for example.

Indeed with reference to especially disclosing an embodiment of the features particularly related to the calculus of behavioural indicators the data processing entity may be made responsible for first hand data pre processing activities and on the fly conversions whereas the next entity either included in the processing entity or at least functionally connected thereto an entity for structuring parametrizing and or adding semantics may be responsible for dividing data into a number of structured entities such as tables based on their content and attributes being preferably capable of utilizing either internal or external support engine which may include modules like location provisioning or weather API in adding e.g. remotely received and or locally generated parameters to the data including also optional procedures where one or several data points from different data tables may be mixed with other data points to either enrich original data points or to form completely new kinds of data points as a result.

The memory module may be responsible for managing the multi layer data storage and other relevant functions whereas the centralized logic for data aggregations implements an advantageous feature by being able to go through e.g. pre programmed or scripted activities in analyzing the data in batches e.g. at discreet intervals. In data aggregations one or more data points from one or several data entities such as tables may be processed in a batch where e.g. time series averaging and or sum operations can be used in squeezing meaningful statistics out of the transactional time stamped data.

The data aggregations module may comprise or be at least functionally connected to a number of distinct modules as mentioned hereinbefore including vector calculations calculus of statistics and behavioural indicators and outputting of predefined vectors comprising all such outputs vector aggregations averaging and aggregating calculated vectors for e.g. a set of users or for a period of time and vector correlations comparison of any two vectors against each other either automatically or by request.

Finally the afore explained vector triggers may define a number of actions that need to be taken if predetermined correlations output certain specific results.

Reverting to the support engines block an example is provided hereinafter of a module that is capable of enriching raw data as a part of the pre processing actions targeted to the received data.

A location handler module may input raw data including location related information in a variety of forms and return location data in a more standardized way and or format back to any requesting module. In the location handler module locations may be recorded e.g. with latitude and longitude geo coordinates degrees with 4 decimals for instance in specific location variables. A so called master location entity such as a table may be provided where each individual location update is to be stored. In addition there may be an entity such as a table where locations will be aggregated for each user for a given time period for example for a 5 minute period to facilitate easy aggregations and mappings to other tables and preferably to exclude outliers through basic statistical methods.

Regarding location the location handler module may input for example each change of the active base station of the cellular network and additionally input data covering the scans of visible base stations at a given frequency periodic or non periodic data on the scans of WiFi hotspots at a given frequency periodic or non periodic data on GPS fixes at a given frequency and or data from a mobile device s location application programming interfaces.

The location handler advantageously systematically processes each separate piece of location information it receives. For incoming new currently unknown base stations or WiFi hotspot indices the coordinates can be retrieved from internal or external other location handlers which are able to map base stations or hotspot indices to geo coordinates. In addition the location handler may maintain its own databases to map base station indices and WiFi hotspot indices to geo coordinates. The location handler may process practically all incoming data to add tangible location coordinates for each incoming location related observation like radio network level parameters.

If a GPS or precise location coordinate through the API of the mobile device is received the location information for the currently active base station and WiFi hotspot active at that time will be updated in the location handler s internal database.

In addition to raw data these possible location stamps may be collected into a special location table indicating the user in question time and location point and accuracy. In a modest case the location may be updated in the table at each base station scan or change for instance. For the table location names may be added at the same time when creating new entries including for example building place name address area city postal address and or country. Location names may be retrieved from external or internal modules that can return place names in response to geo coordinates for instance.

For base station and WiFi based location lookups there may be also other tables that store the respective coordinates location names so that no additional location name lookups needed for them. For example there may exist a separate indexed table where each base station index is mapped to relevant place names. For GPS based and wireless device API based location lookups the location names may be retrieved in real time from internal external modules.

The location table may be further aggregated into a form where the location is stored for given time periods for example 5 minute periods by using a median or similar function for each time period over all location observations.

As part of the overall data processing various embodiments of the present invention may apply in selected cases so called queuing wherein data points are processed through two more steps in order to facilitate smart mapping or matching of information between any two tables.

As disclosed hereinearlier various embodiments of the present invention may further include converting and or processing non parametric data which is typically easier to collect from various sources in a standardized way to parametric observations and richer information stored into the final tables from which more complex aggregations can be done.

As an example relating especially to location aggregation and parametrization processes the procedure of matching location data into observations may be carried out as follows 1. Several different observation types are received in a bigger chunk covering a predetermined time period for example several e.g. 3 days of human user behavior. 2. After first level polishing the data stream is directed into a 3 step process. a. In the first step preferably substantially all data in a given chunk is sorted chronologically as it cannot be always assumed that the inputted data is in order b. In the second step the data in the chunk is processed row by row and only data points related to locations like GPS fixes base station changes base station scans and WiFi scans are processed and a separate location handler module is used to map all this information into geo coordinates. As a result the output of the location handler module including standardized location stamps instead of individual technical observations is stored into a new table where all location updates are stored. In addition a more standardized location table is created where the average location information is updated for a defined time period for example for every 5 minute period. Statistical methods like median may be used for deriving a sufficiently good approximation of the location for that period. In addition even though there are no location updates relative to a given period the process can generate a location stamp for that missing period conditional on the fact for example that it is can be heuristically determined from the data that the location most likely has not changed during the past 5 minutes or other predetermined period. c. As the third step all other data is directed through in a chronological order and the previously processed location data may be easily mapped to various observations and therefore parametric data can be generated as an output.

As a certain preferred entity of the invention layered data mining to be described in more detail hereinafter is capable of initiating a process where data is aggregated and statistical procedure s are applied to convert it into an output form which is more understandable to external systems than the original transaction level observation data.

Accordingly as a related example it is here explained how the behavioral vectors may be calculated aggregated and correlated regarding human behavior in terms of smartphone usage.

As an input this exemplary embodiment of the present invention receives a batch of data e.g. log rows on smartphone application usage. In the raw observed data each row may describe an activation of a smartphone application in the user interface of the wireless device for instance. Each row may have been already pre processed earlier meaning that a so called mapping ID may have been attached to the raw level original technical names of the application the idea of which is to give a unique identifier for each application entity regardless of the logged raw level name that can for example depend on the language of the user interface of the wireless device. The mapping ID may be additionally enriched with further data table s which maps each unique application identifier into a set of other variables like application type application category application sub category etc.

Based on the mapping process all application rows that do not represent real applications for example different kinds of menus screensavers and or homescreen applications may be removed from the data. As part of the process also outliers are preferably excluded including e.g. exceptionally long application sessions. On the other hand the polished data stream should be cleared of duplicate cases where after polishing there could be two rows with exactly similar names but different time stamps this coming as a result of for example the fact that there was an incidental jump to e.g. a home screen application during an application session from where people immediately returned to the original real application. After exclusion of applications that do not represent real usage there might be two rows in sequence with the same application being present and therefore these rows should be combined together as they represent the same usage session. The pre processed data stream on application usage can for example therefore include a set of rows with unique user ID time stamp and or some kind of application identifier but can include additional information like application categories and so on.

In calculating behavioral vectors out of this kind of specialized and well prepared data the vector calculus engine s is able to get a chunk of these rows from the data aggregation entity .

The entity in charge of the procedure may work so that it obtains as a parameter starting time and ending time and a set of user IDs that it is supposed to be processing. After receiving the raw level data the entity may exclude data that does not fit the parameters of its batch run. Secondly the behavioral indicators may have two key dimensions the first being the reflection and or abstraction that it is supposed to be describing and the second being the time scale the activity of which for example it is supposed to be reflecting. The time scale may be for example a day or a week meaning that the indicator in question will be calculated so that it describes average activity during one day or week respectively during the observed time period.

An aggregation related task that the entity could then execute might include calculating how many distinct days or weeks respectively there was some usage observed for a particular application or device feature for example. This sets the baseline for calculation of frequency related statistics given that the potential time units for usage can be derived in other words how many days there was some data available and the device was physically turned on so that it is easier to calculate statistics that reflect the average behavior per potential day of usage or other activities. As an example it may be that there is a chunk of data received corresponding to a period of one year meaning that the first observed date is the first date of the year and the last observed date is the last date of the year.

However during 4 months in the middle no data was received potentially because the data collection feature was disabled. First a simple aggregation procedure may be executed to determine how many distinct months there was potential usage which in this case will lead into a result of 8 months which then serves as the baseline.

After having aggregated the baseline potential time of usage or activity the process may proceed deeper into calculations. In this particular example the objective was targeted towards acquisition of tangible reflections on the extent of application usage. The raw level application data stream does not obviously tell much about this. Thus there might be multiple kinds of different vectors that better describe the usage of applications and one key design goal may be that these vectors are calculated using minimum number of rounds or batch runs. In this particular example two such vectors are more thoroughly explained said vectors being potentially calculated during the same batch run.

The first vector may indicate application face time which tells about the time people spend in front of a certain application with their mobile phone. The second one may reflect application usage frequency which tells about the relative occurrence of usage. For the purposes of this particular example it is assumed that the sole interest is in day level statistics for application usage activity and month level statistics for application usage frequency but the data itself can cover some other period such as full year for example. For these variables the process first aggregates an output file where for each user for each calendar day the sum of cumulative face time spent during that day with each application is calculated. As a result an aggregated data table will be constructed containing information on each user s each day s applications that were used and about the fact whether it was used meaning basically if the row exists as no row exist for an application if no usage was observed and about the activity of usage meaning how much usage there was in terms of spent face time or number of sessions for example this information activity being stored as variables for each row. This kind of aggregation table therefore reflects across all the applications about both the existence or inexistence of usage and the activity of usage. This kind of table it is also easy to aggregate further.

Next this information may be further aggregated so that ultimately an aggregation file is constructed wherein for each user for the full calendar year for each application there is information regarding the total time spent with the application during that period and total number of distinct days during which the application was used. For this table there is a merge operation conducted which means that information calculated in the beginning regarding the potential number of usage or activity days for that year is brought in. After that operation it can be calculated with a simple division operation that on average how many minutes any particular user spent with a particular application per potential day of usage. With another division operation dividing the distinct number of observed usage days for a particular application by the total number of potential usage days we end up with a frequency vector that at maximum can have value 100 and at minimum 0 and it tells about the relative occurrence likelihood of that application reflecting how repetitive the user s usage is.

As an output these kind of behavioral vectors may be combined together through different averaging procedures or by simply summing up the vectors so that for a certain period like one day week month or year the combined vector tells about the usage activity with one or multiple metrics meaning the number of metrics or behavioral indicators per studied application or other activity together form a multi dimensional meaning the number of different applications or activities. In this kind of combination averaging or summing process more detailed for example daily level vectors are typically processed to come up with a week level average of observed behaviour. It is important to acknowledge that in some cases there is a loss of information in behavioural calculus. For example when calculating a behavioural indicator for a particular week s average time spent with the web browser from this metric it is not possible to derive a frequency measure for the month level figure of frequency of web browser usage as the input data for that kind of calculus requires the data to be on the level of days and at the same knowledge about the potential usage meaning distinct number of usage days for that particular month needs to be known.

The same procedure can be repeated with different kinds of aggregation levels. For example instead of application entities the base entity of the aggregation could be an application category application sub category or something else like from mobile web browsing logs it could the domain the user has visited or from device feature logs it can be any particular device feature of interest.

When behavioral vectors for example on application usage are calculated the resulting vectors may be run through a standard regression analysis with for example timestamp being the key independent variable and with this kind of advanced correlation approach possible time trends can be studied and e.g. average slope for the trend determined.

As another example a standard Pearson correlation coefficient or anything similar can be calculated against e.g. year level behavioral vectors of any two users and the behavioral similarity index can be therefore determined.

As a further example it is here explained how behavioral vectors may be calculated aggregated and correlated regarding modeling of human location dynamics in other words movements.

A chunk of location data may be first obtained identifying typically all possible location updates that could have been derived during pre processing which may combine data from several sources including WiFi hotspot scans and base station scans or GPS fixes and this location information in a form of e.g. a table typically forms a non standardized stream of data. The aggregation entity may first turn this location stream into a bit more standardized form for example it may calculate a table row for each e.g. 5 minute period where the approximate location is calculated from the transaction level data which may be performed through statistical modeling by for example utilizing a median function to end up with the best approximation. This typically also solves the problem of outliers. There can be heuristics attached to this process so that for example if there are missing data for a certain 5 minute time period perhaps because no location updates have been done but with other data tables it is obvious to see that the device was on a location point may be created for that 5 minute period based on the previous 5 minute period s location point to end up with more standardized stream of locations.

Next a behavioral indicator may be derived regarding the user s daily movements for instance. To do this simple clustering may be initiated during which all geo coordinates that are in close proximity according to the used criterion may be grouped into one significant location spot for example. By applying standard network analysis and clustering approaches this can be done effectively and therefore for each 5 minute period for example an index describing a distinct location may be established. After this if the final interest is to end up with daily level behavioral vectors regarding the user s movements an aggregation procedure will follow for each user for each day e.g. 5 and 95 percentile of latitude coordinates and respectively 5 and 95 percentile of longitude coordinates may be calculated followed by a distinct number of place indices for that particular day.

With the percentiles outliers may be excluded and or e.g. a 4 point square be formed to approximate the area where the user has mostly been moving during a day. By now calculating the geographic distance of the two furthest points meaning the length of the diagonal a measure called the sphere of movements reflecting on average the area where the user moved during that day may be established. In addition a behavioral indicator called place entropy may be calculated which simply reflects that in how many distinct places where in this case the user spent at least 5 minutes the user had visited during a particular day. As a result a two dimensional vector may be formed for each day per each user regarding his her location patterns. The dimensions thereof reflect the extent and variety of location dynamics.

These merely exemplary location indicators may be then aggregated further. For example it is possible to form month level averages from those vectors or an aggregate location behavior indicator for a group of people for example. Also through correlations it can be studied whether for example a day of the week is affecting the extent or variety of location dynamics. For this standard analysis of variance tools can be used.

Various embodiments of the present invention are advantageously enabled to separate different kinds of data from each other and to structurally divide data points based on the needs related to the utilization of these data points or based on possible interactions with various aggregation layers so that the calculus load and required time can be optimized. These objectives may be achieved with the aforementioned feature generally called layered data mining with behavioral data by which it is referred to managing data flows through a layered model where raw data is differentiated from more polished data and polished transactional data is differentiated from aggregations and statistics. All together there may be at least the following kinds of layers regarding data processing and storage 

1. Raw level data e.g. transactional observation data received from mobile devices potentially in non parametric form 2. Metrics data e.g. processed filtered polished potentially parametric data 3. Middle layer data e.g. aggregations and or re structured data and 4. Insights data e.g. high level aggregations such as ready make behavioral or technical indicators .

Alternatively e.g. layer 3 may not exist and related data may be included in layers 2 and 4 in some cases according to their nature for instance. For example in calculating a technical indicator for average time spent in 3G networks against all time spent in cellular networks a technical indicator for a certain day may be directly calculated from metrics data instead of doing any aggregations in between. Multi layered chained aggregations are used in cases where such an activity fulfills either or both of two conditions 

1. The aggregation process either simplifies the data or derives a particular kind of aggregated metric or structure of data which better reflects the details or nature of an observed technical or behavioral event 2. The aggregation process leads into a situation where the outputted tables are significantly quicker to access or further process through for example averaging.

A scalable means may be provided to access behavioral data and build customized views or statistics on top thereof. For the purpose a feature called middle layer tables for effectively storing at least partially aggregated data into a form that is easy to cultivate and or process further through statistical or more descriptive methods and or direct e.g. to other systems for further aggregations or visualizations. The data may be stored in SQL based Simple Query Language tables like MySQL for instance but may be preferably easily accessible through SPSS Statistical Package for the Social Sciences or other widely used statistical software tools too. The data may be stored in at least one relational database and the number of relations may increase as more data is analyzed one shall remember that the data are collected in a non parametric way .

Preferably the embodiments of the arrangement are not configured to take a fixed standpoint in the task of data processing or aggregations regarding what kind of statistics are needed in the final reports whereupon there is the aforementioned feature called further aggregations which can effectively rely on the behavioral indicators calculated into middle layer tables and generate practically almost any desired kind of statistics to internal or outsize purposes. Exemplary derived statistics could include 

1. Application stickiness how many are using a particular application or application category daily out of those who use it on a weekly basis i.e. shorter period more frequent users vs. longer period less frequent users type analysis .

2. Mobile web site relative attention figure comparing the absolute amount of time spent on a certain domain versus all spent time with web browsing during a certain period of time 3. Ratio of good sleep vs. bad sleep the ratio of nights less than 6 hours in length vs. all nights that have measured regarding a user .

Some embodiments of the present invention have been designed with an aim to minimize required storage capacity protect consumers rights and or facilitate speedy processing of data whereby a feature called periodic cleaning may be applied. During the procedure the arrangement may advantageously automatically periodically traverse through one or more stored raw and or higher level data tables or other entities and dispose the unneeded data points entities from the storage all together.

Additionally or alternatively data processing and storage can be flexibly distributed in the context of the embodiments of the present invention. For this the aforementioned feature called managing distributed data mining may be utilized to effectively keep track regarding e.g. where a user is coming from where his or her data points are stored and if time stamps affect anyhow where the data processing and storage should take place. The storage of incoming data and its post processing are advantageously following the centralized configurations of the system.

As part of the layered data mining logic one embodiment of the present invention is next described to illustrate the implementation and physical inputs and outputs of such a model.

One reason for layering the data storage and further the aggregation procedures may be due to a fact that such a model can convert practically any number of behavioral observations into a variety of aggregate indicators in an efficient manner. Particularly as the related engine for calculating behavioral vectors may in these cases turn out quite complex the amount of possible queries and statistical operations being potentially very high the layered data mining model makes it possible to proactively pre aggregate various tables so that the final steps of behavioral vector calculus are as efficient to execute as possible and their generation can be even real time in most cases.

In applications where real human behavior is measured continuously but the intended output of the arrangement is required to include a communication action to initiate for example a mobile advertising platform to send a message to the customer the behavioral vector calculus module may not have a practical possibility of executing a calculus operation that would take too much time or cover too many queries and therefore it should be able to leverage already aggregated tables in calculating a high level average figure for the past behavior and a simple measure to reflect if that average behavior is different from the current behavior.

As an example it is herein described how locations may be prepared through a layered data mining model. In the first level data each location update is time stamped and the amount of information is potentially very high. In the next step after first level data processing there is an output file where an approximate smoothed location is written for each 5 minute period using heuristics and other procedure like support engines as specified in this invention. Additionally data is enriched so for example place names building street city country are added to the rows to make a bit more semantic description of the data.

In the next step in the layered location data handling there is a process that can be started at any particular time for example every night which takes as an input a specific range of location data for example a time period between a specific starting and ending date. This is a so called batch process which periodically rather than real time processes data.

In practical applications this process may be designed to run in desired optimal periods for example every 24 hours and it can every day process for example the past 3 days of data. In the light of consequent days overlapping aggregations may be thus purposefully determined. If new data is received from a certain user only on one day but not the day before covering his her past 3 days of behavior it is important that the batch process of said one day is able to fill in the missing gaps and update key aggregations for this user also for the past days not only for said one day. The architecture may be designed so that if there are overlapping data the new aggregations may override the old ones.

In the aggregation engine the periodic process will complete a number of items in sequence 1. It will calculate an aggregated entity such as a table where for each user for each date and for each hour there will be for each entity of aggregations for example city a row calculated indicating how many 5 minute periods or any other time related units the user had spent in that location. 2. It will also calculate a similar entity table using the output aggregations of step 1 to end up with a table where for each user for each date a similar location breakdown will be presented. 3. Finally over the next steps there can be an aggregation procedure that will calculate such information for a very long time for example one year reflecting the user s higher level location patterns precisely. Higher level location patterns might be more interesting in for example studying where the user lives as the randomness and variance of daily life is not restricting the analysis this meaning the fact that in low level data tables there is lots of noise for example thousands of places temporarily visited and also potentially exceptional deviations from normal life patterns taking place like holidays and by aggregating statistics to a longer period of time and by also filtering non significant places it is easier to pinpoint the significant places and the likelihood for temporal deviations in the user s life is much lower to have any impact. In the design of this kind of multi layer data models the output of steps described above are used to form so called aggregation derived or middle layer tables which make further calculations easier. For example based on the outputs of item 1 it is relatively straightforward to calculate for each week for each location entity the most typical median hour which makes it possible to heuristically take a standpoint for example regarding if that is an office location or home location.

Further these kinds of aggregate outputs for example the output table of item 2 may be used in deriving a further aggregation at any time which describes for each weekday the ranking list of locations making it possible to understand weekly patterns in terms of activity and locus of movements and time spending.

In the light of middle layer tables there are all kinds of types for behavioral calculus and or processing which represents as the highest layer in data processing including averaging summing estimation of variance derivation of correlation coefficients measuring entropy and so on. For example procedures where average usage activities like spent face time with web browser maximum monthly usage frequencies for sending multimedia messages average variance of the user s location dynamics in terms of kilometers commuted during a day and an aggregate indicator for the share of time spent in poor signal strength conditions are all outputting variables that are typically calculated for a certain time period and can be directly used in relevant reporting or analysis practices perhaps by doing just one level of averaging or combination but the data itself being on the highest level in terms of information content Based on aggregated tables with simple queries and procedures meaningful statistics may be calculated like average time spent at home for a particular week. From raw level data this would be practically impossible to convert quickly because the data needs to be first aggregated time stamps calculated home locations identified etc. prior to deriving the actual high level metrics or indicators. The aggregate tables and the dynamical load balancing and responsibility division enables for different entities of the aggregation and data mining functionality of the present invention to proceed independently from each other and the outputs of one process for example estimated face times for web browser usage for a certain day may be direct inputs of the other process for example a process of deriving a metric for the variance in the usage times of the web browser across multiple days. Through a batch processing approach where the processed incoming data is e.g. periodically sent through a process during which more meaningful indicators and metrics are derived the most recent data is practically in a minimum possible time for example after each day that day s key statistics are calculated available in an optimal form facilitating complex calculations if needed. In other words the design is capable of separating aggregation work from statistics and behavioral vector calculations to make it more efficient for the system to handle big amounts of data though still being rapid regarding the assumed key requirements of applications like mobile advertising or automatic user profiling solutions.

In a similar fashion multi layered aggregation and calculation engines can be designed for the processing of application usage logs web browser click streams music consumption sleeping data and even audio and video signal observations for instance. As mentioned above the storing functionality may be configured to manage different data layers 1. observer data including e.g. raw level transactions application usage voice calls messages and scans WiFi scans. Bluetooth scans memory file system scans etc. in a basic form 2. metrics data including e.g. polished processed cultivated data outliers excluded meta data added data streams converted into parametric form 3. middle layer data including e.g. lower level aggregations and re organized more structure data with sometimes supporting metrics being enriched and attached and the key information points being prepared for the calculus of final metrics 4. insights data including e.g. key statistics and final aggregation results.

Advantageously the present invention serves potentially e.g. hundreds of customers willing to retrieve data from the provided arrangement at any particular time to access it for example by making a query for the calculated data points and statistics. The aforesaid feature called virtual access may be configured to construct an abstraction of the user s behavioral indicators and virtualize middle layer tables so that they are easier to access. The virtual access feature may connect one or multiple network servers together to provide e.g. a homogenous user experience for customers who are using the provided API actively. The virtualized access may provide that the customer does not need to know how many servers collected the date where the servers are physically located etc. as the arrangement described may provide a homogenized view for entering technical queries into the system.

Various embodiments of the present invention may be advantageously built with support for a semantic data model whereupon the provided arrangement may be enabled to describe concepts like user sleeping or movements separately attaching important data points like location and time periods to them periodically and forgetting e.g. the raw observation data collected. A related conversion feature implemented e.g. in connection with processing entity module may be configured to add semantic information to the data points and enable more natural language oriented semantic requests. Among others these semantic data points could include any one or more of the following 1. Location names NYC. Beijing and descriptors Chinese restaurant golf course 2. Music types e.g. MP3. WAV listened and or genre e.g. heavy rock blues dance classical 3. Information on significant locations like Home and Office .

Preferably the implementation of the present invention ensures that the required filtering and exclusion tasks can be done for the analyzed and or processed data. As large amounts of information may be requested from the provided arrangement by external parties i.e. customers it is desirable that there are a set number of filtering and exclusion tasks that are able to check for predetermined specific things in the data and either drop or manipulate associated data points so that the output is as preferred such as a more structured and meaningful. For example it might be needed that certain statistics should be derived only for certain sets of users or for a certain period of time only.

With the abstractions module that combines a multi dimensional vectors out of available behavioral vectors e.g. hour level location dynamics it is possible to generate vectors that can be characterized as behavioral traces naturally experiencing sometimes lots of variance from unit of time to another but nevertheless describing a certain behavioral pattern as already deliberated hereinearlier. After abstractions a user s life may be easier to analyze through tools of machine learning and or pattern recognition. An exemplary descriptor vector regarding a user could be Woke up in place X Moved from X to Y Met H Moved from Y to Z.

In order to predict what people are likely to do next a model of user behavior i.e. prediction model may be dynamically built which includes abstractions of behavior as elements with for example. Markov chain kind of dynamics between elements. As a further feature the prediction model may be configured to dynamically calculate model weights and or likelihoods of different shifts in the underlying system arrangement and practically at any time provide a vector with likelihoods for possible next states of the system arrangement .

Continuous learning process may be applied to new arriving data. The feedback loop may be configured to update the prediction model and calculate e.g. a continuous metric depicting how successfully the model s predictions are at any given time for instance. Through certain thresholds the performance of the prediction engine can be addressed in real time. The feedback loop may enable the prediction engine to be truly self learning.

Predictions may be provided dynamically for example for the purposes of mobile advertising context tied predictive and targeted advertising or network performance analysis and optional optimization. For the former purpose the associated state machine e.g. a Markov model may be configured to continuously provide predictions for the next state e.g. the next location name of the next person the user calls the music artist he is going to listen next and through the calculated performance indicators how likely the model is to be right and external or internal modules that provide the pool of specified ads the system might trigger specific actions like a pop up of a certain ad if the conditions are prospective enough according to the used criteria.

Reverting to the prediction model it may be utilized for obtaining educated guesses regarding people s likely comings and goings in the short term like during the next minutes or in longer term future meaning during the next week for example. The prediction model may be configured to maintain a relatively large network of states for mobile users. The states can be multi dimensional. For example home sleeping and home in a meeting could represent two two dimensional states across e.g. location and social states that the behavioral data mining engine is outputting.

The prediction engine may be structured so as to be able to easily update the associated model re weight edges arrows and or input data in a standardized way without heavy data processing activities. As an example the prediction engine may be enabled to input behavioral and or technical data in multiple dimensions like location movement meeting status battery status application usage web browsing clickstreams and proximity status where for each dimension categorical or scale variables are used to differentiate between possible states. The prediction model may be then used for creating a multi layered relational database model which is optimized for network oriented data storing and network modeling. Out of this storage the prediction engine may then refreshing so called prediction model s . Prediction models can be for example very specific to location patterns or they can be more complex and multi dimensional including things like location and social activity in the same model through multi dimensional states. However this does not change the basic idea in the prediction model where the model is depicted typically as a Markov state machine or any other relevant model which supports multi dimensional network structures with potentially 2 way vectors describing the relationships.

In the prediction model the links between nodes which describe different states are weighted into both directions they describe the likelihoods for mobile users to move between them given that a movement from the current state will take place. The prediction model is not static so new data may be inputted all the time and each observation contributing to the weight of a given link is also stamped with attributes like time weekday social context battery status and so on. This makes it possible for the arrangement to do two things 1. First of all to give quick high level recommendations regarding if a certain thing is like to take place next versus some other things and through trial and error as there is a feedback loop to the system it may be learned about the key threshold s when it is more likely that the priority one guess is right or not. This model is generically being able to tell about people s likely patterns for the next hours being able to calculate high level probabilities for the person for example to leave point A visit point B and end to point C or D during the next hours. The same can be used in predicting that for example after having a call with wife is the user more likely to start moving or perhaps to start a meeting. This approach is more about static more about profiling the user s context. 2. The other possibility is that the predictions are more dynamic more about predicting short term events. The implementation of the system as described above is of such kind that if the system knows the user s current context the current state and its knows various other important variables like current location time and weekday it can use more sophisticated statistical modeling to get a quick estimate that what would be for example the likelihood given current situation to start moving during the next 5 minutes or what could be the likelihood to turn the mobile device off These more dynamic intelligent predictions are possible as the population of historical data behind a certain observation presenting an observed reflection of the link is multi dimensional and parametric and therefore makes it possible to give more precise answers to concrete questions given enough contextual data is available.

In one embodiment of the invention regarding prediction modeling the arrangement may be capable of calculating for each link or groups of links vectors of links measures like predictability which then reflect not only the user s behavioral profile in other words are his her movement patterns very wild and unpredictable but also serve as input for serving requests and deciding if a certain request can be reliably answered or not.

In the prediction engine there overall arrangement is closely tied to the data base structures and multi dimensional data mining with behavioral data. The prediction model is one outcome of the model but it is tied to the real world through applications like mobile advertising or real time content optimization on mobile web sites or other content providers. Other applications could include for example adaptive services that are capable of proactively alarming you regarding for example traffic jams.

In the weighting and probabilistic modeling of the state machine standard network models and Markov model based machine learning approaches can be used with either 1 2 or further degree Markov models. Time series data and more than the current or previous state can be used as input for any given prediction. In predicting more concrete single events the arrangement may use any known methods even linear and non linear regression methods to fit the existing data estimate the model and to give a suggestion regarding what could be the likely outcomes or for example the estimated time to a certain event given the current and past behavior and or technical status.

In the prediction engine one aspect is the utilization of multiple different layers of data to make best guesses regarding people s likely future behavior for example the likelihood of changing from place A to B during the next 60 minutes and the possibility to tie historical data and associated models with more real time data coming from mobiles and establishing a direct and real time feedback loop with the real world events. The key lies in the multi dimensional state machines where each link or behavioral jump has enough background observations that facilitate more sophisticated predictions. At the same time the model itself as a more statistic entity can give concrete outputs regarding people s behavioral patterns or it can be used to send a very targeted campaign message that is based on a segmentation model. The prediction model is reflecting the past behavior and giving likelihoods regarding what the future could look like given that past behavior.
