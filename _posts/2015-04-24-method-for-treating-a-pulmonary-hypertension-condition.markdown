The present invention relates to methods useful for treating a subject having a pulmonary hypertension condition and for improving clinical outcome in such a subject.

Pulmonary hypertension PH has been previously classified as primary idiopathic or secondary. Recently the World Health Organization WHO has classified pulmonary hypertension into five groups 

Pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH is a serious progressive and life threatening disease of the pulmonary vasculature characterized by profound vasoconstriction and an abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the walls of the pulmonary arteries. Severe constriction of the blood vessels in the lungs leads to very high pulmonary arterial pressures. These high pressures make it difficult for the heart to pump blood through the lungs to be oxygenated. Patients with PAH suffer from extreme shortness of breath as the heart struggles to pump against these high pressures. Patients with PAH typically develop significant increases in pulmonary vascular resistance PVR and sustained elevations in pulmonary artery pressure PAP which ultimately lead to right ventricular failure and death. Patients diagnosed with PAH have a poor prognosis and equally compromised quality of life with a mean life expectancy of 2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis if untreated.

Endothelin 1 ET 1 is the primary member of a family of potent vasoconstrictor peptides which are known to play an essential role in mammalian cardiovascular physiology. ET 1 is synthesized de novo and released from endothelial cells in response to a variety of factors including angiotensin II catecholamines cytokines hypoxia and shear stress. Two receptor subtypes endothelin receptor type A ET and endothelin receptor type B ET mediate the effects of ET 1. In humans the ETreceptor is preferentially expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and is primarily responsible for the vasoconstrictive effects of ET 1. In contrast ETreceptors are found mainly in the vascular endothelium and their activation results in vasodilatation via production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. The ETreceptor is also involved in regulation of circulating concentrations of ET 1 through effects on endothelin converting enzyme ECE 1 expression and the synthesis and reuptake of ET 1 by endothelial cells.

Ambrisentan is a non sulfonamide propanoic acid class endothelin receptor antagonist ERA with high affinity 12 pM for the ETreceptor. Bosentan a non selective sulfonamide class ERA is approved for treatment of PAH in patients with WHO functional class III or IV symptoms. Sitaxsentan is another sulfonamide class ERA that is selective for the ETreceptor. Sitaxsentan is currently under review for market authorization as a PAH therapeutic.

Rubin et al. 2005 1 4 1 8 reported improvement of the mean 6MWD for all patients after 12 weeks of ambrisentan treatment with a mean increase from baseline of 36 meters. The authors reported that similar improvements in 6MWD were observed for patients with WHO Functional Class II and III symptoms indicating that the effects of ambrisentan may not be limited by a ceiling effect in less advanced PAH patients as has been reported for sitaxsentan. Additionally the authors reported that clinically meaningful improvements were also seen in BDI and WHO functional class.

Gali et al. 2005 46 3 529 535 reported results of a randomized dose ranging study examining efficacy and safety of ambrisentan in patients with PAH. The authors reported an increase in exercise capacity in patients with idiopathic PAH as well as in patients with PAH due to other etiologies and for patients in WHO Functional Class II as well as those in WHO Functional Class III.

PAH afflicts approximately 200 000 patients worldwide. Improved drug therapies to treat pulmonary hypertensive disorders such as PAH are needed in the art. Further methods for enhancing the clinical outcome for patients having pulmonary hypertension conditions would be highly desirable.

There is now provided a method for treating a pulmonary hypertension condition in a subject comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject wherein at baseline time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years.

There is further provided a method for providing an improved prognosis for a subject having a pulmonary hypertension condition comprising administering to the subject ambrisentan at a dose and frequency and for a treatment period effective to provide a a reduction of at least about 25 in probability of a clinical worsening event during the treatment period and or b a reduction from baseline of at least about 15 in serum brain natriuretic peptide BNP concentration wherein at baseline time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years.

There is still further provided a method for prolonging life of a subject having a pulmonary hypertension condition comprising administering to the subject ambrisentan at a dose and frequency and for a treatment period effective to increase life expectancy from a time of initiation of treatment by at least about 30 days wherein at baseline time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years.

There is still further provided a method for extending time to clinical worsening in a subject having PAH comprising administering to the subject ambrisentan at a dose and frequency and for a treatment period effective to decrease the probability of a clinical worsening event by at least about 25 wherein at baseline time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years.

There is still further provided a method for treating a pulmonary hypertension condition in a reproductively active male subject the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject wherein fertility of the subject is not substantially compromised.

Any of the above methods is applicable to any pulmonary hypertension condition recognized in the WHO classification including pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH as classified in WHO Group 1.

There is still further provided a method for treating PAH in a subject comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject wherein the PAH is associated with one or more of a a congenital heart defect such as a systemic to pulmonary shunt or Eisenmenger s syndrome b portal hypertension c use of a drug or toxin other than an anorexigen d thyroid disorder e glycogen storage disease f Gaucher disease g hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia h hemoglobinopathy i myeloproliferative disorder j splenectomy k pulmonary veno occlusive disease and or l pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.

There is still further provided a method for treating a pulmonary hypertension condition classified in WHO Groups 2 5 in a subject comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject.

Other embodiments including particular aspects of the embodiments summarized above will be evident from the detailed description that follows.

The present invention is based in part on a finding in placebo controlled clinical trials that ambrisentan is effective for treatment of a pulmonary hypertension condition more specifically pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH in subjects wherein the condition is relatively recently diagnosed. In the above referenced presentation by Rubin 2004 at ATS 2004 subjects treated with ambrisentan were reportedly characterized at baseline by a mean time since diagnosis of 3.2 3.8 years. In the absence of placebo control it is not possible to determine how these subjects might have fared had they not been given the benefit of ambrisentan therapy.

It is noted however that a prediction based on the National Institutes for Health NIH registry is that only 74 of patients having a diagnosis of idiopathic PAH survive for 1 year above referenced presentation by Gali 2005 at ATS 2005 . A cohort of patients that have survived with the disease for a longer period of time may not be representative of patients with more recent diagnosis as that cohort may be inadvertently biased in favor of individuals better able to survive for a prolonged period.

The sooner treatment can begin after diagnosis the better. Accordingly in a first embodiment of the invention a method for treating a pulmonary hypertension condition in a subject comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject wherein at baseline time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years for example not greater than about 1.5 years not greater than about 1 year not greater than about 0.75 year or not greater than about 0.5 year. In one aspect of the first embodiment administration of ambrisentan can begin substantially immediately for example within about one month or within about one week upon diagnosis.

This method does not in any way negate ambrisentan therapy for subjects having a longer history of the condition. However it recognizes that early intervention is advantageous. Benefits of the method to subjects having recent diagnosis and poor prognosis without early intervention as exhibited for example in the NIH registry mentioned above have now been quantified for the first time. Illustratively in the placebo controlled study described in Example 1 below the median number of years for which PAH was present at baseline was 0.38 for subjects receiving placebo 0.43 years for subjects receiving 2.5 mg ambrisentan daily and 0.26 years for subjects receiving 5 mg ambrisentan daily. In the placebo controlled study described in Example 2 below the median number of years for which PAH was present at baseline was 0.54 for subjects receiving placebo 0.33 years for subjects receiving 5 mg ambrisentan daily and 0.60 years for subjects receiving 10 mg ambrisentan daily.

Except where otherwise indicated herein the term baseline herein means a time immediately prior to initiation of treatment with ambrisentan.

The term diagnosis herein means recognition by a physician or clinician of a pulmonary hypertension condition for example PAH in the subject by any means whether or not such diagnosis is confirmed by hemodynamic evaluation. In one aspect of the first embodiment diagnosis is confirmed hemodynamically for example in the case of PAH by presence of one or more more typically two or all three of the following 

In one aspect the pulmonary hypertension condition comprises PAH WHO Group 1 for example idiopathic PAH familial PAH or PAH associated with another disease or condition.

Pulmonary hypertension at baseline can be mild moderate or severe as measured for example by WHO functional class which is a measure of disease severity in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The WHO functional classification is an adaptation of the New York Heart Association NYHA system and is routinely used to qualitatively assess activity tolerance for example in monitoring disease progression and response to treatment Rubin 2004 126 7 10 . Four functional classes are recognized in the WHO system 

In one aspect of the first embodiment the subject at baseline exhibits pulmonary hypertension e.g. PAH of at least WHO Class II for example WHO Class II or Class III.

In another aspect the subject at baseline exhibits mean PAP at rest of at least about 30 mmHg for example at least about 35 at least about 40 at least about 45 or at least about 50 mmHg.

Except where otherwise indicated herein a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan is an amount typically a daily amount administered over the course of a period of treatment sufficient to provide any one or more of the effects mentioned above. Preferably the amount administered does not exceed an amount causing an unacceptable degree of adverse side effects.

What constitutes a therapeutically effective amount can vary depending on the particular pulmonary hypertension condition to be treated the severity of the condition body weight and other parameters of the individual subject and can be readily established without undue experimentation by the physician or clinician based on the disclosure herein. Typically a therapeutically effective amount will be found in the range of about 1 to about 25 mg day for example about 2 to about 15 mg day about 2.5 to about 10 mg day or about 2.5 about 3 about 3.5 about 4 about 4.5 about 5 about 6 about 7 about 8 about 9 or about 10 mg day.

Such an amount can be administered each day for example in individual doses administered once twice or three or more times a day. However dosages stated herein on a per day basis should not be construed to require administration of the daily dose each and every day. For example if the ambrisentan is provided in a suitably slow release form two or more daily dosage amounts can be administered at a lower frequency e.g. as a depot every second day to once a month or even longer. Most typically and conveniently for the patient ambrisentan is administered once a day for example in the morning.

The ambrisentan can be administered for an extended treatment period. Typically the longer the treatment continues the greater and more lasting will be the benefits. Illustratively the treatment period can be at least about one month for example at least about 3 months at least about 6 months or at least about 1 year. In some cases administration can continue for substantially the remainder of the life of the subject.

In this and other embodiments ambrisentan can be administered by any suitable route including oral rectal intranasal intrapulmonary e.g. by inhalation or parenteral e.g. intradermal transdermal subcutaneous intramuscular or intravenous routes. Oral administration is most convenient for the majority of subjects and can occur independently of meal times i.e. with or without food.

The ambrisentan can be administered in monotherapy or in combination therapy as described in greater detail hereinbelow.

In various aspects of the first embodiment the subject experiences during or following the treatment period at least one of

Any suitable measure of exercise capacity can be used a particularly suitable measure is obtained in a 6 minute walk test 6MWT which measures how far the subject can walk in 6 minutes i.e. the 6 minute walk distance 6MWD .

The Borg dyspnea index BDI is a numerical scale for assessing perceived dyspnea breathing discomfort . It measures the degree of breathlessness after completion of the 6 minute walk test 6MWT where a BDI of 0 indicates no breathlessness and 10 indicates maximum breathlessness.

In various aspects of the first embodiment the ambrisentan can be administered in an amount effective to adjust one or more hemodynamic parameters indicative of the pulmonary hypertension condition towards a more normal level. In one such aspect mean PAP is lowered for example by at least about 3 mmHg or at least about 5 mmHg versus baseline. In another such aspect PVR is lowered. In yet another such aspect PCWP or LVEDP is raised.

In various aspects of the first embodiment the ambrisentan can be administered in an amount effective to improve pulmonary function versus baseline. Any measure of pulmonary function can be used illustratively 6MWD is increased or BDI is lowered.

In one such aspect 6MWD is increased from baseline by at least about 10 m for example at least about 20 m or at least about 30 m. In many instances the method of the present embodiment will be found effective to increase 6MWD by as much as 50 m or even more.

In another such aspect BDI illustratively as measured following a 6MWT is lowered from baseline by at least about 0.5 index points. In many instances the method of the present embodiment will be found effective to lower BDI by as much as 1 full index point or even more.

The SF 36 health survey provides a self reporting multi item scale measuring eight health parameters physical functioning role limitations due to physical health problems bodily pain general health vitality energy and fatigue social functioning role limitations due to emotional problems and mental health psychological distress and psychological well being . The survey also provides a physical component summary and a mental component summary. For further detail see for example Ware SF 36 Health Survey Update http www.sf 36.org tools sf36.shtml.

In various aspects of the first embodiment the ambrisentan can be administered in an amount effective to improve quality of life of the subject illustratively as measured by one or more of the health parameters recorded in an SF 36 survey. For example an improvement versus baseline is obtained in at least one of the SF 36 physical health related parameters physical health role physical bodily pain and or general health and or in at least one of the SF 36 mental health related parameters vitality social functioning role emotional and or mental health . Such an improvement can take the form of an increase of at least 1 for example at least 2 or at least 3 points on the scale for any one or more parameters.

The ambrisentan can be administered in monotherapy or in combination therapy with one or more additional drugs for example as described in greater detail hereinbelow.

In a second embodiment of the invention a method is provided for improving the prognosis for a subject having a pulmonary hypertension condition. The method of this embodiment comprises administering to the subject ambrisentan at a dose and frequency and for a treatment period effective to provide a a reduction in probability of a clinical worsening event during the treatment period and or b a reduction from baseline in serum brain natriuretic peptide BNP concentration wherein at baseline time from first diagnosis of the condition in the subject is not greater than about 2 years.

Time from first diagnosis in various aspects of the second embodiment can be for example not greater than about 1.5 years not greater than about 1 year not greater than about 0.75 year or not greater than about 0.5 year. In one aspect of the second embodiment administration of ambrisentan can begin substantially immediately for example within about one month or within about one week upon diagnosis.

In the method of the second embodiment the ambrisentan is administered at a dose and frequency and for a period of treatment sufficient to provide one or both of the effects mentioned above. Preferably the dose administered does not exceed an amount causing an unacceptable degree of adverse side effects. The dose administered can vary depending on the particular pulmonary hypertension condition to be treated the severity of the condition body weight and other parameters of the individual subject and can be readily established without undue experimentation by the physician or clinician based on the disclosure herein.

Typically a suitable daily dose will be found in the range of about 1 to about 25 mg day for example about 2 to about 15 mg day about 2.5 to about 10 mg day or about 2.5 about 3 about 3.5 about 4 about 4.5 about 5 about 6 about 7 about 8 about 9 or about 10 mg day. Such an amount can be administered each day for example in individual doses administered once twice or three or more times a day. However dosages stated herein on a per day basis should not be construed to require administration of the daily dose each and every day. For example if the ambrisentan is provided in a suitably slow release form two or more daily dosage amounts can be administered at a lower frequency e.g. as a depot every second day to once a month or even longer. Most typically and conveniently for the patient ambrisentan is administered once a day for example in the morning.

In the method of the second embodiment the treatment period is long enough for the stated effect to be produced. Typically the longer the treatment continues the greater and more lasting will be the benefits. Illustratively the treatment period can be at least about one month for example at least about 3 months at least about 6 months or at least about 1 year. In some cases administration can continue for substantially the remainder of the life of the subject.

In various aspects of the second embodiment the ambrisentan can be administered in monotherapy or in combination therapy as described in greater detail hereinbelow.

In a particular aspect of the second embodiment the method is effective to provide a reduction of at least about 25 for example at least about 50 at least about 75 or at least about 80 in probability of a clinical worsening event during the treatment period.

Clinical worsening event CWEs include death lung transplantation hospitalization for the pulmonary hypertension condition atrial septostomy initiation of additional pulmonary hypertension therapy or an aggregate thereof. Therefore the present embodiment provides a method effective to provide a reduction of at least about 25 for example at least about 50 at least about 75 or at least about 80 in probability of death lung transplantation hospitalization for pulmonary arterial hypertension atrial septostomy and or initiation of additional pulmonary hypertension therapy during the treatment period.

Time to clinical worsening of the pulmonary hypertension condition is defined as the time from initiation of a ambrisentan treatment regime to the first occurrence of a CWE.

In another particular aspect of the second embodiment the method is effective to provide a reduction from baseline of at least about 15 for example at least about 25 at least about 50 or at least about 75 in BNP concentration.

The pulmonary hypertension condition according to the second embodiment can comprise any one or more of the conditions in the WHO or Venice 2003 classification described above. In one aspect of the second embodiment the condition comprises PAH WHO Group 1 for example idiopathic PAH familial PAH or PAH associated with another disease.

In various aspects of the second embodiment the subject at baseline exhibits PH e.g. PAH of at least WHO Class II for example Class II Class III or Class IV as described above.

In a more particular embodiment the subject at baseline has a resting PAP of at least about 30 mmHg for example at least about 35 mmHg or at least about 40 mmHg.

Variants and illustrative modalities of this method are as set forth for the second embodiment above.

In any of the methods described hereinabove the subject can be male or female. For example ambrisentan can be administered to a female subject according to any of the above methods including the indicated variants and illustrative modalities thereof. Alternatively ambrisentan can be administered to a male subject for example a reproductively active male subject according to any of the above methods including the indicated variants and illustrative modalities thereof.

In a fifth embodiment a method is provided for treating a pulmonary hypertension condition in a reproductively active male subject the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject wherein fertility of the subject is not substantially compromised. Not substantially compromised in the present context means that spermatogenesis is not substantially reduced by the treatment and that no hormonal changes are induced that are indicative of or associated with reduced spermatogenesis. Male fertility can be assessed directly for example by sperm counts from semen samples or indirectly by changes in hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone FSH luteinizing hormone LH inhibin B and testosterone.

In accordance with the fifth embodiment of the invention administration of ambrisentan as described hereinabove including the indicated variants and illustrative modalities of such administration has generated no evidence of an adverse effect on male fertility as directly or indirectly assessed.

In a sixth embodiment a method is provided for treating PAH in a subject comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject wherein the PAH is associated with one or more of a a congenital heart defect b portal hypertension c use of a drug or toxin other than an anorexigen d thyroid disorder e glycogen storage disease f Gaucher disease g hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia h hemoglobinopathy i myeloproliferative disorder j splenectomy k pulmonary veno occlusive disease and or 1 pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Variants and illustrative modalities of this method are as set forth hereinabove.

In a seventh embodiment a method is provided for treating a pulmonary hypertension condition classified in WHO Groups 2 5 in a subject comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of ambrisentan to the subject.

The ambrisentan and the second active drug can be formulated in one dosage form as a fixed dose combination for administration at the same time or in two or more separate dosage forms for administration at the same or different times.

Separate dosage forms can optionally be co packaged for example in a single container or in a plurality of containers within a single outer package or co presented in separate packaging common presentation . As an example of co packaging or common presentation a kit is contemplated comprising in separate containers ambrisentan and at least one drug useful in combination with the ambrisentan. In another example the ambrisentan and the at least one drug useful in combination therapy with the ambrisentan are separately packaged and available for sale independently of one another but are co marketed or co promoted for use according to the invention. The separate dosage forms can also be presented to a patient separately and independently for use according to the invention.

Typically at least the ambrisentan is provided in an orally deliverable formulation for example a formulation adapted for oral delivery of a ambrisentan dose of about 1 to about 600 mg day e.g. about 10 to about 300 mg day. The ambrisentan formulation can be adapted for any suitable frequency of administration but in one embodiment is adapted for once a day oral administration.

In one embodiment at least one of the drugs other than ambrisentan in the combination is provided in an orally deliverable formulation for example each of the drugs can be so provided and each of the drugs can be in a formulation adapted for once a day oral administration. Each of the drugs other than ambrisentan is typically present in the combination in an amount providing an adequate to full dose of the drug. One of skill in the art can readily identify a suitable dose for any particular drug from publicly available information in printed or electronic form for example on the internet.

Any two or more drugs in the combination can optionally be coformulated to provide a fixed dose combination. For example the ambrisentan can be coformulated with any one or more of the other drugs in the combination.

Mention of a particular drug or second active agent in the present specification and claims will be understood except where the context demands otherwise to include pharmaceutically acceptable salts esters prodrugs metabolites racemates and enantiomers of the drug to the extent that such salts esters prodrugs metabolites racemates or enantiomers exist and are therapeutically effective.

The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of ambrisentan on exercise capacity in subjects with PAH. The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate effects of ambrisentan on other clinical measures of PAH as well as safety and tolerability of the study drug.

Study drug was provided in round biconvex oral tablets that were identical in appearance. Three strengths of active study drug containing 1 mg 2.5 mg or 5 mg of ambrisentan were used in this study. All study drug was packaged in blister cards. Subjects were instructed to take study drug once daily q.d. by mouth p.o. in the morning with or without food.

The maximum study duration was up to 14 weeks from the time of initial screening procedures to the final study visit Week 12 . Screening procedures were performed a maximum of 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. The maximum duration of study drug treatment was 12 weeks.

Men and women 18 years of age or older with idiopathic PAH PAH associated with connective tissue disease CTD e.g. mixed CTD CREST syndrome systemic sclerosis scleroderma overlap syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus or PAH associated with anorexigen use or HIV infection were enrolled in this study. Subjects were to have a documented mean PAP 25 mmHg PVR 3 mmHg L min and PCWP or LVEDP

After a 2 week screening period eligible subjects were stratified based on the underlying etiology of PAH idiopathic or non idiopathic and were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups placebo 2.5 mg or 5 mg ambrisentan in a ratio of 1 1 1. One blinded dose reduction was permitted during the 12 week treatment period in the event of study drug intolerance e.g. 5 mg to 2.5 mg 2.5 mg to 1 mg placebo to placebo . Subjects received a daily dose of 1 mg ambrisentan only if they reduced from the 2.5 mg dose group. Subjects were assessed for efficacy and safety at monthly intervals.

Due to the placebo controlled design of this study there was a 1 in 3 chance that a subject did not receive ambrisentan for a period of 12 weeks. Therefore after a minimum treatment period of 4 weeks subjects who met 2 or more of the following predefined early escape criteria may have been removed from the study 

Subjects receiving placebo who were removed from the study due to 2 or more early escape criteria were eligible to enter a long term extension study and receive active treatment with ambrisentan.

Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase ALT aspartate aminotransferase AST alkaline phosphatase gamma glutamyl transpeptidase GGT and total bilirubin were closely monitored in all subjects throughout the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential were required to undergo monthly pregnancy tests and to use a double method of contraception to reduce risk of pregnancy during the course of the study. Male subjects were required to undergo complete semen and hormone analyses to evaluate potential effects of ambrisentan on male fertility.

After completion of the 12 week study subjects were eligible to enroll into the long term extension study.

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in 6MWD evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo.

All adverse effects AEs reported during the course of the study were reported and summaries of all AEs were prepared showing frequencies and percentages of 

Liver function test LFT assessments were separately summarized by severity relative to the upper limit of normal ULN for ALT AST alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin.

For subjects who were on anticoagulants at any point during the study regular visit or between visits coagulation tests prothrombin time PT partial thromboplastin time PTT and international normalized ratio INR were completed. In addition to summary statistics by study visit changes in PT and INR were examined relative to changes in warfarin type anticoagulant dose. These analyses focused on the values at Week 0 and Week 12 and the percentage change from Week 0 to Week 12.

The results of semen samples and their normality or abnormality were assessed by an independent male fertility expert and summarized through frequency counts and percentages by treatment. Descriptive statistics for male hormone data were prepared by treatment for the Week 0 and Week 12 visits when data were collected. Change from Week 0 to Week 12 was determined. The male fertility hormone results were analyzed in combination with the semen sample results by a second independent male fertility expert.

Frequency counts and percentages were used to summarize frequency of normal abnormal but not clinically significant and abnormal and clinically significant electrocardiogram ECG results for each scheduled assessment time by treatment. All ECG data were digitally recorded and analyzed by a central reader. The following variables were analyzed heart rate RR and PR intervals QRS duration QT interval QTcB QTcF and ECG diagnostic variables. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize ECG results by treatment group and by week of ECG assessment.

Descriptive statistics for vital signs were reported for each scheduled assessment time by treatment and for the change from pre dose Week 0 to each subsequent scheduled assessment by treatment.

A test of the null hypothesis of no treatment group difference in change from baseline in 6MWD with 62 subjects per group had approximately 90 power to detect an average placebo adjusted treatment effect of 35 m based on a 2 sample t test and a standard deviation of 55 m.

The intention to treat ITT population was defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. For the ITT population subjects were considered as belonging to their randomized treatment group regardless of the actual treatment received.

The safety population was defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects were considered as belonging to a treatment group according to the highest actual treatment dose received. Any subject who received 5 mg ambrisentan on any day was included in the 5 mg group for safety analyses in the entire study. Any subject who received 2.5 mg ambrisentan on any day and never received 5 mg ambrisentan on any day was included in the 2.5 mg group for safety analyses in the entire study. Otherwise any subject who received only placebo was included in the placebo group for safety analyses in the study.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in 6MWD evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo where the last observation was carried forward. Baseline 6MWD was defined as the mean 6MWD of the last two 6MWTs prior to randomization.

Change from baseline for Weeks 4 8 and 12 in each of the two ambrisentan treatment groups were compared to placebo. The mean change was reported with 2 sided 95 confidence intervals CIs calculated by normal theory. The primary comparison was the change from baseline to Week 12. The Wilcoxon rank sum test stratified by idiopathic and non idiopathic PAH subjects was used for inference. A fixed sequence approach was used to control the type I error rate accounting for the two comparisons. The higher dose was first compared to placebo. Because the p value from the Wilcoxon rank sum test was less than 0.05 for the 5 mg ambrisentan group the difference was considered significant and the lower dose was compared to placebo again at the full 0.05 level.

The two ambrisentan dose groups were also combined and compared to the placebo group. A p value was reported but for descriptive purposes only with no impact on the fixed sequence procedure used for comparing the two individual dose groups to the placebo group.

If both ambrisentan dose groups were superior to placebo for the primary endpoint evaluation of the secondary endpoints was done by combining the subjects from the two dose groups for comparison to the placebo group. However if only the 5 mg group was significant for the primary endpoint evaluation of the secondary endpoints was done only for that dose group. Secondary endpoint analyses were stratified by idiopathic and non idiopathic PAH subjects.

The two most important secondary endpoints time to clinical worsening of PAH and change in WHO functional class were compared to placebo using a weighted version of Hommel s extension of the Simes test with an overall of 0.05. Time to clinical worsening was assigned a weight of 80 while change in WHO functional class received 20 of the weight. These two tests served as a gatekeeper allowing the physical functioning scale of the SF 36 health survey to be tested if at least one of the first two secondary endpoints was significant. Lastly the BDI was tested conditional on a significant result from the test of the SF 36 physical functioning scale.

Analyses of ET 1 cTnT and BNP plasma levels were performed both for change from baseline treatment effect and baseline impact on efficacy. Descriptive statistics were presented for the change from pre dose Week 0 to Week 12 by treatment.

A total of 192 subjects with a mean age of 50.9 years received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the ITT and safety populations. A majority of the subjects enrolled were female 74.5 and Caucasian 84.9 . Approximately half 51.6 of the subjects were residents of western Europe or Israel. The remainder of subjects was evenly distributed throughout eastern Europe 24.0 and South America 24.5 .

The number of years that PAH was present prior to participation in the study was calculated from the date that PAH was diagnosed until the date that informed consent was signed. For subjects who had a diagnosis of PAH confirmed at the screening visit for this study the number of years of PAH present prior to this study was set to zero. The mean number of years that PAH was present prior to participation in this study was similar for the placebo 2.3 4.22 years and 5 mg 2.9 6.10 years groups but longer than that of the 2.5 mg 1.2 1.93 years group. The median number of years that PAH was present was less than 1 year for each treatment group placebo 0.38 years 2.5 mg 0.43 years 5 mg 0.26 years.

Of the subjects enrolled 65 had a diagnosis of idiopathic PAH prior to enrollment and 35 had PAH associated with CTD anorexigen use or HIV infection collectively designated non idiopathic PAH herein idiopathic and non idiopathic PAH subjects were equally distributed between the treatment groups. Nearly all of the subjects had either WHO functional class II 44.8 or class III 51.6 symptoms. The mean standard deviation SD baseline 6MWD for all subjects was 348.4 84.46 m.

In general demographic and baseline characteristics of the subjects participating were well balanced between the treatment groups. There was a difference in baseline 6MWD between subjects with WHO functional class II and WHO class III symptoms for both the placebo and combined ambrisentan groups class II 372.0 m and 379.1 m and class III 330.2 m and 328.2 m respectively.

The most frequently used concomitant medications were furosemide 37.0 acenocoumarol 28.6 and spironolactone 25.0 . There did not appear to be any differences in concomitant medication use across the treatment groups.

The primary efficacy endpoint was statistically significant for both doses of ambrisentan compared to placebo. The placebo adjusted improvement in mean 6MWD at Week 12 was 59.4 m 95 CI 29.6 to 89.3 m p

The key secondary endpoint of time to clinical worsening of PAH demonstrated that ambrisentan combined ambrisentan group significantly delayed the time to clinical worsening of PAH compared to placebo p

The time to clinical worsening of PAH is displayed in as a Kaplan Meier event free curve through Week 12 for each treatment group in the ITT population.

Of the 9 13.8 subjects in the placebo group hospitalized for PAH 5 were hospitalized for right heart failure or worsening right heart failure. Comparatively 5 3.9 subjects receiving ambrisentan were hospitalized for PAH of whom 1 in the 5 mg dose group was hospitalized for worsening right heart failure.

There were a total of 6 deaths reported during this study or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug. In the placebo group 4 6.2 subjects died and 2 3.1 subjects in the 2.5 mg dose group died. No subjects receiving 5 mg ambrisentan died during the 12 week study. Five of the 6 deaths were captured as clinical worsening events 3 4.6 placebo subjects and 2 3.1 subjects receiving 2.5 mg ambrisentan died prior to completion of the 12 week treatment period. The sixth subject who dies was in the placebo group. This subject was hospitalized for clinical worsening of PAH and the date of hospitalization was captured as the date of clinical worsening for this subject. The subject discontinued the study via the early escape procedure and subsequently died.

A statistically significant difference between treatment groups in the change in WHO functional class was not observed at Week 12. However a more than 4 fold greater percentage of subjects in the placebo group 18.5 deteriorated by at least 1 WHO class compared to subjects in the combined ambrisentan group 3.9 .

The percentage of subjects at least maintaining their baseline WHO functional class at Week 12 was 81.5 in the placebo group 95.3 in the 2.5 mg dose group and 96.8 in the 5 mg dose group.

A statistically significant increase was observed for the combined ambrisentan group 3.41 6.96 in the physical functioning scale of the SF 36 health survey compared to placebo 0.20 8.14 p 0.005 . Improvements in the physical functioning scale were also demonstrated for both the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups compared to placebo. Furthermore increases were observed in several other SF 36 scales including role physical general health vitality and role emotional scales.

A statistically significant improvement in BDI was observed at Week 12 for the combined ambrisentan group with a placebo adjusted BDI of 1.1 95 CI 1.8 to 0.4 p 0.019 . Improvements in BDI were observed for both the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups compared to placebo. For subjects in the placebo group mean BDI increased worsened from baseline by 0.82. In contrast in the 2.5 mg and 5 mg ambrisentan dose groups mean BDI decreased improved from baseline 0.20 and 0.36 respectively .

At Week 12 the geometric mean percent change in plasma ET 1 decreased by 4 95 CI 0.68 to 1.36 in the placebo group whereas the geometric mean percent change in plasma ET 1 increased from baseline by 19 95 CI 12 to 61 p 0.193 versus placebo in the 2.5 mg group and by 72 95 CI 32 to 125 p 0.004 versus placebo in the 5 mg group. The change from baseline was substantially greater than placebo for the 5 mg group but not for the 2.5 mg group.

At baseline approximately 90 of plasma cTnT concentrations were below the level of quantification 0.01 ng ml . Changes in cTnT concentrations during the 12 week study were minor and not remarkably different from zero.

At Week 12 the geometric mean percent change plasma BNP increased by 13 95 CI 6 to 36 in the placebo group. In contrast the geometric mean plasma BNP decreased from baseline by 29 95 CI 44 to 9 p 0.002 versus placebo in the 2.5 mg group and by 30 95 CI 47 to 9 p 0.002 versus placebo in the 5 mg group. The decrease from baseline was substantially greater than placebo for the 2.5 mg group and the 5 mg group.

Improvements in 6MWD were observed for both WHO functional class I II and WHO functional class III IV subjects at Week 12. For the class I II subgroup the placebo adjusted 6MWD increase from baseline at Week 12 was 44.1 m and 67.7 m for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups respectively. For the class III IV subgroup the placebo adjusted 6MWD increase from baseline at Week 12 was 17.6 m and 51.8 m for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups respectively.

Improvements in 6MWD at Week 12 were observed in both ambrisentan dose groups for the idiopathic PAH subgroup and in the 5 mg dose group for the non idiopathic PAH subgroup. For the idiopathic PAH subgroup the placebo adjusted 6MWD increase from baseline at Week 12 was 56.3 m and 75.7 m for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups respectively. For the non idiopathic PAH subgroup the placebo adjusted 6MWD change from baseline at Week 12 was 12.6 m and 29.5 m for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups respectively.

Improvements in 6MWD at Week 12 were observed in both ambrisentan dose groups for the female subjects. For female subjects the placebo adjusted 6MWD increase from baseline at Week 12 was 42.5 m and 75.7 m for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups respectively. For male subjects the placebo adjusted 6MWD change from baseline at Week 12 was 6.8 m and 2.7 m for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups respectively.

Improvements in 6MWD at Week 12 were observed in both ambrisentan dose groups for the eastern European and South American populations and in the 5 mg dose group for the western European Israel population. For the eastern European subgroup the placebo adjusted 6MWD increase from baseline at Week 12 was 66.1 and 88.0 m for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups respectively. For the South American subgroup the placebo adjusted 6MWD increase from baseline at Week 12 was 50.5 and 79.5 m for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups respectively. For the western European Israel subgroup the placebo adjusted 6MWD increase from baseline at Week 12 was 3.0 and 39.4 m for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg dose groups respectively.

During this 12 week study 80.0 of the subjects in the placebo group experienced at least 1 AE. Similarly 73.4 of subjects in the 2.5 mg dose group and 73.0 of subjects in the 5 mg dose group experienced at least 1 AE during the study.

Overall more subjects in the placebo group compared to the ambrisentan groups prematurely discontinued from the study due to death SAEs AEs and or the early escape procedure.

In general more AEs were assessed as moderate and severe in the placebo group 43.1 and 18.5 respectively compared to the combined ambrisentan group 26.8 and 7.9 respectively .

None of the 127 subjects who received ambrisentan developed any elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations 3.0 ULN compared to 1 subject in the placebo group and there were no notable mean changes from baseline at Week 12 for serum ALT and AST and no differences between treatment groups. Furthermore there was a notable decrease in mean total bilirubin and mean alkaline phosphatase that appeared to be dose dependent.

Mean uric acid increased at Week 12 in the placebo group 34.1 mol l whereas there was a substantial mean decrease in uric acid 19.1 mol l in the combined ambrisentan group.

The analysis of male fertility hormones in combination with a limited number of subjects n 6 providing serial semen samples did not suggest that ambrisentan was associated with an adverse effect on male reproductive potential.

More specifically changes over baseline in follicle stimulating hormone FSH concentration at Week 12 were small ranging from 0.25 IU liter placebo group to 0.58 IU liter 2.5 mg dose group . Although the baseline FSH concentrations for the placebo and 5 mg dose groups 7.6 8.34 IU liter and 7.6 5.69 IU liter respectively suggest possibility of some spermatogenic dysfunction prior to the first dose of study drug the changes observed during the study were unlikely to be of substantial clinical relevance.

Minor increases in luteinizing hormone LH concentration ranging from 0.16 to 0.58 IU liter were observed in all treatment groups with no apparent difference between groups.

Increases from baseline in mean inhibin B concentration at Week 12 were observed for the placebo group 139.6 95.34 pg ml and the 5 mg dose group 131.2 98.77 pg ml but a decrease was observed in the 2.5 mg dose group 43.2 36.52 pg ml . Therefore changes in inhibin B were not dose dependent. Based on expert opinion none of the mean inhibin B concentrations measured at baseline and Week 12 indicated presence or development of spermatogenic dysfunction.

Subjects in the placebo group had a minor increase 0.66 3.904 nmol l in testosterone concentration over the 12 week study however testosterone concentrations decreased in an apparently dose dependent manner in subjects receiving ambrisentan 2.5 mg 0.09 4.595 nmol l 5 mg 2.61 6.962 nmol l. The data were variable and the median values indicated little change. Furthermore the Week 12 data did not represent a decrease below the lower range of normal 10.41 nmol l .

The ambrisentan treatment benefit observed by the primary and secondary endpoints of this study was robust internally consistent and clinically relevant.

Both doses demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in 6MWD that was associated with a significant decrease in BDI. The improvement in 6MWD was nearly twice as large in the 5 mg dose group compared to the 2.5 mg dose group and improvements in 6MWD were consistently dose responsive for most subgroups evaluated. Furthermore plasma BNP a molecular marker that has been shown to decrease in patients with PAH who demonstrate improvements in 6MWD or hemodynamics was substantially reduced with ambrisentan treatment. Ultimately these symptomatic improvements resulted in a patient s self assessment of an overall better quality of life as measured by statistically significant improvements in several scales of the SF 36 health survey.

In addition to the symptomatic improvements observed for exercise capacity and dyspnea there was a more than 4 fold greater percentage of subjects in the placebo group who deteriorated by at least 1 WHO class compared to subjects in the ambrisentan groups. Furthermore there was a significant decrease in disease progression for subjects receiving ambrisentan compared to placebo as measured by the time to clinical worsening endpoint. This was associated with an 80 decrease in the risk of clinical worsening over the 12 week study for the ambrisentan group compared to placebo. The delay in disease progression was also apparent by the lower number of subjects in the ambrisentan treatment groups compared to placebo for each of the following safety categories death SAEs AEs leading to discontinuation and early escapes. Finally the most frequent AE observed in this study was right ventricular failure an indicator of disease progression which was reported in more than 3 times the percentage of subjects in the placebo group compared to the combined ambrisentan treatment group.

In general ambrisentan was well tolerated as demonstrated by the lack of dose reduction and AEs leading to discontinuation. The most frequent AEs of clinical concern observed for subjects receiving ambrisentan were headache and palpitations. For the most part these events were mild in severity and did not lead to study discontinuation. Peripheral edema which has been reported frequently with other ERAs was observed at a similar or lower frequency in the ambrisentan groups compared to placebo. None of the 127 subjects that received ambrisentan developed elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations 3 ULN and there were no increases in mean ALT or AST concentrations for either ambrisentan dose group. Furthermore there appeared to be a dose dependent decrease in mean total bilirubin and mean alkaline phosphatase. Decreases in hemoglobin concentration were observed early in the study and did not decrease further with continued treatment.

In conclusion the treatment benefits observed for the primary and secondary endpoints of this study were robust internally consistent and clinically relevant. Ambrisentan was well tolerated was associated with a manageable safety profile and delayed disease progression indicating a positive risk to benefit profile.

The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of ambrisentan on exercise capacity in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension PAH . The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate effects of ambrisentan on other clinical measures of PAH as well as safety and tolerability of the study drug.

Study drug was provided in round biconvex oral tablets that were identical in appearance. Three strengths of active study drug containing 2.5 mg 5 mg or 10 mg of ambrisentan were used in this study. All study drug was packaged in blister cards. Subjects were instructed to take study drug once daily q.d. by mouth p.o. in the morning with or without food.

The maximum study duration was up to 14 weeks from the time of initial screening procedures to the final study visit Week 12 . Screening procedures were performed a maximum of 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. The maximum duration of study drug treatment was 12 weeks.

Men and women 18 years of age or older with idiopathic PAH PAH associated with CTD e.g. mixed CTD CREST syndrome systemic sclerosis scleroderma overlap syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus or PAH associated with anorexigen use or HIV infection were enrolled in this study. Subjects were to have a documented mean PAP 25 mmHg PVR 3 mmHgL min and PCWP or LVEDP

After a 2 week screening period eligible subjects were stratified based on the underlying etiology of PAH idiopathic or non idiopathic and were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups placebo 5 mg or 10 mg ambrisentan in a ratio of 1 1 1. One blinded dose reduction was permitted during the 12 week treatment period in the event of study drug intolerance e.g. 10 mg to 5 mg 5 mg to 2.5 mg placebo to placebo . Subjects received a daily dose of 2.5 mg ambrisentan only if they reduced from the 5 mg dose group. Subjects were assessed for efficacy and safety at monthly intervals.

Due to the placebo controlled design of this study there was a 1 in 3 chance that a subject did not receive ambrisentan for a period of 12 weeks. Therefore after a minimum treatment period of 4 weeks subjects who met 2 or more of the following predefined early escape criteria may have been removed from the study 

Subjects receiving placebo who were removed from the study due to 2 or more early escape criteria were eligible to enter a long term extension study and receive active treatment with ambrisentan.

Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase ALT aspartate aminotransferase AST alkaline phosphatase gamma glutamyl transpeptidase GGT and total bilirubin were closely monitored in all subjects throughout the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential were required to undergo monthly pregnancy tests and to use a double method of contraception to reduce risk of pregnancy during the course of the study. Male subjects were required to undergo complete semen and hormone analyses to evaluate potential effects of ambrisentan on male fertility.

After completion of the 12 week study subjects were eligible to enroll into the long term extension study.

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in 6MWD evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo.

All adverse effects AEs reported during the course of the study were reported and summaries of all AEs were prepared showing frequencies and percentages of 

Liver function test LFT assessments were separately summarized by severity relative to the upper limit of normal ULN for ALT AST alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin.

For subjects who were on anticoagulants at any point during the study regular visit or between visits coagulation tests PT PTT and INR were completed. In addition to summary statistics by study visit changes in PT and INR were examined relative to changes in warfarin type anticoagulant dose. These analyses focused on the values at Week 0 and Week 12 and the percentage change from Week 0 to Week 12.

The results of semen samples and their normality or abnormality were assessed by an independent male fertility expert and summarized through frequency counts and percentages by treatment. Descriptive statistics for male hormone data were prepared by treatment for the Week 0 and Week 12 visits when data were collected. Change from Week 0 to Week 12 was determined. The male fertility hormone results were analyzed in combination with the semen sample results by a second independent male fertility expert.

Frequency counts and percentages were used to summarize frequency of normal abnormal but not clinically significant and abnormal and clinically significant ECG results for each scheduled assessment time by treatment. All ECG data were digitally recorded and analyzed by a central reader. The following variables were analyzed heart rate RR and PR intervals QRS duration QT interval QTcB QTcF and ECG diagnostic variables. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize ECG results by treatment group and by week of ECG assessment.

Descriptive statistics for vital signs were reported for each scheduled assessment time by treatment and for the change from pre dose Week 0 to each subsequent scheduled assessment by treatment.

A test of the null hypothesis of no treatment group difference in change from baseline in 6MWD with 62 subjects per group had approximately 90 power to detect an average placebo adjusted treatment effect of 35 m based on a 2 sample t test and a standard deviation of 55 m.

The intention to treat ITT population was defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. For the ITT population subjects were considered as belonging to their randomized treatment group regardless of the actual treatment received.

The safety population was defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects were considered as belonging to a treatment group according to the highest actual treatment dose received. Any subject who received 10 mg ambrisentan on any day was included in the 10 mg group for safety analyses in the entire study. Any subject who received 5 mg ambrisentan on any day and never received 10 mg ambrisentan on any day was included in the 5 mg group for safety analyses in the entire study. Otherwise any subject who received only placebo was included in the placebo group for safety analyses in the study.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in 6MWD evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo where the last observation was carried forward. Baseline 6MWD was defined as the mean 6MWD of the last two 6MWTs prior to randomization.

Change from baseline for Weeks 4 8 and 12 in each of the two ambrisentan treatment groups were compared to placebo. The mean change was reported with 2 sided 95 confidence intervals CIs calculated by normal theory. The primary comparison was the change from baseline to Week 12. The Wilcoxon rank sum test stratified by idiopathic and non idiopathic PAH subjects was used for inference. A fixed sequence approach was used to control the type I error rate accounting for the two comparisons. The higher dose was first compared to placebo. Because the p value from the Wilcoxon rank sum test was less than 0.05 for the 5 mg ambrisentan group the difference was considered significant and the lower dose was compared to placebo again at the full 0.05 level.

The two ambrisentan dose groups were also combined and compared to the placebo group. A p value was reported but for descriptive purposes only with no impact on the fixed sequence procedure used for comparing the two individual dose groups to the placebo group.

If both ambrisentan dose groups were superior to placebo for the primary endpoint evaluation of the secondary endpoints was done by combining the subjects from the two dose groups for comparison to the placebo group. However if only the 10 mg group was significant for the primary endpoint evaluation of the secondary endpoints was done only for that dose group. Secondary endpoint analyses were stratified by idiopathic and non idiopathic PAH subjects.

The two most important secondary endpoints time to clinical worsening of PAH and change in WHO functional class were compared to placebo using a weighted version of Hommel s extension of the Simes test with an overall of 0.05. Time to clinical worsening was assigned a weight of 80 while change in WHO functional class received 20 of the weight. These two tests served as a parallel gatekeeper allowing the physical functioning scale of the SF 36 health survey to be tested if at least one of the first two secondary endpoints was significant. Lastly the BDI was tested conditional on a significant result from the test of the SF 36 physical functioning scale.

Additional measures of interest included change from baseline measured after 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo in ET 1 BNP and cTnT.

A total of 201 subjects with a mean age of 50.1 years received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the ITT and safety populations. A majority of the subjects enrolled were female 83.6 and Caucasian 69.2 . More than two thirds 68.7 of the subjects were residents of the U.S. the others were distributed in Central and South America 20.9 and the rest of the world 10.4 in Australia Austria Hungary and Italy .

The number of years that PAH was present prior to participation in the study was calculated from the date that PAH was diagnosed until the date that informed consent was signed. For subjects who had a diagnosis of PAH confirmed at the screening visit for this study the number of years of PAH present prior to this study was set to zero. The mean number of years that PAH was present prior to participation in this study was slightly longer for the placebo 2.14 3.63 years than for the 5 mg 1.86 4.36 years and 10 mg 1.40 2.39 years groups. The median number of years that PAH was present was less than 1 year for each treatment group placebo 0.54 years 5 mg 0.33 years 10 mg 0.60 years.

Of the subjects enrolled 63 had a diagnosis of idiopathic PAH prior to enrollment and 37 had PAH associated with CTD anorexigen use or HIV infection idiopathic and non idiopathic PAH subjects were equally distributed between the treatment groups. Nearly all of the subjects had either WHO functional class II 32.3 or class III 58.2 symptoms at baseline only a small percentage of subjects had WHO class I 2.5 or IV 7.0 symptoms at baseline. The mean standard deviation SD baseline 6MWD for all subjects was 341.0 75.80 m and the mean baseline BDI was 3.8 2.02.

In general demographic and baseline characteristics of the subjects participating were well balanced between the treatment groups. However there were more class IV subjects in the 5 mg 9.0 and 10 mg 10.4 dose groups than in the placebo group 1.5 . There was also a difference in baseline 6MWD between WHO class I II and WHO class III IV subjects for both the placebo and combined ambrisentan groups class I II 377.5 m and 372.0 m and class III IV 320.6 m and 324.6 m respectively.

The most frequently used concomitant medications were furosemide 47.3 warfarin sodium 36.8 and oxygen 26.4 . Minor differences were observed between dose groups in the use of concomitant medications.

The primary efficacy endpoint was statistically significant for both doses of ambrisentan compared to placebo. The placebo adjusted improvement in mean 6MWD at Week 12 was 51.4 m 95 CI 26.6 to 76.2 p

The secondary endpoint of time to clinical worsening of PAH demonstrated that ambrisentan combined ambrisentan group did not significantly delay the time to clinical worsening of PAH compared to placebo. However twice as many subjects in the placebo group n 6 had an event of clinical worsening compared to each of the ambrisentan dose groups 3 subjects each in the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups . Furthermore the hazard ratio showed a 50 reduction in the probability of clinical worsening occurring at any given time for a subject receiving ambrisentan when compared to placebo.

The time to clinical worsening of PAH is displayed in as a Kaplan Meier event free curve through Week 12 for each treatment group in the ITT population. The Kaplan Meier curve decreases sharply in the 10 mg dose group after 12 weeks due to a single event that occurred after most subjects had completed the study.

Of the 2 3.0 subjects in the placebo group hospitalized for PAH 1 was hospitalized for right heart failure and 1 for right ventricular failure. Comparatively 4 3.0 subjects receiving ambrisentan were hospitalized for PAH of whom 2 1 each in the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups were hospitalized for worsening right heart failure and the other 2 for increased shortness of breath with increased peripheral edema 5 mg and worsening PAH with severe peripheral edema 10 mg .

There were a total of 4 deaths reported during this study or within 30 days of the last dose of study drug. In the placebo group 2 3.0 subjects died and 1 1.5 subject each in the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups died. All 4 deaths were captured as clinical worsening events.

The combined ambrisentan group demonstrated a clinically relevant improvement in WHO functional class at Week 12 compared to placebo p 0.036 similar trends were observed for each ambrisentan treatment group. Due to the multiple comparisons procedure a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo could not be stated for this secondary endpoint. However a more than 5 fold greater percentage of subjects in the placebo group 16.4 deteriorated by at least 1 WHO class compared to subjects in the combined ambrisentan group 3.0 . In addition a 3 fold greater percentage of subjects in the combined ambrisentan group 4.5 had an improvement of 2 WHO classes compared to subjects in the placebo group 1.5 .

The percentage of subjects at least maintaining their baseline WHO functional class at Week 12 was 83.6 in the placebo group 98.5 in the 5 mg dose group and 95.5 in the 10 mg dose group.

An increase in the physical function scale of the SF 36 Health Survey was observed in the combined ambrisentan group at Week 12 4.10 8.39 however this increase was not significantly different from placebo 2.31 7.65 . For most of the SF 36 scales there was a general trend of greater increases for the 10 mg group compared to the 5 mg and placebo groups.

A clinically relevant improvement in BDI was observed at Week 12 for the combined ambrisentan group with a placebo adjusted BDI of 0.6 95 CI 1.2 to 0.0 p 0.017 . Dose dependent improvements in BDI were also observed for both the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups compared to placebo. Due to the multiple comparisons procedure a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo could not be stated for this secondary endpoint.

At Week 12 the geometric mean percent change in plasma ET 1 increased by 34 95 CI 11 to 63 in the placebo group. The geometric mean percent change in plasma ET 1 increased from baseline by 96 95 CI 53 to 151 p 0.019 versus placebo in the 5 mg group and by 48 95 CI 19 to 84 p 0.169 versus placebo in the 10 mg group. The change from baseline was substantially greater than placebo for the 5 mg group but not for the 10 mg group.

At baseline approximately 90 of plasma cTnT concentrations were below the level of quantification 0.01 ng ml . Changes in cTnT concentrations during the 12 week study were minor and not remarkably different from zero.

At Week 12 the geometric mean percent change in plasma BNP increased by 9 95 CI 16 to 41 in the placebo group. In contrast the geometric mean percent change in plasma BNP decreased from baseline by 30 95 CI 43 to 14 p 0.002 versus placebo in the 5 mg group and by 45 95 CI 57 to 29 p

Improvements in 6MWD were observed for both WHO functional class I III and class III IV subjects at Week 12 however a slightly greater improvement was observed for class III IV subjects. For the class I II subgroup the placebo adjusted 6MWD increase from baseline at Week 12 was 25.6 m and 42.0 m for the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups respectively. For the class III IV subgroup the placebo adjusted 6MWD increase from baseline at Week 12 was 34.1 m and 56.9 m for the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups respectively.

Improvements in 6MWD at Week 12 were observed in both ambrisentan dose groups for the idiopathic PAH subgroup and in the 10 mg group for the non idiopathic PAH subgroup. There was greater improvement observed in subjects with idiopathic PAH than in subjects with non idiopathic PAH. For the idiopathic PAH subgroup the placebo adjusted 6MWD increased from baseline at Week 12 by 42.9 m and 56.9 m for the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups respectively. For the non idiopathic PAH subgroup the placebo adjusted 6MWD increase from baseline at Week 12 was 10.2 m and 43.0 m for the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups respectively.

Improvements in 6MWD at Week 12 were observed in both ambrisentan dose groups for female subjects. The placebo adjusted 6MWD increased from baseline at Week 12 by 30.9 m and 57.7 m for the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups respectively. For male subjects the placebo adjusted 6MWD increase from baseline at Week 12 was 19.9 m and 13.1 m for the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups respectively.

Subjects not receiving calcium channel blockers CCBs during the study demonstrated an improvement in 6MWD at Week 12 compared to placebo after receiving ambrisentan with a placebo adjusted increase from baseline of 38.7 m and 67.9 m for the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups respectively. Subjects receiving CCBs during the study also had an improvement in 6MWD compared to placebo after receiving ambrisentan with a placebo adjusted increase from baseline of 15.1 m and 19.6 m for the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups respectively.

Subjects not receiving supplemental oxygen demonstrated an improvement in 6MWD at Week 12 compared to placebo that was similar to the overall study population. Subjects in the placebo group who received supplemental oxygen during the study had a decrease 25.5 m from baseline in mean 6MWD at Week 12 whereas subjects in the 5 mg 21.1 m and 10 mg 48.0 m groups had notable increases from baseline in mean 6MWD.

During this 12 week study 83.5 of the subjects in the placebo group experienced at least 1 AE. Similarly 83.6 of subjects in the 5 mg dose group and 79.1 of subjects in the 10 mg dose group experienced at least 1 AE during the study.

Overall more subjects in the placebo group compared to the ambrisentan groups prematurely discontinued from the study due to death SAEs AEs and or the early escape procedure. A greater percentage of subjects in the placebo group 6.0 met the criteria for early escape compared to subjects in the combined ambrisentan group 1.5 .

In general a similar percentage of AEs were assessed as severe in the placebo and 10 mg groups 19.4 and 17.9 respectively whereas a lower percentage of AEs were assessed as severe in the 5 mg group 6.0 . A similar percentage of AEs were assessed as moderate in the placebo and 10 mg groups 38.8 and 37.3 respectively whereas a higher percentage of AEs were assessed as moderate in the 5 mg group 50.7 . The most frequent AE in the combined ambrisentan group was peripheral edema and most events were assessed as mild or moderate.

None of the 134 subjects who received ambrisentan developed any elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations 3 ULN compared to 2 subjects in the placebo group. Further there were no notable mean changes from baseline at Week 12 for serum ALT and AST and no differences between treatment groups.

The changes in total bilirubin at Week 12 were shown to be substantially decreased in the 10 mg and combined ambrisentan groups compared to placebo. The changes in alkaline phosphatase at Week 12 were shown to be substantially decreased in the 5 mg 10 mg and combined ambrisentan groups compared to placebo.

Mean decreases in hemoglobin concentration were observed at Week 12 for both ambrisentan dose groups compared to placebo placebo 0.15 g dl 5 mg 0.83 g dl 10 mg 0.93 g dl . The decreases were observed early Week 4 in the study and did not decrease further with continued treatment.

Mean uric acid decreased slightly over the 12 week study in the placebo group 6.5 mol liter whereas a substantial decrease was observed for the 5 mg 21.5 mol liter and 10 mg 53.3 mol liter groups that appeared to be dose dependent.

The analysis of male fertility hormones in combination with a limited number of subjects n 12 providing serial semen samples did not suggest that ambrisentan was associated with an adverse effect on male reproductive potential.

More specifically changes over baseline in follicle stimulating hormone FSH concentration at Week 12 were small ranging from 0.52 IU liter placebo group to 1.83 IU liter 10 mg dose group . Although the FSH concentrations at Week 12 for the placebo and 5 mg dose groups 8.14 2.49 IU liter and 9.23 7.21 IU liter respectively suggest possibility of some spermatogenic dysfunction the changes observed during the study were unlikely to be of substantial clinical relevance.

Changes in luteinizing hormone LH concentration at Week 12 were small placebo 0.07 4.72 IU liter 5 mg 0.15 2.21 IU liter 10 mg 1.28 10.63 IU liter.

Changes from baseline in mean inhibin B concentration at Week 12 were similar across treatment groups placebo 13.2 73.55 pg ml 5 mg 4.5 28.00 pg ml 10 mg 7.6 50.97 pg ml. Based on expert opinion none of the mean inhibin B concentrations measured at baseline and Week 12 indicated presence or development of spermatogenic dysfunction.

Changes from baseline in testosterone concentration at Week 12 were 2.825 7.20 nmol l for the placebo group 0.099 3.48 for the 5 mg dose group and 0.099 3.48 for the 10 mg dose group. Based on expert opinion these data suggest that ambrisentan did not cause a negative effect on testosterone concentration in this study population.

This study demonstrated that both the 5 mg and 10 mg dose of ambrisentan administered once daily provided statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in exercise capacity and symptoms in subjects with PAH. The improvements in 6MWD were evident within 4 weeks and appeared dose dependent by Week 8. At Week 12 the increase in 6MWD was nearly twice as large in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. Improvements in 6MWD were observed in most subgroups and in general appeared to be dose dependent. Clinically relevant improvements in 6MWD were observed in subjects with WHO functional class I II and class III IV symptoms. Both doses also demonstrated clinically relevant treatment benefits for several secondary endpoints including WHO functional class and BDI as well as a notable reduction in plasma BNP.

Ambrisentan was well tolerated as indicated by the lack of dose reduction and AEs leading to premature discontinuation as well as more subjects in the placebo group discontinued due to death SAEs AEs early escape right heart failure and or worsening PAH. The most clinically important AEs observed in this study were peripheral edema headache and nasal congestion. For the most part these events were mild in severity and none led to study discontinuation. Serum aminotransferase abnormalities which have been observed and treatment limiting for other ERAs were not observed in any subjects receiving ambrisentan. Furthermore there were no increases in mean ALT and AST and there were notable decreases in mean total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase in subjects receiving ambrisentan. Decreases in hemoglobin concentration were observed early in the study and did not decrease further with continued treatment.

In conclusion the treatment benefits observed for the primary and secondary endpoints of this study were robust internally consistent and clinically relevant. Ambrisentan was well tolerated and was associated with a manageable safety profile indicating a positive risk to benefit profile.

The trials described in Examples 1 and 2 enrolled subjects from a population having PAH including idiopathic PAH and PAH associated with CTD anorexigen use or HIV infection. Patients with pulmonary hypertension due to other etiologies were generally excluded. However the efficacy and safety of ambrisentan observed in this classic PAH population and the need for effective therapy in pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions merits evaluation in these non traditional groups. Therefore a further study is conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy of ambrisentan in both classic PAH patients WHO Group 1 and in an expanded pulmonary hypertension patient population WHO Groups 3 and 4 .

This expanded population includes subjects having idiopathic and familial PAH PAH associated with collagen vascular disease congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts HIV infection drugs and toxins thyroid disorders glycogen storage disease Gaucher disease and splenectomy pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD interstitial lung disease ILD sleep disordered breathing and alveolar hypoventilation disorders and pulmonary hypertension due to thromboembolic obstruction of proximal and or distal pulmonary arteries. Four groups are of particular interest in this study 

Subjects having pulmonary hypertension associated with ILD or COPD must demonstrate a degree of pulmonary hypertension that is disproportionate to the severity of the underlying disease. Subjects with ILD must have total lung capacity 60 of predicted normal mean PAP 35 mmHg and PVR 3.5 mmHg l min 280 dyne sec cm . Subjects with COPD must have forced expiratory volume in 1 second 50 of predicted normal mean PAP 35 mmHg and PVR 3.5 mmHg l min 280 dyne sec cm .

The study is designed to evaluate improvements compared to baseline for the overall study population and for key subgroups of interest. The study also examines safety and tolerability of ambrisentan in a broad population of subjects with pulmonary hypertension.

The target population includes men and women 18 years or older with pulmonary hypertension as defined by the WHO clinical classification. Subjects must have a documented history of pulmonary hypertension and be able to walk at least 150 450 meters in a 6MWT.

Subjects who have discontinued bosentan or sitaxsentan therapy due to aminotransferase abnormalities or lack of efficacy are eligible for this study. Subjects currently receiving chronic prostanoid therapy and or an oral PDE 5 inhibitor are also eligible for this study.

All hemodynamic data represent resting pressures and must be assessed no more than 1 year 52 weeks prior to the screening visit. All pulmonary function tests must be assessed no more than 3 months 12 weeks prior to the screening visit.

Certain etiology subgroups are of particular interest. Therefore this study enrolls a minimum of 18 subjects in the following etiology subgroups 

This study also enrolls a minimum of 30 PAH WHO Group 1 subjects receiving concomitant sildenafil therapy at baseline.

Enrollment continues up to a maximum of 200 subjects until the enrollment goals for each of the etiology subgroups as well as the sildenafil subgroup have been met.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate effect of ambrisentan on exercise capacity in a broad population of subjects with pulmonary hypertension. Secondary objectives are to evaluate effects of ambrisentan on other clinical measures of pulmonary hypertension long term treatment success and survival. In addition safety and tolerability of ambrisentan will be evaluated. Efficacy and safety will be evaluated in the overall study population and in various subgroups.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that patients with non classical pulmonary hypertension may respond more slowly to therapy than the classical PAH population therefore the primary analysis of efficacy is evaluated after 24 weeks of treatment. Eligible subjects receive 5 mg ambrisentan once daily for the first 24 weeks. One dose reduction is permitted during the 24 week fixed dose treatment period if a subject is not tolerating study drug e.g. 5 mg to 2.5 mg . After the initial 24 week treatment period investigators are allowed to adjust study drug dose as clinically indicated available doses are 2.5 mg 5 mg and 10 mg .

Subjects are monitored with clinical laboratory tests every 4 weeks throughout the study. These safety laboratory tests may be performed at a local phlebotomy laboratory or at the investigator clinic. In addition the investigator assesses each subject for safety and efficacy at Week 4 Week 12 and Week 24. Following Week 24 subjects are assessed for safety and efficacy every 24 weeks.

Subjects who have received stable sildenafil treatment for at least 4 weeks are permitted to enroll in this study and continue receiving sildenafil in combination with ambrisentan. Subjects who are not receiving sildenafil treatment prior to enrollment are permitted to initiate concomitant sildenafil treatment however prior to addition of concomitant sildenafil treatment investigators must conduct at least one 6MWT after the subject has received 10 mg q.d. ambrisentan for a minimum of 4 weeks. Up titration to 10 mg q.d. ambrisentan is allowed at any time after the Week 24 visit therefore concomitant sildenafil treatment may be added after 28 weeks of ambrisentan monotherapy. Furthermore addition of concomitant sildenafil treatment requires that a subject meet two or more of the following predefined criteria 

The efficacy endpoints of 6MWD WHO functional class BDI and BNP must be assessed immediately prior to initiation of sildenafil treatment to establish baseline efficacy prior to combination therapy.

Concomitant administration of an approved prostanoid treatment i.e. i.v. epoprostenol i.v. or subcutaneous treprostinil or i.v. or inhaled iloprost is permitted at any time after the Week 12 visit. The efficacy endpoints of 6MWD WHO functional class BDI and BNP must be assessed immediately prior to initiation of prostanoid treatment to establish baseline efficacy prior to combination therapy.

Trough pre dose and peak 2 hour PK samples are collected at Week 0 and Week 4 to assess ambrisentan plasma concentrations. For subjects on concomitant sildenafil therapy trough pre dose and peak 1 hour samples are collected at Week 0 and Week 4 to assess sildenafil and N desmethylsildenafil plasma concentrations.

Male subjects complete semen and hormone analyses to evaluate potential effects of ambrisentan on male fertility.

Incidence and severity of adverse events associated with ambrisentan treatment including elevations in AST and ALT 3 ULN are evaluated for all subjects as well as for key etiology subgroups and concomitant sildenafil or prostanoid treatment.
