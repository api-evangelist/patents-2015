title: Controlled-gradient, accelerated vapor-recompression apparatus and method
abstract: An accelerated vapor recompression apparatus  converts incoming flow to a concentrate by developing a concentration profile  within a tank  holding a liquid  containing dissolved solids. The resulting curve  of saturation temperature of the stratified liquid  (such as a brine  or other material ) moves away from the curve  corresponding to fully mixed conditions. The shift  in saturation temperature results in increased boiling without increased energy from a heater  or compressor . A method  of control of the system provides interventions  at different levels  of control, ranging from mass flows  to work of a compressor , heat from a heater , and a predictive processing  of feedback  for controlling commands  algorithmically.

This invention relates to heat transfer and more particularly to novel systems and methods for vapor recompression.

Heat recovery is the basis of electrical co generation plants. Likewise many food and beverage processes require heat recovery for economy. Meanwhile desalination plants sugar processing distillation systems and the like rely on recovery of latent heat in order to minimize net energy requirements. Heat may be recovered by reheating pre heating or otherwise exchanging heat from an exit flow into and incoming flow through a system of heat exchangers.

Vapor recompression is used in various forms as one method for heat recovery. For example in food processing industrial waste processing oil production brine processing and the like vapor recompression relies on conventional heat exchangers and technologies to exchange heat vaporize liquids and condense distillates. The chemical constitution of dissolved materials especially dissolved solids as well as various ions and the like take a toll in energy and damage to the processing equipment for energy exchange.

For example oil production results in pumping considerable water to the surface. That water often contains some amount of hydrocarbons salts methane ammonia trace elements or a combination thereof. Therefore the water cannot be released into other water flows without treatment. Meanwhile disposal by hauling followed by re injection or evaporation by ponds or boilers is expensive.

Industrial waste distillation process in food and beverage industries and the like have similar if not always so severe problems. Even the latest methods such as vapor recompression and multiple effect distillation struggle with efficiency energy budgets and equipment maintenance in the face of corrosion fouling scaling and so forth. Better systems are needed for heat recovery and re use.

In view of the foregoing in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein a method and apparatus are disclosed in one embodiment of the present invention as including a controlled gradient of a material such as for example total dissolved solids TDS in a boiling liquid column such as a brine. Adjacent columns contain condensing vapors at an increased pressure. High heat transfer coefficients and effective stratified densification of the liquid are obtained by controlling mass flows work heat and the like and sensing and controlling predictively based on balancing mass work energy and the rates of change thereof include rates of change in the rates of change second derivatives of values .

In one embodiment of the method in accordance with the invention a system may operate by providing a feed comprising a liquid containing a first material distinct from the liquid and dissolved therein and containing the feed as a pool. A core at least partially immersed in the pool may be in thermal communication therewith and sealed against direct fluid communication therewith.

One may create a concentration profile reflecting a variation of the concentration of the first material in the pool between a liquid level at the top thereof and the bottom thereof by recycling vapor produced in the pool into a condensate within the core. Typically a container containing the feed is selected from a pond a tank an estuary and a vessel and the pool is quiescent relative to the feed.

The core may further comprise closed channels in thermal communication with the pool in indirect fluid communication therewith and sealed against direct fluid communication therewith which may be oriented to flow the vapor and condensate in a vertical direction. Controlling accretion of compositions containing the first material may be done by selecting the attitude of the core in operation.

The portion of the pool within the core may be engaged in confined boiling and the profile which may be thought of as gradient but is not necessarily monotonic or linear is effected by establishing an exchange of heat from the core into the pool. A change in phase of the liquid within the core by confinement therein vaporizes the liquid during the heat transfer from the core.

Optimizing the concentration profile may be done by providing a plurality of panels and selecting a spacing therebetween for enclosing therebetween in at least two dimensions a portion of the pool. For example this may include providing a plurality of panels and selecting a spacing therebetween for enclosing therebetween in at least two dimensions a portion of the pool. Spacing may be based on the characteristics of the feed.

The method may include selecting at least one of a spacing between panels of the plurality of panels a number of the panels in the core a size of the panels material of the core attitude of the core other characteristics of the panels and the position of the core in the pool and a combination thereof based on the characteristics of the feed.

Operation of the system and method establishes an active region proximate the core and containing a substantial majority of the variation in the concentration profile and establishes a trap region below the active region which is substantially excluded from exchanging liquid into the active region.

Optimizing heat transfer may be done by fully immersing the core into the pool and controlling or changing an effective nucleate boiling region of the core by changing the concentration profile. Changing a temperature profile in the pool by adding heat corresponding to a change in a pressure above the pool may be done and may be balanced with work by the compressor to obtain stability at a set of conditions desired.

In one embodiment of a method in accordance with the invention a process may include changing a temperature profile in the first region by adding heat based on a change in a pressure above the first region. Changing a boiling region of the core may be effected by changing the concentration profile which may be used to change the effective saturation temperature pressure or both for the liquid. The pool may be quiescent relative to the feed meaning that flows are generally comparatively slower with turbulence only local and not general.

One embodiment of an apparatus in accordance with the invention may include a containment means adapted for receiving a feed comprising a liquid containing a first material distinct from the liquid and dissolved therein. The containment means may be configured to contain a collection of the feeds as a pool having a liquid level and a bottom level. A core may be at least partially immersed in the pool to be in thermal communication therewith and sealed against direct fluid communication therewith.

Means for processing the pool may create a concentration profile reflecting a variation in concentration of the first material in the pool between the liquid level and the bottom. This processing means may further comprise compression means recycling vapor produced in the pool into a condensate within the core and may include heating means such as a heater for example for adding thermal energy into the pool. The processing means may include a compressor which is one embodiment of a recycling means for recycling vapor produced in the pool into a condensate within the core.

Containment means may be selected from a pond a tank an estuary a vessel or the like. The core may include closed channels in thermal communication with the pool in indirect fluid communication therewith e.g. to receive vapor and sealed against direct fluid communication therewith. The core may be movable for moving relative to the containment means. When the core is engaged in confined boiling moving may be used to adjust spacing between panels of the core. Moving the core may include changing the orientation of it changing a spacing between the closed channels or the like.

In one embodiment of an apparatus in accordance with the invention configured as a heat exchanger suitable for use in a medium configured as a fluid the heat exchanger may include an inlet outlet and surfaces. Surfaces may include an exterior surface and an interior surface defining an interior volume in fluid communication with the inlet and the outlet.

The surfaces may be constructed of a material selected to have a thermal resistance for optimizing heat transfer from the interior volume into the medium fluid . The material s properties considered may include a coefficient of thermal expansion effective to maintain the geometric structural integrity of the surfaces effective to be stable in an environment comprising the medium effective to minimize nucleation during boiling of the medium thereagainst or a combination thereof.

The inlet may conduct a recycled vapor generated against the exterior surface into the interior volume the exterior surface conducting heat from the interior volume into a boundary layer formed by the exterior surface when contacted by the medium. For example the material may be selected from the group consisting of metals polymers composites and a combination thereof. One suitable polymer is a fluorocarbon polymer such as a tetrafluoroethylene e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene .

The material may selected to be chemically inert and non reactive with respect to the medium. It may also be selected to minimize accretion of compounds generated in the medium.

A method for improving a process for vapor recompression may include selecting a process comprising a plurality of operations combinable as sub units to effect the process. Determining a concentration profile of a material dissolved in a source of the vapor may be done in conjunction with determining an influence on the concentration profile. This may be done by evaluating at least one operation of the plurality of operations having a set of operational parameters.

Selecting a target operation from the plurality of operations may be based on that evaluating. Selecting a control parameter for controlling the target operation one may begin manipulating the concentration profile by modifying the control parameter. The control parameter may be selected from the group consisting of a mass flow mechanical work thermal energy thermal inertia a rate of change thereof and a combination thereof for certain embodiments. In other embodiments a larger group may be considered

Evaluating may consist of evaluating in sequence a pump moving liquids in the process a compressor compressing the vapor from the source and a heater adding heat to the source. It need not include more than those actions but could include evaluating the response time of the source e.g. thermal inertia .

In one embodiment evaluating may also be sequentially and in an order of first a pump for moving liquids in the process second a compressor for compressing the vapor from the source and third a heater for adding heat to the source. These may be evaluated when actually moving liquids compressing the vapor from the source and adding heat to the source.

The method may include analyzing the feed for at least one of the constituents therein time variance of the constituents a source of supply delivery mechanisms and the like. The method may include modifying a control corresponding to at least one of a pump a compressor a heater and a combination thereof. It may also include providing sensors to detect at least one of a temperature pressure flow rate power and concentration corresponding to an operation within the process. It may beneficially include determining an ambient condition selected from pressure temperature wind humidity and a combination thereof.

Evaluating may include determining substantially all or all energy inputs into and energy outputs from the process. The method may thus include balancing substantially all inputs of energy into and outputs of energy from the process. It may add an energy recovery operation providing energy transfer with respect to at least one of the operations.

In certain embodiments a method of removing a contaminant from a carrier may include selecting a liquid operating as a carrier. A contaminant found in the carrier may be selected or targeted for removal reduction or concentration. A circuit making up a vapor re compression cycle may have a first region containing nucleate boiling. Introducing into the circuit the carrier containing the contaminant one may establish in the first region a concentration gradient of the contaminant. Controlling the first region may be accomplished by manipulation of the concentration gradient. The result may include returning a condensate the carrier containing less than some pre determined concentration of the contaminant.

The system and method may also return from the first region a brine concentrating the contaminant. At least one of the condensate exiting the cycle and a vapor within the cycle may be substantially devoid of the contaminant. One or more of the condensate vapor and brine may serve as a feedstock for a subsequent unit operation as that term is understood in the chemical engineering art.

The feedstock may provide one or more benefits. It may serve as a precursor for a chemical reaction in the subsequent unit operation. It may be sold as a solid or fluid having independent economic value in some market for such commodities. Likewise it may be further processed to provide a constituent derivable from the fluid and having independent value in the marketplace. In some embodiments the fluid may be reusable directly for recycling in a source process that provided the carrier to the circuit initially. The feedstock or output of the circuit may provide increased operational efficiency for a disposition process disposing of that output reduction of environmental impact of the contaminant improvement in a compliance process in satisfaction of at least one of a governmental regulation industry standard health standard safety standard and a contractual requirement or a combination thereof.

A subsequent unit operation may be or include synthesis of hydrochloric acid synthesis of another acid hydrolysis electrolysis an ion exchange operation an osmotic separation process a vaporization separation process coagulation other chemical separation process centrifugation filtration sluicing settling flocculation and another mechanical separation process microwave separation another microwave treatment re injection into a well a geologic fracturing operation blending with another material reacting chemically with another material or a combination thereof.

The contaminant may also be or include a dissolved solid suspended solid hydrocarbon salt heavy metal other metal volatile organic compound other organic compound oxide of nitrogen other nitrogenous compound alcohol oxide of sulfur other sulfurous compound calcium compound halide other ion acid base or some combination thereof.

The circuit may include modules for effecting the circuit. For example a specification defining a system may call out a plurality of the modules each module implementing an instance of the circuit and its unit operations. One may size the system to match a source of the contaminant and provide the plurality of modules operating together as the system and in numbers selected based on an output to be treated from the source.

Methods may include providing a requirement pre determined and corresponding to a source of the contaminant defining a system having a plurality of the modules each module having a type and implementing at least one function specified by the requirement and then selecting a value a number of modules of each type to be included in the system as selected components. The system may then be configured by connecting the selected components.

The method of claim wherein each module of the modules is mounted on a connecting structure and sized to be commercially transportable in accordance with transportation limitations provided by regulation. It may include assembling a facility in a pre determined configuration by connecting the connecting structures to one another and rendering the modules interoperable.

A method of separating out a material contained in a liquid may include providing from a source a liquid operating as a carrier containing a material targeted for separation from the liquid. It may provide a circuit constituting a vapor re compression cycle having a first region containing nucleate boiling and a second region containing vapor condensation. By introducing into the circuit the liquid the method may establish in the first region a concentration gradient of the material in the liquid. Controlling the nucleate boiling may be done by manipulation of the concentration gradient.

Methods may include returning from the second region a condensate comprising the liquid containing less than a pre determined concentration of the contaminant and may returning from the first region a brine. At least one of a condensate a portion of the vapor and a brine may contain the material and another thereof be substantially devoid of the material. Providing a feedstock may be constituted by at least one of a condensate separated from the material a vapor separated from the material a brine into which the material has been concentrated and a solid comprising the material. A the outputs may be used as a feedstock sent to a subsequent unit operation.

A system in accordance with the invention may include a circuit for processing fluids by vapor re compression the circuit comprising an evaporation region. A working fluid may circulate through the circuit. A material contained within the working fluid may be targeted for separation therefrom. An evaporator controllable by an operator may be located within the evaporation region and provide control of nucleate boiling by establishing and manipulating a concentration gradient of the material in the evaporation region.

The system may be made up of modules constituting the circuit wherein each module is mounted on a connecting structure and sized to be commercially transportable in accordance with transportation limitations provided by regulation. Modules may be connectable and ultimately connected and interoperable in a pre determined configuration when the connecting structures are secured to one another.

It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention as generally described and illustrated in the drawings herein could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the system and method of the present invention as represented in the drawings is not intended to limit the scope of the invention but is merely representative of various embodiments of the invention. The illustrated embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout.

As used herein terms are to be understood and interpreted broadly. However alternative specific terms may be used by way of example but are to be interpreted as meaning the broader terms. For example a solvent or liquid is exemplified by water but may be interpreted as any solvent liquid material medium carrier or the like. Similarly many materials may be dissolved as solutes in such a carrier. Solutes may be called contaminants herein contaminant simply refers to something to be separated out even a desirable material as in distillation. A solvent or liquid may be thought of as any fluid to be treated by a separation process in accordance with the invention.

Solutes may be liquids solids ions synthetic natural mineral animal vegetable or other materials dissolved in the solvent or carrier. Thus the term TDS is an example standing for a solute generally dissolved in the carrier as its solvent. Solutes and solvents may arise in food processing industrial process fluids or wastewater alcohol distilleries sugar processing petroleum drilling or production fluids potable water processing mining effluent or tailings processing nuclear coolant or waste liquids processing runoff or other collection pond handling or the like. Brine stands for any solution of solute in a solvent even though it is an example term commonly applied to dissolved solids and ions in water.

Core materials may be any suitable materials ranging through metals alloys stainless polymers elastomers other materials composites or combinations thereof. The core may have bellows structures to change spacing between panels or other variations supporting positioning pivoting tilting e.g. attitude of roll pitch or yaw around any axis sliding or otherwise optimizing configurations of core panels by positioning. Such may be useful in processes such as vapor recompression evaporator distillation systems multiple effect evaporators and other processing systems even though otherwise difficult in some industrial situations.

The core described herein is not a radiator like an automobile uses for several reasons. For example air through such a radiator is a flow completely unrelated to the cooled liquid contained. In contrast vapor recompression passes a vapor phase boiled off a liquid phase through a compressor and back to condense against the outside of the very wall containing the boiling.

Quiescent is comparative between flows and does not mean a complete lack of flow or motion but rather a much slower motion than the flow compared with it and conventional flows for the function. Nucleate boiling is not limited to boiling initiated at surface nucleation points but boiling due to exceeding the vapor pressure. Confined boiling is a term of art in the art of heat transfer and is used in its ordinary meaning therein. It is also understood to mean nucleate boiling in a space confined in at least one dimension.

Likewise fluids include all gases vapors liquids and liquidous flows. Systems or devices in thermal or fluid communication mean the systems are capable of exchanging heat or fluid respectively. Containment for fluids may include anything natural or artificial from ponds lakes rivers and other estuaries to lined ponds tanks containers pipes conduits or the like.

By gradient is meant a profile a variation in one variable like temperature or concentration with respect to another like space or time . It need not be linear nor monotonic changing always in a single direction . The profiles often tend in one direction with localized variation due to the dynamics of the system. Typically a profile changes more dramatically in an active region region where heat transport mass transport or both are actively occurring between flows and not just flowing through some containment from one location to another . A dynamic gradient or dynamic profile is a profile established by operation of the invention and subject to localized variations variations with time or conditions or a combination thereof.

Referring to while referring generally to a system in accordance with the invention may be set in a permanent installation or may be containerized. The basic elements of system may include a tank .

In the illustrated embodiment the tank contains a brine that has established therein a gradient of concentration of the dissolved solids. The tank is fed originally by a feed tank through lines . In general herein any reference to an item by reference numeral includes a generalized inclusion of such items bearing such a number. A trailing letter after a reference numeral indicates a specific instance of the item designated by the reference numeral. Thus the system includes a plurality of lines including for example lines and so forth.

The feed tank provides through lines to a separator a flow . The flow is typically pre treated in the separator . In one embodiment the separator may be configured as a pre treatment system for removal of volatile materials for example.

In one embodiment of a method in accordance with the invention the system may be used by introducing a brine in an unconcentrated state into the feed tank . This may come directly from a well head or may be hauled to a particular location from various petroleum production facilities. In the illustrated embodiment the feed tank may then transport the brine through a line to a pre treatment system which typically will operate as volatiles separator . Other processes of pre treatment systems may include adding various chemicals in order to reduce fouling scale corrosion and the like.

For example brine received in a feed tank may include numerous materials. Dispersed oil products are typically volatiles that vaporize upon heating. These may include fractions of crude oil that range from C6 to waxes tar paraffin as well as paraffin soluble organic compounds. Gasoline and diesel ranges of organic hydrocarbons may be included in small amounts. Likewise various aromatics such as polycyclic aromatic compounds may be included. BTEX compounds are not uncommon. Likewise methanol phenols and methane may similarly be included.

Not only those organic hydrocarbons but likewise sulfur in various forms including hydrogen sulfide HS may be included. These may be particularly problematic since sulfates are likely to permanently scale out on solid surfaces. In order to reduce the scaling by sulfates scale inhibitors must be introduced into the brine to maintain a clean feed tank . These are not necessarily required but are highly recommended for brines that contain compounds of sulfur.

Similarly silica clay and other inorganic materials may be included in large or small amounts dissolved or undissolved. Typically silica and clay are undissolved and may form particulates. Likewise various salts. Salts may include cations ranging through magnesium calcium sodium and potassium. The anions which may correspond to the aforementioned cations may include chlorides sulfates carbonates nitrates and the like. Typically nitrates are not present in large concentrations. Nevertheless carbonates are typically received in brines in comparatively large or larger quantities.

Treatment chemicals added in the pre treatment system may include for example ammonium various compounds of nitrogen gels foam generating materials and the like. Similarly additional ions may include strontium mercury lead chromium selenium iron barium and so forth. Various naturally occurring radioactive materials such as uranium radium and the like may be included. Boron is not all that uncommon.

In some embodiments various types of separators may be placed to remove other entrained materials whether solid gas liquid or the like. Such pre treatment systems are numerous and ubiquitous in the science of pre treating production brines.

For example Sears in U.S. Pat. No. 5 968 321 issued Oct. 19 1999 and entitled Vapor Compression Distillation System and Method which is incorporated herein by reference discloses a distillation system that includes a pre treatment process and apparatus. Similarly Kresnyak et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6 355 145 B1 issued Mar. 12 2002 and entitled Distillation Process with Reduced Fouling which is incorporated herein by reference likewise discusses various processes for pre treatment.

From the pre treatment system or separator the flow first passes through a heat exchanger referred to as a brine heat exchanger. The function of the brine heat exchanger is to remove heat from brine leaving the tank and to recover that heat into the flow passing into the tank .

Ultimately the concentrated brine from which heat is extracted by the brine heat exchanger is disposed of in a brine tank . The brine tank may be emptied by hauling the brine away passing the brine into an evaporation pond further processing the brine for minerals heating or otherwise drying the brine or other disposition method.

In the illustrated embodiment a distillate handling system operates opposite the brine heat exchanger and brine tank . That is for example the distillate handling system receives the distilled water as an output from the system and specifically from the tank where it has been boiled off. The distillate handling system may include a vapor trap . The vapor trap may be simple or complex and typically operates like a liquid trap e.g. P trap in which a column of liquid is contained within a line that traverses both down and back up in order to maintain a liquid column that cannot be overcome by the pressure of incoming vapor.

The distillate tank operates to collect all the distillate that has been condensed from the closed channels of the core . However as a practical matter particularly in consideration of control issues a distillate reservoir may first receive the distillate from the vapor trap . Accordingly the distillate reservoir may be used for testing the level or rate of generation of distillate.

Following collection in the distillate reservoir the distillate may next pass to a heat exchanger configured to extract heat from the distillate and pass that heat into the feed input line feeding into the tank . In the illustrated embodiment the distillate heat exchanger may operate at a fixed rate of flow in both directions.

For example the brine feeding from the feed tank may be divided between feeds F passing through the distillate heat exchanger and F passing through the brine heat exchanger . Thus F receives heat from the distillate preheating as close as reasonable to the temperature of the brine in the tank . Likewise feed passing from the feed tank through the brine heat exchanger extracts heat from brine exiting at maximum concentration from the tank toward the brine tank . This preheating of F and F elevates feed temperatures and recovers heat that would otherwise be discharged in the distillate tank and the Brine Tank respectively.

In the illustrated embodiment the distillate handling system includes a level control . The level control operates by sensing the level of distillate in the reservoir . According to the output of the level control the system may be adjusted in certain operating parameters in order to maintain a constant flow of distillate.

In the embodiment of the illustration it is contemplated that the distillate outflow to the distillate tank from the distillate handling system through the distillate heat recovery system will be operated at a fixed rate. One benefit of an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention is that the output rate of distillate may be fixed. Likewise the incoming brine mass flow rate may be fixed in the flow divided between the flows F F regardless of the brine concentration incoming from the feed tank and regardless of the brine concentration level discharged into the brine tank .

Various embodiments of level controls may be implemented. For example hereinafter describes one level control mechanism suitable for operating between a vapor compartment and a liquid compartment or a vapor region and a liquid region within a tank while still providing accurate repeatable reliable readings without the need for vents and other condensate removal systems from the vapor side of the gauge.

The energy sources for evaporation of the brine in the tank comes from multiple sources. As a practical matter an auxiliary heat source provides heat to supply the brine in order to elevate the temperature within the tank to the proper level. Meanwhile the brine heat exchanger and distillate heat exchanger recover heat from exit streams in order to elevate the temperatures of F and F respectively entering the tank .

Thus the distillate heat recovery system is a source of heat recovered into the line as the brine heat recovery system is a source of recovered heat into the flow in the line . Other heat recovery systems such as engine exhaust recovery may also be employed. Actual sources of heat will typically include only a heater providing heat from an auxiliary source which operates merely to overcome losses in the system.

The tank may include a level control which may be similar or completely different from the level control on the distillate reservoir . Each of these level controls may operate substantially independent of the rest of the system . However in certain embodiments the level controls may operate directly to control the feed through the lines in order to match mass flow rates according to conservation of mass.

An ancillary option at an appropriate place in the system may be a distillation column . It has been found useful in some production water sources to implement a distillation column in order to remove heavier materials such as distilled water in a stripping section while separating out lighter components such as methanol or the like in a rectifying section at the top thereof. Thus the distillation column is an optional element that may or may not be included depending upon the particular site being serviced by a system .

A compressor compresses vapor originating in the tank in the brine and collecting above the brine . The compressor is responsible to raise the pressure in the vapor according to the Clausius Clapeyron equation relating temperature rise to pressure rise. Accordingly the vapor passes through the compressor and is fed back into the manifold of the core .

The pressure downstream of the compressor exists substantially the same in the conduit manifold and the close channel . The differential in pressure between the upstream side of the compressor and the downstream side thereof effects a pressure of saturation corresponding to a higher temperature of saturation.

Heat is transferred due to the temperature differential between the closed channels of compressed vapor and the open channels in the brine . Heat from the condensing saturated vapor in the closed channel transfers into the brine .

In some embodiments a vapor handling system may be mounted near or at the top of the tank . In the illustrated embodiment the vapor handling system may include for example a mist eliminator . Typically a mist eliminator is responsible to remove droplets of water which may entrain droplets of brine from the vapor and bring with them the risk of carrying dissolved solids toward the compressor .

Various embodiments of vapor handling systems may be considered. In addition to the mist eliminator for example a deaerator may be included as part of the vapor handling system . De aerators at this stage need not be excessively large nor vent substantial quantities of the vapor .

For example in one apparatus and method constructed for experiments and producing approximately 100 barrels per day of distillate in the distillate tank a de aerator was sized by conventional chemical engineering principles. Henry s Law which relates concentrations of non condensables or other vapors within liquids according to the partial pressure and a physical constant as described hereinbelow required a reservoir of about twenty liters. Accordingly the deaerator needed only about five liters to be vented approximately once per day during operation.

In general a plenum above the brine in the tank may be sized to provide a dwell time or accumulation time for vapors in order to enhance mist elimination. Numerous manufactures produce compressors of constant displacement positive displacement and so forth. For example Ingersoll Rand Dresser and other companies produce compressors suitable for application in a system in accordance with the invention. Likewise a plenum may be sized according to the rating of a compressor .

Ultimately the brine is concentrated by boiling and vaporizing the brine into vapor . As vapor leaves the brine as bubbles and enters the plenum the residual dissolved solids within the brine increase in the region about the vaporized bubble. This increase in dissolved solids in this surrounding brine results in higher density and a net downward flow of this more dense brine .

Ultimately the tank establishes a concentration profile or gradient in which the brine of lowest concentration exists at the interface between the brine and the vapor . Accordingly the heaviest or the most concentrated brine is established at the output level of the tank . The function of the system is to concentrate brine from whatever concentration exists in the feed tank to a much greater concentration.

As the brine loses water into vapor collected in the plenum localized concentrating processes occur around every bubble formed. These localized concentrations result in localized descent of heavier brine relative to lighter brine.

For example the brine in the feed tank has less dissolved solids and is lighter per cubic inch or cubic centimeter than the brine in the brine tank . In the locality of bubbles a density differential develops beside a bubble that has vaporized. The bubble leaves behind its share of dissolved solids to be absorbed by neighboring liquid water molecules in the brine . Ultimately with the continuing process of heating and evaporation occurring within the open channels as a result of the heat transferred from the closed channels a continuing concentrating process occurs within each open channel .

As a direct result heavier more concentrated brine moves downward seeking density equilibrium among equally agitated boiling or near boiling neighbors. Thus in steady state the maximum concentration of dissolved solids exists at the outlet of the tank and the minimum density and minimum concentration of dissolved solids exists at the interface between the brine and plenum . This has been demonstrated in experiments.

A concentrate handling system is responsible for handling the concentrated brine exiting the tank . In the illustrated embodiment the concentrate handling system includes a slurry handling system . The slurry handling system is responsible for handling such items as high density precipitates that may form sludge or other suspended solids at high concentrations in liquid. Accordingly such materials may be separated from the brine of the tank and directed to disposition different from the brine in the brine tank .

Similarly a reservoir may act as a settling tank as well as concentrator . As a practical matter concentrations having or causing the greatest stratification occur in regions where concentrating activity such as boiling evaporation are found. In the illustrated embodiment that region is the region within the open channels . In contrast the reservoir lacking any heating or evaporation mechanism concentrate may operate as a settling region and typically does not concentrate substantially further.

Likewise the brine concentration system may include a variety of mechanisms within the slurry handling system to assist in removing precipitates and other solids from the walls floors and the like of various components.

Solids removal equipment is known in the art and may include vibration systems scraping systems augers combinations thereof and the like. Ultimately a slurry holding system may actually be separated by valving from the slurry handling system and only receive brief and periodic discharges of solidus flows into the slurry holding system . Such systems may be manual automatic.

Following passage through the pre treatment system the brine may pass through a flow divider such as a valve or system of valves dividing the overall flow in the lines from the feed tank into F and F illustrated by feed passing through line . The flow divider is responsible for maintaining a constant flow to the distillate heat recovery system and a variable flow to the brine heat exchanger . The control of the relative proportion of these flows will be discussed hereinbelow.

In the illustrated embodiment the flow through the lines represents two flows. A fixed rate through the distillate heat exchanger is matched to the fixed flow of the distillate through the distillate heat exchanger .

In contrast the fresh brine from the feed tank passing through the brine heat exchanger is adjustable commensurate with the flow of brine concentrate out of the tank through the line into the brine heat exchanger . In all cases metered pumps controlled typically by being fixed displacement pumps may be placed in the lines to control the rates of the flows into and out of the tank . For example feed pump may control the flow of brine from the feed tank through the distillate heat exchanger .

Likewise the pump controls F or the flow passing from the brine heat exchanger into the diffuser in the tank . Similarly a brine pump may control the feed of the concentrated brine from the tank through the brine heat exchanger . A pump may control the flow of distillate into the distillate heat exchanger and may be matched by mass flow of the brine pump

Continuing to refer to while referring generally to a system in accordance with the invention typically feeds preheated brine through the lines into a diffuser . The diffuser is described in various options in . By whichever mechanism is selected the diffuser has the effect of distributing the brine in a fashion that will allow the brine from the lines to distribute across the maximum extent of the core .

For example the cross sectional area or foot print of the core in the tank represents a particular area of interest. That area presents the bottom openings of all the open channels . Accordingly a diffuser may be responsible to distribute the flows of the lines within the core . If all the flow passes into a single open channel the efficiency of the core will be different from that achieved if all open channels of core have a reasonably equal opportunity to receive a portion of the flow

An auxiliary heater is responsible to add heat received from a heat source or an auxiliary heat source . In the illustrated embodiment the auxiliary heater is positioned below the bottom of the core .

In certain embodiments the auxiliary heater may be placed on a wall of the tank rather than inside the tank . Likewise the auxiliary heater may be respectively positioned with respect to the diffuser such that auxiliary heat source feeds heat directly into concentrated brine at the bottom of the tank rather than into the incoming brine flowing into the diffuser .

In some embodiments a diffuser may not be required. In others an engineering selection may be made between heating the incoming brine with the auxiliary heater and allowing the incoming brine flow to simply rise due to saline convection TDS content convection to the top of the core without the benefit of carrying any heat.

In diffuser is positioned at a level below the auxiliary heater . Thus the flow from the input lines emitting from the diffuser pass through the layer of heated brine created by the auxiliary heater . This provides a heat transfer mechanism for heating the tank brine . In some embodiments the auxiliary heater may actually be located in the diffuser. In other embodiments the auxiliary heater may be attached to the inside or outside of a wall of the tank . In other embodiments the auxiliary heater may actually be in the lines feeding into the tank .

In order to monitor and subsequently control operation of the system sensors may be installed in the system . Sensors may include sensors to monitor pressure temperature concentration of dissolved solids combinations thereof or the like. In the system concentration effectively improve heat transfer and mass transfer evaporation and condensation for example by virtue of even small differences in concentration. Hence temperature pressure and concentration measures are significant as control parameters in the brine and the vapor . Control of system may require a multiplicity of these sensors .

Nevertheless with such items as the compressor lines conduits and other fixtures pressures may vary throughout the system . Meanwhile inasmuch as the system operates about saturation pressures and temperatures temperature is an indicator of pressure and vice versa. Thus each may be sensed and steps may be taken to assert active control in accordance with established functional relationships.

Concentration profiles which may be referred to as gradients of dissolved solids are established within the brine of the tank and thus localized density may be implied by those concentrations. Accordingly density changes altitude changes together with any pressure changes within the plenum may add up to provide a comparatively wider variety of pressure and saturation temperature variations at points throughout the tank than would a mixed tank . Thus monitors and control systems may be in place to read the sensors and feed that data to actuation devices.

In the illustrated embodiment sensors are positioned within the open channel exposed to the free stream or bulk of the tank . Sensors are located within the closed channel . Sensors detect conditions within the tank near the wall . The sensors may be placed at the wall but will more typically be placed in the brine spaced from the wall but mounted to the wall . Sensors exist in the plenum to detect conditions therein.

Likewise sensors in the vapor handling system detect conditions therein while sensors monitor the heaviest brine concentrated at the bottom of the tank . The region hosting the sensors does not have any portion of the core active therein but may be important in the control of system .

The compressor may be monitored by sensors on the upstream or inlet side thereof and sensors on the downstream or outlet side thereof. Ambient conditions may be monitored by sensors external to the tank located in the environment to sense ambient and atmospheric conditions.

From the plenum the conduits carry the vapor into the compressor and from the compressor into the plenum of the closed panels or closed channels . The vapor within the closed channel eventually condenses to form the condensate in the bottom of the closed channel . Eventually the lower plenum of the closed channels may be completely filled with liquid.

Nevertheless it may be possible that some vapor may be circulated through the distillate or the condensate at the bottom of the closed channels . Accordingly the flow from the closed channel into the vapor trap may contain both gas and liquid phases of the condensate .

Meanwhile the level control monitors the level of condensate in the reservoir . Ultimately the reservoir controlled by the pump passes the distillate through the distillate heat exchanger and on to the distillate tank .

Referring to while continuing to refer generally to the system may include a controller . In general controller includes at least one processor and typically the complete input systems output systems processing facility memory and so forth of a computer. The controller may receive data process data store data and so forth. The controller is responsible to receive inputs from sensors throughout the system .

Specifically the controller will receive information in the form of data regarding temperatures pressures concentrations and so forth as well as flow rates and the like from the various components described hereinabove with respect to the system . In the illustrated embodiment the controller although illustrated multiple times may be a single processor based system or multiple processors. The controller may be consolidated distributed or any other configuration. The controller may be a single controller multiple controllers or a system of controller.

Meanwhile the controller is also responsible to send command singles back to the various pumps and to the auxiliary heat source the auxiliary heater or both. Controller may control the input of heat from the auxiliary heat source as well as the input of power to the compressor .

In general the controller commands or sends outputs as commands to the various devices and components within the system and receives inputs or reads the inputs from those and other components. In the illustrated embodiment the controller receives inputs likewise from such components as the level control and the level control .

However typically the level controls operate within themselves to control the level directly in a manner well understood in the art.

Referring to a control schema identifies four levels of control. At level zero the control system or control schema operates to control the liquid mass. Thus the zero level may also be referred to as the liquid mass control . Likewise the first level of control above zero is the vapor mass control . The liquid mass control could operate completely independent of any other control system but is incorporated as the basic or zero level of control in schema .

Likewise the first level or the vapor mass control level deals with the vapor in the plenum through the compressor and into the closed channels of the core . These depend on a formula relating the work done by the compressor to the pressure and temperature within the vapor passing through the compressor . Thus while the level zero system need only track and control a value of a liquid level the vapor mass control has a more sophisticated responsibility. It must track the liquid levels in the liquid level controllers and also operate the compressor in response thereto in order to assert control over the principle energy input to system the worth of the compressor .

The second level control or the energy control is responsible for controlling a rate of change of energy inputs into the system such as heat into the auxiliary heater . Accordingly the energy control must operate on the basis of a formula algorithm computer program from the conditions of temperature pressure concentration and the like within the tank and other components of the system and assert control over the regulation of heat through the heater as part of controlling the energy of system .

Significant in operation of the energy control is the fact that the time of response of the tank is measured in hours sometimes many hours. By contrast the pressures reported by the sensors in the plenum may facilitate a compressor response in seconds. Thus the compressor may be adjusted in current draw and thus speed or velocity. Therefore volumetric flow rate can be adjusted almost instantaneously. By contrast the addition of energy by the energy control system will not be evident for a much longer period of time.

In contrast a liquid level may be observed by sight in a manometer or gauge. However energy flows cannot be observed physically typically and the rates of change and the relationships within the system are not obvious nor intuitive.

The third level of control or the system predictive control is strictly algorithmic and computational in its implementation. The sophistication required is high. Many parameters many sensors thermodynamic considerations material properties and the like all go into an algorithmic determination by the system predictive control of where system is operating and where it should be.

For example the system predictive control system is responsible to review all data in the controller from all sources including the history of operation of the system . The system predictive control may interpolate extrapolate or use other numerical method solutions to solve complex equations involving partial differentials of any value rate of change or the rate of change of the rate of change of variables in order to precisely and adequately predict control set points. It may control assert control over the heater the compressor level controls pumps and other volumetric flows.

The system is sufficiently robust even resilient that it can accommodate wide variations in inputs. For example brine concentration rates of from approximately 10 000 parts per million of total dissolved solids up to greater than 150 000 parts per million of total dissolved solids may be provided as inputs into the system . Likewise substantially any output concentration from such values to above 200 000 parts per million may be accommodated.

This predictive control system may provide a substantial advantage to the system by calculating the optimum set points for control parameters sent by way of commands to the components. The system may thus obtain optimum energy efficiency brine throughput to distillate and so forth.

Referring to a common problem in boiling regimes such as the vapor liquid interface of tank between brine and vapor is the variable nature of the fluid level. The configuration of a meter overcomes this problem. This may be important for the control schema .

In one embodiment of a system the plenum may provide a pressure source to a meter . The meter may detect a pressure differential and thereby provide processing by the controller or by imbedded processing the liquid level in the tank . Similarly such a meter may be embedded or attached as a liquid level control or .

In the illustrated embodiment a line from the vapor region in this instance the plenum will fill with vapor which will condense and fill the line . Meanwhile the brine within the tank may feed through the line . The two lines thus feed opposite sides of a gauge such as manometer of any configuration. This may be a manometer gauge meter or the like. Likewise the line may serve as a common reference to other gauges elsewhere in the system.

Referring to in one embodiment of an apparatus in accordance with the invention a tank may receive input flows into a diffuser . Those input flows are received from the feed tank and may pass through a pre treatment system . In one presently preferred embodiment the brine flow passing through the brine heat exchanger receives heat from the brine exiting the tank through the line as controlled and driven by the pump . In such an embodiment the heat exchanger may be set up in any one of several alternative configurations.

In one embodiment the heat exchanger may be configured as a single heat exchanger in which the flow of incoming brine is counter flowing contrary to the direction of the exit brine flow flowing in line from the bottom of the tank . In such a configuration the dwell time heat transfer coefficient available surface area and the like may all be fixed to the extent that the heat exchanger may not be reconfigured.

However in most presently contemplated embodiments the flow rate and its corresponding flow rate may be used as control variables. As in the control of energy typically includes the control of heat addition to incoming brine preheated by the heat exchanger . Meanwhile the zero level from includes the level control. One of those level controllers controls the liquid level of the brine in the tank . Accordingly the flow into the tank may be used as a control variable.

As explained the flow rate through the distillate heat exchanger with the corresponding output flow of distillate through the distillate heat exchanger may be fixed and matched to one another. The mass flow rate for adjusting the level of brine in the tank may be that control by the level control altering the flow rate of the F through the pump and the heat exchanger .

Thus in conditions wherein the incoming flow through the brine heat exchanger is comparatively low F may reduce to less than one third of the flow through the distillate heat exchanger . In such an embodiment relatively little heat exchange surface area is required. Thus reduction to a single heat exchanger may be appropriate.

Circumstances wherein the brine heat exchanger receives a greater proportion of flow in F than the distillate heat exchanger receives from F the brine heat exchanger may instead carry two or more times the volumetric flow rate of the incoming flow compared to that of the heat exchanger with its controlling pump

Thus it may be advisable to provide longer dwell times greater surface area or both during conditions when a greater flow rate comparatively passes through the brine heat exchanger than the distillate heat exchanger . Likewise as flows change the number of heat exchangers the area available the dwell time or some combination thereof may be varied.

Referring again to multiple heat exchangers may be configured in either a series or parallel configuration valving systems may be provided to engage one two three or more heat exchangers in a parallel configuration. In this way the number of heat exchangers needed may be engaged without subjecting the flow or the flow to excessive distance and therefore additional fluid dynamic drag to be overcome by the power of the pumps 

In contrast flows may be slowed and dwell times increased while also increasing the available surface area by arranging heat exchanges in a series configuration. In a series configuration pressure losses may be comparatively larger. Also valving cannot be used to direct flows between heat exchangers as all flows pass through all heat exchangers .

Depending upon the range of operational parameters to which a system may be subjected a single multiple series or parallel arrangement of heat exchangers may be configured in the lines in order to accommodate heat transfer between the flows 

By way of reference in one embodiment of an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention a six fold variation in flow rate through the brine heat exchanger necessarily changed the flow speed and the flow profile. As such flows may be partially laminar and partially turbulent. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art such variations affect the net dwell time during which heat transfer can take place the log mean temperature difference existing between the flows in the heat exchanger and so forth.

Therefore the distillate heat exchanger may be designed for the flow rate output for which a system will be operated continuously. In contrast the brine heat exchanger must be tasked with the control process responsibility of matching the net flow through the system according to the brine concentration ratio of incoming to outgoing brine .

Continuing to refer to specifically while referring generally to a diffuser in an apparatus in accordance with the invention may be responsible to introduce the flow into the tank . It has been found that several configurations may be considered each with a somewhat different effect.

Inasmuch as the tank establishes a gradient of concentration from the lowest concentration of total dissolved solids at the top of the liquid level in the tank to a highest concentration of dissolved solids at the bottom of the tank . Two mechanisms tend to operate to exchange heat and mass between the incoming flow and the brine in the tank itself.

By virtue of initial velocity of introduction of the flow into the tank momentum transfers between the incoming flow and the substantially quiescent brine in the tank . Thus mass may be exchanged between the jet and its consequent plume and the brine in the tank . Momentum transfer occurs as the jet interacts with the surrounding brine thus mixing broadening and increasing the concentration in the jet as it mixes with the brine in the tank .

Likewise another mechanism entirely different therefrom in its motivating force and energy is the brine density plume. A buoyance difference between the more dense brine in the tank and the less dense introductory brine flow from the feed tank results in a buoyant force on the incoming brine flow . Accordingly the brine flow tends to rise as a lighter fluid within the heavier brine of the quiescent tank .

This rise also results in a velocity upward by the incoming brine flow resulting in a plume with aspects of the jet like behavior. For example the rising lighter flow rises through the heavier quiescent brine in the tank mixing therewith broadening the plume entraining surrounding brine and resulting in an exchange of momentum as well as content dissolved solids .

A function of a diffuser is to reduce the effect of a velocity based momentum jet from the incoming velocity of the flow . Nevertheless in certain embodiments the diffuser may simply be replaced by a jet.

In the line may connect to a diffuser in which the line and the diffuser are both circular in cross section. For example the diffuser illustrated in the top embodiment illustrates an expansion of the diameter from the diameter of the line as a bell such as a bell on the trumpet.

Thus the effective cross sectional area is gradually increased resulting in a commensurate decrease in the velocity of the flow introduced by the diffuser . In the illustrated embodiment the wall is penetrated for installation of the diffuser . Thus the diffuser introduces the flow through the wall .

In the schematic diagram of the diffuser is illustrated below the core . Each potential location has benefits.

The diffuser presents no horizontal surfaces. It provides in fact no accessible surfaces on which descending materials from the concentrated brine of the tank may accumulate.

The middle embodiment of the diffuser illustrated in is configured more in a fan like shape in which the net area of the line is increased in the diffuser but not with a circular cross section. Here the thickness and width of the fan like diffuser may be selected in order to provide a flow velocity for the flow as desired.

In one embodiment such a diffuser may be oriented to discharge the flow in a vertical direction below the core . In another embodiment the rectangular cross section of the outlet of the diffuser may be configured to be a square and may cover a comparatively larger fraction of the area under the core. However in the illustrated embodiment the diffuser discharges the flow directly through the wall and does not present any of its structure within the tank itself.

The lower configuration of a diffuser in may be constructed in any of several arrangements. The illustrated embodiment shows the line ported directly through the wall resulting in a jet flow into the tank . Of course any degree of change in the cross sectional area from the line to the output of the diffuser may be selected and may be appropriate. Just as the other embodiments may be arranged to pass the flow through the wall or upward into the core directly from below the core this embodiment may be arranged in any such manner.

In fact the flow may be directly horizontally vertically or obliquely with respect to the bottom of the core . In some embodiments the flow may be introduced through a plate with apertures through a plurality of lines through various diffusers through a bank of diffusers or the like. Nevertheless in the illustrated embodiments of the diffusers remain outside the wall . Here they are able to further reduce the components subject to the destructive forces of the concentrated brine chemistry. They also reduce the tendency toward scaling fouling accumulation of precipitants and the like.

Referring to while continuing to refer generally to a system in accordance with the invention may include channels open to the surrounding tank from a top liquid level in the tank to a lowest outlet level . Meanwhile each panel around each closed channel forms a mechanical barrier between the vapor and condensate within the closed channel and the brine in open channels which are effectively contents of the tank .

Each panel presents an outer surface in contact with the brine in the open channel . An inner surface of the wall is in contact with the vapor or condensate in the inner or closed channel . Heat is transferred from the high pressure region having a higher saturation pressure and higher saturation temperature in the closed channel . As described with respect to the compressor compresses the vapor from the plenum to a higher pressure and corresponding temperature in accordance with the Clausius Clapeyron equation illustrated in . The lower pressure and temperature region is represented by the plenum and the open channels in the tank .

Thus heat transferred from the closed channel passes through the wall subject to the heat transfer coefficients on the inner surface and outer surface of the wall . Ultimately convection cells due to thermal convention may occur. Thermal convection is the result of buoyancy a density decrease by a fluid that has been heated compared to its surrounding and comparatively cooler neighbors.

For example to the extent that the tank represents brine that has been stratified stratification in response to brine density differences is several times more significant than the buoyance differential due to a temperature difference. Accordingly hotter brine may still remain lower or at a lower level within the tank due to the fact that its dissolved solids content prohibits its rising in response to thermal buoyance effects.

Nevertheless buoyance differentials due to heat addition rendering the hotter material to be of lower density and thus lighter may result in Bhacek over e nard cells or Bhacek over e nard convection cells . However these will exist only locally within material having the same density with respect to dissolved solids. The cells tend to move heat from the wall into the bulk of the brine in the open channel .

One advantage of a profile e.g. brine concentration gradient or a density variation with depth due to dissolved solids concentrations increases with depth within the tank and the open channels is the fact that rather than rising immediately along the wall heated brine may remain localized thus contributing to increase temperature at a comparatively lower level.

In this way heat may be transferred continually from the wall into the brine of the open channel even though the temperature differential between the vapor in the closed channel may be nearer to the temperature of the adjacent brine in the open channel . Heat transfer still continues because the convection cells did not necessarily become general along the entire height of the panel . Rather energy is pumped away from wall .

Stated another way brine at a particular level in the open channel may still continue to pick up heat and may cause a generation of bubbles at the outer surface of the wall which might otherwise not be able to occur. Compared to the illustrated embodiment and the apparatus in accordance with the invention in free convection if the tank were full of clean water heated liquid would always rise in the presence of comparatively cooler liquid. Thus all the hottest liquid would rise to the top.

In contrast with stratified brine hot liquid may exist and remain at the bottom. In fact a reverse temperature gradient in which the hottest temperature is at the lower end of the panel is entirely possible depending on the heat transfer dynamics of the system .

In general bubbles are generated at the outer surface of the wall of the panel anytime localized brine achieves the saturation temperature for its localized pressure. Pressure varies with depth and density of the brine as well as the overhead pressure within the plenum . Thus lower in the open channel one expects and observes higher pressure.

Moreover due to the density profile e.g. gradient or concentration profile e.g. gradient saturation pressures and temperatures rise even further. Nevertheless inasmuch as the temperature within the closed channel is higher than the temperature in the open channel heat transfer may still occur across wall and bubbles may be generated at the lower extremities of the panels .

This phenomenon has been observed in practice during experiments. For example in free convection with a condensing vapor within a closed channel wherein the outer channel or open channel contained no saline gradient the formation of bubbles occurred only within the top 5 percent of the height of the panel. In contrast bubble formation was observed within the bottom 20 percent of the open channel when the open channel contained stratified brine .

As each bubble is formed it would typically nucleate at a site on the outer surface of the wall of the panel . However it will quickly separate as it grows and move from a position illustrated by the bubble to a position in the free stream of the open channel illustrated by the bubble

It has been observed that as bubbles grow due to heat addition mass addition and even due to a simple rise in altitude reflecting a reduced surrounding pressure the bubbles have been observed to strip the boundary layer from the surface of the panel . This triggers the generation of clouds of bubbles as illustrated by the bubbles of . These bubbles likewise appear to be able to grow and rise. Nevertheless they may not necessarily nucleate at the wall but may be generated by an infusion of heat due to the disruption of the thermal and fluid boundary layer as understood in the art of heat transfer.

As the bubbles continue to rise they tend to grow in size and tend to coalesce with one another. They begin to form larger bubbles and tend to move toward the brine in the open channel and away from the wall . In fact as a practical matter as a bubble flow rises brine is displaced and a corresponding downward flow of the surrounding brine occurs. A simple mass or volumetric analysis illustrates that as mass rises in the open channel a certain amount of the mass must go down and take its place. This results in a flow around each bubble as illustrated.

As a result of the formation of each bubble vapor leaves the brine . Salt the chemicals listed hereinabove that may be contained in the brine and the like may be volatile and nonvolatile. Such contaminants as methanol may evaporate into the vapor . However salts dissolved solids and the like must remain behind and do not evaporate.

Accordingly the flow around each bubble at the time of formation of the bubble necessarily receives the dissolved solids that cannot vaporize. Experiments on apparatus and methods in accordance with the invention demonstrate a downward flow of heavier brine resulting in a net gradient having the lowest concentration of dissolved solids at the top surface of the liquid or the liquid level and the highest concentration of dissolved solids at the bottom of the tank .

In general the height of the panel may be selected to optimize heat transfer. Likewise the distance or thickness across the wall may be selected for structural and thermal considerations. Similarly the width of the open channels may be selected in order that the bubbles coalescing together do not obstruct the channel nor dry the outer surface of the panel . Such drying of the surface may result in additional scaling and has been observed to exacerbate corrosion of the wall .

The width or thickness of the closed channel may be selected to optimize heat transfer and permit flow by natural convection thus limiting or eliminating the need of conventional heat exchange wherein pump energy is used to drive all flows. By contrast in the illustrated embodiment the open channel operates by a saline convection or dissolved solids convection with the brine. This is based on buoyance differentials between various flows and regions of the brine . Similarly the vapor within the closed channel as it condenses on the inner surface of the panel eventually forms a condensate collecting at the bottom thereof and exiting out the plenum for liquids.

It has been found that the height or distance between the top of the panel and the liquid level may be positive. In some embodiments it has been found that heat transfer rates may be effected by vigorous boiling of bubbles near the top of the panel . It has been found most effective in the presently contemplated embodiments as demonstrated by experiments to maintain the liquid level above the top of the panel .

The core will typically be spaced a distance from the outlet level of the tank . Typically a significant volume in the plenum above the liquid level tends to provide a volume against which the compressor may draw. Similarly a larger depth between the tank outlet level than herein illustrated schematically is desired.

The height is illustrated by a cut line indicating that any additional distance may be added therein. Though not shown in the illustration such an addition provides the possibility of increasing of highest density brines from the open channel toward the bottom of outlet level of the tank .

Nevertheless the activity within the tank and specifically when the open channels is a densification or increase in concentration of dissolved solids in the brine . It has been found generally that the region illustrated by the height of activity of the concentrating process is the region that sees the largest change in density profile. Accordingly the density within the height of the region below the panels does not show the intensity of the steepness of gradient.

Inasmuch as the plenums carry differential densities they are different sizes. In fact the upper plenum may be thought of as simply a manifold feeding vapor at a comparatively larger specific volume lower specific density into the closed channel . Similarly the condensate has a density almost 1 000 times greater than that of the vapor corresponding to a specific volume of about one thousandth of the volume of the vapor . Thus the manifold or plenum receiving condensate from the closed panel need not have the same volumetric capacity as the upper manifold

In general droplets form against the inside surface of the wall in the panel . Droplets tend to migrate downward and may likewise coalesce into streams or rivulets running into the condensate collected at the bottom of the panel resulting in condensate level accumulating in panel . The result of condensing vapor on the inner surface of the wall of the closed channel is a very high heat transfer rate on the order of 20 times greater than the heat transfer rate between liquids across a solid surface.

Thus for example the rate of heat transfer into the brine from the outer surface of the wall is lower when merely resulting in heat transfer into the liquid brine . In contrast the heat transfer rate and thus the heat transfer coefficient upon nucleate boiling with bubble formation is comparatively about 20 times that rate and corresponds to the condensation heat transfer rate on the inner surface of the wall in the panel enclosing the closed channel .

Referring to a chart illustrates axes . The height axis illustrates the height from the outlet level of the tank to above the liquid level including the plenum . Meanwhile the TDS axis or the total dissolved solids axis illustrates the concentration of total dissolved solids within the tank.

The curves are gradients or profiles of concentration or density. In the illustration of the location of the core is shown in dotted lines as is the outer shape of a tank . The outer level of the tank is illustrated along with that of the core in order to show the response of the density profile to the altitude or height along the height axis .

In the chart of the curves represent concentrations varying from a minimum amount corresponding to the value on the TDS axis at its minimum value at its intersection with the vertical axis or height axis . Meanwhile at the liquid level the concentration and therefore the density of brine in a tank is at a minimum value of dissolved solids in an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention.

However in a mixed environment one in which the brine in a tank is completely mixed a profile reduces to a vertical line having a constant concentration and constant density throughout from the liquid level to the outlet level . Thus the concentration at the liquid level is the same as that at the outlet concentration .

In an environment in which a gradient profile may be established ideally a static linear density profile may be established according to the curve . In this situation the concentration varies from a minimum value at the liquid level and increases to a maximum outlet concentration at the outlet level .

In order to establish the ideal gradient illustrated by the profile it would be necessary to maintain a continuous and equal change in concentration at substantially every level between the outlet level and the liquid level . This would require tremendous control though it would also provide a predictable and useful and consistent gradient in the tank .

Experimental results in an actual apparatus in accordance with the invention is illustrated in the dynamic density gradient profile . In this profile is seen the change in the density gradient within the core region as compared with the change indicated in the region below the core. Between the liquid level the bottom of the core and the outlet level the normalized concentration difference from the lowest concentration level at the liquid level continually increases to the outlet level .

Accordingly the outlet concentration level of both profiles and originate and terminate at equivalent points. In contrast however the density gradient curve is shown to stabilize in a different shape in which most of the concentration increase occurs within the altitude of the core and very little change occurs therebelow. Thus the region of the tank below the core may still maintain a gradient.

However in these experiments not nearly so substantial a total difference as that achieved within the core was observed. This is seen as indicating several facts including the fact that the core is the region in which the open channels are concentrating brine by evaporating off vapor . Below the core where no substantial vaporizing occurs the difference in concentration is substantially less.

In reviewing the chart of in view of the phenomena illustrated in one may ascertain the degree of mixing occurring within the open channels as opposed to elsewhere in the tank . Also to the extent that the diffuser of is located below the core brine convection or the brine density buoyant convection will occur.

Likewise for example brine incoming in the input flow is lighter than any brine within the tank . Thus regardless of the velocity with which the flow is introduced into the tank it will immediately begin to rise through the core or anywhere else within the tank that it is introduced.

Accordingly the brine buoyance plume created by the inlet brine flow will rise toward the liquid level exchanging momentum mass density and heat with the surrounding brine through which it passes. The dynamic density gradient profile therefore illustrates that the actual value of concentration or density within the tank is neither the ideal static linear density profile nor is it the mixed non gradient

Thus the dynamic density profile gradient is very useful in the control and stabilization of a system in accordance with the invention. Of course the ideal static linear density gradient would be very useful but difficult to achieve maintain or both. However experiments at this point demonstrate that moving away from the mixed non gradient condition illustrated in the curve can be achieved are easily maintained and provide very useful results.

Referring to a chart illustrates curves of an increase in total dissolved solids TDS as a function of the feed concentration thereof. The formula illustrates a normalized total dissolved solids increase represented by each of the curves . The curve represents the increase in total dissolved solids in the brine in the tank at the comparatively minimum feed concentration of dissolved solids in experiments with the apparatus in accordance with the invention.

In contrast the curve illustrates the increase in the normalized total dissolved solids content in the brine of the tank at the comparatively highest input concentration of dissolved solids in the experiments. The height axis as in again measures from the outlet level in the tank or of the tank up to above the liquid level .

The liquid level is the maximum height at which a general quantity of liquid brine exists in the tank . Accordingly only the plenum holding vapor exists immediately above the liquid level . Thus the dissolved solids content has a value at the liquid level . In the experimental system in accordance with the invention the lowest concentration of dissolved solids occurs at the liquid level . Thus all values measured along the axis are normalized against that minimum concentration of dissolved solids .

The shape of the curves reflects the change in rate of concentration increase with depth toward the outlet level . Thus curves reflect intermediate input TDS curves within the family of curves . The experimental data is contained in curves . However the consistent curvature obtained through multiple experiments illustrates that the concentration profile and gradient within the tank are independent from the output TDS.

For example the curve corresponds to input feed concentrations of 50 000 parts per million as well as feed concentrations of 100 000 parts per million ppm . Likewise the curve represents tank concentrations of 100 000 ppm and 200 000 ppm output brine concentrations. However the input dissolved solids concentration when closer to the outlet concentration of dissolved solids appears to have less effect on mixing.

Likewise the larger the discrepancy between the concentration at the inlet flow compared to the outlet brine flow shows a tendency of the more concentrated brine in a tank to rapidly dampen the effect on concentration by the incoming flow . Thus as the input TDS increases the curve moves from the curve toward the curve

Meanwhile minimum and maximum output concentrations of dissolved solids both result in the curve . Thus the normalized TDS increase is independent from the output concentration of total dissolved solids at the outlet concentration at the outlet level in the tank .

The curve corresponds to four sets of experimental data. Two experiments involved vapor recompression in an apparatus in accordance with the invention at a 50 000 ppm of brine input into a tank . In one pair of experiments the output brine concentration was near or at 200 000 parts per million the other 100 000 parts per million. Meanwhile the curve corresponds to two experiments in which the output TDS concentration was 200 000 parts per million. The input feed rate was 100 000 parts per million in each of those experiments and the outputs were 180 000 parts per million and 200 000 parts per million respectively.

Referring to a chart illustrates a distribution of temperature measured along the axis against a height measured along the axis . In the chart the average tank temperature is illustrated at various positions including the value of T or first temperature identified by the line and a second temperature or T at the line . Here the curve reflects the saturation temperature in a stratified concentration profile of the tank .

The curve illustrates the saturation temperature of a mixed brine in a tank . The difference between these curves and reflects the difference in saturation temperature as a function of stratified brine concentration versus completely mixed brine in accordance with Raoult s Law illustrated in . Both illustrate changes in saturation pressure with depth and density. Therefore the curves accommodate the depth difference at various locations within the tank .

Reference to are best understood when viewed together. is a chart illustrating saturation temperature differences between a saturation temperature in a stratified tank curve which is not a line but rather a non linear curve the saturation temperature curve describes a completely mixed tank . Thus these two curves correspond to the dynamic density profile curve of and the mixed non gradient curve of respectively.

The difference between the two curves is best understood by reference to Raoult s Law described in . Here the equation states that the change in saturation temperature within a brine is equal to the product of the ionic constant corresponding to the chemical constituents making up the brine with the ebullioscopic constant corresponding to the units of degrees celsius times kilograms divided by moles for water.

Similarly the Clausius Clapeyron equation describes the rate of change of pressure with temperature according to the dependents on the latent heat of vaporization divided by the temperature and the change in specific volume volume per unit mass . This equation may be written in several forms including one that indicates the change in pressure is equal to the pressure within the bulk fluid times a power of the natural log. In this last embodiment the coefficient m is at best isolated as the lower version of the equation in .

Thus Raoult s Law governs the change in saturation temperature due to the impurities within a liquid. The Clausius Clapeyron equation corresponds to the change in pressure as a function of temperature due to compression of a vapor.

Referring to Henry s Law describes the relationship between concentration of a solute dissolved gas dissolved in a solvent. Accordingly the concentration of a particularly species designated by the lower case letter i is a function of the partial pressure or vapor pressure of that constituent in a volume divided by the Henry s Law constant.

Thus Henry s Law describes how much of a supposedly non condensable gas is actually absorbed. Henry s Law also applies to other condensable gasses.

Therefore when considering the saturation temperature within the tank corresponds to a saturation pressure at any point depth within the tank . However the saturation pressure varies with the constituents dissolved in the brine the volatile ions thereof and the depth at which one is observing temperature pressure and so forth in accordance with the foregoing equations.

Still referring to while continuing to refer generally to the T and T average tank temperatures and merely serve as points of reference. The effects of the curves apply at any particular location or depth within the tank . Accordingly the tank temperature is significant to a local effect on the saturation temperature required to boil liquid to vapor in the channel . Thus the significance of the temperatures is actually their relationship to the localized saturation temperature as given by curves and .

Effectively the curve is a calculated value corresponding to the saturation temperature of the brine in a fully mixed tank . Thus the brine corresponding to the curve is fully mixed and corresponds to the profile as illustrated in and illustrates the absence of a profile or gradient.

At a tank temperature the saturation temperature corresponds to boiling liquid level or a boiling surface point . Remaining in a mixed condition and descending from the liquid level down toward the outlet level the saturation temperature rises to a maximum of . This rise is due to the head level or height of the liquid column above any particular location along the curve .

In this example the surface boiling point is at the surface exactly because there is no submersion below the liquid level so the saturation temperature by the definition of saturation temperature occurs at the boiling surface . In this example the saturation temperature curve takes into account Raoult s Law and its effect on the boiling temperature .

If the tank temperature is raised from the value to a higher temperature then the same head height is imposed by the liquid level . Thus the new boiling point corresponds to surface boiling into the plenum by the brine at the temperature value . Accordingly if the temperature profile or temperature curve were shifted to the right corresponding to the increased temperature the curve would only go through the point if the saturation pressure in the plenum also rose to the appropriate saturation pressure.

If the saturation pressure in the plenum does not rise then the region between the liquid level corresponding to point and the height along the axis corresponding to the point will all be boiling. In other words core nucleate boiling would occur in the upper core region of .

Nevertheless in another example one may think of the tank being at the average temperature and having the compressor draw down the vapor in the plenum . This would result in the drop of the saturation pressure. Accordingly having the plenum at the saturation pressure corresponding the curve while the average tank temperature is at the core region between the surface point and the point on the curve boils generally throughout.

The curve represents the saturation temperature existing in the a dynamic density profile or gradient in a tank . The curve intersects the tank average temperature at a point a condition wherein the saturation temperature within the tank is exactly at the tank average temperature. Likewise the point corresponds to the intersection of the saturation temperature curve and the elevated tank average temperature

These two tank temperatures are illustrated as constant throughout the altitude of a tank and are used merely by way of example. With a dynamic density profile see the stratification within the tank may create any one of a variety of temperature profiles. It is also possible to have a non constant temperature throughout the height of the tank . In other embodiments it may be possible to have reverse gradients in which the hottest temperature is at the bottom of the tank.

Again anytime the localized saturation temperature or is below a localized temperature or the like the brine in the tank at that location will be in boiling mode.

In assume that the pressure in the plenum is always at the same constant value throughout the following discussion. In the chart one may select a temperature within the tank .

Now consider the saturation temperature curve occurring with a gradient in accordance with the invention and represents the dynamic density profile of due to stratification of the brine in the tank . The intersection of this curve intersects the surface not at the point but at some point lower in temperature on axis . In accordance with the foregoing discussion boiling now begins as low as the point where the tank temperature intersects the saturation pressure of the brine gradient

Given this condition existing at point the entire region above point is in a full boiling condition with no additional energy introduced. In the configuration represented by the chart the fully mixed saturation temperature is set to boil at the surface . In contrast at the same tank temperature the stratified brine boils in the entire region above the point . Thus more of the core is involved in high heat transfer nucleate boiling as compared with that which would have been achieved in a completely mixed system.

Of course if temperature were raised in order to engage more of the core in boiling as would correspond to increasing the tank temperature to the value the point is the temperature value required in the tank.

However in the stratified condition corresponding to the curve the point reflects the point above which full nucleate boiling occurs throughout the core in the tank . Thus the region represents the additional benefit or the additional region of the core in which full nucleate boiling is generalized in the core as given by region .

Just as the region above the point represents the portion of the core in full nucleate boiling when the tank average temperature corresponds to the value this increased benefit continues at all points along the curve . Regardless of the depth of the region may be in a fully mixed tank corresponding the saturation temperature curve the stratified saturation temperature curve always provides an improved performance represented by region or by other corresponding differences between the two curves .

This benefit may be realized in one of several alternative ways such as the ability to run the system at a reduced temperature for the same performance. Alternatively the work done by the compressor may be reduced due to the decreased demands on the saturation pressure in the plenum above the liquid level .

Referring to an experimental system was configured with a housing having a motor generator system. Ultimately an auxiliary heater relying on line power was also included. The tank was set up with a core placed therein connected to an upper vapor manifold and a lower liquid condensate manifold . The core included open channels in liquid communication with the surrounding region of the tank while the closed channels were sealed away from the tank brine .

A plenum above the core accumulated vapors boiling from the open channels of the core . A mist eliminator not seen in was positioned within the plenum . Meanwhile a heat exchanger was installed but was not used in the experiments reported in . The conduits conducted vapor from the plenum to the compressor which then passed those vapors at an increased pressure into the vapor plenum or manifold

The manifold distributed the vapors into the closed channels of the panels for condensation. Condensate exited the closed channels through the bottom manifold as condensate. Ultimately after holding in a reservoir the distillate or condensate from the closed channels was eventually passed on to a distillate tank.

Above the core a plenum was arranged and contained a mist eliminator . After passing through the mist eliminator the vapor in the plenum was passed by a heat exchanger which was not active during the experiments reported in . Instead the vapor passed on into the conduit toward the compressor . The compressor increased the pressure and the temperature in the vapor passing the vapor at this increased temperature and pressure of saturation back into the manifold at the top of the core .

The manifold passed the vapors into the closed channels of the panels where it was condensed by discharging the latent heat of vaporization into the surrounding brine in the open channels of the tank .

The condensate was then passed from the closed channels into the manifold at the bottom of the core and ultimately discharged through a reservoir into a heat recovery system as illustrated in to a distillate tank which are not shown in .

Meanwhile the system was instrumented with sensors near the central geography of the core . Heaters were positioned along the walls of the tank . The motor driving the compressor was controlled through a control system that would vary current to the motor thus altering the velocity throughput and volumetric flow rate of the compressor .

The sensors were placed in the open channel at the center of the core . Likewise sensors were placed along the walls as illustrated and distributed schematically in . Sensors were configured to detect temperature and concentration within the brine of the tank in the core and near the wall . Other temperatures and pressures were detected in the plenum the conduits on the upstream side and downside stream side of the compressor and so forth. Various experiments were run on the apparatus of in the development of the data of .

Referring to a mass balance reflects the input of the flow rates introduced into the tank and the output flows exiting the brine heat exchanger as well as the quantities of distillate or condensate passed through the distillate heat exchanger to the distillate tank .

The experiments contributing to the charts of respectively correspond to the data obtained at the experimental conditions and the conditions at location and and the conditions at . The conditions correspond to an input feed of 50 000 parts per million. The output corresponds to a brine concentration of 100 000 parts per million in total dissolved solids exiting the tank .

Meanwhile the conditions and correspond to an input brine concentration of 50 000 parts per million and an output concentration of 200 000 parts per million. Likewise the conditions and correspond to an input concentration of 100 000 parts per million with an output concentration of 180 000 parts per million and 200 000 parts per million respectively.

The data conditions of the table of correspond to a constant output of distillate of 100 barrels 168 liters per day. Notwithstanding the output brine concentration for the conditions and were not only set at 200 000 the conditions under experiment were set at an output brine concentration of 180 000 parts per million.

Referring to the experiments corresponding to the conditions of were implemented in the system of . The chart of plots the normalized increase in total dissolved solids according to the formula illustrated thereon through the six experiments or the six sets of experimental conditions .

The normalized concentration of dissolved solids is illustrated on the TDS axis and plotted against the height from the outlet level up to the liquid level in the tank . The region above the liquid line or liquid level corresponds to the location just above the core which was completely immersed in brine .

The total dissolved solids value at the top of the brine or the liquid level is normalized or used as the normalization value for all the flows. Accordingly the normalized increase in total dissolved solids is expressed as a fraction above the concentration value at the liquid level .

As can be seen from the chart of the curves reflect the fit of data obtained. The curve corresponds to the fit of data to experiment and experiment . The curve is a fit to the experiment based on the conditions and . Likewise the curve is fit to the data corresponding to the conditions and

The curves correspond to the curves of . Meanwhile Fand Fare illustrated by their relative height along the height axis . One may note that the brine buoyancy plume effect was significant in altering the total dissolved solids within the gradient in the tank . Additional information is also available from the raw data charts corresponding to the experiments in .

For example at the location where the feed flows were introduced into the experimental tank no diffuser was available. Accordingly the flows were introduced as several pipes each injecting a horizontal jet of the input feed brine from the feed tank . Both momentum in the horizontal direction and the buoyancy forces vertically affected the integration of the input flow into the brine of the tank .

Moreover the experiment conditions and were intended to correspond to an output brine concentration of 200 000 parts per million. In contrast the conditions were intended to correspond to an output brine concentration of 100 000 parts per million. The effect of brine concentration in the input flow is significant. Where the brine concentration in the tank was four times that of the incoming brine flow the tank brine very quickly rectified the concentration of the incoming flow . Above the location of the feeds the curves match quite closely the raw data.

However in the vicinity of the incoming flows the disruptive effect of mixing is seen in the reduction of concentration below the curves . This suggests that the system is very robust. For example the curves are highly dependent on the incoming concentration of the incoming flow and exhibit virtually no dependence on the output concentration.

Thus the dynamic density profile see as detailed by the curves see may be relied upon to provide a stable predictable output condition for the system . The heat input and work into the compressor may be adjusted to accommodate the incoming feed flow to reach the output desire. Significantly the output result is not in substantial question.

The data of also substantiate the robust performance and resilience of the gradient in the tank in the face of wide variations in the incoming brine concentration. This is particularly significant in actual production facilities where the incoming brine flow may vary as fracture water production brine or the like. These data demonstrate that the output and control of the system need not be subject to such arbitrary inputs.

Referring to a chart illustrates the effect on temperature along the temperature axis at various levels of depth illustrated on the axis . Temperatures are not normalized to a non dimensional form as with other figures. Here the saturation temperature curves correspond to those of . These values reflect actual data from the experiments corresponding to . Here the point represents the saturation temperature at the surface or the liquid level in the tank . The conditions at the point constitute the saturation temperature at the liquid level for a fully mixed tank. This corresponds to the conditions of the curve .

Similarly the point represents a saturation temperature at the pressure in the plenum above the liquid level . Likewise saturation conditions at the liquid level along the curve the point corresponds to the curve of a saturation temperature existing at the pressure in the plenum for a dynamic gradient configuration of .

The empirical data of confirm the operational characteristics discussed with respect to . For example the region corresponds to the description of the region with respect to . Likewise the region . Similarly the region of is the difference between the depth of the region and the region .

This represents the advantage in heat transfer area and greatly multiplied heat transfer coefficient in the region of nucleate boiling in the core. The core is illustrated by dotted line surrounding a region reflecting the actual depth and position of the core in the tank during the experiments .

Referring to while continuing to refer generally to a process for controlling an apparatus in accordance with the invention may have several levels of control. For example a zero level represents balancing mass by a continuous process of tracking and adjusting the levels of liquid in the tank and in the distillate reservoir . These are directly observable and adjustable timely by conventional measurement and control techniques.

Meanwhile a level one control as well as a level two control and a level three control are illustrated. Level one control involves control of the work done by the compressor . In the illustrated process level one is seen as intervening in the operation of the process operating in the system .

A principal mechanism for control is reducing or otherwise changing the work done by the compressor in removing vapor from the plenum . Typically the reducing operation corresponds to a control intervention initiated in response to an undesired rise in the liquid level of the reservoir containing distillate. A change in the work done by the compressor causes a response in the system . For example reducing the work done by the compressor causes a rising pressure in the plenum . Likewise a decreasing mass flow rate will result through the compressor and out of the plenum . This is somewhat counterintuitive.

For example decreasing or reducing the work done by the compressor backs up pressure in the plenum causing core boiling to decrease and decreasing the distillate temperature and saturation pressure. These system responses result in a readjustment of the operation point of the system . Specifically this alters the pressure in the plenum thereby forcing a readjustment of saturation pressure and saturation temperature in the brine .

As a practical matter the process illustrated in is an example of controlling the system . Accordingly the most responsive element for controlling operation of the apparatus or system is the level one control .

Level two control or intervening in the level two control scheme involves adjusting the auxiliary heat provided by the auxiliary heater . In this example adjusting is embodied in decreasing auxiliary heat output by the auxiliary heater . This may be done by controlling the heater or the auxiliary heat source .

By decreasing auxiliary heat intervening follows the more rapid and responsive of the intervention . However in intervening at level two control the decrease in auxiliary heat results in a much slower response of the system. This includes a decreasing temperature in the tank decreasing mass flow rate of the distillate and decreasing core boiling.

The temperature is moved to the left in . However an excursion away from the curve will typically occur as a system response . By decreasing the auxiliary heat the temperature line moves to the left corresponding to a net cooling of the tank . The result of moving the line to the left is a decrease in the region and an increase of the region between the regions .

Perhaps the most significant effect of moving the temperature or decreasing the heat with its corresponding decrease in the temperature is to reduce the region by shifting the position of the intersection point at which the temperature line intersects the curve . Thus less of the core is involved in boiling. Accordingly a decreasing mass flow rate and a decreasing core boiling will occur as system responses in accordance with .

Intervening at the level three control as described in reference to may involve processing by a computer processor in order to provide a predictive trim to the other levels of control. Accordingly the controller may receive signals from any or all of the sensors . It may provide instructions commanding modifications to the work heat or optionally mass flow rates in the system.

Commanding an alteration to these independent control variables may result in alteration of the dependent variables. Accordingly feeding data back or providing feedback of values of pressure temperature mass flow rate concentration or the like will reflect the dependent variables on which the independent variables of work and heat are controlling.

In certain embodiments of an apparatus in accordance with the invention and a method in accordance therewith intervening at level three control may involve numerical methods implemented to predict and stabley step the commands to set points that are expected projected predicted or otherwise calculated to secure proper values of the dependent variables of pressure temperature mass flow rates and concentration at any particular point within the system .

Upon the intervening the system and particularly the controller may render a decision on whether or not the system is stable. If the system is stable continuing intervention of the level three control may involve trimming in a predictive fashion any independent variable necessary. However if the decision is that the system does not appear to be entirely stable the process may advance to detecting an event responsible.

For example if the system does not appear stable certain events are occurring that may be the effect of atmospheric pressure change in concentration in the input flows or the like. Any drifting of the system away from the predictive trim control of the intervention will typically be a result of an event altering the condition of the system .

Accordingly detecting the consequences will typically involve feedback from sensors of pressure temperature mass flow rate concentration a combination thereof or the relationships therebetween. For example the system may encounter a decrease in atmospheric pressure. Likewise the system may detect an increase in mass flow rate of distillate. In this example these changes will be detected by sensor and reported back to the controller as data inputs reflecting consequences of the event .

Following detecting these consequences activation of the control through the controller is appropriate. The level zero control is left out of the control loop of the process for purposes of illustration. The level zero control involves control of parameters that can easily be observed controlled and immediately affected. Adding liquid through adjustment of the rate of flow through a pump will result in increased flow into the tank . Likewise an increase in the speed of a pump may occur by slaving the control for the pump to the volumetric flow rate speed current or other control mechanism of the pump

In contrast determining exactly how much heat should be added to the auxiliary heater is not necessarily an intuitive process and is certainly not directly observable nor controllable manually or by a simple feedback sensor. The time of response for the temperature in the core or the tank is comparatively long e.g. 4.6 hours and the responsiveness of the compressor is so fast seconds that a measurement on a sensor in the plenum does not necessarily provide an obvious direction for intervention at levels one or two respectively.

The level zero control may also be trimmed by the intervention at level three. Slight adjustments may be made for losses miscalculations calibrations and the like. However as a practical matter the level zero control need not be included in the control loop of the process .

One way to consider the intervention at level three control is in terms of predicting what control parameters should be adjusted and in which direction they should be adjusted based on an algorithmic prediction of where the system needs to move so to speak. Thus rather than simply tracking a dependent variable and adjusting a single independent variable the predictive trim control intervention is very much a sophisticated function reflecting the sophisticated interrelationships between heat and mass transport within the system and among its many components.

Another way to think of the control process is with zero level of control maintaining a mass balance according to the first law of thermodynamics. The mass within a system must be the mass flowing in less the mass flowing out.

Likewise the intervention at the level one control represents an energy balance. That is modifying the work being input as the primary energy source in the operation of the system . That is heat from the auxiliary heater does not operate the system . Power or work by the compressor operates the system and makes up the energy losses required by the thermodynamic cycle thereof.

Intervention at the level two control actually is not a principle control of the system . Rather intervening by adjusting auxiliary heat is a mechanism for adjusting the operational parameters of the system in accordance with outside effects.

For example if a storm front rolls in then atmospheric pressure will decrease. Since the tank is not sealed as a pressure vessel the pressure in the plenum may track ambient or atmospheric pressure. A pressure drop in the plenum may easily be larger than the temperature differential being controlled above atmospheric in the plenum .

Thus intervening at level two involves adjusting the temperature of the tank brine in order to adjust the overall operation of the system to changing outside conditions. Intervening at level two may be resetting the system to adjust to a new steady state of operation within its environment. Environment cannot be controlled by the system. Rather the system must adjust to its environment and does so by the intervention . Therefore intervention is prospective to the extent that it is initiated as a result of intervening at level one. However it may still be directed to readjusting the parameters of the system so the system may arrive timely at a new and future equilibrium and steady state condition.

Thus intervening at level three of control is almost entirely predictive. All the lower levels of control are considered and the operational characteristics are modeled in order to determine the nonobvious set points to which independent variables must be set. Dependent variables thereby arrive at their steady state and proper conditions in the most effective and timely manner.

Thus each of the levels including intervention at level zero intervention at level one intervention at level two and intervention at level three abstract the control by the controller . Control moves further from direct values of measurable parameters and away from direct response to current conditions.

Another way to think of this control process is with level zero effectively independent closed loop control of a mass balance directly direct control of the value. Intervening at level one is asserting control over an independent variable directly and the dependent variable indirectly by a change in work.

Meanwhile intervening at level two involves addressing the parameters that affect the rate of change and the direction of change rather than affecting the observed variable itself. Finally intervening at level three involves predicting rates of change of rates of change of parameters to be controlled.

The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its fundamental functions or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the illustrative embodiments are to be embraced within their scope.
