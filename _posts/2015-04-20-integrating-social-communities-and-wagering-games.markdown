Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems and networks that more particularly integrate social communities and wagering games.

Wagering game machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Traditionally wagering game machines have been confined to physical buildings like casinos e.g. resort casinos roadside casinos etc. . The casinos are located in specific geographic locations that are authorized to present wagering games to casino patrons. However with the proliferation of interest and use of the Internet shrewd wagering game manufacturers have recognized that a global public network such as the Internet can reach to various locations of the world that have been authorized to present wagering games. Any individual with a personal computing device e.g. a personal computer a laptop a personal digital assistant a cell phone etc. can connect to the Internet and play wagering games. Consequently some wagering game manufacturers have created wagering games that can be processed by personal computing devices and offered via online casino websites online casinos . However online casinos face challenges and struggles. For instance online casinos have struggled to provide the excitement and entertainment that a real world casino environment provides. Some online casinos have struggled enforcing cross jurisdictional restrictions and requirements. Further some online casinos have struggled adapting the online gaming industry to a traditionally non wagering game business environment. As a result wagering game manufacturers casino operators and online game providers are constantly in need of innovative concepts that can make the online gaming industry appealing and profitable.

This description of the embodiments is divided into five sections. The first section provides an introduction to embodiments. The second section describes example operating environments while the third section describes example operations performed by some embodiments. The fourth section describes additional example operating environments while the fifth section presents some general comments.

Social communication is on the rise. Internet users are enjoying a proliferation of social networking mechanisms e.g. social network websites online chats blogging social network applications etc. that are appearing online in vast quantities. Many of those Internet users are also wagering game enthusiasts. Wagering games are also expanding in popularity. Many wagering game enthusiasts are demanding greater access to wagering games and content related to wagering games especially content that includes social networking. As stated previously some wagering game companies have created online wagering game websites that provide a way for wagering game enthusiasts to play wagering games while connected to the Internet e.g. via a web browser . Some online wagering game websites provide various features such as some social network functionality. Social network features for example allow wagering game players players to create user accounts with one or more unique identifiers that represent an online persona. One example of a unique identifier is an avatar . Avatars are graphical cartoon like depictions of a social network persona. These online personas and associated avatars add to the fun of belonging to a social network. Many online casinos however present an unsatisfactory wagering game experience to players who enjoy a more integrated gaming experience. Embodiments however present examples of integrating social networking mechanisms with wagering games and network gaming venues e.g. online casinos a wagering game websites wagering networks etc. . Embodiments can be presented over any type of communications network e.g. public or private that provides access to wagering games such as a website e.g. via wide area networks or WANs a private gaming network e.g. large area networks or LANs a file sharing networks a social network etc. or any combination of networks. Multiple users can be connected to the networks via computing devices. The multiple users can have accounts that subscribe to specific services such as account based wagering systems e.g. account based wagering game websites account based casino networks etc. . In some embodiments herein a user may be referred to as a player i.e. of wagering games and a player may be referred to interchangeably as a player account. Account based wagering systems utilize player accounts when transacting and performing activities at the computer level that are initiated by players. Therefore a player account represents the player at a computerized level. The player account can perform actions via computerized instructions. For example in some embodiments a player account may be referred to as performing an action controlling an item communicating information etc. Although a player or person may be activating a game control or device to perform the action control the item communicate the information etc. the player account at the computer level can be associated with the player and therefore any actions associated with the player can also be associated with the player account. Therefore for brevity to avoid having to describe the interconnection between player and player account in every instance a player account may be referred to herein in either context. Further in some embodiments herein the word gaming is used interchangeably with gambling .

Although describes some embodiments the following sections describe many other features and embodiments.

This section describes example operating environments and networks and presents structural aspects of some embodiments. More specifically this section includes discussion about wagering game system architectures.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a wagering game server configured to control wagering game content provide random numbers and communicate wagering game information account information and other information to and from a client . The wagering game server can include a content controller configured to manage and control content for the presentation of content on the client . For example the content controller can generate game results e.g. win loss values including win amounts for games played on the client . The content controller can communicate the game results to the client . The content controller can also generate random numbers and provide them to the client so that the client can generate game results. The wagering game server can also include a content store configured to contain content to present on the client . The wagering game server can also include an account manager configured to control information related to player accounts. For example the account manager can communicate wager amounts game results amounts e.g. win amounts bonus game amounts etc. to the account server .

The wagering game system architecture can also include a social network server configured to host social network accounts provide social network content control social network communications store associated social contacts etc.

Each component shown in the wagering game system architecture is shown as a separate and distinct element connected via the communications network . However some functions performed by one component could be performed by other components. For example the wagering game server can also be configured to perform functions of the social network gaming module and other network elements and or system devices. Furthermore the components shown may all be contained in one device but some or all may be included in or performed by multiple devices as in the configurations shown in or other configurations not shown. For example the account manager and the communication unit can be included in the client instead of or in addition to being a part of the wagering game server . Further in some embodiments the client can determine wagering game outcomes generate random numbers etc. instead of or in addition to the wagering game server .

As mentioned previously in some embodiments the client can take the form of a wagering game machine. Examples of wagering game machines can include floor standing models handheld mobile units bar top models workstation type console models surface computing machines etc. Further wagering game machines can be primarily dedicated for use in conducting wagering games or can include non dedicated devices such as mobile phones personal digital assistants personal computers etc.

In some embodiments clients and wagering game servers work together such that a client can be operated as a thin thick or intermediate client. For example one or more elements of game play may be controlled by the client or the wagering game servers server . Game play elements can include executable game code lookup tables configuration files game outcome audio or visual representations of the game game assets or the like. In a thin client example the wagering game server can perform functions such as determining game outcome or managing assets while the client can present a graphical representation of such outcome or asset modification to the user e.g. player . In a thick client example the client can determine game outcomes and communicate the outcomes to the wagering game server for recording or managing a player s account.

In some embodiments either the client or the wagering game server s can provide functionality that is not directly related to game play. For example account transactions and account rules may be managed centrally e.g. by the wagering game server s or locally e.g. by the client . Other functionality not directly related to game play may include power management presentation of advertising software or firmware updates system quality or security checks etc.

Furthermore the wagering game system architecture can be implemented as software hardware any combination thereof or other forms of embodiments not listed. For example any of the network components e.g. the clients servers etc. can include hardware and machine readable media including instructions for performing the operations described herein. Machine readable media includes any mechanism that provides i.e. stores and or transmits information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a wagering game machine computer etc. . For example tangible machine readable media includes read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory machines etc. Machine readable media also includes any media suitable for transmitting software over a network.

This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below some flow diagrams are described with reference to block diagrams presented herein. However in some embodiments the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.

In certain embodiments the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine readable media e.g. software while in other embodiments the operations can be performed by hardware and or other logic e.g. firmware . In some embodiments the operations can be performed in series while in other embodiments one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Moreover some embodiments can perform more or less than all the operations shown in any flow diagram.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a request to add a player to the online communal wagering game. For example the system can determine a need to collect more players into a wagering game such as a need to meet a minimum number requirement of players. Some wagering games may have set limits to players that can play based on game rules. In other embodiments the system may detect a request by a player to invite friends that are logged on as social network user accounts to social network websites. The system can present controls for players to invite their friends or other social contacts associated with their social network.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines one or more social network user account s available to play in the online communal wagering game. The system can search across social network websites wagering game websites and other locations to find players playing a similar game. The system can later aggregate the smaller groups into a larger group of players for the communal wagering game. In some embodiments the system can find players playing different games or find social network accounts that are currently logged on to their respective social networks and which have indicated a desire to join communal games when available. The system can determine whether the social network user account s are willing to enter the communal wagering game. For example the system can check settings set by the social network user account s which settings indicate certain types of games that the social network user account s want to play. The system can also send out invitations and determine whether social network user account s has accepted the invitation. In some embodiments the system can determine when some of the social network user account s manually indicate a desire to play the communal wagering game.

The flow continues at processing block where the system incorporates the social network user account s into the online communal wagering game as one or more players. In some embodiments when the system finds that the social network user account s are available to play the system can aggregate the social network user account s into the communal wagering game. A social network provider can provide the social network user account s . However the wagering game provider can provide one or more wagering game player account s to match up with the social network user account s and that the system can use to transact wagers and perform account related activities. illustrates an example of a communal gaming account controlled by the wagering game server . The wagering game server can provide wagering game services for a wagering game provider e.g. the fictitious online game provider Ultimate Gaming . The wagering game server can aggregate players for a communal wagering game connected to the communal gaming account . The players can be social network users from the social network servers and . Each of the social network servers and can control social network services from multiple different social network providers e.g. respectively the fictitious social network providers Friend Connect Group Space and My Community . The wagering game server receives account information for multiple separate social network accounts e.g. Marcus Miller from Friend Connect Jared Rice from My Community and Joaquin Cheveria from Group Space . The wagering game server can determine wagering game accounts for the social network accounts to use during the communal wagering game e.g. assign guest accounts determine that social network accounts have corresponding wagering game accounts require social network user accounts to register wagering game accounts etc. . For example the system determines that Marcus Miller is associated with the wagering game account for Poker Ace Jared Rice with the wagering game account for Big Bad Boy and Joaquin Cheveria with the wagering game account for CheGu104. The wagering game server can store identifying information for the social network user accounts and the player accounts within the communal gaming account . The wagering game server can store other information such as a social network source a location of the player a current bet for the player a type of the bet e.g. cash money play money points etc. and other information that the wagering game server uses to control the communal wagering game. In some embodiments the system can provide one or more wagering game provider funded bots in the communal wagering game e.g. Pistol Pete who is an Ultimate gaming Bot . In some embodiments the bots can be automated system controlled players that masquerade as real live players within the communal wagering game. In some embodiments the bots can be real live players that are gambling but that use wagering game provider s funds e.g. marketing dollars . The social network servers can provide connection data for the social network user account s . The wagering game server can receive the connection data for the social network user account s and use the connection data to connect the social network user account s to an online communal gaming session for the communal gaming account . The system can receive playing activity for the social network user account s as received from the social network servers and . The system can transact wagers based on the playing activity of the social network user account s . In some embodiments the wagering game server can provide online communal wagering game data to the social network servers and that control the social network user account s . Online communal wagering game data can include game content social communication functions social communication data accounting data license data subscription data application interface data game results etc. For example the system can provide a service for or syndicate shared games content features etc. to social network websites hosted by the social network servers and . The system can provide a subscription fee to the social network servers and to receive game content for the online communal wagering game. The social network servers and can present the communal wagering game content using the online communal wagering game data. In some embodiments the social network servers and can present their own social game s but receive results from other players that are not connected to the communal wagering game e.g. receive results from other players of other social networks that are connected via the wagering game provider and provide results activity etc. of the other players through the social network s own game interface. The system can control a central account for social network user accounts e.g. the communal gaming account and can link the social network user accounts into the central account for the online communal wagering game. The system can transfer money from the social network user accounts into the central account and can track virtual transactions during the communal wagering game. The system can transfer pre funded amounts of money variable amounts etc. The system can reconcile the various social network user accounts at the end of the communal wagering game or at periodic intervals through the communal wagering game. In some embodiments the system can receive social communication data directed between social network user accounts connected to the online communal wagering game. The system can use social communication control features e.g. chat controls provided by the social network servers and . The system can control the social communication data and provide a common infrastructure for social network user accounts from the different social network websites to communicate with each other. In some embodiments the system can provide tiers of service that successful players e.g. highest spending most points most games played etc. would be able to play.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a geographic location of the social network user account determines jurisdictional rules for the geographic location and controls the communal wagering game based on the jurisdictional rules. For example in the system can determine geographic locations for the social network user accounts determine jurisdictional rules for conducting wagering games for the geographic locations and control wagering functions wagering transactions betting restrictions payouts side bets and other gaming activity for the social network user account in the online communal wagering game based on the jurisdictional rules. For example in jurisdictions where wagering games are allowed online the system can conduct cash or monetary wagers. In jurisdictions where wagering games are not allowed the system can conduct non monetary compensation e.g. conduct play money wagers points or non cash wagers e.g. wagering points between players etc. . The system can aggregate players for different prizes e.g. monetary and non monetary depending on the geographic location of where the players are aggregated from e.g. their jurisdictional rules for the geographic location . Rules can vary for each jurisdiction e.g. per country pre region of the country etc. The system can determine the location of each player account and refer to rules for that jurisdiction regarding bet values bet types buy in values pay out types etc. For example when the system aggregates a player account from a social network the system can check the rules of the jurisdiction and determine an appropriate buy in value for the game. If the jurisdiction allows cash buy ins the system can check game rules and determine the current cash buy in values for the game and present options for the player to transaction a cash buy in. In other jurisdictions however where gambling for cash is not allowed the system can present options to utilize play money no value or points e.g. entertainment or customer appreciation points . The system can mirror the payouts to the buy ins e.g. cash buy in gets cash payout points pay in get points payout . In some embodiments the system can provide affiliate compensation to the social network servers and for providing social network user account. The system can split wagering or betting losses for the social network user accounts during wagering game play of the communal wagering game. The system can work with affiliate websites to drive traffic to the game provider site and provide compensation to the affiliate. The system can also gather data e.g. marketing research etc. from the various social network user accounts controlled by the social network servers and .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines that one or more social network accounts are available to play.

The flow continues at processing block where the system provides connection data to the online wagering game provider to connect the one or more social network user accounts to an online communal gaming session.

The flow continues at processing block where the system receives online communal wagering game data from the wagering game provider.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines jurisdictional rules and presents the online communal wagering game according to the jurisdictional rules using the online communal wagering game data. The system can present the online communal wagering game on an online communal wagering game interface in association with the social network provider e.g. on a social network website . illustrates an example of presenting a communal wagering game on two online communal wagering game interfaces communal game interfaces for different social network providers. In a wagering game system system includes a wagering game server connected to social network servers and via a communications network . The system can also include computer systems computers and also connected to the communications network . The wagering game server can host a wagering game provider website e.g. the Ultimate Gaming online casino website . The social network servers and can host separate social network websites e.g. the Friend Connect website and the My Community website . The computers and can present displays and of the social network websites. For example the computer can present the display of the Friend Connect website. A social network user e.g. Marcus Miller can be connected to a social network user account e.g. Marcus Miller s Friend Connect user account via the computer . The Marcus Miller social network user account can be from a first geographic location e.g. London England . A separate user e.g. Jared Rice can be connected to a separate social network user account e.g. Jared Rice s My Community user account via the computer . The Jared Rice social network user account can be from a second geographic location e.g. the State of Utah in the United States of America . The system can determine geographic locations by tracking IP addresses provided by the computers and and or their Internet providers computers. The computer can present the display of the My Community website. In some embodiments the wagering game server provides a communal wagering game application e.g. the Ultimate Gaming Black Jackpot Game that the social network server provides to the computer . The computer presents the communal wagering game application on the display . At the same time however the social network server does not receive the communal wagering game application . Instead the social network server provides its own content which is a social game application e.g. the My Community Black Jack Game that is similar in content to the communal wagering game application and which provides community game playing functionality similar to that provided by the communal wagering game application . For example the communal wagering game application and the social game application are both Blackjack type games. Both games provide similar functionality e.g. the ability to Hit Hold Bet etc. . However the communal wagering game application may present Blackjack content in a way that looks and functions slightly differently from the social game application e.g. the positioning of Hit Hold and Bet controls are different the money format for wagers is different the card face fonts and backs appear different the backgrounds of the games are different the games play different sounds and cause different visual affects to appear social communication features look and react differently etc. . The system can refer to jurisdictional rules when presenting information in the communal wagering game application . For instance the system refers to the jurisdictional rules and provides appropriate wagering controls descriptions and functionality to the communal wagering game application based on whether the jurisdiction allows for cash gambling. As an example the Marcus Miller social network user account is located in England which may allow for cash gambling on the Internet. As a result the system provides instructions to the communal wagering game application to present a cash wagering control e.g. Marcus Miller opted to buy in with cash so the communal wagering game application presents the cash wagering control as a cash meter . Concurrently the system can determine that the Jared Rice social network user account is in a jurisdiction that does not allow cash gambling via the Internet and thus presents a wagering control in the social game application that does not allow for cash betting. The wagering control can allow for a wager type that the user selected at the buy in stage of the game e.g. Jared Rice opted to buy in with points and thus the social game application presents the wagering control as a point meter . In some embodiments the My Community social website can redeem the points earned for cash or other values. For instance although some jurisdictions may not allow for person to person gambling via the Internet or gambling via specific wagering games the jurisdictions may allow for competitions using points where the highest points leader at the end of a competition period may win a cash prize. However the wagering game server provides communal game data to both the social network servers and based on the activity performed by the respective social network user accounts of the different social network servers and .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines playing activity for the one or more social network user accounts via the online communal wagering game interface associated with the social network provider and provides the player activity to the wagering game provider to transact the online communal wagering game. For example in as stated previously the wagering game server provides communal game data to both the social network servers and based on the activity performed by the respective social network user accounts of the different social network servers and . The social network servers and can use the communal game data to present similar game outcomes e.g. the same Blackjack hands for the respective players equivalent bet amounts etc. so that the social network user accounts receive and present the same game play of all users accounts connected to the communal wagering game. Further the social network servers and provide account connection data and player activity data to the wagering game server to process and coordinate communal wagering game play. In an example the player Marcus Miller may be situated in England and the communal wagering game application may be specially configured for presentation of money values in Euros instead of United States U.S. Dollars . Thus the Marcus Miller social network account may bet 5 and the cash wagering control shows 5. The wagering game server however can receive the 5 bet and convert the amount to an equivalent U.S. Dollar amount. The Jared Rice social network account may be situated in the United States or some other jurisdiction that utilizes U.S. Dollars as a standard form of currency and the social game application may present bets in a U.S. Dollar format. Thus the wagering game server presents communal game data that includes the converted bet amount e.g. from 5 to 7 based on a current exchange rate . The social game application can receive the communal game data and can pass the value of the bet amount to the social game application e.g. via an application programming interface communication to present on a graphical user interface associated with the social game application . The social game application thus presents the converted bet amount in a U.S. Dollar format e.g. 7 within an observational meter . The same processing can occur in reverse for bet amounts made by the Jared Rice social network user account if the Jared Rice social network user account were in a jurisdiction that allows for cash betting. The wagering game server could convert a bet from U.S. Dollars to Euros and provide communal game data that the communal wagering game application could present as Euros. In embodiments where the Jared Rice social network account is in a jurisdiction that does not allow cash betting in some circumstances the system may present the point amounts in an observational meter without any conversions to the point amounts. Thus in some embodiments the system can allow players to stay on their own social network websites after being aggregated into the communal wagering game and maintain the look and feel of the communal wagering game from the social network websites.

The flow continues at processing block where the system controls social communication and social wagering between social network user accounts. For example the system can provide social communication functionality in an online communal wagering game interface. In the system presents chat interfaces in connection with the communal wagering game e.g. a chat console of the communal wagering game application and a chat control of the social game application . The social network user accounts can use the chat interfaces to communicate with each other. For example the chat console can receive social communication data from the Marcus Miller social network user account social. The social network server can then provide the social communication data to the wagering game server to communicate to the social network server . The social network server can then provide the social communication data to the computer which presents the chat information using the chat control . In some embodiments the system can transact social wagers e.g. side bets between players. For example the Marcus Miller social network user account can indicate in the chat console a side bet challenge . The system can communicate the side bet challenge and present it in a message associated with the chat console . The message can indicate the amount of the side bet challenge . The system can convert bet amounts to match the currency format of Jared Rice s geographic location e.g. convert the 1 side bet amount to a 1.40 dollar amount or equivalent exchange rate value at the time . The system can determine from the jurisdictional rules restrictions on player to player betting. For instance in some jurisdictions group betting or wagering game betting may not be permitted but player to player betting may be permitted. In some embodiments the system can aggregate and segregate players based on friends certain demographics etc. The system can rely on player settings e.g. see chat settings console in to determine how to segregate players or features such as chat groups in connection with communal wagering games. In some embodiments the system can aggregate non play features from across websites e.g. social communication features community event notifications news feeds happy hour presentations instant messaging applications etc. as well as game related features e.g. group bonuses mystery bonuses additional games game replays etc. . In some embodiments the system can present player activity from other players e.g. scores bets leader boards etc. . For example the system presents a shared leader board e.g. leader board console and leader board control of the aggregated players showing wins points or any other features related to scores between players. In some embodiments the social communication features non play features and game related features can all be content that is licensed by the wagering game server . In some embodiments however the social communication features non play features and game related features can belong to the social network servers and but can integrate e.g. via API connection to a communal wagering game service provided by the wagering game server . Consequently the wagering game server can provide application interface data to the social network servers and to initialize a communal wagering game transfer data communicate data to applications respond to control information transact bets transfer accounting data etc. In some embodiments the system can embed and or respond to embedded content. For example the system can utilize embedded software or embedded content e.g. embedded YouTube video links . The system can insert embedded links into webpages for the social network servers and . In some embodiments the system can delegate authority and or receive delegated authority to access and use data from social network websites. For example the social network servers and can authorize the wagering game server to access and use social network user accounts. In return the wagering game server can authorize the social network servers and to access and use content communal game data social communication data etc.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a first social network user account connected to the online communal wagering game session and connects the first social network user account to an online social communication session. In some embodiments the system can present the one or more online social communication functions to the first social network user account via a first user interface on a social network website e.g. see the displays and in . The system can determine that the first social network user account utilizes controls to communicate socially with other accounts e.g. enters text in a text field hits the send button etc. . For example in the system determines that the Marcus Miller social network user account enters chat text into the chat console . In some embodiments the system can present a multitude of features that include social communication. illustrates an example social network user account interface account interface with a multitude of social communication features according to embodiments. In a wagering game system system includes a computer connected to a wagering game server and a social network server via a communications network . The computer presents a display of the account interface . The account interface is for a social network user account e.g. the Jared Rice account connected to the social network server for the social network provider My Community to receive and send social communications via an integrated wagering game console wagering game console e.g. a game console from Ultimate Gaming that appears when the social network user account for Jared Rice logs in to the My Community website . The wagering game console includes various features that are related to communal wagering games and social communications between wagering game players and social network users from other social network websites that also utilize an instance of the wagering game console . The wagering game console includes a game control for the social network user account to access and player wagering games from a wagering game provider e.g. from Ultimate Gaming . The wagering game console also includes a game replay console which the social network user account can use to replay wagering games from friends or other social contacts associated with the social network user account. The wagering game console also includes a community event news feed that presents events of interest across social networks related to gaming. For example a wagering game player may have won a jackpot or social network user account may host or sponsor a happy hour at a specific social network website or a wagering game website. In some embodiments the happy hour could be online a real world location e.g. a bar or a combination of the two. In some embodiments the system can provide functionality for the social network user to invite multiple persons to online happy hour and or to the social gathering. The system can provide levels of access to the happy hour including providing access to the online gathering for some individuals e.g. for VIPs while others only receive invitations to the real world location or vice versa. In some embodiments the system sends the information to the bar club or other establishment that provides for a social gathering. In some embodiments the establishment or other entity can sponsor the social gathering as well as the online happy hour website party. The wagering game console also includes a chat settings console that includes preferred chat filters or groupings that the social network user account prefers for chat options. The chat filters may include preference related to language demographics topical genres etc. The system can use the chat filters to aggregate players into communal groups for player wagering games and or for social communication possibilities during those games. For example the system may group only Portuguese players into a single communal wagering game based on a language preference setting on a language preference control . In other embodiments for example the system may group together players for a communal wagering game of all language preferences according to a demographic preference setting on a demographic preference control but at the same time may create chat subgroups within the communal wagering game based on the language preference. In some embodiments the system can limit the ability of social network users to communicate with other users if the specific topic of the conversation falls outside a specified topical genre or subject matter setting indicated by a genre preference control . There are many possible embodiments for preferences and settings that the system can use to filter chats aggregation etc. e.g. age religion gender profession sexual preference etc. . The wagering game console also includes a trading console that social network users can use to trade items including wagering game related items. The trading console will be referred to later in connection with below.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a request by the first social network user account via the one or more online social communication controls to communicate with a second social network user account. In some embodiments the first and second social network user accounts can belong to the same social network. The system can integrate with social connection applications that belong to the social network to connect the first and second social network user accounts. In some embodiments however the system can determine that the first social network user account selects a second social network user account that is connected to a second different social network. In some embodiments the system can filter a chat session based on settings for the first social network user account as described above. The system reads a setting that filters a chat audience to a specific group of social network users within the online social communication session. The setting can specify a common characteristic e.g. a common social characteristic or characteristic that indicates a commonality possessed by belonging to or desired by a specific social group . The system can use the setting to presents a chat audience of social network users that share the common characteristic e.g. as found in settings for the other users found in metadata or tags based on jurisdiction based on game play history based on language based on content that users are accessing etc. .

The flow continues at processing block where the system connects the second social network user account to the online social communication session and presents the social communication data to the second social network user account. In some embodiments the system can present one or more second online social communication controls to the second social network user account via a second user interface on a second or additional social network website. The second social network user account receives the social communication data from the first social network user account and presents the social communication data via the second user interface. The first social network user account and the second social network user account can communicate socially back and forth which connected to the online social communication session. In some embodiments the online social communication session can end when the communal wagering game session ends or when connection to a wagering game provider is disconnected. In some embodiments however the online social communication session can persist as a function of the social network provider s functionality.

The flow continues at processing block where the system presents jurisdictional wagering options for a wager included in the social communication data. For example referring back to the system can present the side bet challenge . The system can determine from the jurisdictional rules restrictions on player to player betting and present wagering options that are appropriate for cross jurisdictional player to player betting. For instance the social game application presents the message as well as bet options . The bet options relate to jurisdictional permissions and restrictions. For example the bet options can include an option to accept the side bet challenge and transact it directly through the social network applications should the jurisdictional rules permit direct player to player gambling. In another embodiment the options can include a directional link or other such mechanism that would direct the players to another method or venue for making a wager. For instance the system can present a link to a personal brokerage system e.g. PayPal or another forum that would permit person to person wagering agreements or that would direct the players to mechanisms belonging to nearby jurisdictions that would allow the person to person betting. In some embodiments the system could determine that person to person betting may be restricted in one or both jurisdictions for the players and may provide an option to alter the side bet challenge to comport with jurisdictional rules e.g. change the bet to points or some other form of non cash wagering .

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a first social network user account connected to a social network and connects the first social network user account to the communal trading session. In some embodiments the system can present the communal trading controls to the first social network user account via a first user interface on a social network website. The first social network user account can use the one or more communal trading controls to indicate a desire to trade items.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a request by the first social network user account to transact an exchange of one or more tradable wagering items with a second social network user account via the one or more communal trading controls. In some embodiments the tradable items are wagering game items that are stored in connection with a wagering game player account. The wagering game items can be items that a player account earned won received etc. via wagering in and playing wagering games. The wagering game items can include virtual assets e.g. trophies bonus content betting credits rights to play wagering games wagering game status points leader board status shared points etc. In some embodiments the tradable items may be non wagering game items such as social network points social network items social network privileges personal items files services virtual real estate virtual money etc. The first social network user account can use the one or more communal trading controls to select tradable items and to indicate trade partners and trade terms. For example in the trading console includes an items list a trade partner control and a trade chat console with a send control .

The flow continues at processing block where the system connects the second social network user account to the communal trading session and determines that the first social network account and the second social network user account agree to terms of exchange for the one or more tradable wagering items. In some embodiments the system can determine terms of the exchange via a trading console such as the trade chat console in . However in other embodiments the system can determine an agreement of trade terms via email third party action e.g. bank transactions personal escrow and trading accounts commercial auction websites etc. .

The flow continues at processing block where the system transacts the exchange of the one or more tradable wagering items according to the terms of exchange. In some embodiments the system can transfer items from one account to another e.g. from social network account to social network account . If the tradable items are wagering game items the system can transfer stored items from and or between wagering game player accounts associated with the social network accounts or from social network accounts to wagering game player accounts and vice versa. In some embodiments the system can transact money payments from one account to another. In some embodiments the system can transfer rights to participate in gaming activity from one account to another. In some embodiments the system can transact virtual currency. In some embodiments the system can provide controls for social network user accounts and or player accounts to buy items in a virtual world or to perform virtual activities e.g. play a shared game . The virtual items can increase player s abilities to perform better in communal wagering games. The system can also provide virtual currency to player accounts to use which they can later use via a communal trading session. For example in the social network player account Joaquin Cheveria from the Group Space website bets and receives awards for points instead of money. The jurisdiction for Joaquin Cheveria may prevent wagering gaming but can still provide non cash awards while the social network user plays games with other players that can play for cash. The system can track money and non money bets and awards and transact them accordingly while all players play in the same communal wagering game.
