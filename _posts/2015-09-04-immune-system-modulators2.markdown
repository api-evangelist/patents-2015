The invention relates to generally to the field of immunology. More particularly the invention relates to compositions and methods for altering immune function. More specifically the invention relates to compositions and methods for affecting immune stimulation mediated through Toll like receptor TLR molecules.

Stimulation of the immune system which includes stimulation of either or both innate immunity and adaptive immunity is a complex phenomenon that can result in either protective or adverse physiologic outcomes for the host. In recent years there has been increased interest in the mechanisms underlying innate immunity which is believed to initiate and support adaptive immunity. This interest has been fueled in part by the recent discovery of a family of highly conserved pattern recognition receptor proteins known as Toll like receptors TLRs believed to be involved in innate immunity as receptors for pathogen associated molecular patterns PAMPs and danger associated molecular patterns DAMPs . Compositions and methods useful for modulating innate immunity are therefore of great interest as they may affect therapeutic approaches to conditions involving autoimmunity inflammation atherosclerosis allergy asthma graft rejection graft versus host disease GvHD infection cancer and immunodeficiency.

Toll like receptors TLRs are a family of pattern recognition and signaling molecules involved in innate immunity. This family includes at least twelve members designated TLR1 TLR13 for which the function and specificity are known for most but not all members. Certain of these TLRs are known to signal in response to encounter with particular types of nucleic acid molecules. For example TLR9 signals in response to CpG containing DNA TLR3 signals in response to double stranded RNA and TLR7 and TLR8 signal in response to certain single stranded RNA. There have been a number of reports describing the immunostimulatory effect of certain types of nucleic acid molecules including CpG nucleic acids and double stranded RNA. Of note it was reported that Toll like receptor 9 TLR9 recognizes bacterial DNA and CpG DNA while TLR7 and 8 recognize single stranded RNA Hemmi H et al. 2000 408 740 5 Bauer S. et al. 2001 98 9237 42 Heil et al. 2004 303 1526. In addition to their natural ligands certain synthetic or artificial ligands for these nucleic acid responsive TLRs are also known. These include certain CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides CpG ODN oligoribonucleotides ORN and certain ORN analogs and certain small molecules including imiquimod R 837 and resiquimod R 848 . Imiquimod and resiquimod are classified as imidazoaminoquinoline 4 amines the former is currently marketed as Aldara by 3M Pharmaceuticals for topical treatment of anogenital warts associated with papillomavirus infection. In addition to their use in the treatment of certain viral infections such as papillomavirus certain TLR agonists are also believed to be useful as adjuvants antitumor agents and anti allergy agents. Because a number of diseases and conditions can be treated by enhancing innate immunity there is a continued need for additional and improved TLR agonists.

It was also recently reported that immune complexes containing IgG and nucleic acid can stimulate TLR9 and participate in B cell activation in certain autoimmune diseases. Leadbetter E. A. et al. 2002 416 595 8. Similar and additional documentation of these claims have been made for TLR7 8 and 9 reviewed in Sun S. et al. 2007 Inflammation and Allergy Drug Targets 6 223 235.

Compounds as immune system modulators bearing a pteridine core are described. The molecules described herein can alter TLR mediated immunostimulatory signaling by inhibiting TLR signaling and thus can be useful as inhibitors of immune stimulation. Compositions and methods described herein are useful for inhibiting immune stimulation in vitro and in vivo. Such compositions and methods thus are useful in a number of clinical applications including as pharmaceutical agents and methods for treating conditions involving unwanted immune activity including inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. The compositions of the invention can also be used in methods for the preparation of medicaments for use in the treatment of conditions involving unwanted immune activity including a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.

The entire contents of each of these patents and published patent applications is hereby incorporated by reference. The entire immunostimulatory nucleic acid can be unmethylated or portions may be unmethylated but at least the C of the 5 CG 3 must be unmethylated.

In one embodiment the CpG DNA is a CpG ODN that has a base sequence provided by 5 TCGTCGTTTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT 3 ODN 2006 SEQ ID NO 1 .

Chemokines specifically include without limitation IL 8 IP 10 I TAC RANTES MIP 1a MIP 1p Gro a Gro Gro y MCP 1 MCP 2 and MCP 3.

Most mature CD4 T helper cells can be categorized into cytokine associated cross regulatory subsets or phenotypes Th1 Th2 Th17 or Treg. Th1 cells are associated with IL 2 IL 3 IFN GM CSF and high levels of TNF a. Th2 cells are associated with IL 3 IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 9 IL 10 IL 13 GM CSF and low levels of TNF a. The Th1 subset promotes both cell mediated immunity and humoral immunity that is characterized by immunoglobulin class switching to IgG2a in mice. Th1 responses can also be associated with delayed type hypersensitivity and autoimmune disease. The Th2 subset induces primarily humoral immunity and induces immunoglobulin class switching to IgE and IgGI in mice. The antibody isotypes associated with Th1 responses generally have good neutralizing and opsonizing capabilities whereas those associated with Th2 responses are associated more with allergic responses.

Several factors have been shown to influence commitment to Th1 or Th2 profiles. The best characterized regulators are cytokines. IL 12 and IFN y are positive Th1 and negative Th2 regulators. IL 12 promotes IFN y production and IFN y provides positive feedback for IL 12. IL 4 and IL 10 appear to be required for the establishment of the Th2 cytokine profile and to down regulate Th1 cytokine production the effects of IL 4 are in some cases dominant over those of IL 12. IL 13 was shown to inhibit expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL 12 and TNF a by LPS induced monocytes in a way similar to IL 4.

As members of the pro inflammatory interleukin 1 receptor IL 1R family TLRs share homologies in their cytoplasmic domains called Toll IL 1R homology TIR domains. See PCT published applications PCT US98 08979 and PCT US01 16766. Intracellular signaling mechanisms mediated by TLRs appear generally similar with MyD88 and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 TRAF6 believed to have critical roles. Wesche H et al. 1997 Immunity 7 837 47 Medzhitov R et al. 1998 Mol Cell 2 253 8 Adachi O et al. 1998 Immunity 9 143 50 Kawai T et al. 1999 Immunity 11 115 22 Cao Z et al. 1996 Nature 383 443 6 Lomaga M A et al. 1999 Genes Dev 13 1015 24.

Briefly MyD88 is believed to act as an adapter molecule between the TIR domain of a TLR or IL 1R and IRAK which includes at least any one of IRAK 1 IRAK 2 IRAK 4 and IRAK M . MyD88 includes a C terminal Toll homology domain and an N terminal death domain. The Toll homology domain of MyD88 binds the TIR domain of TLR or IL 1R and the death domain of MyD88 binds the death domain of the serine kinase IRAK IRAK interacts with TRAF6 which acts as an entryway into at least two pathways one leading to activation of the transcription factor NF KB and another leading to activation of Jun and Fos members of the activator protein 1 AP 1 transcription factor family. Activation of NF KB involves the activation of TAK 1 a member of the MAP 3 kinase MAPK family and IKB kinases. The IoB kinases phosphorylate IKB leading to its degradation and the translocation of NF KB to the nucleus. Activation of Jun and Fos is believed to involve MAP kinase kinases MAPKKs and MAP kinases ERK p38 and JNK SAPK. Both NF KB and AP 1 are involved in controlling the transcription of a number of key immune response genes including genes for various cytokines and costimulatory molecules.

As used herein the terms TLR ligand and equivalently ligand for a TLR and TLR signaling agonist refer to a molecule other than a small molecule according to Formula I described herein that interacts directly or indirectly with a TLR through a TLR domain other than a TIR domain and induces TLR mediated signaling. In one embodiment a TLR ligand is a natural ligand i.e. a TLR ligand that is found in nature. In one embodiment a TLR ligand refers to a molecule other than a natural ligand of a TLR e.g. a molecule prepared by human activity. In one embodiment the TLR is TLR9 and the TLR signal agonist is a CpG nucleic acid.

Ligands for many but not all of the TLRs have been described. For instance it has been reported that TLR2 signals in response to peptidoglycan and lipopeptides. Yoshimura A et al. 1999 J Immunol 163 1 5 Brightbill H D et al. 1999 Science 285 732 6 Aliprantis A O et al. 1999 Science 285 736 9 Takeuchi O et al. 1999 Immunity 11 443 51 Underhill D M et al. 1999 Nature 401 811 5. TLR4 has been reported to signal in response to lipopolysaccharide LPS . See Hoshino K et al. 1999 Immunol 162 3749 52 Poltorak A et al. 1998 Science 282 2085 8 Medzhitov R et al. 1997 Nature 388 394 7. Bacterial flagellin has been reported to be a natural ligand for TLR5. See Hayashi F et al. 2001 Nature 410 1099 1103. TLR6 in conjunction with TLR2 has been reported to signal in response to proteoglycan. See Ozinsky A et al. 2000 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97 13766 71 Takeuchi O et al. 2001 Int Immunol 13 933 40.

Recently it was reported that TLR9 is a receptor for CpG DNA. Hemmi H et al. 2000 Nature 408 740 5 Bauer S et al. 2001 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98 9237 42. CpG DNA which includes bacterial DNA and synthetic DNA with CG dinucleotides in which cytosin is unmethylated is described in greater detail elsewhere herein. Marshak Rothstein and colleagues also recently reported their finding that TLR9 signaling can occur in certain autoimmune diseases in response to immune complexes containing IgG and chromatin. Leadbetter E A et al. 2002 Nature 416 595 8. Thus in a broader sense it appears that TLR9 can signal in response to self or non self nucleic acid either DNA or RNA when the nucleic acid is presented in a suitable context e.g. as part of an immune complex.

Recently it was reported that certain imidazoquinoline compounds having antiviral activity are ligands of TLR7 and TLR8. Hemmi H et al. 2002 Nat Immunol 3 196 200 Jurk M et al. 2002 Nat Immunol 3 499. Imidazoquinolines are potent synthetic activators of immune cells with antiviral and antitumor properties. Using macrophages from wildtype and MyD88 deficient mice Hemmi et al. recently reported that two imidazoquinolines imiquimod and resiquimod R848 induce tumor necrosis factor TNF and interleukin 12 IL 12 and activate NF KB only in wildtype cells consistent with activation through a TLR. Hemmi H et al. 2002 Nat Immunol 3 196 200. Macrophages from mice deficient in TLR7 but not other TLRs produced no detectable cytokines in response to these imidazoquinolines. In addition the imidazoquinolines induced dose dependent proliferation of splenic B cells and the activation of intracellular signaling cascades in cells from wildtype but not TLR7 mice. Luciferase analysis established that expression of human TLR7 but not TLR2 or TLR4 in human embryonic kidney cells results in NF KB activation in response to resiquimod. The findings of Hemmi et al. thus suggested that these imidazoquinoline compounds are non natural ligands of TLR7 that can induce signaling through TLR7. Recently it was reported that R848 is also a ligand for human TLR8. See Jurk M et al. 2002 Nat Immunol 3 499. Nat Immunol 3 499. It has also been reported that ssRNA is natural ligand and that aberrant stimulation of TLR7 and or TLR8 by RNA complexes is involved in autoimmunity.

It was recently reported that ligands of TLR3 include poly I C and double stranded RNA dsRNA . For purposes of this invention poly I C and double stranded RNA dsRNA are classified as oligonucleotide molecules. By stimulating kidney cells expressing one of a range of TLRs with poly I C Alexopoulou et al. reported that only cells expressing TLR3 respond by activating NF aB. See Alexopoulou L et al. 2001 Nature 413 732 8.

Alexopoulou et al. also reported that wildtype cells stimulated with poly I C activate NF KB and produce inflammatory cytokines IL 6 IL 12 and TNF a whereas the corresponding responses of TLR3 cells were significantly impaired. In contrast TLR3 cells responded equivalently to wildtype cells in response to lipopolysaccharide peptidoglycan and CpG dinucleotides. Analysis of MyD88 cells indicated that this adaptor protein is involved in dsRNA induced production of cytokines and proliferative responses although activation of NF KB and MAP kinases are not affected indicating distinct pathways for these cellular responses. Alexopoulou et al. proposed that TLR3 may have a role in host defense against viruses.

As used herein a cell expressing a TLR refers to any cell which expresses either naturally or artificially a functional TLR. A functional TLR is a full length TLR protein or a fragment thereof capable of inducing a signal in response to interaction with its ligand.

Generally the functional TLR will include at least a TLR ligand binding fragment of the extracellular domain of the full length TLR and at least a fragment of a TIR domain capable of interacting with another Toll homology domain containing polypeptide e.g. MyD88. In various embodiments the functional TLR is a full length TLR selected from TLR1 TLR2 TLR3 TLR4 TLR5 TLR6 TLR7 TLR8 TLR9 and TLR10.

In one aspect novel pteridine compounds are described. Applicants have surprisingly discovered pteridine compounds as immune system modulators. It is unexpected that the pteridine compounds as disclosed herein are useful in methods for inhibiting an immune response both in vitro and in vivo including methods for treating immune complex associated diseases and autoimmune disorders. In another aspect the invention provides novel pteridine compositions. As described further below these compositions and other pteridine compositions have been discovered to be useful in methods for inhibiting an immune response both in vitro and in vivo including methods for treating immune complex associated diseases and autoimmune disorders. It is also believed that the novel pteridine compositions as described herein can be used for prevention and treatment of malaria as well as for treatment of other diseases.

In certain embodiments the functional TLR is naturally expressed by a cell. Non limiting examples of cells expressing TLR include RPMI 8226 cell line.

In one embodiment the cell naturally expresses functional TLR and is an isolated cell from human multiple myeloma cell line RPMI 8226 ATCC CCL 155 American Type Culture Collection ATCC Manassas Va. . This cell line was established from the peripheral blood of a 61 year old man at the time of diagnosis of multiple myeloma IgG lambda type . Matsuoka Y et al. 1967 125 1246 50. RPMI 8226 was previously reported as responsive to CpG nucleic acids as evidenced by the induction of IL 6 protein and IL 12p40 mRNA. Takeshita F et al. 2000 30 108 16 Takeshita F et al. 2000 30 1967 76. Takeshita et al. used the cell line solely to study promoter constructs in order to identify transcription factor binding sites important for CpG nucleic acid signaling. It is now known that RPMI 8226 cells secrete a number of other chemokines and cytokines including IL 8 IL 10 and IP 10 in response to immunostimulatory nucleic acids. Because this cell line expresses TLR9 through which immunostimulatory nucleic acids such as for example CpG nucleic acids mediate their effects it is a suitable cell line for use in the methods of the invention relating to CpG nucleic acids as reference and test compounds as well as to other TLR9 ligands.

Similar to peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs the RPMI 8226 cell line has been observed to upregulate its cell surface expression of markers such as CD71 CD86 and HLA DR in response to CpG nucleic acid exposure. This has been observed by flow cytometric analysis of the cell line. Accordingly the methods provided herein can be structured to use appropriately selected cell surface marker expression as a readout in addition to or in place of chemokine or cytokine production or other readouts described elsewhere herein.

The RPMI 8226 cell line has also been found to respond to certain small molecules including imidazoquinoline compounds. For example incubation of RPMI 8226 cells with the imidazoquinoline compound R848 resiquimod induces IL 8 IL 10 and IP 10 production. It has recently been reported that R848 mediates its immunostimulatory effects through TLR7 and TLR8. The ability of RPMI 8226 to respond to R848 suggests that the RPMI 8226 cell line also expresses TLR7 as previously reported for normal human B cells.

The RPMI cell line can be used in unmodified form or in a modified form. In one embodiment the RPMI 8226 cell is transfected with a reporter construct. Preferably the cell is stably transfected with the reporter construct. The reporter construct generally includes a promoter a coding sequence and a polyadenylation signal. The coding sequence can include a reporter sequence selected from the group consisting of an enzyme e.g. luciferase alkaline phosphatase beta galactosidase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase CAT secreted alkaline phosphatase etc. a bioluminescence marker e.g. green fluorescent protein GFP U.S. Pat. No. 5 491 084 etc. a surface expressed molecule e.g. CD25 a secreted molecule e.g. IL 8 IL 12 p40 TNF etc. and other detectable protein products known to those of skill in the art. Preferably the coding sequence encodes a protein having a level or an activity that is quantifiable.

In certain embodiments the functional TLR is artificially expressed including over expressed by a cell for example by introduction into the cell of an expression vector bearing a coding sequence for the functional TLR wherein the coding sequence is operably linked to a gene expression sequence. As used herein a coding sequence and the gene expression sequence are said to be operably linked when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or transcription and or translation of the coding sequence under the influence or control of the gene expression sequence. Two DNA sequences are said to be operably linked if induction of a promoter in the 5 gene expression sequence results in the transcription of the coding sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not 1 result in the introduction of a frame shift mutation 2 interfere with the ability of the promoter region to direct the transcription of the coding sequence or 3 interfere with the ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus a gene expression sequence would be operably linked to a coding sequence if the gene expression sequence were capable of effecting transcription of that coding sequence such that the resulting transcript is translated into the desired protein or polypeptide.

In some embodiments a coding sequence refers to a nucleic acid sequence coding for a functional TLR. In some embodiments a coding sequence refers to a nucleic acid sequence coding for a reporter.

A cell that artificially expresses a functional TLR can be a cell that does not express the functional TLR but for the TLR expression vector. For example human 293 fibroblasts ATCC CRL 1573 do not express TLR3 TLR7 TLR8 or TLR9. As described in the examples below such cells can be transiently or stably transfected with suitable expression vector or vectors so as to yield cells that do express TLR3 TLR7 TLR8 TLR9 or any combination thereof. Alternatively a cell that artificially expresses a functional TLR can be a cell that expresses the functional TLR at a significantly higher level with the TLR expression vector than it does without the TLR expression vector.

For use in the methods of the instant invention a cell that artificially expresses a functional TLR is preferably a stably transfected cell that expresses the functional TLR. Such a cell can also be stably transfected with a suitable reporter construct.

The methods of the invention can be assessed using any of a number of possible readout systems based upon a TLR IL 1R signal transduction pathway. In some embodiments the readout for the method is based on the use of native genes or alternatively transfected or otherwise artificially introduced reporter gene constructs which are responsive to the TLR IL 1R signal transduction pathway involving MyD88 TRAF p38 and or ERK. H cker H et al. 1999 18 6973 82. These pathways activate kinases including B kinase complex and c Jun N terminal kinases. Thus reporter genes and reporter gene constructs particularly useful for the assays include e.g. a reporter gene operably linked to a promoter sensitive to NF B. Examples of such promoters include without limitation those for NF B IL 113 IL 6 IL 8 IL 12 p40 IP 10 CD80 CD86 and TNF . The reporter gene operably linked to the TLR sensitive promoter can include without limitation an enzyme e.g. luciferase alkaline phosphatase galactosidase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase CAT etc. a bioluminescence marker e.g. green fluorescent protein GFP e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 491 084 blue fluorescent protein BFP e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 486 382 etc. a surface expressed molecule e.g. CD25 CD80 CD86 and or a secreted molecule e.g. IL 1 IL 6 IL 8 IL 12 p40 TNF . In certain embodiments the reporter is selected from IL 8 TNF NF B luciferase NF B luc H cker H et al. 1999 18 6973 82 IL 12 p40 luc Murphy T L et al. 1995 15 5258 67 and TNF luc H cker H et al. 1999 18 6973 82 . In assays relying on enzyme activity readout substrate can be supplied as part of the assay and detection can involve measurement of chemiluminescence fluorescence color development incorporation of radioactive label drug resistance or other marker of enzyme activity. For assays relying on surface expression of a molecule detection can be accomplished using flow cytometry e.g. FACS analysis or functional assays. Secreted molecules can be assayed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA or bioassays. Many of these and other suitable readout systems are well known in the art and are commercially available.

A cell expressing a functional TLR and useful for the methods of the invention has in some embodiments an expression vector including an isolated nucleic acid which encodes a reporter construct useful for detecting TLR signaling. The expression vector including an isolated nucleic acid which encodes a reporter construct useful for detecting TLR signaling can include a reporter gene under control of a promoter response element enhancer element . In some embodiments the promoter response element is associated with a minimal promoter responsive to a transcription factor believed by the applicant to be activated as a consequence of TLR signaling. Examples of such minimal promoters include without limitation promoters for the following genes AP 1 NF B ATF2 IRF3 and IRF7. These minimal promoters contain corresponding promoter response elements sensitive to AP 1 NF B ATF2 IRF3 and IRF7 respectively. In other embodiments the expression vector including an isolated nucleic acid which encodes a reporter construct useful for detecting TLR signaling can include a gene under control of a promoter response element selected from response elements sensitive to IL 6 IL 8 IL 12 p40 subunit a type I IFN RANTES TNF IP 10 I TAC and interferon stimulated response element ISRE . The promoter response element generally will be present in multiple copies e.g. as tandem repeats. For example in one reporter construct coding sequence for luciferase is under control of an upstream 6 tandem repeat of NF B response element. In some embodiments an ISRE luciferase reporter construct useful in the invention is available from Stratagene catalog no. 219092 and includes a 5 ISRE tandem repeat joined to a TATA box upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. As described herein the reporter itself can be any gene product suitable for detection by methods recognized in the art. Such methods for detection can include for example measurement of spontaneous or stimulated light emission enzyme activity expression of a soluble molecule expression of a cell surface molecule etc.

Readouts typically involve usual elements of Toll IL 1R signaling e.g. MyD88 TRAF and IRAK molecules although in the case of TLR3 the role of MyD88 is less clear than for other TLR family members. As described herein such responses include the induction of a gene under control of a specific promoter such as a NF B promoter increases in particular cytokine levels increases in particular chemokine levels etc. The gene under the control of the NF B promoter can be a gene which naturally includes an NF B promoter or it can be a gene in a construct in which an NF B promoter has been inserted. Genes and constructs which include the NF B promoter include but are not limited to IL 8 IL 12 p40 NF B luc IL 12 p40 luc and TNF luc.

Increases in cytokine levels can result from increased production increased stability increased secretion or any combination of the forgoing of the cytokine in response to the TLR mediated signaling. Cytokines generally include without limitation IL 1 IL 2 IL 3 IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 7 IL 10 IL 11 IL 12 IL 13 IL 15 IL 18 IFN IFN IFN TNF GM CSF G CSF M CSF. Th1 cytokines include but are not limited to IL 2 IFN and IL 12. Th2 cytokines include but are not limited to IL 4 IL 5 and IL 10.

Increases in chemokine levels can result from increased production increased stability increased secretion or any combination of the forgoing of the chemokine in response to the TLR mediated signaling. Chemokines of particular significance in the invention include but are not limited to CCL5 RANTES CXCL9 Mig CXCL10 IP 10 and CXCL11 I TAC IL 8 and MCP 1.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as used herein means a pharmaceutically acceptable material composition or vehicle such as a liquid or solid filler diluent excipient solvent or encapsulating material involved in carrying or transporting the subject pharmaceutical agent from one organ or portion of the body to another organ or portion of the body. Each carrier must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sugars such as lactose glucose and sucrose starches such as corn starch and potato starch cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate powdered tragacanth malt gelatin talc excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes oils such as peanut oil cottonseed oil safflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil glycols such as butylene glycol polyols such as glycerin sorbitol mannitol and polyethylene glycol esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate agar buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide alginic acid pyrogen free water isotonic saline Ringer s solution ethyl alcohol phosphate buffer solutions and other non toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations. The term carrier denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient natural or synthetic with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being comingled with the compounds of the present invention and with each other in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair the desired pharmaceutical efficiency.

As set out above certain embodiments of the present pharmaceutical agents may be provided in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salt in this respect refers to the relatively non toxic inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention or by separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Representative salts include the hydrobromide hydrochloride sulfate bisulfate phosphate nitrate acetate valerate oleate palmitate stearate laurate benzoate lactate phosphate tosylate citrate maleate fumarate succinate tartrate napthylate mesylate glucoheptonate lactobionate and laurylsulphonate salts and the like. See for example Berge et al. 1977 Pharmaceutical Salts 66 1 19. 

The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the subject compounds include the conventional nontoxic salts or quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds e.g. from non toxic organic or inorganic acids. For example such conventional nontoxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloride hydrobromic sulfuric sulfamic phosphoric nitric and the like and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic butionic succinic glycolic stearic lactic malic tartaric citric ascorbic palmitic maleic hydroxymaleic phenylacetic glutamic benzoic salicyclic sulfanilic 2 acetoxybenzoic fumaric toluenesulfonic methanesulfonic ethane disulfonic oxalic isothionic and the like.

In other cases the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more acidic functional groups and thus are capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceutically acceptable bases. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts in these instances refers to the relatively non toxic inorganic and organic base addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can likewise be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free acid form with a suitable base such as the hydroxide carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation with ammonia or with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic primary secondary or tertiary amine Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium sodium potassium calcium magnesium and aluminum salts and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine diethylamine ethylenediamine ethanolamine diethanolamine piperazine and the like.

Formulations of the present invention include those suitable for oral nasal topical including buccal and sublingual rectal vaginal and or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally out of 100 this amount will range from about 1 to about 99 of active ingredient preferably from about 5 to about 70 most preferably from about 10 to about 30 .

Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and optionally one or more accessory ingredients.

A tablet may be made by compression or molding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder for example gelatin or hydroxybutylmethyl cellulose lubricant inert diluent preservative disintegrant for example sodium starch glycolate or cross linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.

The tablets and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention such as dragees capsules pills and granules may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using for example hydroxybutylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile other polymer matrices liposomes and or microspheres. They may be sterilized by for example filtration through a bacteria retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient s only or preferentially in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract optionally in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro encapsulated form if appropriate with one or more of the above described excipients.

Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds of the invention include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions micro emulsions solutions suspensions syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as for example water or other solvents solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol isobutyl alcohol ethyl carbonate ethyl acetate benzyl alcohol benzyl benzoate butylene glycol 1 3 butylene glycol oils in particular cottonseed groundnut corn germ olive castor and sesame oils glycerol tetrahydrofuryl alcohol polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof. Additionally cyclodextrins e.g. hydroxybutyl cyclodextrin may be used to solubilize compounds.

Besides inert diluents the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents emulsifying and suspending agents sweetening flavoring coloring perfuming and preservative agents.

Suspensions in addition to the active compounds may contain suspending agents as for example ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters microcrystalline cellulose aluminum metahydroxide bentonite agar agar and tragacanth and mixtures thereof

Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository which may be prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the invention with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising for example cocoa butter polyethylene glycol a suppository wax or a salicylate and which is solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active pharmaceutical agents of the invention.

Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries tampons creams gels pastes foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.

Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include powders sprays ointments pastes creams lotions gels solutions patches and inhalants.

Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons such as butane and butane.

Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound of the present invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the pharmaceutical agents in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the pharmaceutical agents of the invention across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.

Ophthalmic formulations eye ointments powders solutions and the like are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.

Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions dispersions suspensions or emulsions or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use which may contain antioxidants buffers bacteriostats solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.

In some cases in order to prolong the effect of a drug it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which in turn may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. One strategy for depot injections includes the use of polyethylene oxide polybutylene oxide copolymers wherein the vehicle is fluid at room temperature and solidifies at body temperature.

Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsuled matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or micro emulsions which are compatible with body tissue.

When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals to humans and animals they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing for example 0.1 to 99.5 more preferably 0.5 to 90 of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies that is the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can be administered concurrently with prior to or subsequent to one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies therapeutics or procedures to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder for example the compound of the present invention may be administered concurrently with another anti inflammatory or immunosuppressant agent such as but not limited to NSAIDS DMARDS Steroids or biologics such as antibody therapies or they may achieve different effects e.g. control of any adverse effects .

For treatment of a patient depending on activity of the compound manner of administration purpose of the administration i.e. prophylactic or therapeutic nature and severity of the disorder age and body weight of the patient different doses may be necessary. The administration of a given dose can be carried out both by single administration in the form of an individual dose unit or else several smaller dose units. Repeated and multiple administration of doses at specific intervals of days weeks or months apart are also contemplated by the invention.

The compositions can be administered per se neat or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable but non pharmaceutically acceptable salts can conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include but are not limited to those prepared from the following acids hydrochloric hydrobromic sulphuric nitric phosphoric maleic acetic salicylic p toluene sulphonic tartaric citric methane sulphonic formic malonic succinic naphthalene 2 sulphonic and benzene sulphonic.

Carrier formulations suitable for subcutaneous intramuscular intraperitoneal intravenous etc. administrations can be found in Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa.

The compounds useful in the invention can be delivered in mixtures of more than two such compounds. A mixture can further include one or more adjuvants in addition to the combination of compounds.

A variety of administration routes is available. The particular mode selected will depend of course upon the particular compound selected the age and general health status of the subject the particular condition being treated and the dosage required for therapeutic efficacy. The methods of this invention generally speaking can be practiced using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable meaning any mode that produces effective levels of response without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. Preferred modes of administration are discussed above.

The compositions can conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and can be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the compounds into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the compounds into association with a liquid carrier a finely divided solid carrier or both and then if necessary shaping the product.

Other delivery systems can include time release delayed release or sustained release delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compounds increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

HEK Blue hTLR9 cells were obtained from InvivoGen Inc. and used to determine test compound antagonism of human TLR9 hTLR9 driven responses. HEK Blue hTLR9 cells are designed for studying the stimulation of human TLR9 by monitoring the activation of NF kB. As described by the manufacturer HEK Blue hTLR9 cells were obtained by co transfection of the hTLR9 gene and an optimized secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase SEAP reporter gene into HEK293 cells. The SEAP reporter gene is placed under the control of the IFN b minimal promoter fused to five NF kB and AP 1 binding sites. Stimulation with a TLR9 ligand activates NF kB and AP 1 which induces the production of SEAP. Levels of SEAP can be easily determined with QUANTI Blue a detection medium that turns purple blue in the presence of alkaline phosphatase .

A cell suspension of HEK Blue hTLR9 cells at 450 000 cells per ml in test medium which contained 5 v v heat inactivated FBS was prepared. 180 ul of cell suspension 80 000 cells was added per well of a flat bottom 96 well plate and place in an incubator at 37 C. for overnight.

Test compounds were serially diluted in test medium generally starting at 10 uM and diluting by 3 fold in a 96 well master plate. 20 ul of diluted test compound was transferred using a 12 channel multi channel pipet to the cell plate and incubated at 37 C. for 1 hour. Then 20 ul of an hTLR9 agonist such as ODN 2006 1 uM was added to each well and the plate incubated at 37 C. overnight.

Invivogen s QUANTI Blue was prepared following the manufacturer s instructions. 180 ml of resuspended QUANTI Blue was added per well of a flat bottom 96 well plate. 20 ul per well of induced HEK Blue hTLR9 cells supernatant was then added to the plate and the plate was incubated at 37 C. for 1 3 h. SEAP levels were determined using a spectrophotometer at 620 nm.

The concentration dependent inhibition of hTLR9 dependent SEAP production was expressed as the concentration of compound which produced half the maximal level of SEAP induced by the hTLR agonist alone. Percent activity was calculated for each observation using the formula activity observed O.D. background O.D. agonist only O.D. background O.D. 100. The 50 inhibitory concentration IC was calculated by using a 4 parameter Hill plot sigmoidal curve fit where the inflection point of the sigmoidal curve is defined as the point of 50 activity. The results are shown in Table 4.
