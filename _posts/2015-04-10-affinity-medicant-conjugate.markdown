An intact antibody has primarily two regions a variable region and a constant region. The variable region binds to and interacts with a target antigen. The variable region includes a complementary determinusng region CDR that recognizes and binds to a specific binding site on a particular antigen. The constant region may be recognized by and interact with the immune system. An antibody can be of any type or class e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD and IgA or subclass e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2 . The antibody can be derived from any suitable species. In some embodiments the antibody is of human or murine origin. An antibody can be for example human humanized or chimeric.

As used herein the terms specifically binds and specific binding refer to antibody binding to a predetermined antigen. Typically the antibody binds with an affinity of at least about 1 10M and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity that is at least two fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non specific antigen e.g. Bovine Serum Albumin casein other than the predetermined antigen or a closely related antigen.

As used herein the term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts and includes chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical to or homologous with the corresponding sequence of antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical to or homologous with the corresponding sequences of antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.

As used herein an intact antibody is one which comprises an antigen binding variable region as well as a light chain constant domain C and heavy chain constant domains C C Cand C as appropriate for the antibody class. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains e.g. human native sequence constant domains or amino acid sequence variants thereof.

As used herein the term an intact antibody may have one or more effector functions which refers to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region e.g. a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include complement dependent cytotoxicity antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity AMCC and antibody dependent cell mediated phagocytosis.

As used herein the term an antibody fragment comprises a portion of an intact antibody preferably comprising the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments di abodies tri abodies tetrabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules scFv scFv Fc multi specific antibody fragments formed from antibody fragment s a fragment s produced by a Fab expression library or an epitope binding fragments of any of the above which immuno specifically bind to a target antigen e.g. a cancer cell antigen a viral antigen or a microbial antigen .

As used herein the term variable in the context of an antibody refers to certain portions of the variable domains of the antibody that differ extensively in sequence and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. This variability is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the Framework Regions FRs . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs connected by three hypervariable regions.

As used herein the term hypervariable region when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a complementarity determining region or CDR e.g. residues 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 in the light chain variable domain and 31 35 H1 50 65 H2 and 95 102 L3 in the heavy chain variable domain and or those residues from a hypervariable loop e.g. residues 26 32 L1 50 52 L2 and 91 96 L3 in the light chain variable domain and 26 32 H1 53 55 142 and 96 101 H3 in the heavy chain variable domain. FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.

As used herein a single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragment comprises the Vand Vdomains of an antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Typically the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding.

As used herein the term di abody refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a variable heavy domain V connected to a variable light domain V in the same polypeptide chain. By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites.

As used herein Humanized forms of non human e.g. rodent antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

As used herein isolated means separated from other components of a a natural source such as a plant or animal cell or cell culture or b a synthetic organic chemical reaction mixture. As used herein purified means that when isolated the isolate contains at least 95 and in another aspect at least 98 of a compound e.g. a conjugate by weight of the isolate.

As used herein an isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or non proteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or non reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

As used herein an antibody which induces apoptosis is one which induces programmed cell death as determined by binding of annexin V fragmentation of DNA cell shrinkage dilation of endoplasmic reticulum cell fragmentation and or formation of membrane vesicles called apoptotic bodies . The cell is a tumor cell e.g. a breast ovarian stomach endometrial salivary gland lung kidney colon thyroid pancreatic or bladder cell. Various methods are available for evaluating the cellular events associated with apoptosis. For example phosphatidyl serine PS translocation can be measured by annexin binding DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through DNA laddering and nuclear chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any increase in hypodiploid cells.

As used herein the term therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount of a medicant effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer the therapeutically effective amount of the medicant may reduce the number of cancer cells reduce the tumor size inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the medicant may inhibit the growth of and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy efficacy can for example be measured by assessing the time to disease progression TTP and or determining the response rate RR .

As used herein the term substantial amount refers to a majority i.e. greater than approximately fifty per cent 50 of a population of a mixture or a sample. In this range approximately means plus or minus ten per cent 10 .

As used herein the term intracellular metabolite refers to a compound resulting from a metabolic process or reaction inside a cell on an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate e.g. an Antibody Drug Conjugate AMC .

As used herein a native sequence polypeptide is one which has the same amino acid sequence as a polypeptide e.g. a tumor associated antigen receptor derived from nature. Such native sequence polypeptides can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. Thus a native sequence polypeptide can have the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring human polypeptide a murine polypeptide or a polypeptide from any other mammalian species.

As used herein an isolated nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the nucleic acid where for example the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.

As used herein the expression control sequences refers to nucleic acid sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes for example include a promoter optionally an operator sequence and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters polyadenylation signals and enhancers.

As used herein a nucleic acid is operably linked when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example DNA for a pre sequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA encoding a polypeptide if it is expressed as a pre protein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence for example if it affects the transcription of the sequence or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally operably linked means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous and in the case of a secretory leader contiguous and in reading phase. However enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking can be accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers can be used in accordance with conventional practice.

As used herein the terms cell cell line and cell culture are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. The words transformants and transformed cells include the primary subject cell and cultures or progeny derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended it will be clear from the context.

As used herein the term chiral refers to molecules which have the property of non superimposability of the mirror image partner while the term achiral refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.

For heteroalkylene groups heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini e.g. alkyleneoxy alkylenedioxy alkyleneamino alkylenediamino and the like . Still further for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example the formula C O R represents both C O R and R C O . As described above heteroalkyl groups as used herein include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom such as C O R C O NR NR R OR SR and or SOR . Where heteroalkyl is recited followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups such as NR R or the like it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and NR R are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus the term heteroalkyl should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups such as NR R or the like.

The terms cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl by themselves or in combination with other terms mean unless otherwise stated cyclic versions of alkyl and heteroalkyl respectively. Additionally for heterocycloalkyl a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule.

A fused ring aryl refers to multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is an aryl ring. The term heteroaryl refers to aryl groups or rings that contain from one to four heteroatoms selected from N O and S wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized and the nitrogen atom s are optionally quaternized. Thus the term heteroaryl includes fused ring heteroaryl groups i.e. multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is a heteroaromatic ring . A 5 6 fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together wherein one ring has 5 members and the other ring has 6 members and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. Likewise a 6 6 fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 6 members and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. And a 6 5 fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 5 members and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon or heteroatom. Non limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl 1 naphthyl 2 naphthyl 4 biphenyl 1 pyrrolyl 2 pyrrolyl 3 pyrrolyl 3 pyrazolyl 2 imidazolyl 4 imidazolyl pyrazinyl 2 oxazolyl 4 oxazolyl 2 phenyl 4 oxazolyl 5 oxazolyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 isoxazolyl 5 isoxazolyl 2 thiazolyl 4 thiazolyl 5 thiazolyl 2 furyl 3 furyl 2 thienyl 3 thienyl 2 pyridyl 3 pyridyl 4 pyridyl 2 pyrimidyl 4 pyrimidyl 5 benzothiazolyl purinyl 2 benzimidazolyl 5 indolyl 1 isoquinolyl 5 isoquinolyl 2 quinoxalinyl 5 quinoxalinyl 3 quinolyl and 6 quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below.

When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group for example each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R R R and R group when more than one of these groups is present. When R and R are attached to the same nitrogen atom they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4 5 6 or 7 membered ring. For example NR R includes but is not limited to 1 pyrrolidinyl and 4 morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents one of skill in the art will understand that the term alkyl is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups such as haloalkyl e.g. CFand CHCF and acyl e.g. C O CH C O CF C O CHOCH and the like .

Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from for example OR NR R SR halogen SiR R R OC O R C O R COR CONR R OC O NR R NR C O R NR C O NR R NR C O R NR C NR R R NR NR C NR R NR S O R S O R S O NR R NRSOR CN NO R N CH Ph fluoro C C alkoxy and fluoro C C alkyl in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system and where R R R and R are preferably independently selected from hydrogen substituted or unsubstituted alkyl substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group for example each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R R R and R groups when more than one of these groups is present.

Two or more substituents may optionally be joined to form aryl heteroaryl cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl groups. Such so called ring forming substituents are typically though not necessarily found attached to a cyclic base structure. In one embodiment the ring forming substituents are attached to adjacent members of the base structure. For example two ring forming substituents attached to adjacent members of a cyclic base structure create a fused ring structure. In another embodiment the ring forming substituents are attached to a single member of the base structure. For example two ring forming substituents attached to a single member of a cyclic base structure create a spirocyclic structure. In yet another embodiment the ring forming substituents are attached to non adjacent members of the base structure.

Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally form a ring of the formula T C O CRR U wherein T and U are independently NR O CRR or a single bond and q is an integer of from 0 to 3.

Malignant neoplasia is the second most common cause of death in the United States behind cardiovascular disease. Chemotherapy has exerted a predominant role in increasing life spans for patients with a variety of tumors including Burkitt s lymphoma acute lymphocytic leukemia and Hodgkin s disease. Further new cancer chemotherapeutic agents and methods of care combined with early detection and treatment have resulted in decreases in the overall incidence of cancer and decreases in the death rates from all cancers combined. Responsive tumors represent only a small fraction of the various types of cancer. Further agents such as cyclophosphamide adriamycin 5 fluorouracil and hexamethylmelamine which are highly active against clinical solid tumors are limited. Thus patients with many types of malignancies remain at significant risk for relapse and mortality. After relapse some patients can be re induced into remission with their initial treatment regimen. However higher doses of the initial chemotherapeutic agent or the use of additional agents are frequently required indicating the development of at least partial medicant resistance. Evidence indicates medicant resistance can develop simultaneously to several agents including medicant resistance to treatments to which the patient was not exposed. The development of multiple medicant resistant tumors may be a function of tumor mass and constitutes a major cause of treatment failure. To overcome this medicant resistance high dose chemotherapy with or without radiation and allogenic or autologous bone marrow transplantation can be employed. The high dose chemotherapy may employ the original medicant s or be altered to include additional agents. As a result there remain many cancer patients for whom no or minimally effective therapy exists. Accordingly there is a need for the development of novel chemotherapeutics with greater efficacy or safety either as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents and such agents with the potential to overcome medicant resistance in cancer cells.

Illudins are toxic natural products produced by mushrooms of the genus . Syn Illudins are semi synthetic derivatives of Illudins. Acylfulvenes are also semi synthetic derivatives of Illudins. Syn Illudins and Acylfulvenes have each been chemically modified at select sites to allow their use as medicants. The modifications in the Syn Illudins do not alter any of the cyclic rings cyclopropane cyclopentane cyclohexane of the basic Illudin chemical structure . The modifications of Acylfulvenes differ from Syn Illudins in that an additional double bond an unsaturated bond has been created in the 5 membered cyclopentane ring .

Illudins function as alkylating agents that damage DNA and thereby block transcription. The blockage can be repaired through nucleotide excision. The toxicity of the illudins has prevented any applications in human tumor therapy. Acylfulvenes have been developed which exhibit promising antitumor activity with a better safety profile as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 439 936 5 523 490 and 6 380 403 which are each herein expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties. Irofulven or 6 hydroxymethylacylfulvene see is an analog of illudin S which has demonstrated clinical activity with an acceptable safety profile in hormone refractory prostate cancer. Most relevant to clinical applications irofulven activity is independent of common resistance mechanisms such as the multi medicant resistance phenotype anti apoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 Bcl 2 SEQ. ID. 056 over expression as well as tumor protein 53 p53 SEQ. ID. 057 and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 p21 WAF1 SEQ. ID. 058 mutations see and Table XIV .

Growth factors including peptides and proteins are critical mediators of a wide range of cell cell communication. They are important endocrine paracrine and autocrine messengers. Growth factors function as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators regulate chemotaxis immune function development cell growth and can influence tumor cells. The receptors that recognize growth factors are highly selective and define specific cell populations. As a result growth factor receptors are a large and important class of medicant including drug targets. In addition to physiologic noncancerous cell populations these receptors can also be expressed in various cancer cell populations.

A polypeptide is a long continuous and unbranched chain of amino acids. A glycol peptide is a peptide that contains one or more carbohydrate moieties covalently attached to the side chains of specific amino acids. A pro peptide is an inactive peptide that can be turned into an active form through a post translational modification that enzymatically cleaves the pro peptide. Examples include pro insulin SEQ. ID. 059 and pro opiomelanocortin SEQ. ID. 060 . Enzymatically cleaving the pro peptide allows for the peptide to be available on short notice and or in large quantities. Some pro peptides are secreted from the cell. Many of these are synthesized with an N terminal signal peptide that targets the pro peptide for secretion.

Cytokines are small proteins approximately 5 to 20 kDa that affect the behavior of other cells and sometimes the releasing cell itself and are thereby important in cell signaling see Table XIV . Many specific cytokines can be released by a variety of different kinds of cells e.g. macrophages B lymphocytes T lymphocytes mast cells endothelial cells fibroblasts and various stromal cells. Cytokines act through specific receptors and are important in the humoral and cell based immune responses. Cytokines also regulate the maturation growth and responsiveness of specific cell populations. Cytokines circulate in much higher concentrations than hormones and in contrast with hormones are made by a variety of different kinds of cells. Cytokines are important in host responses to infection immune responses inflammation trauma sepsis cancer and reproduction. As a result cytokine receptors are upregulated in many forms of cancers.

A steroid is an organic compound that contains four cycloalkane rings joined to each other. Examples of steroids include the dietary lipid cholesterol and the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone. The core of a steroid molecule is composed of seventeen carbon atoms bonded together that take the form of four fused rings three six carbon atom rings and one five carbon atom ring. A variety of functional groups can be attached to the four ring core. Steroids can also vary depending on the oxidation state of the rings. A steroid hormone is a steroid that acts as a hormone. Steroid hormones can be grouped into five groups glucocorticoids mineralocorticoids androgens estrogens and progesterones based on the receptors to which they bind. Steroid hormones particularly androgens are essential not only for growth and development but also in the progression of many forms of cancer. As a result steroid hormone receptors are upregulated in many forms of cancers.

The retinoic acid receptor RAR is a nuclear receptor which can also act as a transcription factor. The RAR can be activated by either all trans retinoic acid or 9 cis retinoic acid. There are three RAR isoforms alpha SEQ. ID. 061 beta SEQ. ID. 062 and gamma SEQ. ID. 063 each encoded by separate genes where splice variants generate still further diversity in the expressed receptor. The retinoid X receptor RXR is a nuclear receptor activated by 9 cis retinoic acid. There are also three RXR isoforms alpha SEQ. ID. 064 beta SEQ. ID. 065 and gamma SEQ. ID. 066 each encoded by separate genes. RXR hetero dimerizes with subfamily 1 nuclear receptors including RAR. In the absence of ligand the RAR RXR dimer binds to retinoic acid response elements complexes with a co repressor protein. Binding of agonist ligands to RAR results in dissociation of the co repressor and recruitment of a co activator protein that in turn promotes transcription of the downstream target gene into mRNA and thereby protein or other RNA signaling mechanisms.

Lipid metabolism is altered in many forms of cancer including upregulation of de novo lipid synthesis. Cancer cells can also use alternative enzymes and pathways to facilitate the production of fatty acids. These newly synthesized lipids may support a number of cellular processes to promote cancer cell proliferation and survival. Elaidic acid or E octadec 9 enoic acid is the trans isomer of oleic acid and is found in small quantities in caprine milk bovine milk and some meats. It increases Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein CETP SEQ. ID. 067 activity which in turn raises levels of very low density lipoprotein and lowers levels of high density lipoprotein HDL cholesterol. CETP is found in plasma where it is involved in the transfer of cholesteryl ester from HDL to other lipoproteins. Defects in the CETP gene are a cause of hyperalphalipoproteinemia 1.

An antibody is a protein made up of four peptide chains disulfide linked together to form a Y shape. Antibodies are produced by plasma cells and are used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign antigens such as bacteria and viruses. The antibody recognizes a unique part of the antigen using each FAB portion of the protein i.e. the tip of the Y portion of the antibody allowing a specific high affinity binding interaction to occur. The binding interaction of different antibodies can target specific antigen epitopes. An antibody fragment containing one or both FAB portions can also target specific antigen epitopes.

The ability of the Illudin Syn Illudin and Acylfulvene analogs to inhibit tumor cell growth is shown in Table XV. The MV522 cell line is a lung derived adenocarcinoma cell line. In various embodiments of the invention the MV522 cell line represents a target cell line. That is an Illudin Syn Illudin or Acylfulvene analog that exhibits toxicity against this solid tumor cell line shows a desirable result. The 8392B cell line represents a hematopoietic non solid cell line. In various embodiments of the invention the 8392B cell line is considered a nontarget cell line. The two hour toxicity data represents the concentration of a given analog for which a two hour exposure will inhibit 50 of the DNA synthesis activity in a given cell line. The 48 hour exposure data represents the concentration at which a given analog with a 48 hour exposure will inhibit the growth or viability in a given cell line as defined by the standard Trypan Blue Exclusion assay. As an example analog will inhibit the target MV522 cell line at 110 nM with only a 2 hour exposure but has no inhibitory effect on the nontarget 8392B cell line at 26 000 nM 26 M . Analog with a prolonged exposure period e.g. 48 hours can eventually inhibit the nontarget cell line. In contrast Analog will inhibit the target. MV522 cell line with only a 2 hour exposure IC50 360 nM but has minimal effect on the 8392B cell nontarget line with even a 48 hour exposure IC50 26 0000 nM indicating superior anticancer activity as a monotherapeutic agent. In contrast to these two analogs analog displayed minimal toxicity as well as no differential toxicity between the target and nontarget cell line indicating it would have minimal properties as a monotherapeutic anticancer agent.

Despite recent advances in therapy many patients with cancer invariably relapse and require additional treatments. Most of these patient s cancers become refractory to standard chemotherapy and or radiation treatment regimens. The prognosis for these patients is poor and long term survival rates for metastatic solid tumor cancers remain very low. Thus there is a need for the development of novel agents and treatment regimens that specifically target these recurring tumor cells and also produce less systemic toxicity. Target therapies such as monoclonal antibodies now provide a promising alternative to the conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy approach.

Monoclonal antibody based therapy has recently achieved considerable success in oncology and there are currently nine monoclonal antibodies without a medicant attached approved by the FDA as cancer therapeutics. As an example HERCEPTIN and RITUXAN both produced by Genentech South San Francisco Calif. are used to successfully treat breast cancer and non Hodgkin s lymphoma respectively. HERCEPTIN is a recombinant DNA derived humanized monoclonal antibody selectively binding to the extracellular domain of the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 HER2 proto oncogene whereas RITUXAN is a genetically engineered chimeric murine human monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen overexpressed on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes.

Recent clinical evidence indicates that while the monoclonal antibody based therapies are effective at inducing remission they do not always produce a complete cure and relapses eventually occur in most patients. There is now a tremendous interest in the use of antibody medicant conjugates as a class of therapeutics that utilize the antigen selectivity of monoclonal antibodies to deliver potent cytotoxic medicants to specific tumor cells. Antibody medicant conjugates are produced by attaching a cytotoxic agent to an antibody that binds specifically to a tumor associated antigen.

In theory antibody medicant conjugates can confer an increased therapeutic index to highly potent medicants by improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity by minimizing damage to normal tissues although this goal has been elusive in achieving. The basis for the efficacy of antibody medicant conjugates is that they target tumor cells that preferentially express an antigen that is recognized by the associated antibody. In contrast non tumor cells either fail to express this antigen or express the antigen at a very low level. In theory only the tumor cells expressing the associated antibody are recognized and destroyed by the AMC and other cells are left untouched and undamaged.

While different medicant classes have been tried for delivery via antibodies only a few have proved efficacious for use as antibody medicant conjugates. The two main medicant classes used to date to produce antibody medicant conjugates are the auristatins MMAE N methylvaline valine dolaisoleuine dolaproine norephedrine or MMAF N methylvaline valine dolaisoleuine dolaproine phenylalanine and the maytansines DM1 or DM4 . Currently only two antibody medicant conjugates are approved by the U.S.F.D.A. and marketed brentuximab vedotin auristatin based and ado trastuzumab emtansine maytansine based .

Illudins see where R CHOH or OH Syn illudins see where X or Y C N S O and Z O or NH or NOH and Acylfulvenes see and where X C N S O and n 1 have several unique properties over agents traditional used to make antibody drug conjugates ADCs . Firstly these are the only agents known to function by inhibition of the DNA transcription coupled repair pathway see . No other toxin drug or medicant inhibits this pathway. The result is that Illudins Syn illudins and Acylfulvenes are true cytotoxic agents whereas other agents traditionally used to produce ADCs pyrrolobenzodiazepines maytansines fumagillols dolstatins auristatins enadiynes halichondrins and tubulysins are only cytostatic. In the NCI DTP 60 cell line panel these other agents were capable of inhibiting tumor cell growth ICvalue had some ability to block tumor cell growth TGI value but none were capable of actually causing tumor cell death or cytotoxicity Table XIII . The illudin derivatives however are capable of killing tumor cells at nanomolar concentrations Table XIII . This means that while ADCs developed using other toxins can stall tumor cell growth they cannot actually kill the tumor cell. Once the effect of the drug has worn off the tumor cells will again grow and kill the patient. In contrast the Illudins Syn illudins and Acylfulvenes actually kill the tumor cell with as little as a 2 hour exposure see . Secondly whereas tumor cells will undergo apoptosis or cell death with hours once the DNA transcription coupled repair pathway is blocked normal diploid non tumor cells can survive for hours. This translates into a wide therapeutic window for ADCs developed with Illudins Syn illudins and Acylfulvenes. The two ADC agents currently FDA approved for administration deliver a dose of the associated toxin that is 300 higher than a lethal dose which is why these agents have severe systemic toxicity. In contrast the comparable ADC developed with Illudins Syn illudins or Acylfulvenes will deliver a dose of the associated toxin that is 40 of a known non toxic dose estimated at 28 of a toxic dose and only 12 of a lethal dose . Thus ADCS developed with Illudins Syn illudins and Acylfulvenes will have minimal systemic toxicity as compared to current agents. Thirdly these agents are stable down to a pH of 2.0. An ADC is engulfed by a tumor cell transported to the endosomes pH

The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery that acylfulvenes can be conjugated directly to a linker via a variety of peptide or non peptide bonds and are active as medicant delivery agents in vitro and in vivo. Similar to other medicant classes used to produce antibody medicant conjugates the acylfulvenes can be conjugated to a linker that allows subsequent coupling to a monoclonal antibody. Surprisingly unlike previous medicant classes such as the auristatins MMAE MMAF dolstatin 10 the maytansines DM1 or DM4 the irinotecans and their metabolites SN38 the calicheamicins 17 DMAG the pyrrolobenzodiazepines SJG 136 the duocarmycins CC 1065 many of the acylfulvene compounds do not require a linker and can be directly attached to a monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof by a variety of simple chemical reactions. In this sense the lack of requirement for a linker or a spacer the acylfulvene compounds are unique. They will directly form covalent bonds with reactive groups on an AM such as a monoclonal antibody. In addition because of their very small size and extreme cytotoxicity the acylfulvenes can be coupled directly to very small molecular weight entities or affinity moieties that allow tumor specific cytotoxicity without the concomitant requirement of use of a monoclonal antibody. Examples include the ability to link illudins acylfulvenes directly to steroids which allow the medicant affinity complex to kill cells overexpressing a specific steroid receptor such as estrogen or progesterone positive breast cancer cells or even to be chemically coupled to various lipids. The small size and extreme cytotoxicity acylfulvenes allows direct coupling to peptides which can preferentially bind to tumor cells integrin binding peptides or display anti angiogenic properties to hinder tumor invasion. The illudins acylfulvenes can also be coupled to specific peptides which actually renders the medicant affinity complex non toxic until the peptide is cleaved by a protease secreted by tumor cells. An example includes PSA prostate specific antigen secreted by prostate adenocarcinoma cells. Again unlike previous medicant classes such as the auristatins MMAE MMAF dolstatin 10 the maytansines DM1 or DM4 the irinotecans and their metabolites SN38 the calicheamicins 17 DMAG the pyrrolobenzodiazepines SJG 136 the duocarmycins CC 1065 the acylfulvene compounds do not require a linker and can be directly attached to a steroid or a peptide that will subsequently function as an AM and direct the associated complex to specific tumor cells. An acylfulvene is attached to either a Specific Binding Peptide or a peptide which if cleaved by a specific protease see Table IX such as PSA generates an entity which is cytotoxic see Table VIII .

Trastuzumab emtansine Genentech for Breast cancer uses maytanasine derive DM 1 a stable non cleavable linker. Brentuximab vedotin Seattle Genetic s Takeda for Hodgkin s Lymphoma uses auristatin MMAE to anti CD30 an enzyme sensitive cleavable linker.

The malonic linker maleimide linker and SMCC succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate linker can form active intermediates that react with sulfhydryl groups on an antibody. SMCC has been used to bind maytansine derivative DM1 to the monoclonal antibody Herceptin. The AMC was internalized where the Herceptin was degraded by proteases and DM1 was released into the cytosol. Further Sulfo SMCC sulfosuccinimidyloxycarbonyl methyl 2 pyridyldithio toluene forms an active intermediate that reacts with sulfhydryl groups on an antibody. The resulting Sulfo SMCC AMC is more water soluble than the SMCC AMC.

Compounds and Conjugates. The present invention is drawn to a series of compounds and conjugates containing a Medicant moiety M linked via its C terminus to a LU LU . The LU can operate to provide a suitable release of M.

In one group of embodiments the invention provides Medicant Linker compounds having Formula I LU M I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof where the medicant loading is represented by p the average number of medicant molecules per affinity e.g. an antibody e.g. of Formula II IIa IIa . Medicant loading may range from 1 to 20 Medicant units M per Affinity unit e.g. Ab or in Ab . Compositions of Formula IIa and Formula IIa include mixtures of antibodies conjugated with a range of medicants from 1 to 20.

In some embodiments p is from about 1 to about 8 Medicant units per Affinity unit. In some embodiments p is 1. In some embodiments p is from about 2 to about 8 Medicant units per Affinity unit. In some embodiments p is from about 2 to about 6 2 to about 5 or 2 to about 4 Medicant units per LU. In some embodiments p is about 2 about 4 about 6 or about 8 Medicant units per Affinity unit.

The average number of Medicants units per Affinity unit in a preparation from a conjugation reaction may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy ELISA assay and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances separation purification and characterization of homogeneous Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates where p is a certain value from Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates with other medicant loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.

Returning to Formula IIa the conjugates comprise an antibody covalently attached to one or more Medicant units moieties via a LU A a W and w are as described above. The antibody medicant conjugate include pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof.

The medicant loading is represented by p the average number of Medicant units per antibody in a molecule of Formula II. Medicant loading may range from 1 to 20 medicants M per Ab or mAb. Compositions of the AMC of Formula IIa include mixtures of antibodies conjugated with a range of medicants from 1 to 20. In some embodiments p is from about 1 to about 8 Medicant units per antibody. In some embodiments p is 1. In some embodiments p is from about 2 to about 8 Medicant units per antibody. In some embodiments p is from about 2 to about 6 2 to about 5 or 2 to about 4 Medicant units per antibody. In some embodiments p is about 2 about 4 about 6 or about 8 Medicant units per antibody.

The average number of medicants per antibody in preparations of AMCs from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as UV visible spectroscopy mass spectrometry ELISA assay and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of AMCs in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances separation purification and characterization of homogeneous AMCs where p is a certain value from AMC with other medicant loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.

For some antibody medicant conjugates p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example where the attachment is a cysteine thiol an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a LU may be attached. In some embodiments the cysteine thiol is a thiol group of a cysteine residue that forms an interchain disulfide bond. In some embodiments the cysteine thiol is a thiol group of a cysteine residue that does not form an interchain disulfide bond.

Typically less than the theoretical maximums of medicant moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain for example many lysine residues that do not react with the Medicant Linker compound intermediate or LU reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine reactive LU reagent. Generally antibodies do not contain many if any free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a Medicant moiety via a LU. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol DTT . The antibody may be subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine. The loading medicant antibody ratio of an AMC may be controlled in several different manners including i limiting the molar excess of Medicant Linker compound intermediate or LU reagent relative to antibody ii limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature and iii partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.

Where more than one nucleophilic group reacts with a Medicant Linker compound intermediate or LU reagent followed by Medicant moiety reagent then the resulting product is a mixture of Affinity Medicant Linker Conjugates e.g. AMCs with a distribution of one or more Medicant moieties per Affinity unit e.g. an antibody . The average number of medicants per Affinity unit e.g. antibody may be calculated from the mixture by for example dual enzyme linked immune serum assay ELISA antibody assay specific for antibody and specific for the medicant. Individual Affinity Medicant Linker Conjugate molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy and separated by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC e.g. hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Thus a homogeneous conjugate with a single loading value may be isolated from the conjugation mixture by electrophoresis or chromatography.

A Linker Unit LU is a bifunctional compound which can be used to link a Medicant unit and or an Affinity unit to form an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate. Such conjugates are useful for example in the formation of immuno conjugates directed against tumor associated antigens. Such conjugates allow the selective delivery of cytotoxic drugs to tumor cells. A LU includes a traditional linker a 4 fluorosulfonyl benzoyl 4 FSB linker a 3 fluorosulfonyl benzoyl 3 FSB linker a 2 fluorosulfonyl benzoyl 2 FSB linker a maleimide Mal1 linker an azlactone linker and a bridging amino acid.

In the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate the LU serves to attach the Medicant moiety and the AM.

The Affinity Moiety AM includes within its scope an Affinity Unit AU that specifically binds or reactively associates or complexes with a receptor antigen or other receptive moiety associated with a given target cell population. An AU is a molecule that binds to complexes with or reacts with a receptor antigen or other receptive moiety of a cell population sought to be therapeutically or otherwise biologically modified.

In an embodiment of the invention an AM can form a bond to a Stretcher Unit. In an alternative embodiment of the invention an AM can form a bond to the Stretcher Unit of the LU via a heteroatom of the AM. Heteroatoms that may be present on an AM include sulfur in one embodiment from a sulfhydryl group of an AM oxygen in one embodiment from a carbonyl carboxyl or hydroxyl group of an AM and nitrogen in one embodiment from a primary or secondary amino group of an AM . These hetero atoms can be present on the AM in the AM s natural state for example a naturally occurring antibody or can be introduced into the AM via chemical modification.

In one embodiment an AM unit has a sulfhydryl group and the AM bonds to the LU via the sulfhydryl group s sulfur atom. In another embodiment the AM has lysine residues that can react with activated esters such esters include but are not limited to N hydroxysuccinimide pentafluorophenyl and p nitrophenyl esters of the Stretcher Unit of the AM and thus form an amide bond consisting of the primary nitrogen atom of the AM and the carboxyl group of the AM.

Useful polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of immunized animals. Useful monoclonal antibodies are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigenic determinant e.g. a cancer cell antigen a viral antigen a microbial antigen a protein a peptide a carbohydrate a chemical nucleic acid or fragments thereof . A monoclonal antibody mAb to an antigen of interest can be prepared by using any technique known in the art which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture.

Useful monoclonal antibodies include but are not limited to human monoclonal antibodies humanized monoclonal antibodies antibody fragments or chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art.

The antibody can also be a bispecific antibody. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art and are discussed infra.

The antibody can be a functionally active fragment derivative or analog of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to target cells e.g. cancer cell antigens viral antigens or microbial antigens or other antibodies that bind to tumor cells or matrix. In this regard functionally active means that the fragment derivative or analog is able to elicit anti anti idiotype antibodies that recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment derivative or analog is derived recognized. Specifically in an exemplary embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art e.g. the BIA core assay .

Other useful antibodies include fragments of antibodies such as but not limited to F ab fragments Fab fragments Fvs single chain antibodies diabodies triabodies tetrabodies scFv scFv FV or any other molecule with the same specificity as the antibody.

Additionally recombinant antibodies such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies comprising both human and non human portions which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques are useful antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as for example those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal and human immunoglobulin constant regions. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non human species having one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from the non human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art.

Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable and can be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen e.g. all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus using such a technique it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG IgA IgM and IgE antibodies. Other human antibodies can be obtained commercially from for example Abgenix Inc. now Amgen Freemont Calif. and Medarex Princeton N.J. .

Completely human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as guided selection. In this approach a selected non human monoclonal antibody e.g. a mouse antibody is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art including phage display libraries.

In other embodiments the antibody is a fusion protein of an antibody or a functionally active fragment thereof for example in which the antibody is fused via a covalent bond e.g. a peptide bond at either the N terminus or the C terminus to an amino acid sequence of another protein or portion thereof preferably at least 10 20 or 50 amino acid portion of the protein that is not from an antibody. Preferably the antibody or fragment thereof is covalently linked to the other protein at the N terminus of the constant domain.

Antibodies include analogs and derivatives that are either modified i.e. by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule as long as such covalent attachment permits the antibody to retain its antigen binding immunospecificity. For example but not by way of limitation derivatives and analogs of the antibodies include those that have been further modified e.g. by glycosylation acetylation pegylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to a cellular antibody unit or other protein etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage acetylation formylation metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin etc. Additionally the analog or derivative can contain one or more unnatural amino acids.

Antibodies can have modifications e.g. substitutions deletions or additions in amino acid residues that interact with Fc receptors. In particular antibodies can have modifications in amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the anti Fc domain and the FcRn receptor.

Antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained commercially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as e.g. chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained e.g. from the GenBank database or a database like it literature publications or by routine cloning and sequencing.

Treatment of Cancer. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates and Medicant Linker compounds are useful for inhibiting the multiplication of a tumor cell or cancer cell causing apoptosis in a tumor or cancer cell or for treating cancer in a patient. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates and or Medicant Linker compounds can be used accordingly in a variety of settings for the treatment of animal cancers. The Affinity Medicant Linker Conjugates can be used to deliver a Medicant or Medicant unit to a tumor cell or cancer cell. Without being bound by theory in one embodiment the AM of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate binds to or associates with a cancer cell or a tumor cell associated antigen and the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate can be taken up internalized inside a tumor cell or cancer cell through receptor mediated endocytosis or other internalization mechanism. The antigen can be attached to a tumor cell or cancer cell or can be an extracellular matrix protein associated with the tumor cell or cancer cell. Once inside the cell one or more specific peptide sequences within or at the Medicant unit s proximal end of the LU are hydrolytically cleaved by one or more tumor cell or cancer cell associated proteases resulting in release of the Medicant unit. The released Medicant unit is then free to migrate within the cell and induce cytotoxic or cytostatic activities. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate also can be cleaved by an intracellular protease to release the Medicant moiety. In an alternative embodiment the Medicant or Medicant unit is cleaved from the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate outside the tumor cell or cancer cell and the Medicant or Medicant unit subsequently penetrates the cell.

The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates provide conjugation specific tumor or cancer medicant targeting thus reducing general toxicity of the Medicant. The LUs stabilize the Affinity Medicant Conjugates in blood yet are cleavable by tumor specific proteases within the cell liberating a Medicant unit.

In one embodiment the AM binds to the tumor cell or cancer cell. In another embodiment the AM binds to a tumor cell or cancer cell antigen which is on the surface of the tumor cell or cancer cell. In another embodiment the AM binds to a tumor cell or cancer cell antigen which is an extracellular matrix protein associated with the tumor cell or cancer cell.

The specificity of the AM for a particular tumor cell or cancer cell can be important for determining those tumors or cancers that are most effectively treated. For example an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and or Medicant Linker compound having a BR96 AM can be useful for treating antigen positive carcinomas including those of the lung breast colon ovaries and pancreas. Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates having an anti CD30 or an anti CD70 binding affinity moiety can be useful for treating hematologic malignancies.

Other particular types of cancers that can be treated with an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and or a Medicant Linker compound include but are not limited to fibrosarcoma myxosarcoma liposarcoma chondrosarcoma osteogenic sarcoma chordoma angiosarcoma endotheliosarcoma lymphangiosarcoma lymphangioendotheliosarcoma synovioma mesothelioma Ewing s tumor leiomyosarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma colon cancer colorectal cancer kidney cancer pancreatic cancer bone cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer prostate cancer esophageal cancer stomach cancer oral cancer nasal cancer throat cancer squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma sweat gland carcinoma sebaceous gland carcinoma papillary carcinoma papillary adenocarcinomas cystadenocarcinoma medullary carcinoma bronchogenic carcinoma renal cell carcinoma hepatoma bile duct carcinoma choriocarcinoma seminoma embryonal carcinoma Wilms tumor cervical cancer uterine cancer testicular cancer small cell lung carcinoma bladder carcinoma lung cancer epithelial carcinoma glioma glioblastoma multiforme astrocytoma medulloblastoma craniopharyngioma ependymoma pinealoma hemangioblastoma acoustic neuroma oligodendroglioma meningioma skin cancer melanoma neuroblastoma retinoblastoma blood borne cancers including but not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL acute lymphoblastic B cell leukemia acute lymphoblastic T cell leukemia acute myeloblastic leukemia AML acute promyelocytic leukemia APL acute monoblastic leukemia acute erythroleukemic leukemia acute megakaryoblastic leukemia acute myelomonocytic leukemia acute nonlymphocyctic leukemia acute undifferentiated leukemia chronic myelocytic leukemia CML chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL hairy cell leukemia multiple myeloma acute and chronic leukemias lymphoblastic myelogenous lymphocytic myelocytic leukemias Lymphomas Hodgkin s disease non Hodgkin s Lymphoma Multiple myeloma Waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia Heavy chain disease Polycythemia vera.

In one embodiment the chemotherapeutic agent is that with which treatment of the cancer has not been found to be refractory. In another embodiment the chemotherapeutic agent is that with which the treatment of cancer has been found to be refractory. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates can be administered to a patient that has also undergone surgery as treatment for the cancer.

In some embodiments the patient also receives an additional treatment such as radiation therapy. In a specific embodiment the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate is administered concurrently with the chemotherapeutic agent or with radiation therapy. In another specific embodiment the chemotherapeutic agent or radiation therapy is administered prior or subsequent to administration of an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate.

A chemotherapeutic agent can be administered over a series of sessions. Any one or a combination of the chemotherapeutic agents such a standard of care chemotherapeutic agent s can be administered.

Additionally methods of treatment of cancer with an Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate and or a Medicant Linker compound are provided as an alternative to chemotherapy or radiation therapy where the chemotherapy or the radiation therapy has proven or can prove too toxic e.g. results in unacceptable or unbearable side effects for the subject being treated. The patient being treated can optionally be treated with another cancer treatment such as surgery radiation therapy or chemotherapy depending on which treatment is found to be acceptable or bearable.

The Affinity Medicant Linker AML conjugates and or Medicant Linker ML compounds can also be used in an in vitro or ex vivo fashion such as for the treatment of certain cancers including but not limited to leukemia and lymphomas such treatment involving autologous stem cell transplants. This can involve a multi step process in which the animal s autologous hematopoietic stein cells are harvested and purged of all cancer cells the animal s remaining bone marrow cell population is then eradicated via the administration of a high dose of an AML conjugates and or ML compound with or without accompanying high dose radiation therapy and the stem cell graft is infused back into the animal. Supportive care is then provided while bone marrow function is restored and the patient recovers.

Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates and Medicant Linker compounds are useful for killing or inhibiting the replication of a cell that produces an autoimmune disease or for treating an autoimmune disease. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates and Medicant Linker compounds can be used accordingly in a variety of settings for the treatment of an autoimmune disease in a patient. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugates can be used to deliver a Medicant unit to a target cell. Without being bound by theory in one embodiment the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate associates with an antigen on the surface of a target cell and the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate is then taken up inside a target cell through receptor mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell one or more specific peptide sequences within and or Medicant unit proximal to the LU are enzymatically or hydrolytically cleaved resulting in release of the Medicant or Medicant unit. The released Medicant or Medicant unit is then free to migrate in the cytosol and induce cytotoxic or cytostatic activities. The Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate also can be cleaved by an intracellular protease to release the Medicant or Medicant moiety. In an alternative embodiment the Medicant is cleaved from the Affinity Medicant Linker conjugate outside the target cell and the Medicant or Medicant unit subsequently penetrates the cell.

In an embodiment of the present invention the AM binds to an autoimmune antigen. In one aspect the antigen is on the surface of a cell involved in an autoimmune condition.

Azlactone linker. Reactions of carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC or diisopropylcarbodiimide DIC with a carboxylic acid yields a highly reactive O acylisourea. During artificial protein synthesis such as Fmoc solid state synthesizers the C terminus is often used as the attachment site on which the amino acid monomers are added. To enhance the electrophilicity of carboxylate group the negatively charged oxygen must first be activated into a better leaving group and carbodiimides can be used for this purpose. The negatively charged oxygen will act as a nucleophile attacking the central carbon in DCC. DCC is temporarily attached to the former carboxylate group which is now an ester group making nucleophilic attack by an amino group on the attaching amino acid to the former C terminus carbonyl group more efficient.

When the Illudin Syn Illudin or Acylfulvene carboxylic acid analog is activated by DCC or DIC in the presence of an amino acid the DCC activated carboxylate will react with the amino acid to form an azlactone and . This amino acid derived azlactone will react with primary amines undergo ring opening and forms an amide bond.

Illudin M 450 mg 1.845 mmol 1 equiv. glutaric anhydride 2.10 g 18.45 mmol 10 equiv. and DMAP 171 mg 1.4 mmol 0.76 equiv. were dissolved in CHCl 5 mL at room temperature. After 3.5 hours the mixture was taken up by CHCl which was washed with water and brine in sequence. It was then dried and evaporated. The residue was eluted through a column Hexane EtOAc 4 1 to give analog see 365 mg 55 as a liquid. UV CHCl nm 3387 .

Analog was generated from illudin M as outlined in Example 13. The carboxylic acid derivative was activated using DCC DMAP to synthesize steroid AFC s and . In addition Irofulven carboxylic acid derivative analog was activated using DCC DMAP to produce analogs and . In general carboxylate group containing compounds can be activated using a carbodiimide in the presence of an amino acid to form an azlactone. The azlactone formed will react spontaneously with primary amine groups on an amino acid a peptide an antibody a protein or another drug and undergo ring opening with the formation of an amide bond. For proteins antibodies and peptides the amino acids capable of reacting with the azlactone derivative includes arginine and lysine.

To form an Illudin derived azlactone active drug linker moiety either analog or analog can be activated by DCC DMAP in the presence of a small amino acid such as glycine to form the azlactone. DCC cannot be added without the presence of an amine containing target such as the glycine or the activated carboxylate reacts with another carboxylate to form a symmetrical anhydride. The azlactone formed will react spontaneously with primary amine groups on a peptide an antibody a protein or a medicant.

Part A Production of Azlactone from carboxylate Acylfulvene analog Analog 58.5 mg 0.2035 mmol and DMAP 5 mg. 0.048 mmol were dissolved in CHCl 5.6 mL at 0 C. The desired amino acid such as glycine is added in an equimolar amount. Note that amino acids having substitutions on the C4 carbon such as alpha methyl glycine or 2 dimethylglycine are preferred over conventional amino acids as substitution cannot occur at the C4 position after ring opening and all nucleophilic coupling reactions must occur at the C5 position resulting only in the desired amide bond formation with the amine containing molecule. To this solution was added CHClsolution of DCC 250 L 1 M 0.244 mmol stirred for 30 minutes allowed to warm to room temperature then stirred for 1.5 hours. The filtrate was washed with dilute HCl 1.5 saturated NaHCOand brine in sequence. The organic phase was dried over NaSO and evaporated. The residue was eluted through a column 100 CHClplus 0.5 methanol to give the desired azlactone analog as a solid. Part B Coupling of Azlactone to the protein component reacting with primary amines on amino acids such as the one on lysine The typical protein coupling reaction consists of the Azlactone suspended in buffer 25 mM sodium phosphate 150 mM NaCl pH 7.5 and the desired amount of protein 20 g to 5.0 mg is added. The mixture is gently rocked for 60 minutes then the reaction terminated by the addition of the blocking reagent 1.0 ml of 1.0 M ethanolamine in 25 mM sodium pyrophosphate titrated to pH 9.0 with HCI Sample rocked gently for 5 minutes then the residual ethanolamine removed by dialysis or chromatography using pH 7.5 phosphate NaCl buffer.

The azlactone derivative generated in Example 14 note that other amino acids can be used in place of glycine is then reacted with the desired peptide or protein or other compound containing a primary amino group at a 1 1 ratio in buffer 25 mM sodium phosphate 150 mM sodium chloride pH 7.5 with gentle rocking at room temperature for 60 minutes. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 1.0 mL of 25 mM ethanolamine titrated to pH 9.00 with rocking for 5 minutes at room temperature . The drug azlactone ligand product can be purified by column chromatography or dialysis to remove the ethanolamine by product.
