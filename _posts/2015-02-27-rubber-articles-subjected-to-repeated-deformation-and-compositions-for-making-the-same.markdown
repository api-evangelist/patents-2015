This application is a continuation application of U.S. Non Provisional application Ser. No. 13 058 964 which was the National Stage of International Application Serial No. PCT US09 53857 filed on Aug. 14 2009 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 088 827 filed on Aug. 14 2008 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Embodiments of the present invention relate to vehicle air springs and elastomeric compositions for making the same.

Air springs or pneumatic suspension devices have long been used to isolate road disturbances from a vehicle seat or cab. An air spring as part of a vehicle s suspension supports the vehicle s load or mass at each axle. Typically each axle of a vehicle associated with an air spring supports the mass component or load carried by the axle. In addition there may be ancillary air springs that support driver comfort in and around the driver s compartment or cab. In an air spring a volume of gas usually air is confined within a flexible container. As an air spring is compressed jounce travel the pressure of the gas within the air spring increases and as an air spring extends rebound travel the pressure of the gas within the air spring decreases. Road disturbances are mainly absorbed by this compression and extension of the air springs as a function of work w F dx . Air springs are often engineered to have a specific spring rate or spring constant thereby controlling jounce and rebound characteristics for the desired application and for comfort.

Because an air spring may undergo countless cycles between compression and extension the air spring must include an enclosure container for the gas that is flexible and durable. Typically these enclosures are referred to as bellows or airsleeves and are made of cord reinforced rubber compositions. The reinforcement in cord reinforced rubber compositions may be fabric or metal and cord fabric may be but is not limited to natural or synthetic materials.

Over time and under operational stresses the material properties of an airsleeve will change. Eventually cracks may form and become sufficiently large so that the integrity of the airsleeve is challenged requiring replacement. Thus there is a need in the market for an air spring with an airsleeve having improved resistance to cracking.

In one or more embodiments the present invention provides an air spring having an airsleeve wherein at least one layer of said airsleeve includes the vulcanization product of an elastomer and syndiotactic 1 2 polybutadiene.

In one or more embodiments the present invention provides a method for the production of an air spring airsleeve comprising mixing an elastomer syndiotactic 1 2 polybutadiene and a curative in a masterbatch to form a rubber composition forming the rubber composition into the shape of an airsleeve and curing the rubber composition.

In one or more embodiments the present invention provides an air spring having an airsleeve wherein at least one layer of said airsleeve has a rubber component comprising an elastomer and syndiotactic 1 2 polybutadiene.

For both air spring assemblies and airsleeves and are made of cord reinforced rubber and may be comprised of several layers as shown in a cutaway view of an exemplary airsleeve in . The reinforcement in cord reinforced rubber compositions may be fabric or metal and cord fabric may be but is not limited to natural or synthetic materials. Exemplary airsleeve features two ply construction and includes four layers including innerliner first ply second ply and outer cover . Innerliner and outer cover may include calendered rubber. First ply includes a single ply of cord reinforced rubber with the cords at a specific bias angle. Second ply includes a single ply of fabric reinforced rubber with the same bias angle laid opposite that of first ply .

Those skilled in the art will be able to select an appropriate amount of the various ingredients that can be used based upon the ultimate desired properties sought within the airsleeve of an air spring. Likewise those skilled in the art will be able to select an appropriate amount of curative and complementary cure agents in order to achieve a desired level of cure.

The rubber compositions for preparing one or more layers of airsleeve according to the present invention can be prepared by conventional means using conventional rubber compounding equipment such as Brabender Banbury Werner Pfleiderer Sigma blade mixer two roll mill or other mixers suitable for forming viscous relatively uniform admixtures. Mixing techniques depend on a variety of factors such as the specific types of polymers fillers processing oils waxes and other ingredients used. In one or more embodiments the ingredients can be added together in a single stage. In other embodiments some of the ingredients such as syndiotactic polybutadiene carbon black etc. can be first loaded followed by the rubber. In other embodiments a more conventional manner can be employed where the rubber is added first followed by the other ingredients. In even other embodiments the rubber may be added at the same time as the syndiotactic polybutadiene.

When utilizing an internal mixer the dry or powdery materials such as the carbon black can be added first followed by the processing aids and finally the neoprene this type of mixing can be referred to as an upside down mixing technique .

Mixing cycles generally range from about 2 to 10 minutes. In certain embodiments an incremental procedure can be used whereby the rubber and part of the ingredients are added first and the remaining ingredients are added in additional increments. In other embodiments part of the rubber can be added on top of the other ingredients. In other embodiments the rubber and syndiotactic polybutadiene are added together. In one or more embodiments two stage mixing can be employed.

The syndiotactic polybutadiene can be added with the rubber near the beginning of the mixing cycle. In one or more embodiments the syndiotactic polybutadiene is included before the cure package is added.

Because of the melting point of the syndiotactic polybutadiene the masterbatch drop temperature may be set to about 100 10 C.

The cure package sulfur accelerators activators etc. can be added near the end of the mixing cycle and at lower temperatures to prevent premature crosslinking of the neoprene chains.

Once mixed the rubber composition can be then formed into a sheet via calendering or combined with a fabric or metal reinforcing cord. The rubber compositions of the invention can also be formed into various types of articles using other techniques such as extrusion.

In one or more embodiments the rubber compositions of the present invention include discontinuous domains of syndiotactic polybutadiene in polychloroprene or polychloroprene copolymers. It is believed that these domains are formed because syndiotactic polybutadiene and polychloroprene or polychloroprene copolymers are immiscible. Despite this the rubber compositions of the present invention have advantageous qualities. By selecting syndiotactic polybutadiene having the disclosed melting temperatures the syndiotactic polybutadiene can be dispersed into the neoprene without employing high mixing temperatures that may cause scorching of the polychloroprene or polychloroprene copolymers.

The vulcanizable rubber compositions of the present invention can be formed into airsleeves of air springs by employing conventional techniques for fabricating and manufacturing air springs.

In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention the following examples have been prepared and tested. The examples should not however be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention. Accordingly for an appreciation of the true scope and breadth of the invention reference should be made to the following claims.

Two airsleeve rubber compositions were prepared according to the examples in Table I and the parts of each ingredient are by weight unless otherwise specified.
