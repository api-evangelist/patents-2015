The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

A modular artillery charge system MACS includes a three piece combustible cartridge case design and a bi directional center core ignition system. U.S. Pat. No. 5 747 723 issued on May 5 1998 to Buckalew et al. discloses a MACS. The contents of U.S. Pat. No. 5 747 323 are incorporated by reference herein. is a cross sectional view of a MACS module disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 747 723.

Module includes a body a center core tube and a cap . Body and cap each have the general shape of a thin walled hollow cylinder with an open end and a closed end. Cap fits into and covers the open end of body . The closed ends of both cap and body have center holes respectively. Center core tube is positioned longitudinally in body and contacts both cap and the closed end of body . The cavity formed by assembly of propelling charge module is filled with an energetic material . Exterior surfaces of body and cap are coated with an environmental protection material .

Center core tube holds a core igniter bag . Core igniter bag contacts two end igniter bags and . End igniter bag occupies the center hole in the closed end of body and end igniter bag occupies the center hole in cap . End igniter bags and may be held in place by an attaching means .

The closed end of the body at its center hole has a conical surface joined to a flat surface joined to a tubular surface . Similarly the closed end of cap at its center hole has a conical surface joined to a flat surface joined to a tubular surface .

The igniter bags in the MACS module are made of a rayon viscose material. The rayon viscose material is a flexible non rigid fabric. The design and manufacturing of the igniter bags is very labor intensive. The manufacture of the igniter bags involves manually sewing the rayon viscose material. In addition attaining the desired quality control from lot to lot is difficult. Thus there are an excessive amount of rejects and scrapped parts. Igniter bags that deviate from the quality control standards pose serious threats for example hangfire misfire and other performance related issues when loaded in a MACS supported system and then ignited in a gun tube.

A need exists for an improvement of the MACS igniter system that is safer and efficiently mass produced. The improvement should yield consistent tolerances reliability and performance to thereby mitigate potential hazards.

One aspect of the invention is an artillery charge system module having a central longitudinal axis. The module includes a hollow cylindrical combustible body having an open end and a closed end with a center hole. The closed end of the body at the center hole has a conical surface joined to a flat surface joined to a tubular surface. A core tube having first and second open ends is centered on the central longitudinal axis. A hollow cylindrical combustible cap has an open end and a closed end with a center hole. The open end of the cap is concentrically attached to the open end of the body. The closed end of the cap at the cap center hole has a conical cap surface joined to a flat cap surface joined to a tubular cap surface.

A rigid core igniter container is disposed in the core tube. A rigid body end igniter container is disposed in the closed end of the body in juxtaposition with the conical surface. A rigid cap end igniter container is disposed in the closed end of the cap in juxtaposition with the conical cap surface. The cap end and body end igniter containers are fixed to the core igniter container.

The core igniter container cap end igniter container and body end igniter container may be made of for example foamed celluloid.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Novel igniter containers for a MACS replace the prior art igniter bags shown in . The novel igniter containers are made of a rigid material. One example of a material for the novel igniter containers is foamed celluloid such as the foamed celluloid disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8 597 444 issued on Dec. 3 2013 to Young et al. The contents of U.S. Pat. No. 8 597 444 are incorporated by reference herein.

The core igniter container and the end igniter containers contain propellant powders. In one embodiment the core igniter container contains ball powder and the cap end and body end igniter containers contain black powder. Of course other types of propellants may be used.

In one embodiment core igniter container is a rigid tube having a cap end and a body end . Internal surfaces of the core igniter container at the cap end and the body end include ridges . The body end and cap end igniter containers each have a large container portion and a small container portion that extends from the large container portion into a respective end of the core igniter container . The small container portions include a flange that mechanically locks beneath the ridges in the internal surfaces of the core igniter container .

In one embodiment the large container portion is a conical frustum and the small container portion is tubular and the core igniter container is a circular tube.

A plug is inserted in each end of the core igniter container . Plug has a receptacle for receiving the small container portion of the end igniter containers . The ridges are formed on the receptacle of plug . The body end and cap end igniter containers each have a propellant loading hole and a closure for sealing the propellant loading hole . Closures may be made of transparent materials for example unfoamed transparent celluloid sheet. Transparent celluloid enables laser light to pass through the closures and ignite the powder. At least one of the plugs inserted in the core igniter container may include a propellant loading hole and a closure for sealing the propellant loading hole .

As seen in the core igniter container may be a rectangular tube and include one or more longitudinal pockets formed on its sides. The temperature probe may be inserted through radial slot and into longitudinal pocket . Container includes ridges at its ends for locking with end containers .

The cap and body ends of the core igniter container extend into the receptacles of the cap end and body end igniter containers respectively. This construction enables the volume of the core igniter container to be larger compared to the construction of module . The flanges on the cap and body end containers mechanically lock in the ridges on the external surface of the core igniter container .

The sides of the cap end and body end igniter containers that are opposite the core igniter container have channels formed therein. The channels are formed in the periphery of the top side surface of the cap and body end igniter containers . Four channels are present in the embodiment shown. The channels enable gas generated by powder in the core igniter container to pass through channels and reach an adjacent MACS for sequential ignition. To facilitate gas flow the diameter or transverse major dimension of the core igniter container may be decreased to create a gap between the core igniter container and the center core tube . One of the cap end and the body end of the core igniter container includes a propellant loading hole . A closure seals the propellant loading hole .

The novel ignition containers reduce manufacturing variability manufacturing steps and costs. The potential for injury is greatly reduced by eliminating the prior art manual sewing process. The novel ignition containers can be tailored or configured for multiple ignition processes. The Figs. depict ignition containers of various geometries however other geometries may also be used.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
