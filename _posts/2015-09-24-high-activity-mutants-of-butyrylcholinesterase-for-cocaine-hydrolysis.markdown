Subject matter described herein was made with government support under Grant Number R01DA013930 awarded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA of the National Institutes of Health NIH . The government has certain rights in the described subject matter.

The presently disclosed subject matter relates to butyrylcholinesterase variant polypeptides and in particular butyrylcholinesterase mutants having amino acid substitutions.

Cocaine abuse is a major medical and public health problem that continues to defy treatment. The disastrous medical and social consequences of cocaine addiction such as violent crime loss in individual productivity illness and death have made the development of an effective pharmacological treatment a high priority. However cocaine mediates its reinforcing and toxic effects by blocking neurotransmitter reuptake and the classical pharmacodynamic approach has failed to yield small molecule receptor antagonists due to the difficulties inherent in blocking a blocker. An alternative to receptor based approaches is to interfere with the delivery of cocaine to its receptors and accelerate its metabolism in the body.

The dominant pathway for cocaine metabolism in primates is butyrylcholinesterase BChE catalyzed hydrolysis at the benzoyl ester group Scheme 1 .

Only 5 of the cocaine is deactivated through oxidation by the liver microsomal cytochrome P450 system. Cocaine hydrolysis at benzoyl ester group yields ecgonine methyl ester whereas the oxidation produces norcocaine. The metabolite ecgonine methyl ester is a biologically inactive metabolite whereas the metabolite norcocaine is hepatotoxic and a local anesthetic. BChE is synthesized in the liver and widely distributed in the body including plasma brain and lung. Extensive experimental studies in animals and humans demonstrate that enhancement of BChE activity by administration of exogenous enzyme substantially decreases cocaine half life.

Enhancement of cocaine metabolism by administration of BChE has been recognized to be a promising pharmacokinetic approach for treatment of cocaine abuse and dependence. However the catalytic activity of this plasma enzyme is three orders of magnitude lower against the naturally occurring cocaine than that against the biologically inactive cocaine enantiomer. cocaine can be cleared from plasma in seconds and prior to partitioning into the central nervous system CNS whereas cocaine has a plasma half life of approximately 45 90 minutes for a relatively low dose of cocaine long enough for manifestation of the CNS effects which peak in minutes. Under the overdose condition BChE is saturated with cocaine and thus the plasma half life of cocaine will be longer. Hence BChE mutants with high activity against cocaine are highly desired for use in humans. Although some BChE mutants with increased catalytic activity over wild type BChE have previously been generated there exists a need for mutant BChE with even higher catalytic activity.

The details of one or more embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter are set forth in this document. Modifications to embodiments described in this document and other embodiments will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art after a study of the information provided in this document. The information provided in this document and particularly the specific details of the described exemplary embodiments is provided primarily for clearness of understanding and no unnecessary limitations are to be understood therefrom. In case of conflict the specification of this document including definitions will control.

The presently disclosed subject matter includes butyrylcholinesterase BChE polypeptide variants. The BChE polypeptide variants disclosed herein each have enhanced catalytic efficiency for cocaine as compared to wild type BChE. The presently disclosed subject matter further includes a pharmaceutical composition including a butyrylcholinesterase polypeptide variant as described herein and a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. The presently disclosed subject matter further includes a method of treating a cocaine induced condition comprising administering to an individual an effective amount of a butyrylcholinesterase polypeptide variant as disclosed herein to lower blood cocaine concentration.

In some embodiments the BChE polypeptide variant is selected from a BChE polypeptide variants set forth in Table 1. Table 1 also includes the SEQ ID NOs associated with the identified BChE polypeptide variants as well as a summary of the approximate fold increase in catalytic efficiency against cocaine for the identified BChE polypeptide variants as compared to wild type BChE.

The terms polypeptide protein and peptide which are used interchangeably herein refer to a polymer of the protein amino acids or amino acid analogs regardless of its size or function. Although protein is often used in reference to relatively large polypeptides and peptide is often used in reference to small polypeptides usage of these terms in the art overlaps and varies. The term polypeptide as used herein refers to peptides polypeptides and proteins unless otherwise noted. The terms protein polypeptide and peptide are used interchangeably herein when referring to a gene product. Thus exemplary polypeptides include gene products naturally occurring proteins homologs orthologs paralogs fragments and other equivalents variants and analogs of the foregoing.

The term variant refers to an amino acid sequence that is different from the reference polypeptide by one or more amino acids e.g. one or more amino acid substitutions. For example a butyrylcholinesterase BChE polypeptide variant differs from wild type BChE by one or more amino acid substitutions i.e. mutations.

The terms polypeptide fragment or fragment when used in reference to a reference polypeptide refers to a polypeptide in which amino acid residues are deleted as compared to the reference polypeptide itself but where the remaining amino acid sequence is usually identical corresponding positions in the reference polypeptide. Such deletions can occur at the amino terminus carboxy terminus of the reference polypeptide or alternatively both. A fragment can also be a functional fragment in which case the fragment retains some or all of the activity of the reference polypeptide as described herein. For example a functional fragment of a particular BChE polypeptide variant retains some or all of the cocaine hydrolysis activity. i.e. the catalytic efficiency for cocaine of the particular BChE polypeptide variant. In this regard the term BChE polypeptide variant is inclusive of functional fragments of the BChE polypeptide variant. Such fragments are typically are at least about 300 325 350 375 400 425 450 475 500 525 or 550 amino acids long. One or more residues from about 1 to 67 and or one or more residues from about 443 to 574 can be removed without substantially affecting the catalytic activity of the BChE polypeptide variant. As such the term BChE polypeptide variant is inclusive of functional fragments wherein one or more residues from 1 to 67 and or one or more residues from 443 to 574 is truncated relative to the full length BChE polypeptide variant.

The BChE polypeptide variant e.g. SEQ ID NOS 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 and 32 can be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition along with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier known to one skilled in the art.

The present BChE variant polypeptides can be used in treating a cocaine induced condition by administering to an individual an effective amount of a BChE variant polypeptides e.g. SEQ ID NOS 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 and 32 to lower blood cocaine concentration. The BChE polypeptide variant can be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in which the BChE polypeptide variant is included with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. Treatment of a cocaine induced condition using one of the aforementioned BChE polypeptide variants can be in a manner that will be understood by those skilled in the art.

The preferred dose for administration of a BChE polypeptide variant or pharmaceutical composition in accordance with the presently described subject matter is that amount which will be effective in lowering cocaine concentration in a patient s bloodstream and one would readily recognize that this amount will vary greatly depending on the nature of cocaine consumed e.g. injected or inhaled and the condition of a patient. An effective amount of butyrylcholinesterase polypeptide variant or pharmaceutical composition to be used in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter is intended to mean a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the agent such that the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect is produced. Thus the exact amount of the enzyme or a particular agent that is required will vary from subject to subject depending on the species age and general condition of the subject the severity of the condition being treated the particular carrier or adjuvant being used and its mode of administration and the like. Similarly the dosing regimen should also be adjusted to suit the individual to whom the composition is administered and will once again vary with age weight metabolism etc. of the individual. Accordingly the effective amount of any particular butyrylcholinesterase polypeptide variant or pharmaceutical composition thereof will vary based on the particular circumstances and an appropriate effective amount may be determined in each case of application by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.

The presently disclosed subject matter is further illustrated by the following specific but non limiting examples. The following examples may include compilations of data that are representative of data gathered at various times during the course of development and experimentation related to the presently disclosed subject matter.

Embodiments of the BChE polypeptide variants of the presently disclosed subject matter were made and studied using the following experimental procedure.

Site directed mutagenesis of human BChE cDNA was performed by the QuikChange method of Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. 1996 57 5731 incorporated herein by this reference. Mutations were generated from wild type human BChE in a pRc CMV expression plasmid in accordance with Xie W. Altamirano C. V. Bartels C. F. Speirs R J. Cashman J. R. Lockridge O. 1999 55 83 each of which is incorporated herein by this reference. The expression plasmid pRc CMV was kindly provided by Dr. O. Lockridge University of Nebraska Medical Center Omaha Nebr. .

Using plasmid DNA as template and primers with specific base pair alterations mutations were made by polymerase chain reaction with Pfu DNA polymerase for replication fidelity. The PCR product was treated with Dpn I endonuclease to digest the parental DNA template. Cloned pfu DNA polymerase and Dpn I endonuclease were obtained from Stratagene La Jolla Calif. . Modified plasmid DNA was transformed into amplified and purified. The DNA sequences of the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. The QIAprep Spin Plasmid Miniprep Kit and Qiagen plasmid purification kit and QIAquick PCR purification kit were obtained from Qiagen Santa Clarita Calif. .

BChE mutants were expressed in human embryonic kidney cell line 293T 17. Cells were grown to 80 90 confluence in 6 well dishes and then transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 complexes of 4 g plasmid DNA per each well. Cells were incubated at 37 C. in a COincubator for 24 hours and cells were moved to 60 mm culture vessel and cultured for four more days. The culture medium 10 fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM was harvested for a BChE activity assay.

Human embryonic kidney 293T 17 cells were from ATCC Manassas Va. . Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM was purchased from Fisher Scientific Fairlawn N.J. . Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by the Integrated DNA Technologies and Analysis Facility of the University of Kentucky. 3 3 5 5 Tetramethylbenzidine TMB was obtained from Sigma Saint Louis Mo. . Anti butyrylcholinesterase mouse monoclonal antibody Product HAH002 01 was purchased from AntibodyShop Gentofte Denmark and Goat anti mouse IgG HRP conjugate from Zymed San Francisco Calif. .

To measure cocaine and benzoic acid the product of cocaine hydrolysis by BChE sensitive radiometric assays based on toluene extraction of H cocaine labeled on its benzene ring were used in accordance with Zheng F. Yang W. Ko M. C. Lin J. Cho H. Gao D. Tong M. Tai H. H. Woods J. H. Zhan C. G. Most Efficient Cocaine Hydrolase Designed by Virtual Screening of Transition States 2008 130 12148 12155 which is incorporated herein by this reference. H cocaine 50 Ci mmol was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences Boston Mass. .

In brief to initiate reactions 100 nCi of H cocaine was mixed with 100 l of culture medium. Reactions proceeded at room temperature 25 C. with varying concentrations of cocaine. Reactions were stopped by adding 300 l of 0.02 M HCl which neutralized the liberated benzoic acid while ensuring a positive charge on the residual cocaine. H benzoic acid was extracted by 1 ml of toluene and measured by scintillation counting. Finally the measured cocaine concentration dependent radiometric data were analyzed by using the standard Michaelis Menten kinetics so that the catalytic efficiency k K was determined along with the use of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA described in b Zheng F. Yang W. Ko M. C. Liu J. Cho H. Gao D. Tong M. Tai H. H. Woods J. H. Zhan C. G. Most Efficient Cocaine Hydrolase Designed by Virtual Screening of Transition States 2008 130 12148 12155.

The catalytic efficiency k K of the BChE polypeptide variants of SEQ ID NO 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 and 32 are set forth in Table 2.

The catalytic efficiencies k K of the BChE polypeptide variants were found to be between about 6.74 10and 3.72 10Mmin which is about 740 to about 4080 times the k Kvalue 9.11 10Mmin of the wild type BChE.

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISA were preformed as follows. The ELISA buffers used were the same as those described in the literature such as Brock A. Mortensen V. Loft A. G. R. Nergaard Pedersen B. 1990 28 221 224 and Khattab A. D. Walker C. H. Johnston G. Siddiqui M. K. Saphier P. W. 1994 13 1661 1667 both of which are incorporated herein by this reference. The coating buffer was 0.1 M sodium carbonate bicarbonate buffer pH 9.5. The diluent buffer EIA buffer was potassium phosphate monobasic potassium phosphate monohydrate buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.9 sodium chloride and 0.1 bovine serum albumin. The washing buffer PBS T was 0.01 M potassium phosphate monobasic potassium phosphate monohydrate buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.05 v v Tween 20. All the assays were performed in triplicate. Each well of an ELISA microliter plate was filled with 100 l of the mixture buffer consisting of 20 l culture medium and 80 l coating buffer. The plate was covered and incubated overnight at 4 C. to allow the antigen to bind to the plate. The solutions were then removed and the wells were washed four times with PBS T. The washed wells were filled with 200 l diluent buffer and kept shaking for 1.5 h at room temperature 25 C. . After washing with PBS T for four times the wells were filled with 100 l antibody 1 8000 and were incubated for 1.5 h followed by washing for four times. Then the wells were filled with 100 l goat anti mouse IgG HRP conjugate complex diluted to a final 1 3000 dilution and were incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h followed by washing for four times. The enzyme reactions were started by addition of 100 l substrate TMB solution. The reactions were stopped after 15 min by the addition of 100 l of 2 M sulfuric acid and the absorbance was read at 460 nm using a Bio Rad ELISA plate reader.
