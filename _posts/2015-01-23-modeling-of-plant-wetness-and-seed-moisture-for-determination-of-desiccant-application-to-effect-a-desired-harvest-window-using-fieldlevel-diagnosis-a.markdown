title: Modeling of plant wetness and seed moisture for determination of desiccant application to effect a desired harvest window using field-level diagnosis and forecasting of weather conditions and observations and user input of harvest condition states
abstract: A modeling framework for evaluating the impact of weather conditions on farming and harvest operations applies real-time, field-level weather data and forecasts of meteorological and climatological conditions together with user-provided and/or observed feedback of a present state of a harvest-related condition to agronomic models and to generate a plurality of harvest advisory outputs for precision agriculture. A harvest advisory model simulates and predicts the impacts of this weather information and user-provided and/or observed feedback in one or more physical, empirical, or artificial intelligence models of precision agriculture to analyze crops, plants, soils, and resulting agricultural commodities, and provides harvest advisory outputs to a diagnostic support tool for users to enhance farming and harvest decision-making, whether by providing pre-, post-, or in situ-harvest operations and crop analyses.

The present invention relates to harvest operations in precision agriculture. Specifically the present invention relates to a system and method of applying real time field level weather simulation and prediction to one or more agricultural models to generate a series of harvest advisory outputs in a tool for supporting farm operations management.

Harvest operations for a variety of agricultural commodities are substantially influenced by environmental factors such as the weather. While some weather conditions such as precipitation may create an obvious deterrent to harvest operations more benign daily weather characteristics also play subtle yet significant roles. For example many commodities require that the harvested product be at or below a product dependent moisture threshold before they can be stably stored at ambient temperatures at least without taking specific steps to keep the product stable such as the maintenance of a constant airflow through the product . On the other extreme delaying harvest for too long can result in the crop becoming overly dry potentially exposing seeds to damage during the threshing process or removing permissible water weight from the product. Such an occurrence of delayed harvest may result in lower crop revenue since payments are often based on mass. Similarly crop temperature thresholds may be a major consideration for long term storage of some crops for example tuberous crops such as potatoes and sugar beets where cold conditions are advantageous.

The harvest operation itself is also often sensitive to plant product and soil moisture and temperature levels. For instance green plants or even deceased plants with a heightened moisture level often create difficulty for harvest operations that are based on the use of a threshing action to separate the seed or other product from the parent plant. This can result in both yield loss due to un threshed seeds passing through and out of the harvester and seed damage due to the repeated or harsh threshing action that may be required. Frozen or excessively wet soils can also inhibit harvest operations for various crops depending upon the harvest mechanism for the particular crop. Each of the product plant and soil moisture and temperature therefore impact both the timing and viability of harvest operations and all of these qualities are highly influenced by complex interactions between plant and soil characteristics and environmental conditions.

As global agricultural operations continue to grow in size the practicality of in situ monitoring of field conditions on a regular basis is becoming increasingly diminished. Further the often substantial equipment and labor resources involved in harvest operations are not easily moved across significant distances in an effort to find fields with viable or more favorable harvest conditions. The ability to both diagnose and predict the viability of harvest operations in a potentially remote field is therefore of increasing importance to the management of modern farm operations. Also production agriculture is often a capital intensive business with very thin relative profit margins. The ability to more effectively manage the logistics associated with deployment of a farm operation s equipment and human resources is therefore becoming increasingly critical to profitability and long term viability of the farm itself.

In part because agricultural research globally is largely carried out by institutions with local or regional focus agronomic models are often based on sample datasets that are limited in size and or geographic representativeness with less than ideal documentation of or accommodation for associated weather and environmental conditions. Because of this there are very few models that can be picked up and applied to other locations and timeframes without a potentially substantial loss in model accuracy. Models for the same processes can often lead to diametrically opposed conclusions when applied at differing locations because of model shortcomings that are due to a lack of understanding of the extent to which localized influences impact the associated processes during the development of the model.

Existing solutions do not provide a sufficient framework for utilizing weather analysis and prediction to accurately diagnose field level weather conditions for precision agriculture to overcome the challenges above. Accordingly there is a strong need not found in the existing art for a system and method that provides an improved process for application of weather information in agronomic modeling to produce a better understanding of farm and harvest operations. There is also a need not found in the existing art for support tools designed to provide real time assessments of weather conditions and the impact on crops plants soils and resulting agricultural products to enable improvements in farm and harvest operations.

It is therefore one objective of the present invention to provide a system and method of applying real time assessments of weather conditions to precision agriculture models for enhancing harvest operations. It is another objective to combine real time and location tagged data communication in farm operations with such real time assessments of weather conditions for generating harvest advisory information in precision agriculture. It is still another objective of the present invention to combine user provided and or observed feedback of a present state of a harvest related condition with real time assessments of weather conditions for generating harvest advisory information in precision agriculture. It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide a diagnostic support tool for enhanced decision making in harvest operations.

There are many other specific objectives of the present invention. One such objective is to provide a system and method of predicting dry down of a crop over time such as a mature small grain coarse grain or oilseed crop for planning the timing of harvest operations. It is another such objective of the present invention to provide a system and method of predicting the time varying unit costs per percent moisture per unit of mass or volume associated with fuel based or forced air mechanical drying of crops resulting from changing weather conditions and the characteristics of the drying facility. Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a system and method of predicting the time varying unit costs per unit of mass or volume associated with the combined impacts of time varying grain moisture levels of a crop to be harvested and the time varying unit costs per percent moisture per unit of mass or volume of forced air or fuel based mechanical drying.

It is another objective to provide tools for assessing a risk of delayed harvest operations to achieve favorable crop moisture levels for evaluating soil temperature and soil moisture in a given field to provide guidance as to when soil conditions are likely to inhibit harvest and post harvest tillage operations due to soil being exceedingly wet or frozen and for evaluating the impact of time varying soil temperature in a given field for the timing of harvest operations as it pertains to the internal temperature of root based crops and their long term storage stability at those temperatures.

Other objectives of the present invention include providing systems and methods for predicting the day by day and intraday windows of opportunity for harvest operations owing to time varying threshability as a result of interactions between a standing crop and atmospheric and soil conditions to aid in more immediate planning of harvest operations predicting the dry down of hay alfalfa etc. and other cuttings over time for planning the timing or windows of opportunity of cutting windrowing silageing or bailing operations and assisting in decision making for application of a desiccant to affect a desired harvest window.

The present invention is a system and method of evaluating diagnosing and predicting various agronomic conditions attendant to farming activities in an advisory model configured to simulate and predict the impact of weather conditions on harvest operations. The present invention applies real time field level data representative of assessments of localized weather conditions together with real time and location tagged communication of data of various types and content and long range climatological and or meteorological forecasting to one or more physical empirical or artificial intelligence models of precision agriculture to analyze crops plants soils and resulting agricultural commodities and generate a plurality of harvest advisory outputs. Such outputs are provided either directly to farmers to third parties or in a harvest advisory tool based on the advisory model for supporting precision agricultural operations.

Through application of the harvest advisory modeling paradigms discussed herein the prospects for providing improved guidance relating to farm and harvest operations has the potential to be very substantial in the field of precision agriculture. For example diagnosing and predicting the in field dry down of agricultural commodities the efficiency of fuel based and or forced air grain drying activities the associations between plant moisture and atmospheric conditions and the soil temperature and moisture profiles all provide significant value added benefit. Recent parallel advances in weather analysis and prediction and in the availability of mechanisms for facilitating real time and location tagged data communication in farm operations have created an enticing set of possible new applications for addressing the problems described above and others. The application of both in situ though not necessarily in or near a given field and remotely sensed weather information in combination with scientific and computational advances in the integration of data collected by these disparate weather observing systems permit the diagnosis of field level weather conditions with accuracy that greatly improve upon that obtained with the deployment of a basic weather station to each and every field.

Further advances in the understanding of the interactions between the land surface and the overlying atmosphere combined with other improvements to the physics of meteorological weather models and the ever increasing computational power available to operate these models enable a level of both short term and long term accuracy and locality to weather forecasts that has not been previously attainable.

The present invention also applies time and location tagged feedback and observations on current and recent characteristics representing measurements of various crop states such as moisture and temperature to the one or more physical empirical or artificial intelligence models of precision agriculture. Such feedback and observations provide an enhanced collection of data along with the associated weather conditions and other relevant information to build more comprehensive datasets that are used to make far reaching improvements to associated physical models for diagnosing and predicting underlying harvest related conditions. Artificial intelligence is also incorporated to this more comprehensive dataset to draw automatic associations between available external data and the harvest related condition to yield further models for simulating harvest conditions. Artificial intelligence in the present invention is also retrained as more and more data are accumulated and the results may be tested against independent data in an effort to find the most reliable model. Such a model framework implicitly yields information as to the importance of related factors through the resulting weighting systems between inputs subcomponents within the artificial intelligence layer and the model output s . Together this feedback and observations and physical empirical and artificial intelligence modeling paradigms discussed herein significantly enhance the analysis of crops plants soils and resulting agricultural commodities within the present invention to generate harvest advisory outputs and improved guidance for farm and harvest operations.

Other objects embodiments features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments taken together with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention.

In the following description of the present invention reference is made to the exemplary embodiments illustrating the principles of the present invention and how it is practiced. Other embodiments will be utilized to practice the present invention and structural and functional changes will be made thereto without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The harvest advisory model ingests or receives input data that includes weather and location specifications such as meteorological data real time field level weather data observed weather data that has occurred for example during a current growing season and extended range weather and climatological forecast information . The weather and location specifications may also include other types of real time and location tagged data such as for example GPS data and data captured from orbiting satellites or remotely powered vehicles that when processed provide details at a field level resolution such as remotely sensed satellite imagery data and remotely captured drone imagery data . The input data may further include crop and plant specifications such as for example the type variety and relative maturity of the crop and other planting chemical application and harvest data such as for example the date that a field was planted with seed the population of planted seeds per specified area when a field was sprayed for example with a pesticide desiccant other chemical the type and amount of chemical applied and anticipated temporal harvest data such as an expected harvest date or harvest window. The crop and plant specifications may also include the desired crop temperature crop moisture seed moisture facility storage dimensions and specifications and airflow characteristics for a stored crop . Additional information may include planting information such as plant depth and row width .

The input data may also include field and soil specifications which may further include data such as for example the soil type in which a crop was planted and attributes such as soil temperature soil moisture current and or forecasted soil conditions overall soil profile levels of vegetative debris existing at the time of planting and nutrient levels present.

The input data may also include physical empirical or observed agricultural data such as for example sampled crop moisture content . This may include data such as samples and or observations of actual grain moisture taken from a planted field at one or more times and the associated dry down of the grain in a particular field over time. Other examples of such data include data regarding temporal harvestability windows for a particular crop at a particular location over some recent period of time or for various crops at various locations over time. This may include for example temporal windows of threshability of a seed based crop over some recent period of time temporal windows of cut windrow bail operations for crops such as hay at a particular location over some recent period of time and temporal windows of mature growth stages desiccant efficacy and harvestability for a particular desiccant for particular crop at a particular location over some recent period of time.

The physical empirical or observed agricultural data may further include descriptive metadata reflecting actual performance realization or implementation of one or more of crops plants fields soils and facilities. This metadata may include crop and seed metadata such as the relative maturity and dry down characteristics of the variety pest and disease susceptibility or resistance whether a crop is irrigated or non irrigated and type and origin of seeds for example genetically modified or non genetically modified and company source . Such metadata may also include soils metadata such as information relating to previous crop grown on or in the soil tillage practice soil composition presence of surface and or subsurface drainage nutrient composition rate of degradation rate of water movement in both a lateral and vertical direction presence of materials such as salts in soil strata and facility metadata such as metadata relating to type characteristics for example whether the facility is a forced air drying facility or a fuel based mechanical grain drying facility and their associated resources and costs.

All of this input data is ingested into the harvest advisory model via a data ingest module as shown in the system diagram of . The harvest advisory model ingests this input data and applies it to one or more precision agriculture agronomic models which may include artificial intelligence derived precision agriculture models to produce output data . The output data of the harvest advisory model is represented a harvest condition output profile that is provided to a harvest advisory tool that can be used to predict simulate and forecast harvest conditions as discussed further herein.

The input data is applied to the one or more precision agriculture models in a plurality of data processing modules within a computing environment that also includes one or more processors and a plurality of software and hardware components. The one or more processors and plurality of software and hardware components are configured to execute program instructions to perform the functions of the harvest advisory model described herein and embodied in the one or more data processing modules .

The plurality of data processing modules include in addition to the data ingest module a physical and empirical models module and an artificial intelligence module configured to apply a layer of artificial intelligence to the harvest advisory model to develop relationships between input data and outputs from other precision agriculture models to perform and improve the assessments diagnoses simulations forecasts and predictions that form the harvest condition output profile . The plurality of data processing modules also includes a harvest condition prediction module configured to generate the harvest condition outputs .

The physical and empirical models module enables application of the input data to the one or more precision agriculture models . Such models include crop soil plant and other modeling paradigms such as for example phenological models that include general crop specific and crop variety specific models a common example being growing degree day GDD models. These models also include soil models such as the EPIC APEX and ICBM soil models and land surface models such as the NOAH Mosaic and VIC models. Other models contemplated within the scope of the present invention include crop specific site specific and attribute specific physical models such as models for simulating temperature moisture wetness in field crop dry down plant atmosphere vapor diffusion plant rewetting associated with precipitation and deterministic and stochastic grain drying models that parameterize the unique drying characteristics of a specific crop to be dried based on characteristics of the drying process and statistical models and models for analyzing storage characteristics of crops seeds soils and storage facilities. It is contemplated that the input data may be applied to existing precision agriculture models as well as customized models for specific harvest conditions for example simulation of expected dry down of grain in the particular field grain and plant moisture levels and temperature and moisture content of a root based crop over time and other simulations predictions and forecasts as noted herein.

The harvest condition output profile as noted above is output data of the harvest advisory model . Once the harvest advisory model has generated the harvest condition output profile the present invention applies the harvest condition output profile to develop the harvest advisory tool for analyzing many types of information in harvest operations. The harvest condition output profile provides estimates for example of standing crop dry down rates anticipated harvest dates and suitability fuel consumption optimizers for forced air drying indicators of plant toughness for anticipating harvest windows and possible loss of field workability due to the formation of frost in the soils prior to post harvest tillage.

The expected weather conditions and additional input data are then applied in step to one or more precision agriculture models . Output from such models may also be further applied to develop artificial intelligence models for further analysis of the harvest condition as discussed further herein. The present invention performs an initial evaluation of the harvest condition and may ingest input data representing further observations to perform modifications of the initial evaluation. The present invention then produces the harvest condition output profile and provides this to the harvest advisory tool for use by one or more users or for further distribution or processing in an API module .

As noted above the harvest advisory model includes a layer of artificial intelligence that may be applied to develop relationships between input data and outputs from others of the precision agriculture models to perform the simulations forecasts diagnoses and predictions represented in the harvest condition output profile . The present invention contemplates that these relationships may be developed in a variety of different ways. For example the artificial intelligence module is configured to adjust to input data that includes observations provided from fields that are local or even distributed across a region. Other data applied to the artificial intelligence module includes as noted above output from other precision agriculture models and it is further contemplated that the original datasets for such models may be collected from institutions around the world and analyzed within the present invention. Regardless observations may be either quantitative e.g. grain moisture level as tested or qualitative e.g. the plant material became harvestable or unharvestable at a given time and location whether or not because of environmental factors . Such information can be analyzed with respect to both recent and current weather and soil conditions and the corresponding agronomic model outputs to make appropriate adjustments to the unaltered agronomic model output that would otherwise be provided to the user. This information can also be used to provide updated guidance to other users in similar circumstances with respect to locale crop etc. .

The artificial intelligence module uses associated weather conditions agronomic and other agricultural model outputs environmental considerations crop characteristics and other relevant data together with empirical observations where applicable to build a more comprehensive dataset that can be used to make far reaching improvements to or even replacements for the associated physical models for diagnosing and predicting the underlying harvest related condition. For instance the artificial intelligence layer can be applied to an adequately sized dataset to draw automatic associations between the available external data and the harvest related condition effectively yielding a black box model for simulating the condition. As more and more data are accumulated the data can be sub sampled the artificial intelligence layer retrained and the results tested against independent data in an effort to find the most reliable model. Further such a model implicitly yields information as to the importance of related factors through the resulting weighting systems between inputs subcomponents within the artificial intelligence layer and the model output s . This information may be used to identify which factors are particularly important or unimportant in the associated process and thus help to target ways of improving the model over time.

The present invention contemplates that many different types of artificial intelligence may be employed within the scope thereof and therefore the artificial intelligence module may include one or more of such types of artificial intelligence. The artificial intelligence module may apply techniques including but not limited to k nearest neighbor KNN logistic regression support vector machines or networks SVM and one or more neural networks.

The use of artificial intelligence in the harvest advisory model of the present invention enhances the utility of physical and empirical models by automatically and heuristically constructing appropriate relationships mathematical or otherwise relative to the complex interactions between growing and maturing plants the environment in which they reside the underlying processes and characteristics and the observational input data made available to the system. For example where predictive factors known to be related to a particular outcome are known and measured along with the actual outcomes in real world situations artificial intelligence techniques are used to train or construct a model that relates the more readily available predictors to the ultimate outcomes without any specific a priori knowledge as to the form of those relationships.

The present invention adopts a combined approach for simulating the relationships between predictive data and eventual outcomes. In the harvest advisory model the general nature of the relationships can be quantified with one or more physical models and or with artificial intelligence models which are then applied to a combination of the predictive data historical data metadata and other physical model outputs to better simulate the ultimate outcomes. This approach permits the better understood portions of the problem at hand to be modeled using a physical or empirical model while permitting the less well understood portions of the problem to be automatically modeled based on the relationships implicit in the data provided to the system. In additional embodiments with sufficient input data and output reliability and accuracy the physical models may be entirely supplanted by the use of artificial intelligence model s . Alternatively the artificial intelligence layer need not be employed in the system to produce the desired output information.

The proliferation of devices for communicating data both collected and required during harvests provides the opportunity to address many issues with obtaining reliable centralized datasets for modeling harvest activities. For example issues arise because although key predictive factors or ground truths are routinely measured in production agriculture they are rarely reported into a centralized repository of data that could be used to develop models that simulate the relevant relationships. Further the mere act of reporting and collecting this data does not in itself provide the ability to develop models based on the data. In one embodiment of the present invention past present and predicted weather data for any location globally are constructed through combined application of one or more of in situ weather observations remotely sensed weather observations and meteorological analysis and prediction models. These data are made available via an API based system for obtaining weather data for any given location and timeframe. Likewise global national and regional databases of soil and land cover characteristics are also made available via an API system making these potentially predictive parameters readily available for association with any harvest related observations that might become available. These data along with user provided crop metadata can be used to diagnose and predict the growth and maturation of a crop to be harvested with or without the aforementioned systems and methods including whether or not the processes are performed on a mobile device. Using a field data collection device such as a smartphone or tablet observations of conditions impacting harvest operations can be provided in near real time. These observations may include grain moisture samples whether from a trial harvest operation or manual sampling crop harvestability metrics field accessibility metrics or any number of other characteristics of the crop or field that may impact the crop s behaviors or its harvest operations. Additionally through combined application of locational information available from the device and crop or field metadata relating to the aforementioned observations that might be collected through an application accessible on the device data on additional predictive factors can be collected and associated with each observation. When combined with automatically collected weather soil and other environmental data these data can be used as the basis for automatically building artificial intelligence models that either simulate the future expected states of the harvest impacting conditions directly or that act to provide corrective adjustments to the outputs of one or more physical models for simulating the underlying processes.

The systems and methods of the present invention therefore provide the opportunity to substantially advance the state of the art in terms of planning and managing harvest operations with the use of combinations of physical and empirical models with artificial intelligence. It is further notable however that many types and sources of input data allow for user based and or locality based biases in the observations and predictive data that are available to develop the artificial intelligence modeling paradigms contemplated herein. Some of these biases may represent differences in perception where subjective feedback is accepted while others may be due to biases in the instrument s used to collect more quantitative observations and even others may be due to variability in factors associated with the crop or farm operation that are outside of the realm of what is being collected in terms of metadata for instance the design of the particular harvesting equipment used can impact both harvestability and field accessibility for a given operation . Because of this the present invention contemplates development of both generalized artificial intelligence models using all available data and metadata and localized or user specific artificial intelligence models tailored to analyze for example a particular location user crop operation soil type and seed variety. These highly localized or personalized models may yield information that is more closely tailored to the particular location or user than that provided from original data.

As noted above the harvest advisory model ingests many different types of weather information for application to the modeling approaches discussed above. This includes real time historical and forecasted field level data representative of assessments of localized weather conditions and may include long range climatological and or meteorological forecasting in one or more predictive weather models .

Such real time field level data representative of assessments of localized weather conditions may be produced by many different sources of meteorological data to provide one or more of observed weather data and current field level weather data and predicted weather data for example as data that is complementary to the data assimilation systems and forecasting systems noted below. Such additional sources of weather data may include data from both in situ and remotely sensed observation platforms. For example numerical weather prediction models NWP and or surface networks may be combined with data from weather radars and satellites to reconstruct the current weather conditions on any particular area to be analyzed. There are numerous industry NWP models available and any such models may be used as sources of meteorological data in the present invention. Examples of NWP models at least include RUC Rapid Update Cycle WRF Weather Research and Forecasting Model GFS Global Forecast System as noted above and GEM Global Environmental Model . Meteorological data is received in real time and may come from several different NWP sources such as from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting ECMWF Meteorological Services of Canada s MSC Canadian Meteorological Centre CMC as well as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s NOAA Environmental Modeling Center EMC and many others. Additionally internally or privately generated mesoscale NWP models developed from data collected from real time feeds to global and localized observation resources may also be utilized. Such mesoscale numerical weather prediction models may be specialized in forecasting weather with more local detail than the models operated at government centers and therefore contain smaller scale data collections than other NWP models used. These mesoscale models are very useful in characterizing how weather conditions may vary over small distances and over small increments of time. The present invention may be configured to ingest data from all types of NWP models regardless of whether publicly privately or internally provided or developed.

Long range climatological and or meteorological forecasting may be generated by in one aspect of the present invention dynamical extended range weather forecast models generated from known methods for inter seasonal to inter annual climate prediction which have evolved into a combination of deterministic and statistical modeling schemes that permit the capture of long term low frequency features. Such forecasting often requires global analyses for the specification of observed initial and boundary conditions the use of sophisticated numerical weather prediction models a statistical treatment of the model results and a verification of the forecast results as a feedback into forecast refinement.

In one embodiment of the present invention providing long range climatological and or meteorological forecasting may involve the use of two data assimilation systems and two forecasting systems. The two data assimilation systems may be used to provide historic and current atmospheric and land surface initial conditions and also global ocean temperatures. For example the two forecast systems may incorporate the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Predictions NCEP Global Forecast System GFS for atmospheric predictions and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Modular Ocean Model to provide sea surface temperature predictions. Software and data supporting the above are publicly available from the NCEP.

The present invention contemplates that one or more predictive weather models may be incorporated to develop expected weather conditions as in . Such models may be executed at any desirable time interval such as daily or hourly to provide a complete global dataset for use in initializing the subsequent model run and to be used to supply localized values for harvest projections for individual crop locations.

Another type of input data contemplated within the scope of the present invention is image data such as field level processed remotely sensed imagery in the form of remotely sensed satellite imagery data and remotely captured drone imagery data which may be ingested to provide additional support for an assessment of crop and soil states and yield metrics in the harvest advisory model . One source of image data representing this remotely sensed imagery is satellite systems such as fine temporal resolution low earth orbit satellites that provide a minimum of three spectral bands. Another source is unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles such as those commonly referred to as drones . Other sources are also contemplated such as for example manned aerial reconnaissance lower temporal frequency earth resources satellite such as LANDSAT and MODIS ground based robots and sensors mounted on field and farm equipment. Regardless of the source this image information is field navigated to provide users with the most recent high resolution depiction of a field to be or being harvested. Image data may be delivered on a web or application based device configured for use with the harvest advisory tool and additional tools may be provided for spatially navigating the image data and overlaying a variety of weather data elements.

Regardless of the source the field level remotely sensed raw or image data may be used by the harvest advisory model to map the crop field and generate a time series profile of harvest activity. It is contemplated that remotely sensed satellite imagery data and remotely captured drone imagery data may be analyzed prior to or in concert with application to the one or more modeling paradigms discussed herein. The remotely sensed satellite imagery data and remotely captured drone imagery data may be analyzed using a normalized difference vegetative index NDVI that provides the user with an evaluation of plant health biomass nutrient content and moisture or wetness content. Other approaches may also be employed for such analysis such as Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index OSAVI Triangular Chlorophyll Index OSAVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index Improved Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index MSAVI and Red Edge Model MSAVI.

The harvest advisory model may further include additional sources of data such as image based data from systems such as video cameras and data generated from one or more vehicle based sensing systems including those systems coupled to computing systems configured on harvesting equipment or those systems configured to gather weather data from mobile devices present within vehicles such as the mobile telephony devices and tablet computers as noted above. Crowd sourced observational data may also be provided from farmers using mobile telephony devices or tablet computers using software tools such as mobile applications and from other sources such as social media feeds. Meteorologist input may be still a further source of data. The data collected or used need not be in image format.

Visible adaptation of the output of any of the modeling paradigms employed within the harvest advisory model and harvest advisory tool to user provided feedback data helps to foster a productive and ongoing feedback loop between the user and the harvest advisory model over time. While adding an artificial intelligence layer to the overall modeling system leads to output that is generally responsive to user feedback on the whole it is possible that even the output of the artificial intelligence model or artificial intelligence layer functioning together with a physical model may differ from real world observations. The present invention therefore contemplates in another embodiment an extra layer of forced adaptation software for adjusting output to ensure responsiveness to feedback data and enforce the belief that data being provided is actually being used to automatically improve the corresponding model over time. Since even a model based on artificial intelligence cannot be reasonably forced to return an outcome that is consistent with what is observed even after that observation has been included in the pool of data that was used to develop the model in the first place a forced adaptation layer that varies according to the nature of the problem and model s to which it resides is applied so that information provided to the user going forward is well matched to the information the user has provided. For example it is entirely possible that feedback and observational data provided by two different users for seemingly identical situations from the perspective of the data the system has available will conflict even to the extent of potentially being diametrically opposed. Applied to the same adaptive learning model the present invention may produce an indeterminate outcome because of the conflicting feedback or even a conflicting outcome to what the user has reported. The forced adaptation layer is therefore an additional module atop the artificial intelligence layer that provides an appropriate albeit brute force adjustment to system output to ensure that it is consistent with the feedback and observational data the user has provided for the appropriate timeframe if one exists so as to provide the perception of responsiveness to the user and encourage the provision of further feedback and observational data.

The present invention contemplates that many applications of the harvest advisory model are used to provide specific output information for supporting farming and harvesting operations. In one such application the harvest condition output profile provides a pre harvest prediction of in field dry down of a mature small grain coarse grain or oilseed crop over time but crop type need not be limited to this. For example root based crops may be considered for either in field crop dry down or crop moisture acquisition. This prediction is provided via the harvest advisory tool and is used for planning the timing of pre harvest harvest and post harvest operations for such crops.

The harvest advisory tool provides this prediction in one or more approaches. In one such approach the harvest advisory model leverages weather prediction models to predict weather conditions that impact the rate of drying or wetting of a root based crop or the grain associated with a mature small grain coarse grain or oilseed crop in a particular field. A physical model is also applied to simulate the expected dry down of the grain in the particular field based on the combination of crop and field characteristics and the expected weather conditions. This is accomplished by receiving one or more samples of actual grain moisture from the field at one or more times and modifying based on the differences between simulated and sampled moisture content at the corresponding times the prediction of the expected dry down of the grain in the particular field over time.

In another approach a prediction of weather conditions that impact the rate of drying or wetting of a root based crop or the grain associated with a mature small grain coarse grain or oilseed crop in a particular field is formed using crop metadata and one or more samples of actual grain moisture from one or more fields at one or more times. The weather conditions crop metadata and root or grain moisture samples from one or more fields and one or more crops are applied to automatically develop an in field root or grain dry down model based on artificial intelligence. The harvest advisory model then applies the artificial intelligence based model to diagnose or predict the in field dry down of grain with similar characteristics in any field at any chosen time.

In another application the harvest condition output profile provides a prediction of the time varying unit costs per percent moisture per unit of mass or volume associated with fuel based or forced air mechanical drying of grain resulting from changing weather conditions and the characteristics of a grain drying facility. This prediction is provided via the harvest advisory tool for evaluating the impact of time varying weather conditions on the unit costs of forced air or fuel based drying.

In this application the harvest advisory model leverages weather prediction models to predict weather conditions that impact the energy requirements associated with at least one of forced air and fuel based mechanical grain drying. This is accomplished by receiving metadata whether past present or future regarding the characteristics of at least one of forced air and fuel based mechanical grain drying facility and their associated resources and applying the predicted weather data and facility metadata in at least one of an empirical physical and artificial intelligence model to predict the time varying cost of at least one of forced air and fuel based grain drying. Factors that may impact the cost of forced air or fuel based drying include the atmospheric temperature and moisture content the temperature of the grain itself often reflective of the ambient temperature at the time of harvest the moisture of the grain the amount of airflow with respect to a measurement of area or volume cost of the energy used to drive the airflow and the energy efficiency of the facility itself. In the process of drying heat is necessary to evaporate moisture from the grain and a flow of air is needed to carry away the evaporated moisture. There are two basic mechanisms involved in the drying process the migration of moisture from the interior of an individual grain to the surface and the evaporation of moisture from the surface to the surrounding air. The rate of drying is determined by the moisture content and the temperature of the grain and the temperature the relative humidity and the velocity of the air in contact with the grain. Likewise facility design such as continuous flow dryers batch dryers tower dryers and the like can impact the ultimate drying costs by 50 or more.

In yet another application the harvest condition output profile provides a prediction of the time varying unit costs per unit of mass or volume associated with the combined impacts of time varying grain moisture levels of the crop to be harvested and the time varying unit costs per percent moisture per unit of mass or volume of forced air or fuel based mechanical drying. This prediction is provided via harvest advisory tool for evaluating the costs associated with in field vs. facility based drying of an agricultural commodity requiring sufficiently low moisture levels for stable long term storage.

In this application the harvest advisory model predicts the in field dry down of the grain associated with a crop in a particular field using one or more physically based and or or artificial intelligence models to simulate the combined impacts of weather conditions crop characteristics and field characteristics on grain moisture levels. The harvest advisory model then uses predicted weather data to predict metadata associated with one or more of forced air and fuel based mechanical grain drying facilities and analyzes relationships that quantify the process of grain drying the per unit time varying cost of drying the grain cost per percentage point of moisture per unit of grain mass or volume . Then using the predicted in field grain dry down and the predicted cost of one or more of forced air and fuel based grain drying the effective time varying overall cost of forced air and or fuel based grain drying cost per unit of grain mass or volume is predicted.

Another application of the present invention includes aiding in the assessment of the expected costs of forced air or fuel based mechanical drying of a crop owing to early harvest relative to the potential costs of crop losses due to adverse weather conditions and the susceptibility of the in field crop to weather and other causes of yield loss. In this application the harvest condition output profile provides an assessment of the trade offs associated with delaying harvest operations to achieve a more appealing crop moisture level verses the risks associated with leaving the crop exposed in a field. The present invention performs this assessment by applying predictions of the in field grain dry down and the time varying cost of at least one of forced air and fuel based grain drying to predict the effective overall time varying cost of mechanical forced air or fuel based grain drying cost per unit of grain mass or volume . It then predicts using crop characteristics and predicted weather data the time varying potential for crop yield losses owing to adverse weather conditions and provides time varying comparative data on the costs of at least one of forced air and fuel based drying associated with earlier harvest of the crop versus the risks associated with yield losses associated with adverse weather conditions that may be experienced prior to harvest of the crop.

The present invention may also be configured to diagnose and predict the soil temperature and moisture profiles in a given field to provide guidance as to when soils in that field are likely to become exceedingly wet or frozen thereby inhibiting harvest and post harvest tillage operations. In this application the harvest condition output profile provides an assessment of the trade offs associated with delaying harvest operations to achieve a more appealing crop moisture level verses the risks associated with leaving the crop exposed in a field. The present invention performs this assessment by applying predictions of the in field grain dry down and the time varying cost of at least one of forced air and fuel based grain drying to predict the effective overall time varying cost of mechanical forced air or fuel based grain drying cost per unit of grain mass or volume . In parallel it also predicts using crop characteristics soil data and predicted weather data the time varying likelihood of at least one of excess moisture or frost developing within the soil profile and provides time varying comparative data on the costs of forced air or fuel based drying associated with earlier harvest of the crop versus the risks associated with excessive moisture or frost developing within the soil profile prior to the time when at least one of harvest operations and post harvest tillage operations can be completed.

In another application the harvest condition output profile enables a diagnosis and prediction of the impacts of time varying soil temperature profile in a given field as it pertains to the internal temperature of root based crops and their long term storage stability at those temperatures. This is provided via harvest advisory tool for aiding in the timing of harvest operations so as to optimize storage conditions.

The present invention provides this diagnosis and prediction in one or more approaches. In one approach the harvest advisory model leverages at least one of weather prediction models land surface and soil models to predict the time varying temperature and moisture content of a root based crop intended to be harvested. Utilizing predicted weather conditions the present invention then predicts using the crop temperature and moisture and airflow characteristics of the storage pile or facility the stability of the crop for long term storage.

In another approach the present invention collects data on crop temperature and moisture storage dimensions and airflow characteristics for a stored crop over time. It then compares this crop storage data against at least one of time varying weather data and outputs of models for simulating crop moisture and temperature characteristics in the corresponding times and locations for the corresponding crops to develop artificial intelligence models for relating these crop storage characteristics to the more readily available weather data and outputs of models for simulating crop moisture and temperature characteristics. Using the airflow characteristics of the storage pile or facility and the artificial intelligence model and at least one of forecast weather data and forecast outputs of models for simulating crop temperature and moisture characteristics the present invention then provides a forecast of the likely windows of harvestability on the current and future days and the potential for crop stability for long term storage.

In another application the harvest condition output profile enables prediction of the day by day windows of opportunity for harvest operations owing to time varying threshability as a result of interactions between a standing or windrowed crop and atmospheric and soil conditions. The present invention provides this prediction to aid in more immediate planning of harvest operations in one or more approaches. In one approach the harvest advisory model predicts the daily window of harvest opportunity due to the impact of plant wetness on crop threshability by collecting data on temporal windows of harvestability for a particular crop at a particular location over some recent period of time and comparing this harvestability data against at least one of time varying weather data and outputs of models for simulating plant wetness characteristics in the crop in order to identify relationships between these external data and the reported harvestability data. The harvest advisory model then provides based on these identified relationships and the at least one of time varying weather forecast data and forecast outputs of models for simulating plant wetness characteristics a forecast of the likely windows of harvestability on the current and future days.

In another approach the present invention predicts the daily window of harvest opportunity due to the impact of plant wetness on crop threshability by collecting data on windows of harvestability for various crops at various locations over time and comparing this harvestability data against at least one of time varying weather data and outputs of models for simulating plant wetness characteristics in the corresponding times and locations for the corresponding crops in order to develop artificial intelligence models for relating these windows of harvestability to the more readily available weather data and outputs of models for simulating plant wetness characteristics. The harvest advisory model then provides using the artificial intelligence model and at least one of forecast weather data and forecast outputs of models for simulating plant wetness characteristics a forecast of the likely windows of harvestability on the current and future days.

The present invention may also be configured for an application in which the harvest condition output profile enables prediction of the dry down of cutting crops such as hay and others for example alfalfa over time. The harvest advisory tool uses this output of the harvest advisory model for planning the timing of or predicting windows of opportunity for cutting windrowing silageing or bailing operations for hay fields.

The present invention performs this collecting of data on temporal windows of cut windrow bail during consecutive and disjoint operations for hay at a particular location over some recent period of time and compares this operational data against at least one of time varying weather data and outputs of models for simulating plant wetness characteristics in the hay in order to identify relationships between these external data and the reported operational data. The harvest advisory model then provides based on these identified relationships and the at least one of time varying weather forecast data and forecast outputs of models for simulating plant wetness characteristics a forecast of the likely windows of for example cut windrow bail operations on the current and future days.

Additionally the present invention may also be configured for an application in which the harvest condition output profile provides assistance with the decision to apply a desiccant to affect a desired harvest window. The harvest advisory tool uses this output of the harvest advisory model in one or more approaches. In one such approach the present invention collects data on temporal windows of mature growth stages and desiccant efficacy and harvestability for a particular desiccant for particular crop at a particular location over some recent period of time. It then compares crop growth stage desiccant and harvestability data against at least one of time varying weather data and outputs of models for simulating plant wetness and seed moisture characteristics in the crop in order to identify relationships between these external data and the reported crop growth stage desiccant and harvestability data. The present invention then provides based on these identified relationships and the at least one of time varying weather forecast data and forecast outputs of models for simulating plant wetness and seed moisture characteristics a forecast of the likely windows of desiccant efficacy and subsequently the crop moisture on the current and future days.

In another approach the harvest advisory model collects data on temporal windows of mature growth stages desiccant efficacy and harvestability for a particular desiccant for a particular crop at a particular location over some recent period of time and compares crop growth stage desiccant and harvestability data against at least one of time varying weather data and outputs of models for simulating plant wetness and seed moisture characteristics in the crop in order to develop artificial intelligence models relating these external data and the reported crop growth stage desiccant and harvestability data. The harvest advisory tool then provides using the artificial intelligence model and at least one of time varying weather forecast data and forecast outputs of models for simulating plant wetness and seed moisture characteristics a forecast of the likely windows of desiccant efficacy and subsequently the crop moisture on the current and future days.

The execution of the harvest advisory model prior to during or following harvest activities addresses multiple factors that can be used by farmers to improve and enhance management of harvest operations. The harvest advisory tool provides farmers with many different types of harvest related information such as evaluations predictions forecast and diagnoses of harvest conditions . As noted above this harvest related information may include estimates of standing crop dry down rates anticipated harvest dates and suitability fuel consumption optimizers for forced air drying indicators of plant toughness for anticipating harvest windows and possible loss of field workability due to the formation of frost in the soils prior to post harvest tillage.

One specific example of such harvest related information include predictions of expected in field pre harvest dry down of a mature small grain coarse grain or oilseed crop over time so that users can plan the timing of a harvest operation. Another example is a prediction of time varying unit costs associated with at least one of fuel based or forced air mechanical drying of grain resulting from changing weather conditions and characteristics of the grain drying facility for post harvest crop storage. Yet another example is an assessment of expected costs of forced air or fuel based mechanical drying of a crop owing to early harvest relative to the potential costs of crop losses due to adverse weather conditions and the susceptibility of the in field crop to weather and other causes of yield loss. Still another example is a diagnosis and prediction of soil temperature and moisture profiles in a given field to provide guidance as to when soils in that field are likely to become exceedingly wet or frozen thereby inhibiting harvest and post harvest tillage operations. A further example is a diagnosis and prediction of the impacts of a time varying soil temperature profile in a given field as it pertains to the internal temperature of root based crops and their long term storage stability at those temperatures thereby aiding in the timing of harvest operations so as to optimize storage conditions. Still a further example is prediction of harvest opportunity windows such as the daily window of harvest opportunity due to the impact of plant wetness on crop threshability and the timing or windows of opportunity of cutting windrowing silageing or bailing operations with regard to dry down of hay alfalfa et al. cutting over time. Additional examples involve a determination of whether to apply a desiccant to affect a desired harvest window and a determination of field workability loss .

The harvest advisory tool contemplates that output data may be generated for visual representation of the information contained for example on a graphical user interface. With the harvest advisory tool users may be able to configure settings for and view various aspects of the harvest advisory model using a display on such graphical user interfaces and or via web based or application based modules. Tools and pull down menus on such a display or in web based or application based modules may also be provided to customize the type and nature of the input data applied to the various modeling paradigms of the harvest advisory model as well as the output data provided in the harvest condition output profile . Examples of this include the tactile and or haptic notifications of changes in the harvest conditions discussed herein. Other types of notifications may include those provided via applications resident on mobile telephony tablet or wearable devices are also possible such as for example a voice based output generated to verbally notify farmers of possible disease or pest risk.

As noted above the output data of the harvest advisory model may be used to generate a plurality of advisory services in one or more application programming interface API modules . These advisory services provide enhanced decision making support to harvest operations in precision agricultural production.

These advisory services are driven by the generation of the harvest condition output profile that results in the harvest action reporting and harvest summary reporting aspects of the output data . Each of these advisory services enriches the utilization and application of the augmented crop growth model .

One such advisory service is a current and historical weather reporting service . Site specific weather information is an important element of field recordkeeping in agricultural production. Using the field geo positional information provided for the harvest advisory modeling current and historical weather for the field location may be provided as an advisory service for specific geographical locations.

A soil modeling service is another advisory service contemplated within the scope of the present invention. One API module applies the harvest condition output profile and output data to a sophisticated soil model to generate information that provides a better understanding of current and future soil conditions relative to historical soil conditions at harvest times. Such a soil model supports the use of existing soil properties e.g. organic matter soil type etc. tillage practices presence of tile drainage and irrigation history along with the advanced short medium or long range weather forecasting. This coupling of modeled soil characteristics with advanced weather forecasting information at harvest times provides a valuable tool for indicating crop potential. The output of an API module generating this soil modeling service may be further configured to provide a detailed past through future analysis of soil characteristics impacting harvest conditions such as soil temperature and moisture assessments including freeze and thaw information the amount of water throughput runoff or ponding of soils and an important interpretation of workability of the soils.

Another advisory service is soil conditions forecasting service . The soil modeling service can be used with prediction of expected weather conditions to provide an estimate of future soil conditions at harvest times in this advisory service . Using the weather and location specifications a forecast of soil temperature and moisture conditions for the specified field location can generated. Such a forecast in this service enables anticipation of periods of suitable soil conditions for field operations including workability particularly those after periods of rainfall.

Another advisory service as an output of the harvest advisory model is a harvest alerts service . The importance of information provided to production agriculture in the present invention dictates a necessity for an effective and direct method of conveying information. The harvest alerts service may utilize a push technology for immediate and direct dissemination of information provided as output data from the harvest advisory model . The API module that generates this service may be configured to so that as the time for conducting a harvest operation nears users may receive alerts of important combinations of weather conditions risk factors and decision support aides for the purposes of managing and timing harvest operations. This is supported by user specified elements including alert parameters location s lead time s time s of day and the particular device s to receive the alerts. For example a custom harvesting operation may integrate their work orders with such an alerting system in order to optimize the logistics of their operation by avoiding costly weather related delays to harvest operations through either spatial or temporal reassignment of equipment and related resources.

As noted above the present invention may in one embodiment is configured to diagnosis and prediction of the impacts of a time varying soil temperature profile in a given field as it pertains to the internal temperature of root based crops and their long term storage stability at those temperatures. Such a model aids in the timing of harvest operations so as to optimize crop storage conditions.

Such an embodiment is performed in a system and method of evaluating a timing of harvest operations and crop storage conditions comprising in which a profile of long term storability of an agricultural commodity is developed with a harvest advisory model.

The harvest advisory model forecasts harvestability windows over a specified period of time and crop stability for long term storage by simulating the expected weather conditions crop specific information for an agricultural commodity to be harvested and the field specific information in an agricultural model of one or more physical and empirical characteristics of crop moisture and crop temperature for harvestability of crops at corresponding times and locations. The agricultural model comprises at least one of a crop specific growing degree day model a soil model a land surface model. Also an artificial intelligence model may be developed to simulate crop storage characteristics from the expected weather conditions one or more sampled observations from a planted field and crop storage facility data by building a comprehensive dataset for the agricultural model of one or more physical and empirical characteristics of crop moisture and crop temperature for harvestability of crops at corresponding times and locations.
