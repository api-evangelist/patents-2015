The following clearly describes the technical solutions in the embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of the present invention. Apparently the described embodiments are merely some but not all of the embodiments of the present invention. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the present invention without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of the present invention.

A data transmission method is mainly applied to a data transmission system that primarily provides an uplink service for example the Internet of Things which is called a machine to machine Machine to Machine M2M network for short. However the data transmission method in this embodiment is a method executed by a terminal device that includes an application apparatus and a communication apparatus where the application apparatus and the communication apparatus may be separate entities for example an electricity meter an application apparatus in the Internet of Things and a device that is connected to the electricity meter and can perform communication or the application apparatus and the communication apparatus may be two modules included in a same entity. Generally the application apparatus uploads application information for example status information such as a number counted by an electricity meter to a server on a network by using the communication apparatus.

When the terminal device is powered on and registers with a network side the terminal device may be in two states namely a non activated state and a connected state. The method in this embodiment of the present invention is a data transmission method implemented after the terminal device is powered on and registers with the network side and a flowchart is shown in and the method includes 

Step When a terminal device does not need to send uplink data set the terminal device to be in a first non activated state. An application apparatus in the terminal device may transmit state information of the application apparatus and the like to a communication apparatus and if the communication apparatus does not receive uplink data it indicates that the terminal device does not need to upload uplink service data and the terminal device is set to be in the first non activated state. Specifically the terminal device may be triggered to operate in the first non activated state.

In this embodiment in the first non activated state the terminal device does not listen to a paging message and therefore does not receive downlink data sent by a network side device where the paging message herein is delivered by the network side device to the terminal device may be used to instruct the terminal device to receive changes in a service and system information or may be used to page the terminal device and require the terminal device to establish a connection to the network side device and the like. In the first non activated state the terminal device does not listen to a broadcast message either where the broadcast message is broadcast by a base station and may include a system information block System Information Block SIB and the like. The foregoing system information may be specifically used to instruct the terminal device to access information such as information about an occupied channel and an uplink and downlink timeslot which is required by the base station.

When the terminal device is in the first non activated state if the network side device has downlink data that needs to be sent to the terminal device the downlink data may be buffered first for example when a server on a core network sends to an access network of the terminal device downlink data that is to be sent to the terminal device an access network side device such as a serving gateway Serving Gateway SGW buffers the downlink data first and then sends the buffered downlink data to the terminal device when the terminal device is in the connected state.

Step When the terminal device needs to send uplink data set the terminal device to be in a connected state and if system information needs to be updated the terminal device sends the uplink data after updating the system information and receives downlink data that is buffered by a network side device when the terminal device is in the first non activated state.

Because in the first non activated state the terminal device does not listen to the paging message the terminal device does not receive any downlink data sent by the network side device and the terminal device does not learn a change in the system information. When the terminal device enters the connected state from the non activated state to send the uplink data it is required to acquire the system first and determine whether the system information is consistent with system information stored in the terminal device. Specifically whether a value tag value tag in the system information is consistent with a stored value is determined if the version tag in the system information is inconsistent with the stored value the system information stored in the terminal device needs to be updated and only in this way can the terminal device communicate with the network side device correctly.

Further because the terminal device may move constantly if in the first non activated state the terminal device moves but does not execute a step of location updating when the terminal device is set to be in the connected state location updating further needs to be performed so as to update current location information of the terminal device and send updated information to the network side device.

The foregoing setting the terminal device to be in a connected state refers to re establishing a connection between the terminal device and the network side device and in this way the terminal device can not only send the uplink data according to the foregoing updated system information but also receive the downlink data that is buffered by the network side device when the terminal device is in the first non activated state.

It should be noted that the foregoing steps and have no absolute sequence relationship but are specific execution steps when the terminal device is in two different statuses and shows only one of specific implementation manners.

It may be seen that when a terminal device in this embodiment of the present invention does not send uplink data the terminal device is set to be in a first non activated state and does not listen to a paging message in the first non activated state. In this way the terminal device does not receive any downlink data nor constantly enter a connected state from the first non activated state to receive downlink data which reduces times of switching between the non activated state and the connected state and can reduce power dissipation of the terminal device thereby reducing power consumption in addition only when the terminal device sends uplink data the terminal device is set to be in the connected state which can fully ensure that the terminal device transmits the uplink data and receives the downlink data thereby ensuring uplink and downlink services.

To further reduce the power consumption of the terminal device the terminal device may enter the foregoing first non activated state after the foregoing step is executed that is after the uplink data is sent and when no downlink data is received or after the terminal device receives in the connected state a connection release message sent by the network side device. In this case the terminal device may actively send in the connected state second instruction information to the network side device where the second instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to release a connection between the network side device and the terminal device which does not require the network side device to determine whether to release the connection between the network side device and the terminal device the network side device may release the connection after receiving the second instruction information.

In a process of switching the terminal device from the connected state to the first non activated state that the terminal device is switched from the connected state to the first non activated state may also be that the terminal device enters the first non activated state provided that the terminal device has been in the connected state for a preset connection holding time t or the terminal device enters the first non activated state provided that the terminal device sends the uplink data and holds for a preset connection holding time t. The preset connection holding time t may be fixedly set in the terminal device and in this case the terminal device may actively send in the connected state or in a power on and registering process first instruction information to the network side device where the first instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to skip releasing the connection between the network side device and the terminal device when a time for which the network side device and the terminal device are in the connected state is within the preset connection holding time t or the first instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to skip releasing the connection between the network side device and the terminal device when a time of receiving the uplink data sent by the terminal device is within the preset connection holding time t. In these two cases after a time of a corresponding operation exceeds the preset connection holding time t the network side device actively releases the connection between the network side device and the terminal device which does not require the terminal device to further send the second instruction information to instruct the network side device to release the connection. Specifically after the network side device receives the first instruction information if the network side device and the terminal device are in the connected state a timer may be started and a time of the timer may be set to the foregoing preset connection holding time and the connection is not released until the timer is stopped or the timer is started after the network side device receives the last piece of the uplink data of the terminal device.

The foregoing preset connection holding time may also be configured for the terminal device by the network side device. Specifically in the connected state the terminal device may receive from a data plane or a user plane first configuration information sent by the network side device where the first configuration information includes the preset connection holding time or the terminal device receives in the power on and registering process first configuration information sent by the network side device. In addition the network side device may send the first configuration information to the terminal device by using a new message or an existing message. In this case the network side device knows the connection holding time t the network side device actively releases the connection between the network side device and the terminal device after the corresponding operation exceeds the connection holding time t which does not require the terminal device to send the first instruction information to instruct the network side device to release the connection.

It should be noted that the method in the foregoing embodiment is mainly aimed at a terminal device that primarily provides an uplink service however some terminal devices that have relatively more downlink services do not need to use the method in the foregoing embodiment to perform data transmission. To better distinguish these two types of terminal devices a type of terminal device that uses the method in this embodiment of the present invention may be set to a terminal device that is switched between the foregoing first non activated state and the connected state. The terminal device may send the type of the terminal device to the network side device in the power on and registering process and in this way the network side device buffers downlink data of the terminal device according to the type of the terminal device when the terminal device is in the foregoing first non activated state because in another embodiment the network side device knows the type of the terminal device the terminal device may not need to configure the type of the terminal device in the network side device and the network side device actively buffers the downlink data of the terminal device when the terminal device is in the first non activated state.

A data transmission method is mainly applied to a data transmission system that primarily provides an uplink service where a terminal device in the data transmission system includes an application apparatus and a communication apparatus. The method in this embodiment is a method executed by the network side device in the method in the foregoing Embodiment 1 where a flowchart of the method is shown in and the method includes 

Step When a terminal device is in a first non activated state a network side device buffers downlink data of the terminal device.

Step When the terminal device enters a connected state in which the terminal device is connected to the network side device the network side device receives uplink data sent by the terminal device and sends to the terminal device the downlink data that is buffered in step .

Steps executed by the terminal device are described in the foregoing Embodiment 1 and details are not repeatedly described herein. In the first non activated state the terminal device does not listen to a paging message sent by the network side device nor receive downlink data and in this case the network side device needs to buffer downlink data that needs to be sent and send the buffered downlink data to the terminal device when the terminal device is in the connected state.

It should be noted that in a specific embodiment the network side device does not execute the foregoing steps to for all terminal devices but the network side device executes the foregoing steps to provided that a type of a terminal device is a terminal device that is switched between the foregoing first non activated state and the connected state with respect to a terminal device of another type if there is downlink data the network side device instantly pages the terminal device by using a paging message so that the terminal device enters the connected state to receive the downlink data. The type of the terminal device may be sent to the network side device by the terminal device in a power on and registering process of the terminal device or may be locally preconfigured by the network side device.

The foregoing steps and have no absolute sequence relationship but are specific execution steps when the terminal device is in two different states and shows only one of specific implementation manners.

In this embodiment of the present invention when a terminal device does not send uplink data the terminal device is set to be in a first non activated state and does not listen to a paging message in the first non activated state. In this way the terminal device does not receive any downlink data and a network side device needs to buffer downlink data first so that the terminal device does not constantly enter a connected state from the first non activated state to receive the downlink data which reduces times of switching of the terminal device between the non activated state and the connected state thereby reducing power dissipation of the terminal device and power consumption in addition when the terminal device sends uplink data the terminal device is set to be in the connected state which can fully ensure that the terminal device transmits the uplink data and receives the downlink data buffered by the network side device thereby ensuring uplink and downlink services.

As shown in in a specific embodiment in addition to executing the foregoing steps and the network side device may passively release a connection by executing step when the terminal device is in the connected state the network side device may further passively hold the connection between the network side device and the terminal device by executing step the network side device may further actively configure a connection holding time for the terminal device by executing step to hold the connection between the network side device and the terminal device.

Step The network side device receives second instruction information sent by the terminal device where the second instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to release a connection between the network side device and the terminal device then releases the connection between the network side device and the terminal device according to the second instruction information.

Step When the terminal device is in the connected state or in a power on and registering process the network side device may receive first instruction information sent by the terminal device if the first instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to skip releasing the connection between the network side device and the terminal device when a time for which the network side device and the terminal device are in the connected state is within a preset connection holding time t the network side device releases the connection between the network side device and the terminal device according to the first instruction information after the time for which the network side device and the terminal device are in the connected state is the preset connection holding time t. Specifically after the network side device receives the first instruction information if the network side device and the terminal device are in the connected state a timer may be started and a time may be set to the preset connection holding time t and the connection between the network side device and the terminal device is not released until the timer is stopped.

If the first instruction information instructs the network side device to skip releasing the connection between the network side device and the terminal device when a time of receiving the uplink data sent by the terminal device is within a preset connection holding time t the network side device releases the connection between the network side device and the terminal device according to the first instruction information after the time of receiving the uplink data is the preset connection holding time. Specifically the foregoing timer may be stared after the network side device receives the last piece of the uplink data.

Step The network side device sends first configuration information to the terminal device where the first configuration information includes the foregoing preset connection holding time t and in this way the network side device actively releases the connection between the network side device and the terminal device after the time for which the network side device is connected to the terminal device is the preset connection holding time t. Specifically the network side device may send when the terminal device is in the connected state the first configuration information by using a user plane or a data plane or in the power on and registering process of the terminal device the network side device sends the first configuration information to the terminal device. In addition the first configuration information may be added to a new message or added to an existing message used for communication between the network side device and the terminal device so as to be sent to the terminal device.

The foregoing steps to are respectively three substeps for performing data transmission by the network side device where step and step have no absolute sequence relationship and may be executed at the same time or may be executed subsequently and shows only one of specific implementation manners.

A data transmission method is mainly applied to a data transmission system that primarily provides an uplink service and the method in this embodiment is a method executed by a terminal device including an application apparatus and a communication apparatus where the application apparatus and the communication apparatus may be separate entities or may be two modules included in a same entity.

When the terminal device is powered on and registers with a network side the terminal device may be in two states namely a non activated state and a connected state. The method in this embodiment of the present invention is a data transmission method implemented after the terminal device is powered on and registers with the network side and a flowchart is shown in and the method includes 

Step When a terminal device does not need to send uplink data set the terminal device to be in a second non activated state. If a communication apparatus in the terminal device does not receive uplink data sent by an application apparatus it indicates that the terminal device does not need to upload uplink service data and the terminal device is set to be in the second non activated state. Specifically the terminal device may be triggered to operate in the second non activated state.

In this embodiment in the second non activated state the terminal device may listen to a paging message within a preset first listening time t and does not listen to a paging message after the first listening time t is exceeded and in this case the terminal does not receive for a period of time any downlink data sent by a network side device. Alternatively in the second non activated state the terminal device may also listen to a paging message in a preset first quantity of listening times N and does not listen to a paging message after the first quantity of listening times N is exceeded. Herein one time of active search for a paging message performed by the terminal device is recorded as one time of paging message listening and the preset first listening time t and the preset first quantity of listening times N may be fixedly set in the terminal device or may be configured for the terminal device by the network side device.

Specifically the terminal device may receive second configuration information sent by the network side device where the second configuration information may include a time point for listening to the paging message and the preset first listening time t the preset first listening time t a time point for listening to the paging message and the preset first quantity of listening times N or the preset first quantity of listening times N. The second configuration information may be sent when the terminal device is in the second non activated state and listens to the paging message to the terminal device by the network side device by using a broadcast message or may be sent when the terminal device is in a connected state to the terminal device by the network side device by using a new message or an existing message.

When the terminal device is in the second non activated state if the terminal device does not listen to a paging message the network side device may first buffer downlink data that needs to be sent to the terminal device and then sends the buffered downlink data to the terminal device when the terminal device is in the connected state. If the terminal device listens to a paging message and if the network side device needs to send downlink data to the terminal device the network side device pages the terminal device by using a paging message and requires the terminal device to be switched to the connected state to receive the downlink data.

Step When the terminal device needs to send uplink data set the terminal device to be in a connected state and if system information needs to be updated the terminal device sends the uplink data after updating the system information the terminal device needs to receive downlink data that is buffered by a network side device when the terminal device is in the second non activated state. Specifically it is required that the uplink data is sent and the downlink data is received according to updated system information.

Because in the second non activated state the terminal device may not listen to a paging message for a period of time and in this way the terminal device does not learn a change in the system information. When the terminal device enters the connected state from the second non activated state to send the uplink data the system information needs to be acquired first and it is required to determine whether the system information is consistent with system information stored in the terminal device. If not the system information stored in the terminal device needs to be updated so that the terminal device can communicate with the network side device correctly. Further if in the second non activated state the terminal device moves but does not execute a step of location updating when the terminal device is set to be in the connected state location updating needs to be performed first so as to update current location information of the terminal device and send updated information to the network side device.

It should be noted that the terminal device is set to be in the connected state when the terminal device needs to send uplink data. Besides in this embodiment because in the second non activated state the terminal device listens to a paging message for a period of time if the network side device pages the terminal device in this period of time the terminal device may enter the connected state from the second non activated state.

The foregoing steps and have no absolute sequence relationship but are specific execution steps when the terminal device is in two different states and shows only one of specific implementation manners.

It may be seen that when a terminal device in this embodiment of the present invention does not send uplink data the terminal device is set to be in a second non activated state and in the second non activated state the terminal device listens to a paging message within a preset first listening time or a preset first quantity of listening times and does not listen to a paging message when the first listening time or the first quantity of listening times is exceeded. In this way the terminal device receives downlink data in the second non activated state only in a period of time for listening to the paging message but in a period of time for not listening to the paging message the terminal device does not constantly enter a connected state from the second non activated state to receive the downlink data which reduces times of switching between the non activated state and the connected state and can reduce power dissipation of the terminal device thereby reducing power consumption in addition the terminal device is set to be in the connected state when the terminal device sends the uplink data which can fully ensure that the terminal device transmits the uplink data and receives the downlink data thereby ensuring uplink and downlink services

To further reduce the power consumption of the terminal device after the foregoing step is executed that is after the uplink data is sent and when no downlink data is received or after the terminal device receives in the connected state a connection release message sent by the network side device the terminal device may enter the foregoing second non activated state or the first non activated state described in the foregoing embodiment. In this case the terminal device may actively send in the connected state second instruction information to the network side device where the second instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to release a connection between the network side device and the terminal device and the network side device may release the connection after receiving the second instruction information.

In another case in a process of switching the terminal device from the connected state to the first or the second non activated state that the terminal device is switched from the connected state to the first or the second non activated state may also be that the terminal device enters the first or the second non activated state after the terminal device has been in the connected state for a preset connection holding time t or after the terminal device sends the uplink data and holds for a preset connection holding time t where the preset connection holding time t may be fixedly set in the terminal device in this case the terminal device may actively send in the connected state or in a power on and registering process first instruction information to the network side device where the first instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to skip releasing the connection between the network side device and the terminal device when a time for which the network side device and the terminal device are in the connected state is within the preset connection holding time t or the first instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to skip releasing the connection between the network side device and the terminal device when a time of receiving the uplink data sent by the terminal device is within the preset connection holding time t after a time of a corresponding operation exceeds the preset connection holding time t the network side device actively releases the connection between the network side device and the terminal device which does not require the terminal device to further send second instruction information to instruct the network side device to release the connection.

The foregoing preset connection holding time may also be configured for the terminal device by the network side device. Specifically in the connected state the terminal device may receive from a data plane or a user plane first configuration information sent by the network side device where the first configuration information includes the preset connection holding time or the terminal device receives in the power on and registering process first configuration information sent by the network side device or when the terminal device is in the second non activated state and listens to the paging message the network side device may send first configuration information to the terminal device by using a broadcast message and in this way the terminal device may acquire the first configuration information from the broadcast message.

It should be noted that the method in this embodiment is mainly aimed at a terminal device that primarily provides an uplink service however some terminal devices that have relatively more downlink services do not need to use the method in this embodiment to perform data transmission. To better distinguish these two types of terminal devices if a terminal device needs to be in the second non activated state the terminal device may send a type of the terminal device to the network side device in a power on and registering process and in this way the network side device may buffer downlink data of the terminal device according to the type of the terminal device when the terminal device is in the foregoing second non activated state and does not listen to a paging message with respect to a terminal device of another type the network side device does not buffer downlink data when the terminal device is in a non activated state the terminal device is a type of terminal device that is switched between a second non activated state and a connected state.

In this case downlink data may be buffered in the network side device when a preset second listening time t or a preset second quantity of listening times N of the terminal device is exceeded and therefore when the terminal device is in the second non activated state and listens to a paging message in the preset first listening time t the network side device does not buffer the downlink data of the terminal device within the preset second listening time t but buffers the downlink data of the terminal device only if the terminal device is still in the second non activated state after the second listening time t is exceeded when the terminal device is in the second non activated state and listens to a paging message within the preset first quantity of listening times N the network side device does not buffer the downlink data of the terminal device when determining that the terminal device performs listening within the second quantity of listening times N but buffers the downlink data of the terminal device only if the terminal device is still in the second non activated state after the second quantity of listening times N is exceeded. The foregoing first listening time t may equal or may not equal the second listening time t and the first quantity of listening times N may equal or may not equal the second quantity of listening times N.

A data transmission method is mainly applied to a data transmission system that primarily provides an uplink service where a terminal device in the data transmission system includes an application apparatus and a communication apparatus. The method in this embodiment is a method executed by the network side device in the method in the foregoing Embodiment 3 where a flowchart of the method is shown in and the method includes 

Step When a terminal device is in a second non activated state a network side device buffers downlink data of the terminal device when a preset second listening time t or a preset second quantity of listening times N within which the terminal device listens to a paging message is exceeded and correspondingly in the second non activated state the terminal device listens to a paging message within a preset first listening time t or a preset first listening quantity of listening times N. The first listening time t may equal or may not equal the second listening time t and the first quantity of listening times N may equal or may not equal the second quantity of listening times N.

That the network side device buffers downlink data when a preset second listening time t or a preset second quantity of listening times N is exceeded specifically refers to that the network side device does not buffer the downlink data within the second listening time t but buffers the downlink data only if the terminal device is still in the second non activated state when the second listening time t is exceeded or the network side device buffers the downlink data provided that a quantity of times for which the terminal device listens to the paging message exceeds the second quantity of listening times N.

Step When the terminal device enters a connected state in which the terminal device is connected to the network side device the network side device receives uplink data sent by the terminal device and the network side device sends to the terminal device the downlink data that is buffered when the terminal device is in the second non activated state.

Steps executed by the terminal device are described in the foregoing Embodiment 3 and details are not repeatedly described herein. In the second non activated state for a period of time the terminal device does not listen to a paging message sent by the network side device and in this period of time the network side device needs to buffer downlink data that needs to be sent and send the buffered downlink data to the terminal device when the terminal device is in the connected state.

It should be noted that in a specific embodiment the network side device does not execute the foregoing steps to for all terminal devices but the network side device executes the foregoing steps to provided that a type of a terminal device is a terminal device that is switched between the foregoing second non activated state and the connected state with respect to a terminal device of another type if there is downlink data the network side device instantly pages the terminal device by using a paging message so that the terminal device enters the connected state to receive the downlink data. The type of the terminal device may be sent to the network side device by the terminal device in a power on and registering process of the terminal device or may be locally preconfigured by the network side device.

The foregoing steps and have no absolute sequence relationship but are specific execution steps when the terminal device is in two different states and shows only one of specific implementation manners.

In this embodiment of the present invention when a terminal device does not send uplink data the terminal device is set to be in a second non activated state and does not listen to a paging message for a period of time in the second non activated state and the terminal device enters a connected state from the second non activated state only in a period of time for listening the paging message to receive downlink data and does not constantly enter the connected state from the second non activated state in the period of time for not listening to the paging message to receive the downlink data which reduces times of switching of the terminal device between the non activated state and the connected state and can reduce power dissipation of the terminal device thereby reducing power consumption. A network side device needs to buffer the downlink data first when a preset second listening time or a preset second quantity of listening times for which the terminal device listens to the paging message is exceeded and the terminal device is set to be in the connected state when the terminal device sends the uplink data which can fully ensure that the terminal device transmits the uplink data and receives the downlink data buffered by the network side device thereby ensuring uplink and downlink services.

As shown in in a specific embodiment in addition to executing the foregoing steps and the network side device may passively release a connection by executing step when the terminal device is in the connected state the network side device passively holds the connection between the network side device and the terminal device by executing step the network side device may further actively configure a connection holding time for the terminal device by executing step to hold the connection between the network side device and the terminal device the network side device may further configure by executing step before step information indicating that the terminal device is in the second non activated state.

Step The network side device receives second instruction information sent by the terminal device where the second instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to release a connection between the network side device and the terminal device then releases the connection between the network side device and the terminal device according to the second instruction information.

Step The network side device receives first instruction information sent by the terminal device and if the first instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to skip releasing the connection between the network side device and the terminal device when a time for which the network side device and the terminal device are in the connected state is within a preset connection holding time t the network side device releases the connection between the network side device and the terminal device according to the first instruction information after the time for which the network side device and the terminal device are in the connected state is the preset connection holding time t. If the first instruction information instructs the network side device to skip releasing the connection between the network side device and the terminal device when a time of receiving the uplink data sent by the terminal device is within a preset connection holding time the network side device releases the connection between the network side device and the terminal device according to the first instruction information after the time of receiving the uplink data is the preset connection holding time.

Step The network side device sends first configuration information to the terminal device where the first configuration information includes the foregoing preset connection holding time t and in this way the network side device actively releases the connection between the network side device and the terminal device after the time for which the network side device is connected to the terminal device is the preset connection holding time t. In addition to sending the first configuration information to the terminal device when the terminal device is in the connected state or in the power on and registering process of the terminal device the network side device may also send when the terminal device is in the second non activated state and listens to the paging message the first configuration information to the terminal device by using a broadcast message.

Step The network side device sends second configuration information to the terminal device where the second configuration information includes a time point at which the terminal device listens to the paging message and the preset first listening time the preset first listening time a time point at which the terminal device listens to the paging message and the preset first quantity of listening times or the preset first quantity of listening times. Specifically the network side device may send when the terminal device is in the connected state the second configuration information by using a user plane or a data plane or the network side device sends the second configuration information to the terminal device in the power on and registering process of the terminal device. In addition the second configuration information may be added to a new message or added to an existing message used for communication between the network side device and the terminal device so as to be sent to the terminal device.

The foregoing steps to are respectively three substeps for performing data transmission by the network side device where step and step have no absolute sequence relationship and may be executed at the same time or may be executed subsequently and shows only one of specific implementation manners.

A data transmission method is mainly applied to an Internet of Things system shown in where the system includes devices such as a terminal device with a machine type communication MTC application a radio access network RAN a mobile management entity MME or a serving GPRS support node SGSN a home location register HLR or a home subscriber server HSS an MTC interworking function IWF entity a service gateway SGW and a packet data gateway PGW and an MTC server. In a solid line represents data transmission on a data plane and a dotted line represents data transmission on a control plane. The Internet of Things system may perform data transmission according to the following two methods 

When the terminal device is in a power on and registering process that is an attach procedure and in a procedure of authentication performed by a network side on the terminal device the terminal device informs the MME that a type of the terminal device is a terminal device that is switched between the first non activated state and the connected state the MME performs authentication on the terminal device by using subscription information of the terminal device and the MME may record the type of the terminal device in a context of the terminal device after the authentication succeeds the MME adds the type of the terminal device to a Create Session Request message that is sent to the SGW and then the SGW stores the type of the terminal device in the context of the terminal device.

After the terminal device is powered on and registers with the network side the terminal device may be in two states namely the first non activated state or the connected state and specifically when the terminal device does not need to send uplink data the terminal device is set to be in the first non activated state and does not listen to a paging message. In this case when downlink data of the terminal device reaches the SGW the SGW no longer triggers sending of a downlink data notification downlink data notification message to the MME but buffers the downlink data.

When the terminal device needs to send uplink data the terminal device is set to be in the connected state a SIB message is first acquired and a value tag in the SIB message is compared with a value stored in the terminal device where if the value tag in the SIB message is inconsistent with the value stored in the terminal device system information stored in the terminal device needs to be updated if the terminal device moves in the first non activated state but does not execute a location updating operation the terminal device needs to update a latest location to the network side. After the foregoing operation is executed the terminal device may send the uplink data according to updated system information and the SGW may send the buffered downlink data to the terminal device.

In a process in which the terminal device is in the connected state second instruction information may further be sent to a base station to instruct the base station to release a connection and the base station releases a connection between the base station and the terminal device after receiving the second instruction information. In the process in which the terminal device is in the connected state first instruction information may be sent to a base station in the RAN where the first instruction information includes a connection holding time t that is fixedly set in the terminal device in this way after receiving the first instruction information the base station starts a timer and sets a time of the timer to the connection holding time t and the base station releases a connection between the base station and the terminal device after the timer is stopped. In another specific embodiment the connection holding time t is not fixedly set in the terminal device and in this way an MME or the like on an uplink network may carry the connection holding time t to the terminal device by using a message that is in an Attach procedure an authentication procedure or a secure interaction procedure or a new message and the terminal device releases a connection after a time for which the terminal device has been in the connected state is the connection holding time t.

The MME may further send the foregoing connection holding time t to the base station by using an initial context setup request initial context setup request message that is in the Attach procedure a service request service request procedure or a switching process or a new message and if after receiving the connection holding time t the base station is currently in a connected state in which the base station is connected to the terminal device the base station starts a timer whose time is t if there is no session connection between the base station and the terminal device currently the base station starts the foregoing timer after receiving the first uplink data package or the last uplink data package of the terminal device. After the timer expires the base station releases the connection between the base station and the terminal device.

It should be noted that in the foregoing embodiment a type of the terminal device that is a terminal device that is switched between the first non activated state and the connected state may be sent to a network side device by the terminal device in another embodiment the network side device knows the type of the terminal device and in this way the terminal device does not need to send the type to the network side device and the network side device actively buffers downlink data of the terminal device when the terminal device is in the first non activated state.

 2 The terminal device is switched between a second non activated state and a connected state and in the second non activated state the terminal device listens to a paging message within a first listening time.

In a power on and registering process the terminal device informs a network side device that a type of the terminal device is a terminal device that is switched between the second non activated state and the connected state a specific process is similar to that of the foregoing case in which the terminal device is switched between the first non activated state and the connected state and details are not repeatedly described herein. In another case the network side device knows the type of the terminal device and may actively buffer when the terminal device is in the second non activated state downlink data provided that a preset second listening time t is exceeded.

After the terminal device is powered on and registers with a network side the terminal device may be in two states namely the second non activated state or the connected state and specifically when the terminal device does not need to send uplink data the terminal device is set to be in the second non activated state that is listens to a paging message within a first listening time t and does not listen to a paging message when the first listening time t is exceeded. In this case after the SGW receives a release access bearers request release access bearers request sent by the MME where the release access bearers request may instruct the terminal device to enter the second non activated state the SGW may start a timer whose time is the second listening time t and when downlink data of the terminal device reaches the SGW the SGW may trigger within the second listening time t sending of a downlink data notification downlink data notification message to the MME if the timer expires the SGW does not trigger the sending of the downlink data notification but buffers the downlink data.

When the terminal device needs to send uplink data the terminal device enters the connected state and an operation executed by the terminal device is similar to the operation of entering by the terminal device the connected state from the first non activated state and details are not repeatedly described herein. In the connected state the terminal device may send the uplink data and if the SGW has buffered the downlink data the SGW may send the buffered downlink data to the terminal device. In a process in which the terminal device is in the connected state the terminal device may further send second instruction information to a base station to release a connection or may send first instruction information to a base station to require the base station to hold a connection between the base station and the terminal device.

In another specific embodiment the foregoing connection holding time t and the first listening time t are not fixedly set in the terminal device and in this way an MME or the like on an uplink network may carry the connection holding time t and the first listening time t to the terminal device by using a message that is in an Attach procedure an authentication procedure or a secure interaction procedure or a new message the MME may add the second listening time t and the connection holding time t to a session recreation request that is sent to the SGW. In this embodiment because in the second non activated state the terminal device listens to a paging message for a period of time the MME may send the foregoing connection holding time t and the first listening time t to the terminal device by using a broadcast message.

It should be noted that because in some embodiments an application apparatus and a communication apparatus in a terminal device are separate entities when the terminal device is in the connected state the MTC server may directly inform the application apparatus of the terminal device of the foregoing connection holding time t and the first listening time t by using a data plane and in this way the application apparatus instructs by using an API interface the communication apparatus to listen to the paging message according to the first listening time t or the MTC server informs the terminal device of the configuration information by using a control plane and in this case the MTC server sends the configuration information to the MME and the MME configures the configuration information for the terminal device. In addition the MTC server may also configure for the terminal device a time point at which the terminal device listens to the paging message.

 3 The terminal device is switched between a second non activated state and a connected state and in the second non activated state the terminal device listens to a paging message according to a first quantity of listening times which is similar to the method in which the terminal device listens to the paging message according to the first listening time in the second non activated state but a difference is that the terminal device listens to a paging message according to a first quantity of listening times N while a network side device for example an SGW buffers downlink data provided that a quantity of times for which the terminal device listens to a paging message exceeds a second quantity of listening times N. Therefore in the SGW to determine whether downlink data needs to be buffered a timer is not started but a counter used to count listening times of the terminal device is started. When a value of the counter reaches the second quantity of listening times N if the terminal device is still in the second non activated state the downlink data is buffered.

A data transmission apparatus for example a terminal device is provided and is mainly configured to execute the method described in Method Embodiment 1 or 3 and a schematic structural diagram is shown in . The apparatus includes an inactivation processing unit and a connection processing unit .

The inactivation processing unit is configured to set when uplink data does not need to be sent the data transmission apparatus to be in a first non activated state or a second non activated state where when the data transmission apparatus is in the first non activated state the inactivation processing unit does not listen to a paging message and when the data transmission apparatus is in the second non activated state the inactivation processing unit listens to a paging message within a preset first listening time or a preset first quantity of listening times and does not listen to a paging message when the first listening time or the first quantity of listening times is exceeded.

The connection processing unit is configured to set when uplink data needs to be sent the data transmission apparatus to be in a connected state send if system information needs to be updated the uplink data after updating the system information and receive downlink data that is buffered by a network side device when the data transmission apparatus is in the first non activated state or the second non activated state where specifically the connection processing unit needs to send the uplink data and receive the downlink data according to updated system information.

Further if the data transmission apparatus moves in the first non activated state or the second non activated state the foregoing inactivation processing unit may further update a new location to a network side if the inactivation processing state does not perform location updating the connection processing unit may further first determine whether location updating needs to be performed and if the location updating needs to be performed the connection processing unit further needs to perform location updating.

In a data transmission apparatus in this embodiment of the present invention when no uplink data is sent an inactivation processing unit sets the data transmission apparatus to be in a first non activated state and in this way the data transmission apparatus does not listen to a paging message nor constantly enter a connected state from the first non activated state to receive downlink data or when uplink data is sent an inactivation processing unit sets the data transmission apparatus to be in a second non activated state and in this way the data transmission apparatus listens to a paging message in a period of time so that the data transmission apparatus enters a connected state from the second non activated state in the period of time to receive downlink data and in a process in which the inactivation processing unit does not listen to a paging message the data transmission apparatus does not enter the connected state from the second non activated state to receive downlink data which reduces times of switching between the non activated state and the connected state and can reduce power dissipation of the data transmission apparatus in this embodiment thereby reducing power consumption in addition a connection processing unit sets the data transmission apparatus to be in the connected state only when the uplink data is sent which can fully ensure that the data transmission apparatus transmits the uplink data and receives the downlink data thereby ensuring uplink and downlink services.

In another embodiment if the data transmission apparatus is switched between the second non activated state and the connected state the type sending unit may further be configured to send a type of the data transmission apparatus to the network side device so that the network side device buffers the downlink data according to the type of the data transmission apparatus when the data transmission apparatus is in the second non activated state and does not listen to the paging message where the type of the data transmission apparatus is an apparatus that is switched between the second non activated state and the connected state.

In the data transmission apparatus in this embodiment when the connection processing unit sends the uplink data but does not receive downlink data or after the connection processing receives a connection release message sent by the network side device the connection processing unit is further configured to trigger the inactivation processing unit to set the data transmission apparatus to be in the first non activated state or the second non activated state and in this case the second instruction sending unit may further send the second instruction information to the network side device to instruct the network side device to release the connection between the network side device and the data transmission apparatus.

Further if the terminal device moves in the first non activated state or the second non activated state but the processor does not update a new location to the network side device after the terminal device is set to be in the connected state the processor further needs to perform a location updating operation.

Further when the output apparatus sends the uplink data but does not receive the downlink data or after the input apparatus receives a connection release message sent by the network side device the processor may set the terminal device to be in the first non activated state or the second non activated state and in this case when the terminal device is in the connected state the processor may further control the output apparatus to send second instruction information to the network side device where the second instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to release a connection between the network side device and the terminal device.

In another case after the terminal device has been in the connected state for a preset connection holding time or after the output apparatus sends the uplink data and holds for a preset connection holding time the processor may set the terminal device to be in the first non activated state or the second non activated state. The preset connection holding time may be included in first configuration information sent by the network side device and received by the input apparatus or the preset connection holding time is fixedly set in the terminal device and in this way the processor may control the output apparatus to send first instruction information to the network side device where the first instruction information is used to instruct the network side device to skip releasing the connection between the network side device and the terminal device when a time for which the network side device and the terminal device are in the connected state is within the preset connection holding time.

Further when the terminal device is switched between the second non activated state and the connected state the processor is further configured to receive second configuration information sent by the network side device where the second configuration information includes a time point for listening to the paging message and the preset first listening time the preset first listening time a time point for listening to the paging message and the preset first quantity of listening times or the preset first quantity of listening times in this way the processor listens when the terminal device is in the second non activated state to the paging message according to information configured in the second configuration information received by the processor . In this case data transmission may be performed between units in the terminal device according to the method described in Method Embodiment 3 and the processor may further control the output apparatus to send a type of the terminal device to the network side device where the type of the terminal device is a terminal device that is switched between the second non activated state and the connected state so that the network side device buffers the downlink data according to the type of the terminal device when the terminal device is in the second non activated state and does not listen to the paging message.

In another case if the terminal device is switched between the first non activated state and the connected state data transmission may be performed between units of the terminal device according to the method described in Method Embodiment 1 and the processor may control the output apparatus to send a type of the terminal device to the network side device where the type of the terminal device is a terminal device that is switched between the first non activated state and the connected state so that the network side device buffers the downlink data according to the type of the terminal device when the terminal device is in the first non activated state.
