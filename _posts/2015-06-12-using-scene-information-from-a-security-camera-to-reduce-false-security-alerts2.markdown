title: Using scene information from a security camera to reduce false security alerts
abstract: A process reduces false positive security alerts. The process is performed at a computing device having one or more processors, and memory storing one or more programs configured for execution by the one or more processors. The process computes a depth map for a scene monitored by a video camera using a plurality of IR images captured by the video camera and uses the depth map to identify a first region within the scene having historically above average false positive detected motion events. In some instances, the first region is a ceiling, a window, or a television. The process monitors a video stream provided by the video camera to identify motion events, excluding the first region, and generates a motion alert when there is detected motion in the scene outside of the first region and the detected motion satisfies threshold criteria.
