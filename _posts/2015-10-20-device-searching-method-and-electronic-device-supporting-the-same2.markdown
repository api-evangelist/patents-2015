According to various embodiments of the present disclosure the external electronic device may deliver place related information in addition to a BLE signal or may transmit uniform resource locator URL information for obtaining place related information or information relating to a WLAN signal associated with corresponding BLE together.

According to various embodiments of the present disclosure if there is no specified BLE signal detection by monitoring a BLE signal for a specified time the electronic device may output a notification about this. Then the electronic device may perform a control to return to a specified function for example a home screen or a function performed right before a device searching function .

Referring to according to various embodiments of the present disclosure the electronic device or the external electronic device may determine whether the other party approaches at a predetermined time point. In relation to this according to an embodiment of the present disclosure in operation when it is necessary to detect whether a specific device for example the external electronic device is adjacent the electronic device may insert the address of at least one external electronic device to be checked for adjacency into a BLE advertisement packet and then may transmit it. Upon the receipt of a BLE advertisement packet relating to the adjacency checking the external electronic device may measure the adjacency and in response to this may transmit a BLE advertisement packet to the electronic device in operation .

In the above operation when the address of the external electronic device is specified the electronic device may write the address in a packet and transmit it. Additionally when not specifying the external electronic device the electronic device may write a message for requesting an adjacency check in a packet having an address write omitted and may then transmit it. Upon the receipt of a packet relating to an adjacency check request the external electronic device may determine whether it is adjacent by using characteristics such as the signal intensity of a request packet before sending a response and only when it is adjacent may send a response to the electronic device .

The adjacency request packet as mentioned above may include information of the external electronic device to be checked on whether it is adjacent and a reference value for determining the degree of adjacency. For example the electronic device may write a signal intensity reference value set to make a response only when a value is greater than a specific signal intensity value in an adjacency request packet and then may transmit it. In correspondence to this only when the signal intensity of a received adjacency request packet is greater than a signal intensity reference value the external electronic device may transmit an adjacency response packet to the electronic device .

In order to improve the accuracy of adjacency the external electronic device may write a reference value obtained when an adjacency request packet is received in an adjacency response packet to be transmitted and transmit it. The electronic device may determine the accuracy of adjacency by comparing a corresponding value of an adjacency response packet with a value extracted from a received signal.

For example when an adjacency request packet that the electronic device transmits is received as a value of 50 dBm the external electronic device may write information relating to 50 dBm in an adjacency response packet and then may transmit it to the electronic device . Upon the receipt of an adjacency response message the electronic device may measure a signal intensity for this. For example a signal intensity for an adjacency response message that the electronic device receives may be 60 dBm. In this case it is known that a distance between the electronic device and the external electronic device is between 50 dBm and 60 dBm.

Additionally information for defining a method that a corresponding device performs in a second step for example accurate distance or direction recognition may be written in an advertisement response or request packet. Based on this information when requesting a second step entry the electronic device may select one of methods commonly supported by the electronic device and the external electronic device and then may notify it to the external electronic device to perform a second step. For example in relation to a second step distance measuring method the electronic device may support WLAN multi input multi output MIMO and Audio based processing and the external electronic device may support only WLAN MIMO based processing. In this case the electronic device may request the external electronic device in order to perform WLAN MINO based second step processing through information exchange relating to a distance measurement method. If there are commonly supported methods the electronic device may select an optimal method specified based on variables such as accuracy measurement time and current consumption according to an application in execution and then may perform it. Additionally when the current remaining battery is less than a specified value as exchanging remaining battery information the electronic device may stop second step processing.

As mentioned above in relation to the first operation for determining a specific location entry the electronic device may use various techniques other than BLE. For example the electronic device may perform the first operation based on physical information and logical information.

In relation to the physical information the electronic device may use a reception intensity as a microphone receives radio signals specific sound waves or ultrasonic signals through WLAN e.g. Wi Fi and HyberLan Zigbee Z Wave and ultra wideband UWB which are communication standard techniques other than BLE for configuring a personal communication network using a low power digital radio.

Alternatively the electronic device may determine an approach to a specific location by using a variety of sensor information from vibration temperature pressure altitude smell and magnetic sensors. Alternatively in the case of outdoor the electronic device may check an approach to a specific location by directly utilizing GPS information. Alternatively the electronic device may determine the location by utilizing 3rd generation 3G and 4th generation 4G communication network cell Identification ID information and WLAN access point AP database DB .

In relation to the logical information the electronic device may use a context awareness technique using life logging. For example the electronic device may monitor a device usage pattern of a user and based on information collected through this may estimate the location of the electronic device at a specific time and a specific pattern. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the electronic device may estimate that it is located at a company at a corresponding time based on data accumulated for a worker going to the company at 9 00 am in a specified period. Alternatively the electronic device may identify the location thereof by analyzing a specific sound pattern of sound obtained based on a low power microphone in an Always on state. For example the electronic device may estimate whether it is located in a bus or located at a bus station at a specified predetermined location through bus noise. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure the electronic device combines the above mentioned context awareness technique with a Log based context awareness technique to more accurately estimate the location. According to various embodiments of the present disclosure the electronic device may estimate the current location of the electronic device by using manually inputted information or shared schedule information received from another electronic device.

Referring to when it is determined that the electronic device is located at a specific location based on the first step operation the electronic device may perform a second step operation. Before entering the second step the electronic device may predefine a method to be used in the second step by using a communication channel used in the first step. For example when the second step procedure is performed after the first step is performed through BLE the electronic device may enter the second step after exchanging a WLAN channel and media access control MAC information by using a BLE advertisement packet to explicitly perform a second step function.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure in operation the electronic device may transmit an advertisement packet for requesting the second step entry to the external electronic device . The entry request packet may include information used for a second step measurement procedure. For example a measurement method using WLAN MIMO may be written in the entry request packet. As a second step detection method the electronic device may write WLAN MIMO setting information in a packet and transmit it to the external electronic device and may transmit channel information for exchanging packets via WLAN and the WLAN MAC address of the electronic device to the external electronic device .

Upon the receipt of the second step entry request packet the external electronic device may supply power to a WLAN communication module and may process a channel for exchanging packets to be in a reception standby state. Once a preparation performance is completed in operation the external electronic device may transmit a second step entry response corresponding to the preparation completion to the electronic device by using BLE advertisement. The second step entry response message may include the WLAN MAC address of the electronic device . Accordingly the electronic device and the second electronic device may perform Unicast based mutual communication by using WLAN MIMO after entering the second step.

The electronic device receiving the second entry response packet may supply power to a WLAN communication module and may perform a second step measurement procedure after maintaining a reception standby state for exchanging packets.

Referring to in relation to a second step preparing method corresponding to a second step entry in operation the electronic device may transmit a BLE advertisement second step entry request from the external electronic device for example. Information for setting as WLAN MIMO a second step detecting method in correspondence to a specified setting information for exchanging packets via WLAN and the WLAN MAC address of the electronic device may be written in the transmitted BLE advertisement second step entry request packet. After transmitting the second step entry request packet the electronic device may supply power to a WLAN communication module and may maintain a channel for exchanging packets to be in a reception standby state.

The external electronic device receiving the second step entry request packet may supply power to a WLAN communication module and activate it and then transmits a second step entry response to a second step entry WLAN channel in response to a preparation completion in operation . According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the external electronic device may transmit a WLAN Probe Response as a second step entry response to the electronic device . The electronic device receiving the second step entry response may perform a second step measurement procedure.

Referring to a second step operation as a distance or direction recognition step may estimate an accurate location and direction for a target.

When an estimation algorithm is used the electronic device may relatively accurately estimate a physical distance in addition to a relative distance.

In order for a distance and angle measurement between two devices for example the electronic device and the external electronic device when they are not connected to each other for example Pre association the electronic device or the external electronic device may use message such as Probe Request and Probe Response. Alternatively the electronic device or the external electronic device may perform exchanging newly defined messages.

When attempting to measure a distance to the external electronic device the electronic device may transmit a specific message and may collect a time difference at which an acknowledgement Ack that is a feedback for a corresponding message is received from the external electronic device . The electronic device may estimate an actual distance that a radio wave radiates by calculating an actual time t t t t taken for radiating a radio wave with the collected times and multiplying it by a radio wave transmission speed 2.8 10 8 m sec . Since the calculated distance in such a manner may include various errors such as multi path according to a measured environment the electronic device may increase the accuracy by exchanging a plurality of signals and an average thereof. Additionally since the accuracy may be higher as an RF message exchange bandwidth is higher the electronic device may vary a repeated measurement frequency in correspondence to a band that two for example the electronic device or the external electronic device support. For example when the bandwidth of a wireless communication channel is broad the electronic device may reduce a repetition frequency for a time difference detection and when the bandwidth of a wireless communication channel is narrow may increase a repetition frequency in order to the accuracy.

According to various embodiments of the present disclosure the electronic device may estimate a distance between two devices by using ToF RSSI signal to noise ratio SNR and signal to noise plus interference ratio SINR of a received message. Alternatively the electronic device may improve the accuracy of detected information by using a combination of two or more variables ToF RSSI SNR and SINR .

Referring to upon the receipt of transmission signals by using WLAN MIMO the electronic device may receive a signal where a phase difference occurs in two or more antennas. The electronic device may estimate a direction of the other party device for example the external electronic device by analyzing a phase difference of two signals. For example the electronic device may perform a direction measurement by utilizing AoA.

According to various embodiments when a transmission electronic device for example the external electronic device configured with a plurality of antennas transmits the same signal to a reception device configured with one antenna a reception electronic device for example the external electronic device may detect a phase difference of signals transmitted from the plurality of antennas. For example the external electronic device may measure a direction of the electronic device by utilizing AoD.

For example the electronic device or the external electronic device may deliver a message transmitted received between devices in a RTT based distance measurement or t and t corresponding to an absolute time value at which a packet is transmitted by using a Vendor Specific Field. The electronic device or the external electronic device which receives this may analyze the received signal to calculate propagation delay and may estimate a distance between the two devices finally.

According to various embodiments of the present disclosure if the external device delivers Probe Response periodically by using the RSSI and phase difference of a signal each time the electronic device receives a corresponding packet for example an Action Frame of WLAN the electronic device entering the second step may measure a distance and a direction between the electronic device and the external electronic device and then may obtain an average value of repeatedly measured values to obtain a final value.

Referring to in relation to the location measuring method the electronic device may exchange and compare data mutually measured with the external electronic device in order to minimize measurement errors and improve the reliability of a measurement result.

For example in operation the electronic device may transmit a measurement request action frame to the external electronic device . The external electronic device receiving the action frame from the electronic device may measure a distance and a direction by using the received action frame in operation and may write a measured value in an action frame corresponding to a measurement response and then transmit it to the electronic device in operation . The electronic device receiving the action frame corresponding to a location measurement response from the external electronic device may perform a location measurement on the external electronic device as receiving a measurement response packet in operation . During this operation the electronic device may improve the reliability for a distance or a direction with respect to the external electronic device based on the measured value for the external electronic device and a distance and direction value for example a measured direction value is a value inversed in the opposite direction explicitly displayed in the location measurement response packet that the external electronic device transmits.

The electronic device and the external electronic device may perform a repeat operation such as operation to operation and operation N to operation N 3 and may determine an average value of the calculated values as a final value. The number of repetitions may be a specified value and may be adjusted according to a bandwidth size with respect to the external electronic device .

Correspondingly the external electronic device may obtain the location of the electronic device based on a location value that the electronic device provides.

Referring to when a reliable value is obtained for example a value measured more than n times is identical within an error range earlier than the predetermined number of repetitions while a location measurement is performed repeatedly the measurement may be terminated in advance.

For example in operation the electronic device may transmit an action frame for example a location measurement request to the external electronic device . The external electronic device may perform a location measurement in response to the request of the electronic device in operation . For example the external electronic device may perform a location measurement using a multi antenna based on the reception of the action frame for example a location measurement request that the electronic device transmits.

The electronic device may perform the above performed operation in operation repeatedly. The electronic device and the external electronic device may perform the above operation repeatedly during a specified number of times or until the reliability for location measurement satisfies a specified condition.

If a location measurement is repeated for a predetermined number of times or the reliability for location measurement satisfies the specified condition the electronic device may transmit to the external electronic device an action frame for example a location measurement request with stop message for requesting a location measurement request stop in operation N. For example the action frame for example a location measurement request with stop message may be a message for performing a location measurement until this message reception and stopping a location measurement procedure. The external electronic device may perform a location measurement based on the received action frame for example a location measurement request with stop message in operation N 1 and may write a measurement result in an action frame for example a location measurement response to transmit it to the electronic device in operation N 2.

For example the electronic device and the external electronic device may collect sound waves or ultrasonic waves generated from a specific location by using an array microphone and may identify a specified frequency pattern among the collected sounds. The electronic device or the external electronic device may determine the other party location and direction information by measuring an arrival time difference of signals corresponding to a specified frequency pattern and the intensity of a sound wave.

Referring to in order to the accuracy of direction and distance information with respect to a target the electronic device may use a connection device and may utilize an additional antenna for a bearer for example a communication module connected to the same hardware chipset in the electronic device. For example if a WLAN antenna is one or more and an additional antenna for Bluetooth exists in the same chip the electronic device may be prepared to share WLAN and BT antennas in a chip. When performing a location measurement the electronic device may utilize the plurality of shared antennas. The connection device may interoperate with the electronic device such as a wearable device or a tablet and may be another device of which location information is known to the electronic device . If the connection device is the wearable device the multi antenna of the electronic device and the multi antenna of the wearable device operate integrally thereby improving the accuracy of a distance or direction measurement with respect to the external electronic device . If the wearable device is used additionally a direction and a distance d between the wearable device and the electronic device may be measured by using the multi antenna of the electronic device and an antenna distance between the electronic device and the wearable device may be obtained by using the measured direction and distance d. The electronic device may improve the accuracy of an estimation on a distance or a direction from the electronic device to a target for example the external electronic device by using a signal phase shift for example a difference between a signal that the electronic device receives from the target for example the external the external electronic device and a signal that the wearable device receives inputted to the antenna of the electronic device and the additional antenna of the wearable device .

For example the electronic device may display a direction of the external electronic device for example a target by using a plurality of arrows in correspondence to an error range.

Additionally as shown in when a location value of the external electronic device is measured through the collaboration with the wearable device the electronic device may display a measurement value corresponding thereto on the display . For example the electronic device may display a direction of the external electronic device for example a target by using a single arrow having relatively no error range. Herein the electronic device may display at a lower end of the display that the direction is displayed through the collaboration with the wearable device .

Referring to a method of determining the directivity of a device for example the electronic device or the external electronic device may determine the location of the other party device by using a difference for example a phase difference in MIMO of obtained information. Such a determination method may correspond to a case that a point to be measured and a form are fixed. After checking in what form a measurement is performed currently the electronic device may process a correction on the current measurement form during a process for measuring an actual direction.

For example in a WLAN transmission reception environment using a multi antenna technique the electronic device or the external electronic device may receive signals by using a multi antenna or may receive signals transmitted from a multi antenna in order to determine the direction of a received signal. The electronic device or the external electronic device may perform a calculation for determining the direction of a transmission electronic device by calculating a phase difference of a received signal.

As shown in the and the when the number of Senders is q and the number of antennas of a receiving device is p signals that the electronic device or the external electronic device receives are as follows. Equation 1

Additionally a distance difference between a transmission device and a reception electronic device is represented in a phase difference as shown in the following Equation 3.

During the above calculation process information on the antenna position of a device that receives signals may be used. The antenna position information may be used with a fixed value.

Although a phase difference used for a location measurement is described with reference to under the assumption that antenna location information is fixed the direction of at least one of the electronic device or the external electronic device may be changed. Correspondingly it is necessary to apply the current state for example direction information of the electronic device .

The electronic device may determine which direction it faces currently at what speed it moves or whether it lies or stands by utilizing a sensor for example an acceleration sensor a gyro sensor a barometer a proximity sensor an illumination sensor a gesture sensor and so on . For example if the electronic device lies horizontal to the horizon and lies in a state that the direction of an upper end points to the north direction the electronic device may measure how the upper end of the electronic device rotates to north south east or west or left or right based on a horizontal plane by using an earth magnetic sensor. For example the electronic device may obtain a sensing value corresponding to a left predetermined angle rotation state a right predetermined angle rotation state the front 90 rotation and left or right direction 90 rotation state . The electronic device may apply the obtained angle value to a phase difference calculation operation of the other party device.

For example the electronic device may display the display in a vertical direction by using the direction of the external electronic device as the north direction as shown in a state . The electronic device may display the direction of the external electronic device in the upper right direction in a state . The electronic device may display the direction of the external electronic device in the upper left direction in a state . For example the electronic device may display a form indicating that the direction of the external electronic device is in the north on the display in a horizontal direction.

Referring to the electronic device may measure the location of the external electronic device based on the above described methods as shown in and may display this on the display . For example if it is measured that the external electronic device is disposed in the north direction the electronic device may output direction information corresponding thereto through an arrow as shown in .

According to various embodiments of the present disclosure the external electronic device may change its location. For example the external electronic device may move in the right direction by a predetermined distance as shown in a state . The electronic device may perform a location measurement on the external electronic device in a predetermined period or in real time and when the location of the external electronic device is changed may re perform a location measurement corresponding thereto. The electronic device may display the changed location information of the external electronic device on the display . During this operation the electronic device may obtain information on its current state through sensor information and may display direction information in consideration of its direction state and a direction with respect to the external electronic device .

Referring to in relation to the phase difference location determining method in operation upon the receipt of signals the electronic device may measure the RSSI of an individual antenna. In relation to this the electronic device may include a multi antenna and may receive a signal of a specified pattern transmitted from the multi antenna. In operation the electronic device may perform a signal phase detection of an individual antenna. In operation the electronic device may perform a signal phase difference calculation and detection.

In operation the electronic device may perform a posture determination of an electronic device by using a sensor. For example the electronic device may check a changed sensor value based on a specified sensor value of sensors for a specific state to determine the current state. In operation the electronic device may perform a signal phase difference calculation result correction. For example the electronic device may partially correct a direction according to the calculated phase difference calculation based on the current direction information. In operation the electronic device may perform a location and direction estimation. During this operation the electronic device may display an estimated location and direction value.

Referring to in relation to the low power location determining method the electronic device may perform a calculation and trace by using a low power processor such as the sensor hub in a direction and distance determination operation with a target for example the external electronic device . For example the electronic device may perform basic calculation and monitoring through the sensor hub and if there is a user s request or there is a meaningful change in a monitored value or a specific event occurs may activate an AP to perform an additional calculation and control. For example the sensor hub only monitors the proximity with respect to a target for example the external electronic device and if the target is located within a specific distance an AP may be activated to obtain more accurate distance or direction information.

In relation to the distance or direction determining method using a low power processor a multi processor with a big little core may be used instead of the sensor hub . For example if it is not necessary to use a high performance core the electronic device using a multi core may perform a monitoring on a distance or direction determination in a low power core and may process information by activating a high performance core if necessary. For example a period for searching for the location of a device may be adjusted according to a state that the electronic device moves by using an acceleration sensor.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the electronic device may perform a mobility measurement in operation . In operation the electronic device may check whether it moves based on the measured value. If it moves in operation the electronic device may increase the other party location detection period. If it does not move in operation the electronic device may reduce the other party location detection period.

Based on the above mentioned operation manner since it is possible that a distance and an angle between devices for example the external electronic device to be measured are changed the electronic device may increase the measurement frequency to improve the accuracy. Additionally in the case of a fixed environment the electronic device may lower the frequency relatively to save a resource such as current consumption.
