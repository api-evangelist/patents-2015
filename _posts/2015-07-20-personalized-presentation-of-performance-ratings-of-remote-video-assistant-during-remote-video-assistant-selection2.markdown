In general embodiments of the invention relate to remote video assistant assistance and more particularly systems method and computer program products for providing a user a personalized presentation of user specific performance ratings for remote video assistants based on the user s previous experiences with the remote video assistants.

The use of remote video assistants is becoming prevalent in the financial institution banking world as well as other customer service environments such as health care retail utilities communications and the like. Remote video assistants are accessible through dedicated Automated Teller Assist ATA machines devices which may be located within a business such as a financial institution banking center or may be located at any other convenient location. Additionally remote video assistants may be accessible via a user s customer s device such as a personal computer laptop computer touch pad device mobile communication device such as a smart phone or the like.

In conventional remote video assistant applications a user identifies their need such as financial institution banking needs e.g. mortgage loan personal banking or the like and is randomly provided a video assistant that specializes in the customer s financial institution banking needs. This is in contrast to the live financial institution banking center experience in which the customer can become familiar and comfortable with interacting with one or more of the banking center associates at the customer s frequently visited banking center. However the random assignment of video assistants does not create a personalized experience for the customer nor does it insure that the customer is familiar with or has good rapport with the video assistant.

Moreover in systems that do provide a user or customer the ability to choose a representative or agent to interact or transact with insight into the representative or agents performance such as a rating score or the like is typically limited to an overall average rating of all the interactions transactions conducted by that particular representative or agent. In other words the overall average rating is reflective of how all the other users that have used the agent or representative score or rate that agent representative and does not reflect only the customer user performance rating s provided by the customer user currently selecting the representative agent i.e. based on previous transactions interactions that the user customer has had with the specific agent representative .

Therefore a need exists to develop systems apparatus computer program products methods and the like that provide users with a personalized means for selecting video assistants prior to conducting a remote video assistant session. The desired systems and methodology should allow for the user to select from video assistants that the user is familiar with i.e. a video assistant that the user has interacted with in the past . Moreover the desired systems and methodologies should provide for presenting user specific performance ratings for each video assistants that the user is selecting from such that the user may make informed decisions as which remote video assistant they desire to currently select for a present transaction and or interaction.

The remote video assistant module additionally includes instructions for generating and displaying User Interface UI that access to a media plugin that is configured to execute a media client i.e. video conferencing platform within the user interface to allow for the video session to appear on the display of the video assistant s device. As previously discussed specific to the present invention the implementation of the intermediary middleware framework allows for the media client application executing on the third computing platform to be disparate from the media client application executing on the first computing platform . Such use of different media clients on the user platform and the video assistant platform is made possible by the second computing platform creating a virtual conference room in which the second computing platform i.e. the middleware framework generates and distributes the same Room Key to both the first user computing platform and the third video assistant computing platform . Thus the media plugin associated with the first computing platform and the media plugin associated with the third computing platform will present communicate the a virtual room ID i.e. room key to the media server to initiate the video session between the user and selected video assistant.

Referring to a block diagram is presented of a system highlighting a methodology for selecting a video assistance which a user has previously interacted with along with optional presentation of performance rating and availability information in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The methodology begins by user selecting e.g. clicking on or the like a designated icon or another indicator for video assistance displayed within the User Interface UI of the remote video session module . The remote video session module may be executed on a dedicated device such as an Automated Teller Assist ATA device or a user possessed device such as PC laptop computer mobile device including a smart phone or the like. Prior to the user selecting the video assistance option or after the user has selected the video assistance option the user is required to enter log in requisite credentials e.g. username and or password to identify the user and in some embodiments identify the user as an authorized registered video assistance user. Once the user has requested video assistance the User Interface UI of the remote video module sends assistant request along with a user identifier as determined from the log in procedure to the first session broker adaptor . In turn the first session broker adaptor encapsulates the assistance request into a session request message using a predetermined industry standard protocol such as XMPP HTTP HTTPS JSON or the like.

The session request message is subsequently communicated via a communications network to the meeting broker of the video session broker . As previously noted the first session broker adapter has a persistent bind connection with the connection manager of the video session broker . All messages received from the remote video session module and the remote video assistant module are hosted on a messaging server such as an XMPP server or the like. Upon receipt of the session request message the meeting broker queries the database based on the user identifier for the customer s recent video session history. The database stores user s recent video session history including a video assistant identifier. The video assistant identifier may be the name of the video assistant or the identifier may include an image photo of the video assistant. Additionally the video assistant identifier may include a video clip of the video assistant such as a pre recorded video greeting or a snippet of the last video session between the user and the video assistant. Upon querying the database the meeting broker retrieves the video assistant identifier s associated with the recent video sessions.

In specific embodiments of the invention the database also includes at least one user specific performance rating associated with one or more of the video assistants that the user has recently conducted a video session with. As previously noted the performance rating may be a session specific performance rating which was provided by the user at or near the conclusion of the recent video session and or the performance rating may be an average of a plurality of such as all the video sessions conducted between the user and that particular video assistant. In such embodiments of the invention the meeting broker may retrieve both the video assistant identifiers and the performance ratings associated with the video assistants.

In other specific embodiments of the invention the meeting broker in conjunction with the messaging server will determine availability information for the video assistants that the user previously conducted video interactions with. The messaging server may track video assistant availability based on video assistant identifier and record in the database or the like the average length of a call session for a video assistant. The meeting broker may also determine a current wait for a video assistant based on average length of a call for the video assistant the length of the video assistant s current call and the quantity of assistant requests currently queued for that particular video assistant.

Once the meeting broker has retrieved the applicable video assistant data from database the meeting broker encapsulates the data e.g. video assistant identifiers including images videos and the like performance ratings and availability information into a video assistant response message using the predetermined chosen protocol e.g. XMPP or the like and communicates the message via the connection manager to the first session broker adapter of the remote video session module .

In response to the first session broker adapter receiving the response message a video assistant selector widget is launched within the UI and the video assistant identifiers are displayed within the widget . In specific embodiments of the invention such display of the video assistant identifiers will include display of the image of the video assistant and or access to or execution of the video clip associated with the video assistant. In other embodiments of the invention the video assistant identifiers such as images and or video clips may be displayed in conjunction with the user specific performance ratings or the video assistant specific availability information. For example an image of a video assistant may be displayed and the associated user specific performance rating and or the availability information e.g. currently unavailable currently available currently available with a specified wait time . In those embodiments in which a wait time is time is displayed the wait time may be dynamically displayed in the form of a running clock that counts down the approximate wait time for video assistant based on the average length of calls for the video assistant the current length of the call that the video assistant is currently conducting and the quantity of calls session that the video assistant currently has in their queue.

Once the video assistant identifiers and other information has been displayed the user may select a video assistant from the displayed previously used video assistant or the user may select to conduct the session with a new video assistant i.e. a random video assistant that the user has not interacted with in the recent past . It should also be noticed that once the video assistant identifiers are displayed in the widget a user may provide filters to the video assistants e.g. based on call session type or the like to insure that the video assistant selected meets the needs of the currently requested call session. In other embodiments of the invention the filets may be applied by the user at the time of the request such that the video session broker only returns video assistants that the user previously interacted with and that meet the filter criteria imposed by the user.

Once a video assistant has been selected the media plugin client is loaded within the UI and the first session broker adapter receives the video assistant selection and encapsulates a video assistant identifier and a user identifier into a video assistant selection message which is subsequently communicated to the video session broker . In turn the meeting broker of the video session broker generated a room key which is encapsulated and communicated to the remote video session module and the remote video assistant module of the selected video assistant. Based on the remote video session module providing the room key to the media plugin client the media client will call the media server and present the room key. In turn the media server will call the remote video assistant module to notify the video assistant of the pending video session. Once the remote video assistant module is in receipt of the message containing the room key the remote video assistant module loads the media plugin client and communicates the room key to the media server to connect the user to the video assistant via a live video audio session.

Referring to a flow diagram is presented of a method for providing personalized user selection of remote video assistants based on the user s video call history including dynamic video assistant availability information in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. At Event a video assistant session request is received from a user as a means of initiating a video session between the user the video assistant. The video assistant request is received within a UI executing on a user device platform. As previously noted the user device platform may be a dedicated device configured for conducting video sessions such as an Automated Teller Assist ATA device deployed by financial institutions or the like or the device may be a user possessed device such as a PC laptop mobile computing device such as a table smart phone or the like. Prior to receiving the video assistant request or in response to receiving the video assistant request the user s credentials i.e. username and or password may be received as a means of identifying the user and or verifying that the user is authorized registered to use the video assistance system.

Subsequently at Event the message is communicated as a chat message a Publish Subscribe message or the like to a connection manage of a video session broker that has a persistent binding connection with the first session broker adaptor.

At Event in response to the meeting broker receiving the video assistant request message a database is queried based on the user identifier for the user s recent video session history. The recent history may be preconfigured as a prescribed number of previous video session or the video sessions conducted over a predetermined prior time period. At Event one or more video assistant identifiers associated with each video assistant that conducted a previous video session with the user is retrieved from the database along with the average session time for video assistant s that conducted the recent video sessions with the user. The video assistant identifiers may include the name of the video assistant and any other relevant profile data e.g. specific areas of expertise or the like . In specific embodiments the video assistant identifiers may include an image of the video assistant and or a video clip of the video assistant. The video clip may be a prerecorded greeting by the video assistant or a snippet of a previous video session conducted between the user and the video assistant.

At Event current availability information is determined for each of the video assistants that conducted video sessions included within the user s recent video session history. Current availability information may be determined as currently available with no minimal wait time not currently available or currently available with a wait time. In such embodiments of the invention logic may be employed to dynamically determine a current i.e. constantly updating wait time based on the video assistants average time for a call session throughout the system the length of time of the video assistant s current ongoing call session and the quantity of calls outstanding that the video assistant has in their queue.

At Event the meeting broker encapsulates the video assistant identifier s and the availability information into a video assistant response message using the predetermined protocol of choice e.g. XMPP HTTP HTTPS JSON or the like and at Event the response message is communicated back to the first session broker adaptor of the remote video session module executing on the user device.

At Optional Event a user selection of a video assistant is received within the video assistant selection widget and at Optional Event in response to receiving the user selection of the video assistant a media plugin client is loaded on the user device that is configured to provide a video session between the user and the selected video assistant. Additionally a video assistant identifier associated with the selected video assistant and the user identifier are encapsulated into a video assistant selection message using the predetermined protocol. At Event the video assistant selection message is communicated to video session broker which in turn is configured to initiate a video session with the selected remote video assistant by generating and communicating a common room key to the user device platform and the video assistant s device platform. The common room key is presented by corresponding media clients to a designated media server to initiate the video audio connection between the user s device platform and the video assistant device platform.

Referring to a high level schematic diagram of a system for delivering video assistance through implementation of an Over The Top OTT application i.e. video session broker in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The video session broker provides separation between the multimedia application platforms i.e. remote video session module executing on a user client platform and remote video assistant module executing on a video assistant agent platform and the resource allocation infrastructure services . The separation eliminates the need for tight integration between the multimedia client vendor and the underlying resource allocation infrastructure. The separation allows for the system to be multimedia client vendor agnostic meaning that video assistance can be established between the user and the video assistant regardless of the type video client employed by the user or the video assistant. In this regard the video session broker mitigates between different media client applications and backend infrastructure services such as video session host application services and resource management services e.g. assistant selection queueing routing and the like by acting as a session breakage to streamline the call workflow.

Specifically the multimedia client vendor agnostic approach and the ability to include diverse infrastructure services that may employ different protocols is made possible by the video session broker employing an industry standard protocol such as XMPP or the like that encapsulates different protocols messages with a common messaging protocol. Such a light client server messaging transport provides a layer that hovers i.e. over the to over the resource allocation infrastructure services and coordinates the audio video session call requests from and video assistant host application or widget. In response to the video session broker receiving a request to initiate a multimedia session the video session broker will broker the request in a trigger action mode in which the video session initiation parameters hand off occurs at the user platform.

Additionally functionality provided by the video session broker includes the ability to maintain a presence of all active user and video assistant endpoints through implementation of a connection manager not shown in that maintains a persistent connection with session broker adaptors not shown in included in the remote video session module and the remote video assistant module . Moreover the video session broker provides the ability to hide call setup and media exchange complexity from the underlying resources allocation infrastructure services . Additionally the video session broker employs a Representational State Transfer REST software architecture Applications Program Interface API for applications key authentication user data transfer virtual rooms statistics and the like.

Additionally the video session broker provides for use of virtual video rooms which is a logical meeting room that participants users and video assistants can join based on presentation of a unique room key generated by the video session broker . In this regard the calling party application is not required to call directly to the video assistant. The video session broker generates a unique room key e.g. virtual room key and communicates the room key to both the user remote video session module and the video assistant remote video assistant module . The remote video session module and the remote video assistant module present the key to establish join the same virtual video room virtual room hosted by media server . It should be noted that the room key can be presented by any number of participants and as such more than one user and or more than one remote video assistant may join the video session. The virtual room is hosted by any vendor using a Multipoint Conferencing unit MCU video bridge or the like.

Referring to shown is a schematic diagram of a system for delivering multimedia assistance specifically the session broker framework architecture highlighting the call flow for establishing a multimedia session in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The video session broker coordinates video session requests between the remote video session module and the remote video assistance module and send requests on behalf of those modules and to backend resource management services . Asynchronous event driven client server messaging occurs between the video session broker and the modules and as well between the video session broker and the backend infrastructure services . For example remote video session module or the remote video assistance module may send a request for a resource which triggers through the video session broker a set of backend operations to assign the appropriate requested resource.

The process of initiating a multimedia call session may begin by a user logging in to a host application which may be included in the remote video session module or may be a separate application module. In specific embodiments the host application may be a self service application such as a standalone Automated Teller Assist ATA and Automated teller Machine ATM with assist capabilities a web based application a mobile based application or the like. As the system illustrates the log in process may require the host application to directly communicate with the backend resource infrastructure services specifically video session host application services or the like.

The remote video session module includes a session broker adaptor client that includes a messaging client such as XMPP client or the like. The session broker adaptor connects to the video session broker anonymously or with a pre assigned user ID based on specific remote video session module configuration. The call request is encapsulated in the messaging format of the messaging client and communicated to the video session broker that implements the meeting broker coordinator which is configured as a trigger action API. The meeting broker coordinator passes the call request to a backend resource management service implementing a request respond resource availability API .

Once the resource management service responds to the session broker the session broker will encapsulate a constructed Uniform Resource Identifier URI and a generated room key in the messaging format and communicated the encapsulated message to the session broker adaptor of the remote video session module and the session broker adaptor of the remote video assistance module . In turn the session broker adaptors and pass the URI and the room key to the media clients and . The media clients and initiate the multimedia session by joining a designated virtual room associated with the room key which is hosted by media server .

Referring to schematic diagram of system a high level video session broker framework architecture highlighting session broker interaction with infrastructure services in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The user may interface with the multimedia assistance service via a resident remote video session module that may reside on a user device such as a PC laptop tablet mobile device or the like or may reside on a dedicated device such as an ATM with assist ATA or the like. Additionally the user may interface with the multimedia assistance service via a web based remote video session module that can be accessed via a web browser application on a user device such as a PC laptop mobile device or the like or may reside on a dedicated device such as an ATM with assist ATA or the like. The resident remote video session module A may include a host application such as a banking application or the like. While in other embodiments of the invention the host application may be distinct from the remote video session module A. The host application may include an authentication routine configured to verify the identity of user . The authentication provided by authentication routine may include serve to authenticate the user for use of the multimedia assistance system or. In other embodiments of the invention a separate authentication routine may reside in the remote video session module . As previously discussed remote video session module also includes a session broker adaptor including a messaging client such as a XMPP client that is configured to connect with the video session broker via HTTPS WebSocket API or the like.

Video session broker includes WebServer API which may be a scalable Representational State Transfer RESTful software architecture API or the like. The API may include authentication client meeting actions client meeting controls client meeting statistics client federation interoperability client and interoperability transmission receipt client .

The authentication client may be in communication with authentication hub included in the backend infrastructure services . The authentication client and authentication hub communicate via asynchronous event driven client server messaging implemented in the session broker such as messaging extension plugins and messaging server which may comprise XMPP extensions plugins and XMPP server or the like. The authentication provided by authentication client and authentication hub may be integrated with authentication routine of the host application or may be in addition to the authentication routine of the host application .

The meeting actions client is configured to initiate the setup of a connection between a user and a video assistant agent and communicates via asynchronous event driven client server messaging with backend infrastructure resources such as contact center signaling gateway media server vendor choice MCU and the like. The meeting controls client is configured to provide control over the video session such as controlling commands affecting the multimedia session such as muting the audio moving the session from audio only to audio video or audio video to audio only and the like. Similar to the meeting actions client meeting controls client communicates via asynchronous event driven client server messaging with backend infrastructure resources such as contact center signaling gateway media server vendor choice MCU and the like.

Meeting statistics client is configured to capture statistics associated with an ongoing multimedia assistance session such as bandwidth actions taken e.g. mute changes in audio video form collection of data and the like. Meeting statistics client is in communication with backend infrastructure services such as monitoring rules traps which serve to provide alerts alarms and the like based on the results of the monitoring statistics.

Federation operability client and Interoperability TX RX are optional clients that are configured to allow two separate domains to communicate with one another during a multimedia assistance session and may communicate with backend resource infrastructure services such as signaling gateway contact center and the like.

Thus systems apparatus methods and computer program products described above provide for capturing and presenting in conjunction with video assistant selection personalized user specific performance ratings for video assistants that the user has transacted interacted with in the past. Once a user logs in or otherwise presents identifying credentials the system or methodology accesses the user s recent remote video assistant session data i.e. which video assistants the user previously transacted with and at least one corresponding user specific performance rating and presents a listing of the video assistants which the user previously interacted with along with at least one user specific performance rating for each remote video assistant. By providing for display of the user specific performance rating along with the video assistant identifier the user is aware of not only which video assistants they conducted transactions interactions with in the past but also how the remote video assistant performed for the user during the previous transactions interactions.
