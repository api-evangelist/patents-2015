Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems and networks that more particularly provide and control embeddable gaming content.

Wagering game machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Traditionally wagering game machines have been confined to physical buildings like casinos e.g. resort casinos road side casinos etc. . The casinos are located in specific geographic locations that are authorized to present wagering games to casino patrons. However with the proliferation of interest and use of the Internet shrewd wagering game manufacturers have recognized that a global public network such as the Internet can reach to various locations of the world that have been authorized to present wagering games. Any individual with a personal computing device e.g. a personal computer a laptop a personal digital assistant a cell phone etc. can connect to the Internet and play wagering games. Consequently some wagering game manufacturers have created wagering games that can be processed by personal computing devices and offered via online casino websites online casinos . However online casinos face challenges and struggles. For instance online casinos have struggled to provide the excitement and entertainment that a real world casino environment provides. Some online casinos have struggled enforcing cross jurisdictional restrictions and requirements. Further some online casinos have struggled adapting the online gaming industry to a traditionally non wagering game business environment. As a result wagering game manufacturers casino operators and online game providers are constantly in need of innovative concepts that can make the online gaming industry appealing and profitable.

This description of the embodiments is divided into six sections. The first section provides an introduction to embodiments. The second section describes example operating environments while the third section describes example operations performed by some embodiments. The fourth section describes additional example embodiments while the fifth section describes additional example operating environments. The sixth section presents some general comments.

A widget is a stand alone dynamic application that provides a first content that can be included in or embedded into second content provided by a host. The widget s content may be referred to as widget content and the host s content into which the widget content is embedded may be referred to as host content. Widgets can be created by a first entity that provides or generates the widget content. The first entity may be a business entity that specializes in the widget content. The first entity may also provide the widget or may distribute the widget to other entities to distribute. The host may be a computer system that belongs to a separate entity from the first entity such as a business entity that runs a website. The host content therefore may include a website that is served or hosted by a computer with a web server web server . The host e.g. the web server can provide a web document e.g. a web page a blog a social media site profile etc. associated with the website. A user that has rights of authorship for the web document can embed the widget into the web document. Widgets embedded into web documents are sometimes referred to as web widgets. A web user or a user that visits the host website can request the web document using a web browser application browser . When the web document loads into the browser the browser displays webpage content that includes the widget. The webpage content can include other host content in addition to the widget. The widget therefore provides a portion of host content for the webpage so that the host e.g. the web server or the entity that owns the host e.g. the webpage provider does not have to generate or maintain the widget content. The host may also be a personal or local non server computer system or an operating system for a computer system. For example a computer can present a widget embedded into the computer s desktop or into another application stored locally on the computer. Widgets embedded on personal or local computer systems are sometimes referred to as desktop widgets.

The host does not typically control the widget content. The widget content and or the functionality the widget provides cannot typically be modified by the host. Thus the host can either present the widget content or not use the widget. The host does however control the placement of the widget. However a user who has rights to the host can remove the widget from the host content such as from a webpage or a computer desktop. Further widget content can be processed as server side content or content that is processed by a server that belongs to the widget s provider. Thus widgets can reduce the need to store some content on host computers and or reduce performance issues for host systems and networks. Widgets therefore can be very useful cost effective resource efficient and easily maintainable applications for host entities.

The gaming server associates or links the first player account and the second player account and tracks wagering game statistics e.g. activity history achievements etc. and non wagering game statistics for both the first player account and the second player account . The gaming server stores wagering game statistics of one or more wagering games that the wagering game machine s present during one or more wagering game sessions in the casino network for the first player account . The gaming server also tracks and stores non wagering game statistics of one or more non wagering games that the first gaming widget presents during one or more non wagering game sessions outside the casino network for the second player account . The gaming server however can link store data mine analyze or otherwise use or associate the wagering game statistics and non wagering game statistics. For example the gaming server stores non wagering game history and wagering game history in or in association with the second player account e.g. stored in a database record associated with the second player account stored in separate but related or linked database records associated with the second player account and the first player account etc. . For example the first player account and the second player account may be controlled or owned by the same player or entity. In some embodiments the first player account can be controlled by linked with owned by etc. a casino a game provider a third party etc. The player selects or is assigned a first user name i.e. M. Miller for the first player account . The player also selects or is assigned a second user name i.e. Poker Ace 1 for the second player account . The gaming server associates the two accounts together and therefore associates the two user names and stores the association for example in the second player account .

In some embodiments the gaming server can also provide a second gaming widget to the wagering game server to present via a graphical user interface for the wagering game machine s . The graphical user interface also presents wagering game content such as slot reels a credit meter a bet meter and a spin control . The second gaming widget when presented in the graphical user interface can present second content in addition to or instead of the first content . The second content may be wagering game content such as secondary wagering games or non wagering game content such as casual games that do not require wagering.

The first gaming widget or the second gaming widget can receive login information for the second player account at different times and provide a game session e.g. either a wagering game session or non wagering game session for the second player account via the first gaming widget or the second gaming widget . The gaming server provides the first content for the first gaming widget and the second content for the second gaming widget . Therefore the wagering game server or the web server can utilize the first gaming widget or the second gaming widget without having to host the first content or the second content .

Further some embodiments of the inventive subject matter describe examples of providing and controlling embeddable gaming content in a network wagering venue e.g. an online casino a wagering game website a wagering network etc. using a communication network such as the communications network in . Embodiments can be presented over any type of communications network that provides access to wagering games such as a public network e.g. a public wide area network such as the Internet a private network e.g. a private local area network gaming network a file sharing network a social network etc. or any combination of networks. Multiple users can be connected to the networks via computing devices. The multiple users can have accounts that subscribe to specific services such as account based wagering systems e.g. account based wagering game websites account based casino networks etc. .

Further in some embodiments herein a user may be referred to as a player i.e. of wagering games and a player may be referred to interchangeably as a player account. Account based wagering systems utilize player accounts when transacting and performing activities at the computer level that are initiated by players. Therefore a player account represents the player at a computerized level. The player account can perform actions via computerized instructions. For example in some embodiments a player account may be referred to as performing an action controlling an item communicating information etc. Although a player or person may be activating a game control or device to perform the action control the item communicate the information etc. the player account at the computer level can be associated with the player and therefore any actions associated with the player can also be associated with the player account. Therefore for brevity to avoid having to describe the interconnection between player and player account in every instance a player account may be referred to herein in either context. Further in some embodiments herein the word gaming is used interchangeably with gambling. 

Although describes some embodiments the following sections describe many other features and embodiments.

This section describes example operating environments and networks and presents structural aspects of some embodiments. More specifically this section includes discussion about wagering game system architectures.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a gaming server configured to control wagering game content provide random numbers and communicate wagering game information account information and other information to and from a client . The gaming server can include a content controller configured to manage and control content for the presentation of content on the client . For example the content controller can generate game results e.g. win loss values including win amounts for games played on the client . The content controller can communicate the game results to the client . The content controller can also generate random numbers and provide them to the client so that the client can generate game results. The gaming server can also include a content store configured to contain content to present on the client such as via a gaming widget embedded on the client via a web browser etc. The gaming server can also include an account services manager configured to control information related to player accounts link player accounts use information from separate player accounts etc. For example the account services manager can communicate wager amounts game results amounts e.g. win amounts bonus game amounts etc. to the account server . In some embodiments the account services manager can communicate game progress in a non wagering game. In some embodiments the accounts services manager can also communicate wagering game information and non wagering game information to a marketing server to generate promotions advertisements rewards etc. associated with gaming and non gaming content. The gaming server can also include a communication unit configured to communicate information to the client and to communicate with other systems devices and networks. The gaming server can also include a gaming services module configured to provide track store use or control gaming content and non gaming content in a gaming widget. The gaming server can also include a data services module configured to provide data storage data mining data reporting and other data related services. The gaming server can also include a secondary content module configured to provide content and control information for secondary games and other secondary content e.g. secondary wagering game content promotions content advertising content player tracking content web content etc. . The secondary content module can provide secondary content or content for secondary games presented on the client . Secondary in some embodiments can refer to an application s importance or priority of the data. In some embodiments secondary can refer to a distinction or separation from a primary application e.g. separate application files separate content separate states separate functions separate processes separate programming sources separate processor threads separate data separate control separate domains etc. . Nevertheless in some embodiments secondary content and control can be passed between applications e.g. via application protocol interfaces thus becoming or falling under the control of primary content or primary applications and vice versa.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a web server configured to control and present an online website that hosts wagering games and other content. The web server can also be configured to present multiple wagering game applications on the wagering game machine via a wagering game website or other gaming type venue accessible via the Internet. The web server can host an online wagering website and or a social networking website. The web server can include other devices servers mechanisms etc. that provide functionality e.g. controls web pages applications etc. that web users can use to connect to a social networking application and or website and utilize social networking and website features e.g. communications mechanisms applications etc. . The web server can also be configured to present web documents e.g. web pages with embedded gaming widgets.

The wagering game system architecture can also include the client configured to present wagering games and receive and transmit information to provide and control embeddable gaming content. The client can be a computer system a personal digital assistant PDA a cell phone a laptop a wagering game machine or any other device or machine that is capable of processing information instructions or other data provided via the communications network . The client can include a content controller configured to manage and control content and presentation of content on the client . The client can also include a content store configured to contain content to present on the client . The client can also include a gaming module configured to present and control a gaming widget and provide other gaming services provided by the gaming server .

Each component shown in the wagering game system architecture is shown as a separate and distinct element connected via a communications network . However some functions performed by one component could be performed by other components. For example the gaming server can also be configured to perform functions of the client and other network elements and or system devices. Furthermore the components shown may all be contained in one device but some or all may be included in or performed by multiple devices as in the configurations shown in or other configurations not shown. For example the account services manager and the communication unit can be included in the client instead of or in addition to being a part of the gaming server . Further in some embodiments the client can determine wagering game outcomes generate random numbers etc. instead of or in addition to the gaming server .

As mentioned previously in some embodiments the client can take the form of a wagering game machine. Examples of wagering game machines can include floor standing models handheld mobile units bar top models workstation type console models surface computing machines etc. Further wagering game machines can be primarily dedicated for use in conducting wagering games or can include non dedicated devices such as mobile phones personal digital assistants personal computers etc.

In some embodiments clients and wagering game servers work together such that clients can be operated as thin thick or intermediate clients. For example one or more elements of game play may be controlled by the client or the wagering game servers server . Game play elements can include executable game code lookup tables configuration files game outcome audio or visual representations of the game game assets or the like. In a thin client example the wagering game server can perform functions such as determining game outcome or managing assets while the clients can present a graphical representation of such outcome or asset modification to the user e.g. player . In a thick client example the clients can determine game outcomes and communicate the outcomes to the wagering game server for recording or managing a player s account.

In some embodiments either the client or the wagering game server s can provide functionality that is not directly related to game play. For example account transactions and account rules may be managed centrally e.g. by the wagering game server s or locally e.g. by the client . Other functionality not directly related to game play may include power management presentation of advertising software or firmware updates system quality or security checks etc.

Furthermore the wagering game system architecture can be implemented as software hardware any combination thereof or other forms of embodiments not listed. For example any of the network components e.g. the wagering game machines servers etc. can include hardware and machine readable storage media including instructions for performing the operations described herein.

This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below some flow diagrams are described with reference to block diagrams presented herein. However in some embodiments the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.

In certain embodiments the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine readable storage media e.g. software while in other embodiments the operations can be performed by hardware and or other logic e.g. firmware . In some embodiments the operations can be performed in series while in other embodiments one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Moreover some embodiments can perform more or less than all the operations shown in any flow diagram.

In the flow begins at processing block where a wagering game system system detects a request to login a player account via a gaming widget and logs in the player account where the gaming widget is included in host content. For instance similar to the gaming web widget can be installed embedded inserted etc. into a host webpage as a web widget or into a host wagering game machine as a desktop widget. In some embodiments the wagering game machine may utilize web browsers to present content. Thus the gaming widget may be embedded as a web widget in a wagering game machine s browser. The host can present the gaming widget but the gaming widget runs on a service connected to a gaming server that is external to and separate from the host network e.g. an online gaming server that provides the service via the Internet . The gaming server can serve all game content through the gaming widget. In some embodiments the gaming widget can be downloaded and installed using a plug in. In other embodiments the gaming widget can be embedded using code chunks in a webpage. The gaming widget however looks and acts like a traditional application but it is embedded in the host content and therefore functions separately from the host content as described previously. The gaming widget can be implemented using web technologies including JavaScript Flash HTML and CSS. The gaming widgets can use web application programming interfaces APIs that can be exposed by the browser by a widget engine etc. As described previously the gaming widget can be embedded in a web document such as a webpage document. A webpage document can include web document code such as hypertext markup language HTML extensible markup language XML C PHP JavaScript AJAX etc. The webpage document can be an HTML document e.g. have an .HTML or .HTM file extension an Active Server Page or Microsoft ASP.NET document e.g. a webpage document with an .ASP file extension an open source document e.g. a webpage document with a .PHP file extension etc.

In some embodiments the system can detect via user access from a casino webpage a request to login to a gaming service via a gaming web widget embedded in the casino webpage. The system can receive user login information entered into the gaming web widget after the gaming web widget loads and login a player account for gaming web widget content. The system can be connected to a host web server e.g. a casino s web server in on a casino network that provides one or more webpages in response to a user request to load the one or more webpages in a browser. The one or more webpages includes a first login control and a gaming web widget with a second login control. The system receives the first login information from the first login control for a first player account. The first player account is stored on a casino account server associated with the casino network. In other words the casino account server stores information and controls a player account that a player can utilize to play wagering games to track financial information to track and redeem player loyalty points for the casino etc. The system can login the first player account to the casino account server and can receive first player account information for the first player account from the casino account server. The system can also receive second login information from the second login control for a second player account. The second player account is stored on an online account server associated with an online wagering game service. The system can also provide the second login information to the online account server via the gaming widget to login the second player account. The system can receive second player account information for the second player account from the second account server select content based on the first player account information and the second player account information and provide the content in the webpage. For instance the system can present non wagering game content in the gaming widget for the second player account based on a degree or amount of play in a wagering game stored in or referenced by the first player account. illustrate an example. In a wagering game system system includes a computer connected to a casino server a gaming server and an online player account server via a communications network . The computer presents a browser that can access a webpage provided by the casino server . Embedded in the webpage is a gaming widget . The gaming widget can include a content display and a content navigation console . The webpage can include webpage content such as a graphic that indicates a wagering game theme associated with the webpage . The webpage also includes as its content the gaming widget which provides widget content in the content display and in the content navigation console . The gaming widget can access a multi media game content service game content service provided by the gaming server . The gaming widget provides content for multiple game themes. For instance a player may have played a specific wagering game at a casino prior to accessing the webpage from the computer . The webpage is related to a specific wagering game theme such as a themed game e.g. Lord of the Rings thematic slot game that the player may have played previously in a casino or online. By playing the themed wagering game in a casino or via online venues the system tracks the playing activity in the themed wagering game. Based on the playing activity the system unlocks non wagering game content that the system can present in the gaming widget when the player visits the webpage . The non wagering game content may only be available when the player visits specific websites such as the webpage which is part of the casino s website. The webpage includes the graphic e.g. the Lord of the Rings graphic that specifically indicates the themed game i.e. the Lord of the Rings thematic slot game .

The content display presents a login form with an account identifier field and a password field . A user can enter a login identifier into the account identifier field and password into the password field . The login identifier and password are related to an online player account stored on or referenced by the online player account server which is accessible to the gaming server . Previous to logging in the gaming widget can present a registration form for a registration process to create the online player account . As part of the registration process the system can present options for the player to select a specific screen name or user name. In some embodiments during the registration process the system can provide a name clearing house service that checks that a requested user name is not already in use. The system can present a service that a player can use to check whether a specific user name is available as a user name for the online player account for example to determine if a matching user name for a casino player account is available to use. If a matching user name is already in use the system can suggest similar names or can provide services that offer the user name to a player account that has a higher player status or that pays a higher fee. Further as part of the registration process or thereafter the system can present options for a player to associate the online player account with one or more casino playing accounts that store data regarding a player s playing statistics or playing history for the specific themed game at one or more casinos or one or more online gaming venues. Previously on the webpage or on a different location associated with a casino s website the user can also enter login information for a casino player account associated with the casino or casino server that hosts the webpage . The casino server can login the casino player account prior to or concurrently with logging in the online player account . The gaming server can link together the online player account and the one or more casino player accounts when the player logs in to the online player account via the gaming widget . In other words the system can provide information for the online player account to the casino server . Further the system can receive information for the casino player account from the casino server and provide the information to the gaming server . Therefore when a player logs on to a casino website or to a casino game at a wagering game machine the casino can link the player s casino account to the online player account . The casino then has the linked information as well as game statistics and playing history for gaming widget games and can use the information for selecting bonuses for providing advertisements etc. For example when a player logs in to a casino player account through the casino website or on a wagering game machine the casino knows that the player is Marcus Miller. Then when the player further logs on to the online player account for which the player Marcus Miller is known by the user name PokerAce1 the gaming server provides to the casino server the user name PokerAce1. The gaming server also provides access to playing history statistics etc. for the past wagering games and non wagering games that the online player account has played or that the casino player account has played in other casinos or online gaming venues or for other player accounts that have been linked to the online player account .

Returning momentarily to the flow continues at processing block where the system detects a selection of a wagering game theme for a wagering game that the player account has played and provides via the gaming widget a list of non wagering games related to the wagering game theme. In some embodiments the selection of the wagering game theme can be from the web widget or from the webpage. For instance in a player can navigate to the webpage via an Internet hyper link for content specific to the wagering game theme e.g. a player visits the casino s website and clicks on a link for the Lord of the Rings game theme . In another example however still referring to the system can present a game theme selector that a player can use to select a specific game theme. When a player selects a specific game theme from the game theme selector e.g. the LOTR or Lord of the Rings selection the system can update content within the gaming widget and also update webpage content on the webpage based on the selection of the game theme selector . To update content on the webpage based on the selection of the game theme selector the gaming widget can communicate bi directionally with the casino server and the gaming server . For instance the gaming widget can pass information e.g. via API to the casino server or dynamically to the webpage e.g. via scripting to update the background or other elements e.g. the graphic of the webpage to adapt to the selection of the wagering game theme from the gaming widget . In other embodiments the background or other elements of the webpage do not need to update to reflect the selected wagering game theme but can remain the same e.g. the webpage can remain generic or present content unrelated to the specific game theme . In embodiments where the game theme selection is not made in the gaming widget the web page or the casino server can pass information e.g. via API and or scripting to the gaming widget and or to the gaming server that indicates the wagering game theme.

When the wagering game theme is selected the system presents a listing of multiple persistent state web widget games e.g. non wagering games casual games or mini games in the content navigation console . The listing for example can include a first game selection graphic for a first mini game e.g. Gandalf s Rockets a second game selection graphic for a second mini game e.g. Mahjongg a third game selection graphic for a third mini game e.g. A Hobbits Puzzle etc. Each of the mini games is related to the selected game theme e.g. each of the mini games is related to the Lord of the Rings game theme selected in the game theme selector . The gaming widget can present the listing in many different ways such as via tabs dropdowns flow charts diagrams mind maps pop ups etc. In some embodiments the listing can show a player s favorite games

The mini games and other widget content can be unlocked or authorized for player access based on a player s performance or playing history or statistics in a wagering game for the selected wagering game theme that the player played during one or more previous wagering game sessions. Access to some or all of the widget content e.g. the mini games may depend on or require a player account to first attain a level or threshold of statistical performance or activity e.g. attain a threshold statistic for a wagering game. For example in after the system logs in the online player account the system modifies the content navigation console to be player specific. For instance a portion of the available mini games in the content navigation console can be deactivated e.g. locked grayed out etc. based on previous performance e.g. attaining one or more threshold statistics in a previous wagering game session. For example the second game selection graphic e.g. the Mahjongg game and the third game selection graphic e.g. the Hobbit s Puzzle game are deactivated or unauthorized for access because the online player account has not unlocked the associated mini game content via wagering game play at a casino or an online gaming venue. Another portion of the available mini games e.g. the Gandalf s Rocket game in the content navigation console however is activated e.g. unlocked ungrayed etc. or authorized for access by the online player account

In some embodiments the system can incorporate statistics into non wagering game content. For example as described previously the system presents non wagering game content based on statistics for the wagering game of the wagering game theme. For instance the system presents on a graphical map progress points that were earned by game achievements during the themed wagering game or during previous non wagering game sessions. In some embodiments the system can also present indicators on the graphical map that highlight a player s statistics in a wagering game e.g. a number of times that a player played the themed wagering game a best win an amount won etc. . For example the system can present wagering game statistics on the graphical map as elevated displays in association with a particular progress point. In some embodiments the system can use the statistics to generate advertisements promotions bonuses etc. that the system can present in the gaming widget e.g. in association with a progress point as an advertisement during game play etc. . The progress points on the map can respond to mouse movements that cause an elevated presentation e.g. a hover over display that shows for example game statistics from primary games such as a number of spins statistics for a number of times a player decided to play a particular bonus a visual or graphical representation of a player s best win e.g. a video replay of a player s wagering game achievement achievements e.g. medals trophies badges etc. won during the wagering game or during the non wagering game etc.

Returning momentarily to the flow continues at processing block where the system detects a selection from the list of non wagering games and provides non wagering game content via the web widget based on the selection. For example in the gaming widget presents in the content display a mechanism that indicates game status game status indication mechanism such as on a meter a chart a graph a clock a panel a graphic a map etc. such as the graphical map which indicates playing status e.g. game status game progress etc. for both the wagering game theme and non wagering game content associated with the wagering game theme as part of a persistent state game experience that tracks game activity between a casino game and a widget game e.g. the widget gaming experience on the webpage . In some embodiments the status of a persistent state game may be indicated by a series of game play status indicators game status indicators e.g. game status markers game progress points etc. . For instance in an example of the graphical map game play status indicators may take the form of progress points e.g. miles leagues waypoints etc. along a path. One of the progress points indicates a current state progress point for the persistent state game. When the online player account reaches a certain game status e.g. reaches certain progress points on the graphical map the player receives certain rewards. The system can provide game status indicators e.g. progress points for game play for the wagering game related to the wagering game theme as well as for game play in any of the mini games listed in the content navigation console for the wagering game theme. The gaming widget can also present a message for the player when the player logs in indicating a current state for the persistent state gaming experience.

When a player selects a non wagering content from the content navigation console the gaming widget can change appearance as illustrated in . In the gaming widget presents game content in the content display e.g. a game title a start control and game play elements that appear in the content display after a player activates the start control . The gaming widget can also change the appearance of the content navigation console to show game status information messages buttons e.g. a back button to exit game play or other information.

Returning momentarily to the flow continues at processing block where the system detects a game play achievement in the non wagering game content and stores an indication of the game play achievement with the player account. For example in the gaming server tracks and stores progress of game play performed via the gaming widget . During game play the online player account can attain game play achievements e.g. complete tasks solve puzzles find objects pass levels etc. . The gaming server detects the game play achievements and assigns a number of awards and or game status indicators for the game play achievements. The gaming server saves an indication of the game play achievements to the online player account . The gaming server can further modify the game status indication mechanism e.g. the graphical map to present the number of awards and or game status indicators e.g. present a number of progress points on a path . For example a new current state progress point indicates that the online player account has progressed along the path of the graphical map . An additional message can indicate that based on the player s performance in the non wagering game the player unlocked wagering game content e.g. the Prancing Pony bonus game that is only available when the player plays the themed wagering game e.g. the Lord of the Rings slot game at a casino. At any subsequent time the online player account can log in again to the gaming widget whether at the webpage at another website at a wagering game machine etc. and the system can provide the game status indication mechanism e.g. the graphical map and show progress the online player account has made.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a host provided reward for the game play achievement and provides the host provided reward to the player account.
