This application claims the benefit of Japanese Priority Patent Application JP 2014 031602 filed Feb. 21 2014 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

In recent years various technologies for causing an information processing device and an external device to perform linked operations have been developed. For example JP 2014 502400T discloses technology in which when a portable device is connected to a host system in wired or wireless communication and the host system is determined not to have a driver of the portable device or a driver included in the host system is determined to be older than a driver stored in the portable device the portable device automatically installs the driver stored therein in the host system.

The technology disclosed in for example JP 2014 502400T however does not assume a linked operation of a plurality of apparatuses via an information processing device. For this reason when there are a head mounted display HMD and a watch that both perform linked operations with a smartphone for example if the HMD is set to perform linked operations with the watch via the smartphone situations in which a procedure that a user has to go through to realize the linked operations becomes complicated are created.

Therefore the present disclosure proposes a novel and improved electronic apparatus and linked operation method that can easily realize linked operations of a plurality of apparatuses via an information processing device.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided an electronic apparatus that performs a linked operation with an information processing device via first driver software that is installed in the information processing device and also performs a linked operation with an external device that performs a linked operation with the information processing device via second driver software that is installed in the information processing device. A linked operation is performed with the external device when only the first driver software and second driver software are installed in the information processing device. The first driver software includes a software portion that serves as application software capable of being invoked by the second driver software.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided a linked operation method including installing first driver software for causing an electronic apparatus to perform a linked operation with an information processing device in the information processing device installing second driver software for causing an external device to perform a linked operation with the information processing device in the information processing device and causing the electronic apparatus to perform a linked operation with the external device via the first and second driver software that are installed in the information processing device. The first driver software serves as application software capable of being invoked by the second driver software.

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure as the first driver software that causes the electronic apparatus to perform a linked operation with the information processing device serves as application software that can be invoked by the second driver software that causes the external device to perform a linked operation with the information processing device it is not necessary to install separate application software for a linked operation in the information processing device and thereby linked operations are realized with ease.

According to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure described above it is possible to easily realize linked operations of a plurality of apparatuses via an information processing device.

Note that the effect described above is not necessarily limited and along with or instead of the effect any effect that is desired to be introduced in the present specification or other effects that can be expected from the present specification may be exhibited.

Hereinafter preferred embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the appended drawings. Note that in this specification and the appended drawings structural elements that have substantially the same function and structure are denoted with the same reference numerals and repeated explanation of these structural elements is omitted.

The HMD includes a display unit and a control unit . The display unit has a housing in the shape of for example glasses and is worn by a user observer on his or her head. The control unit is connected to the display unit by a cable.

The display unit is provided with a light source and a light guide plate as shown in . The light source emits image display light according to control of the control unit . The light guide plate guides the image display light incident from the light source and then emits the image display light to a position corresponding to the eyes of the user. The eyes of the user receive incidence of light that was incident on the light guide plate from a real space and is then transmitted through the light guide plate and the image display light guided from the light source by the light guide plate . Accordingly the user wearing the display unit can perceive an image being superimposed on the real space. Note that for the configuration for causing the image display light to be emitted from the light source through the light guide plate for example the technology disclosed in JP4776285B may be used. The display unit may be further provided with an optical system that is not illustrated for the configuration.

Further the display unit may be provided with a motion sensor an illuminance sensor and or a camera as shown in . The motion sensor includes for example a triaxial acceleration sensor a triaxial gyro sensor and a triaxial geomagnetic sensor.

The memory stores various kinds of data for operations of the processor . For example the memory stores programs for the processor to realize various functions. In addition the memory temporarily stores data output from the motion sensor and the camera of the display unit . The communication device executes wireless communication with the smartphone . For the wireless communication for example Bluetooth a registered trademark Wi Fi or the like is used. The input key includes for example a return key a Push to Talk PTT key and the like and acquires user operations with respect to the HMD .

The microphone converts sounds into audio signals and provides the signals to the processor . The speaker outputs sounds according to control of the processor . The battery supplies power to the entire control unit and display unit .

Note that a small size and light weight of the display unit are intended in the HMD such that the processor the microphone the speaker the battery and the like can be mounted in the control unit and the display unit and the control unit are separated from each other but connected with a cable. Since the control unit is also carried by a user it is desirable that it be as small and light as possible. Thus by setting the functions realized by the processor as minimum functions for controlling the display unit and other functions to be realized by the smartphone for example a small size of the entire control unit and battery attributable to a reduction in power consumption of the processor may also be attempted.

The smartphone is provided with a processor a memory communication devices and a sensor a display a touch panel a Global Positioning System GPS receiver a microphone a speaker and a battery . The processor realizes various functions as it operates according to programs stored in the memory . As described above as the processor realizes various functions in cooperation with the processor provided in the control unit of the HMD the control unit can be small and light. The memory stores various kinds of data for operations of the smartphone . For example the memory stores programs for the processor to realize the various functions. In addition the memory temporarily or permanently stores data acquired by the sensor and the GPS receiver and data transmitted to and received from the HMD .

The communication device executes wireless communication using Bluetooth a registered trademark Wi Fi or the like with the communication device provided in the control unit of the HMD and a communication device provided in the watch . In addition the communication device executes network communication with the server . The network communication may be executed via for example a mobile telephone network. The sensor includes for example an acceleration sensor an angular velocity sensor a geomagnetic sensor an illuminance sensor or the like and detects various states of the smartphone . The display displays various images according to control of the processor . The touch panel is disposed on the display and acquires touch operations of the user with respect to the display . The GPS receiver receives GPS signals for measuring latitude longitude and altitude of the smartphone . The microphone converts sounds into audio signals and then provides the signals to the processor . The speaker outputs sounds according to control of the processor . The battery supplies power to the entire smartphone .

The server is provided with a processor a memory and a communication device . Note that the server is realized for example through cooperation between a plurality of server devices on a network however it will be described as a hypothetical single device herein for simplification of description. The processor realizes various functions as it operates according to programs stored in the memory . The processor of the server executes various information processes according to for example requests received from the smartphone and transmits results thereof to the smartphone . The memory stores various kinds of data for operations of the server . For example the memory stores programs for the processor to realize the various functions. Further the memory may temporarily or continuously store data uploaded from the smartphone . The communication device executes network communication via for example a mobile telephone network with the smartphone .

The watch is provided with a processor a memory a communication device a sensor a display a touch panel and a battery . The watch is another example of the wearable device that is worn by the user of the HMD . The system may include a wearable device worn by the user on another part of his or her body instead of the watch or along with the watch .

The processor operates according to programs stored in the memory to realize various functions. In the present embodiment the processor transmits for example user operations acquired through the touch panel to the smartphone using the communication device receives results of processes executed by the smartphone based on the user operations and then executes control of displaying them on the display . Alternatively the watch may perform linked operations with the HMD and thereby the processor may transmit user operations for operating the HMD acquired through the touch panel to the smartphone using the communication device . The communication device executes wireless communication with the communication device provided in the smartphone using Bluetooth a registered trademark Wi Fi or the like. Note that the communication device may be capable of directly communicating with the communication device provided in the control unit of the HMD .

The sensor includes for example an acceleration sensor an angular velocity sensor a geomagnetic sensor an illuminance sensor or the like and detects various states of the watch . The display displays various images according to control of the processor . The touch panel is disposed on the display and acquires touch operations of the user with respect to the display . The battery supplies power to the entire watch .

Hereinabove the system configuration according to an embodiment of the present disclosure has been described. Note that in the present embodiment the HMD is an example of an electronic apparatus that is a wearable device. As described above the HMD provides images superimposed on a part of the visual field of the user by guiding image display light to the eyes of the observer using the light guide plate . Thus although the term display is used the HMD is not necessarily a device that causes images to be formed on its display plane. Of course an HMD of another known type such as a type of HMD in which images are formed on its display plane may be used instead of the HMD .

In addition the system configuration described above is an example and various other system configurations are also possible. For example the HMD may not necessarily have the display unit and the control unit separated from each other and the entire configuration of the HMD described above may be consolidated in a glasses type housing such as the display unit . In addition as described above at least some of the functions for controlling the HMD may be realized by the smartphone . Alternatively the display unit may also be provided with a processor and thus information processing of the HMD may be realized in cooperation between the processor of the control unit and the processor of the display unit .

As another modified example the system may not include the smartphone and communication may be directly executed between the HMD and the watch and or the server . In addition in the system the smartphone may be replaced by another device that can execute communication with the HMD the server and or the watch for example a tablet terminal a personal computer a portable game device or the like.

Next the processor transmits the information necessary for the image to be displayed next for example an icon text or the like to the HMD using the communication device S . The processor of the HMD generates the image to be displayed next frame image based on the information from the smartphone received through the communication device S . Further the processor controls the light source of the display unit based on data of the generated frame image and thereby updates a frame of an image provided with image display light emitted from the light source S .

Note that although the HMD provides an image based on the user operation acquired by the watch in the example described above the HMD may likewise provide an image based on a user operation acquired by the touch panel of the smartphone or the input key or the touch sensor of the control unit of the HMD .

Referring to the software module executed by the processor of the HMD includes HMD firmware . In addition the software module executed by the processor of the smartphone includes application software which will also be referred to hereinafter as App software and an HMD driver

The HMD firmware is a program written in the memory in advance in order to control operations of the HMD . On the other hand the HMD driver is driver software for causing the HMD and the smartphone to perform linked operations. The App software includes App software for a social medium and App software for e mail therein in the illustrated example. The App software causes the HMD to provide for example contributions to the social medium or received messages as images or provides a function of contributing to or transmitting text that is audibly input in the HMD images photographed by the camera or the like.

Here the App software of the smartphone provides various functions to the HMD through the HMD driver . Transmission and reception of control commands and data performed between the smartphone and the HMD should pass through the HMD driver . The HMD driver provides an application programming interface API for the App software and the respective pieces of the App software can cause the HMD to realize its functions by invoking the API. In addition control commands and data transmitted from the HMD are provided to the corresponding App software from the HMD driver . The HMD driver is automatically downloaded from the server and installed in the smartphone when for example the HMD is connected to the smartphone for the first time.

As shown in with respect to the watch various functions provided by the App software are realized in the watch as control commands and data are transmitted and received between watch firmware and a watch driver of the smartphone as in the HMD . The watch driver is also automatically downloaded from the server and installed in the smartphone when for example the watch is connected to the smartphone for the first time.

With this configuration in which the App software causes the HMD or the watch to realize their functions using the driver software the HMD driver and the watch driver as described above the App software may not describe processes in accordance with specifications of the HMD firmware and the watch firmware and thus development of the software is easy. In addition as the driver software supervises transmission of control commands and data it is possible to prevent unexpected control commands and data from being transmitted to the HMD and the watch and the HMD and the watch which are wearable devices directly related to safety of the user in some instances can be safely used.

Referring to a software module executed by the smartphone in the comparative configuration example includes App software for linked operations and application managing software in addition to the HMD driver the watch driver and the App software and for a social medium and e mail described in above.

The App software for linked operations causes the HMD and the watch to perform linked operations via the smartphone . The App software causes the HMD to realize functions by invoking the API of the HMD driver as the other pieces of the App software does. In addition the App software operates based on control commands and data transmitted from the watch and provided by the watch driver . With such operations of the App software the watch and the HMD perform linked operations via the smartphone and according to user operations performed on the touch panel of the watch for example it is possible to change images to be provided to a user via the light source and the light guide plate of the HMD .

The application managing software which may be referred to hereinafter as App managing software manages invocations of the App software by the driver software . When the App software is installed in the smartphone for example the App managing software collects information regarding the respective pieces of the App software and registers the collected information in a database . The collected and registered information can include for example screen sizes corresponding to the respective pieces of the App software and types of sensors necessary for operations. The driver software searches for the App software that can be invoked from the database via the App managing software .

Note that the App managing software can function in the same way as when the respective HMD and watch independently perform linked operation with the smartphone however illustration and description thereof will be omitted in .

In the illustrated example as the App software that can be invoked by the watch driver App software that realizes a function that the watch driver desires to use the App software for linked operations is registered in the database . Thus it is possible in the smartphone to selectively cause the HMD to perform a predetermined operation as a linked operation when a predetermined operation is executed in the watch . To be more specific for a linked operation the watch driver invokes the App software for linked operations then the App software invokes the API of the HMD driver and thereby the HMD operates according to an operation input to the watch .

In the case of the comparative configuration example described above however the App software for linked operations is necessary for causing the watch and the HMD to perform linked operations in addition to the pieces of the driver software . Since the App software is different software from the driver software it should be separately downloaded in the smartphone by the user. Thus in comparison to the driver software that is automatically downloaded when the HMD and the watch are connected to the smartphone a procedure of operations that should be performed by the user to make it usable is cumbersome. Depending on cases there is also a possibility of the user being unaware of or forgetting about presence of the App software without using the function relating to the linked operations even though the watch and the HMD can perform linked operations.

In addition in the case of the comparative configuration example the App software for linked operations is not the only one that can invoke the API of the HMD driver . Other pieces of the App software for example the App software and for a social medium and e mail can also invoke the API of the HMD driver . Control of images provided by the HMD for example sometimes blocks the visual field of the user and affects safety of the user. Thus when the HMD driver provides the API for freely controlling images of the HMD through linked operations with the watch it is risky to allow a third party to freely develop and provide the other pieces of the App software .

Thus in the present embodiment by employing a module configuration to be described hereinbelow with reference to it is possible to realize linked operations of the watch and the HMD with ease and safety.

Referring to the software module executed in the smartphone in the present embodiment includes the application managing software in addition to the HMD driver the watch driver and the App software and for a social medium and e mail described in above. Further in the illustrated example a software portion is included in the HMD driver . Hereinbelow description will focus on the software portion that is the difference from the example of described above.

The software portion is a part of the HMD driver . Thus the software portion is downloaded together when the HMD driver is downloaded in the smartphone. The software portion is a part of the driver software and serves as application software that can be invoked by the driver software . In other words the software portion provides information to the App managing software and the provided information is registered in the database . As described above the provided and registered information can include corresponding screen sizes types of sensors necessary for operations and the like.

In the illustrated example as the App software that can be invoked by the watch driver App software that realizes a function that the watch driver desires to use the software portion of the HMD driver is registered in the database . Thus as in the example of described above it is possible in the smartphone to selectively cause the HMD to perform a predetermined operation as a linked operation when a predetermined operation is executed in the watch . To be more specific in the drawing for a linked operation the watch driver invokes the software portion . In this case since the software portion is a part of the HMD driver it is possible to cause the HMD to operate according to operation inputs to the watch without using the API of the HMD driver

In order to cause the watch and the HMD to perform linked operations in the configuration of the present embodiment there may be separate pieces of the driver software i.e. the HMD driver and the watch driver . Since the software portion is downloaded along with the HMD driver a separate downloading procedure by the user is not necessary and thus there is no risk of the user not being aware of it. Thus linked operations performed between the watch and the HMD can be realized more easily than in for example the comparative configuration example of .

In addition in the configuration of the present embodiment as the watch driver invokes the software portion that is a part of the HMD driver a linked operation is realized without using the API of the HMD driver . For this reason it is not necessary for the HMD driver to provide the API for freely controlling images of the HMD in the linked operation with the watch . Thus even when a third party is allowed to freely develop and provide the other pieces of the App software for example linked operations performed between the watch and the HMD can be safely realized.

The configuration of the software module according to the present embodiment described above can be effective when for example the HMD and the watch are sequentially added to the system . To be more specific when the watch is first added to the system and then the HMD is added to the system the watch driver is not produced based on the premise of the presence of the HMD driver . In such a case rewriting the watch driver so as to perform direct exchange with the HMD driver to realize linked operations can also be considered however when the driver software is installed in a client device such as the smartphone updating of the software is executed with a user operation and thus it is difficult to reliably perform updating. For example the comparative configuration example shown in in which the driver software invokes the App software is effective for realizing expansion of the function without rewriting the individual pieces of the driver software in such a case but downloading separate software as described above is cumbersome and allowing a third party to develop the App software is risky.

On the other hand in the present embodiment the HMD driver that is added later has the software portion that is based on the premise of linked operations with the existing watch driver . Accordingly while the advantages of the comparative configuration example that the function can be easily expanded and the App software can be developed by a third party are maintained linked operations performed between the watch and the HMD can be realized with ease and safety.

Note that although the App managing software manages invocations of the App software by the driver software in the above described example an embodiment of the present disclosure is not limited thereto. As long as the driver software and the App software exchange information with a fixed protocol they can realize the equivalent function without the App managing software .

In addition in the above described example the HMD is an electronic apparatus that performs linked operations with the smartphone information processing device via the HMD driver first driver software that is installed in the smartphone and also performs linked operations with the watch that performs linked operations with the smartphone via the watch driver second driver software that is installed in the smartphone . Here the HMD can perform linked operations with the watch when only the HMD driver and the watch driver are installed in the smartphone and the HMD driver includes the software portion that serves as application software that can be invoked by the watch driver

In addition in the above described example the linked operation method in which the HMD driver first driver software for causing the HMD to perform linked operations with the smartphone is installed in the smartphone the watch driver second driver software for causing the watch to perform linked operations with the smartphone is installed in the smartphone and the HMD electronic apparatus and the watch external device are caused to perform linked operations using the driver software and installed in the smartphone information processing device is executed. Here the HMD driver includes the software portion that serves as application software that can be invoked by the watch driver
