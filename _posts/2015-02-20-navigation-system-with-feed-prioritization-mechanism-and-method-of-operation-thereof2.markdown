The navigation system can make changes to the interest list when a discrepancy is found between the interest feed and the feed record of or between the interest feed and the interest list . The discrepancy is a deviation between information provided by the interest feed and information contained in the feed record the interest list or a combination thereof.

The discrepancy can include the new entry of the missing entry of or the former entry of . The navigation system can add either the new entry or the former to the interest list by adding the new entry or the former entry to an addition queue . The addition queue is a waiting list for transitioning the feed entries onto the interest list . The navigation system can add either the new entry or the former entry to the interest list from the addition queue when an addition count exceeds an addition threshold .

The addition count is a record of the number of times the new entry is included in the interest feed aggregated by the navigation system . The addition threshold is a minimum number of counts which must be exceeded before an entry can be added to the interest list . As an example the addition threshold can be three counts and the navigation system can add the new entry to the interest list when the addition count of the new entry exceeds three counts.

The navigation system can also add one of the list entries corresponding to the missing entry to a purge queue . The purge queue is a waiting list for transitioning the list entries off the interest list . The navigation system can remove one of the list entries corresponding to the missing entry from the interest list by removing the list entries from the purge queue . The navigation system can remove the list entries from the purge queue when a removal count exceeds a removal threshold .

The removal count is a record of the number of times the missing entry is included in the interest feed aggregated by the navigation system . The removal threshold is a minimum number of counts which must be exceeded before one of the list entries can be removed from the interest list . As an example the removal threshold can be three counts and the navigation system can remove one of the list entries corresponding to the missing entry when the removal count of the list entries exceeds three counts.

Referring now to therein is shown an example display on the display interface of the first device of . The display interface can depict multiple instances of an update to the interest list of as shown to a user of the first device . The update can include removing one of the list entries of from the interest list or adding the new entry to the interest list .

As an example depicts the update as a removal of an instance of the location entry from the interest list . As shown in the location entry can be a recently closed Starbucks caf location. In this example the recently closed Starbucks caf location can correspond to the missing entry of . Also in this example the missing entry can be included in an instance of the interest feed of with the removal authority of such as the brand specific feed of of Starbucks store locations.

Continuing with this example the navigation system can remove the recently closed Starbucks caf location from the interest list by adding the location entry to the purge queue of when the brand specific feed omits the location entry from its own instance of the feed entries of . The navigation system can then remove the recently closed Starbucks from the interest list when the removal count of associated with the recently closed Starbucks caf location exceeds the removal threshold of . The purge queue the removal count and the removal threshold can be utilized by the navigation system to prevent any of the list entries from being deleted or removed by mistake.

As an additional example also depicts the new entry added to the interest list . As shown in the new entry can be a recently opened Starbucks caf location. The new entry can be included in an instance of the interest feed with the addition authority of such as the brand specific feed of Starbucks store locations.

The display interface can also depict an interest location associated with the update . The interest location is a geographic location or coordinate of the location entry or the event entry of associated with the update . In addition the display interface can depict a device location . The device location is a geographic location or coordinate of a device connected to the navigation system such as the first device .

The navigation system can generate a geo fence around the interest location . The geo fence is a virtual perimeter surrounding a geographic area or location in the real world. The geometry of the geo fence can include a circle an ellipsoid a polygon or a combination thereof. The size of the geo fence can be defined by a distance segment such as a radius stemming from a reference point such as a center point.

The display interface can also depict a navigation behavior . The navigation behavior is navigation data concerning a location which is indicative of a characteristic of the location. The navigation behavior can include a stoppage frequency a total stoppage time or a combination thereof. The stoppage frequency is a number of times a device connected to the navigation system stopped at a location. The total stoppage time is a total amount of time one or more devices connected to the navigation system stopped at a geographic location or coordinate.

As an example the stoppage frequency can be the number of times the first device stopped at the interest location . As an additional example the total stoppage time can be the total number of minutes all devices connected to the navigation system stopped at the interest location . As will be discussed in more detail below the navigation system can determine a device has stopped at the interest location when the device is detected within the geo fence surrounding the interest location .

The navigation system can determine the navigation behavior over a confirmation period . The confirmation period is a set period of time after the update to the interest list . As an example the confirmation period can be a period of one week one month or three months after the update to the interest list .

The display interface can also depict a navigation threshold . The navigation threshold are minimum or maximum limit values concerning the navigation behavior . As an example the navigation threshold for the stoppage frequency of a new POI added to the interest list can be a minimum of 100 stops within the confirmation period of one week.
