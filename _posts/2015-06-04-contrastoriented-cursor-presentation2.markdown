title: Contrast-oriented cursor presentation
abstract: Many devices present a cursor on a display. In order to facilitate the user's visual identification and tracking of the location of the cursor, the device may present the cursor with many visual variations, such as blinking the cursor, or selecting colors for the cursor that contrast with the background. However, these techniques may only marginally increase the visibility of the cursor in some circumstances, and/or may appear visually unappealing to the user. Presented herein are techniques for presenting a cursor on the display as a first cursor layer in a first cursor color that blends with the background color, and, under the first layer, a second cursor layer in a contrasting cursor color with respect to the first cursor color and the background. The device may also periodically remove the first layer to display the contrasting second layer and to indicate the location of the cursor to the user.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve the presentation of a cursor on a display of a device. In many such scenarios difficulties may arise due to the visibility of the cursor on the display e.g. a user may have difficulty identifying the location of the cursor and or tracking movement of the cursor if the cursor blends into a display background including a wallpaper or static image presented on the background and or a user interface element such as a window.

Various techniques may be utilized to facilitate the user in determining the location of the cursor. As a first example the device may cause the cursor to blink at a specified frequency or to rotate through various colors. As a second example the device may detect the background color and may present respective portions of the cursor in inverse colors e.g. when the cursor is positioned over a black background the device may present a white cursor and vice versa. These and other techniques may draw the user s eye to the location of the cursor and may therefore enable the user to interact with the device via the pointer.

Some techniques for presenting the cursor may utilize some framework hardware or software capabilities of the device. For example a device may provide hardware and or application library support for alpha blending to provide a smooth transition between cursor states and the cursor may be presented by invoking such support to present the cursor with an inverse alpha blend. Because such underlying support may be more highly optimized for the other hardware and or software capabilities of the device and or may integrate such alpha blending techniques at a lower level e.g. a part of the display device driver utilizing such resources may provide enhanced performance e.g. reduced cursor movement latency and or computational use than ad hoc alpha blending techniques developed specifically for and applied specifically to the display of the cursor.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

While various techniques may be utilized to draw the attention of the user to a cursor location of the cursor some of these techniques may be disadvantageous. As a first such example devices that always present a high contrast cursor such as always presenting a bright white cursor on a dark background may be visually unappealing to the user. As a second such example a blinking cursor may still be difficult to detect against a non contrasting background e.g. a dark colored cursor over a dark colored background may not be visible even with a high blink rate. As a third such example a entire cursor that color contrasts with the background may still be difficult to locate if the background features highly contrasting colors e.g. a cursor that contrasts with a camouflage designed background may also appear camouflaged and therefore difficult to see even if the contrasting colors of the cursor are updated as the cursor moves over the background. As a fourth such example while some devices may provide support for some cursor display techniques other devices may not. An application that depends on the availability of such support for the presentation of the cursor may result in an absence of any contrast enhancing technique for the cursor that interacts with the application on devices lacking such support and or may result in error messages from broken dependencies.

Presented herein are techniques for presenting a cursor on a display of a device that may address some of these observations. In accordance with these techniques a device may be configured to present the cursor at a cursor location of the display in the following manner. The device may present at the cursor location a first cursor layer of the cursor in a first cursor color. The device may also present at the cursor location and under the first cursor layer a second cursor layer of the cursor in a contrasting cursor color that contrasts with the first cursor color. The device may also periodically remove the first cursor layer thus revealing the second cursor layer. The removing of the first cursor layer may be a discrete step e.g. alternating between the first cursor layer presented over the second cursor layer and only presenting the second cursor layer or continuous e.g. incrementally and or smoothly fading between presenting the first cursor layer over the second cursor layer and presenting only the second cursor layer . In this manner the device may present the cursor in a manner that facilitates the user s identification and or tracking of the mouse movement of the cursor in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

In such example scenarios difficulties may arise with the presentation of the cursor wherein the user may have difficulty identifying the location of the cursor on the display distinguishing between the cursor and the background of the display and or tracking the movement of the cursor across the display including over various user interface elements .

A first technique illustrated in involves periodically removing the cursor from the display at a second time causing the cursor to blink. Therefore while the cursor is stationary on a static background of the display the cursor may stand out from the static background and the attention of the user may be drawn to the blinking shape that represents the cursor .

A second technique illustrated in involves presenting the cursor at a cursor location and with a background color of the background of the display . For example if the background color of the background is dark such as black the cursor may be presented in a white cursor color. Conversely while presenting the cursor on a light colored background such as at the first time the device may present the cursor in a dark cursor color such as black. In some techniques the specific portions of the background at the location of the cursor may be taken into consideration e.g. if the user moves the cursor from the dark colored background and over a light colored user interface element such as a window the cursor color of the cursor may be changed to a dark color such as black. As a further variation such background contrast may be selected for different parts of the cursor e.g. a first portion of the cursor positioned over the dark background may be shown in a light cursor color and concurrently a second portion of the cursor positioned over a light colored user interface element may be shown in a dark cursor color . In this manner various techniques may be utilized to present the cursor to the user .

In some of these techniques the presentation of the cursor may utilize some resources of the device . For example some techniques may involve alpha blending calculations which may enable blending of colors and which may be used to provide a partial opacity or transparency of presented images with respect to other images and or the background . Because such calculations may be computationally intensive it may be difficult and or inefficient to utilize these techniques in a performant manner e.g. applying alpha blending operations to the cursor during each redraw . Instead the device may provide some resources to assist with such tasks such as support through a display device driver or the operating system which may achieve the performance of such operations in an optimized manner and or may alleviate ad hoc code from applications utilizing such techniques.

However in many such scenarios a variety of problems may arise with the presentation of the cursor that diminish the ability of the user to identify the location of the cursor even if such techniques as shown in the example scenario of are utilized.

As a first such example if the device always presents a high contrast colored cursor the high contrast may be visually unappealing to the user . For example if the cursor is shown in a high contrast color such as bright red the cursor may look garish or distracting. Similarly if the cursor blinks at a high rate the cursor may be visually distracting while the user is not interested in its location.

As a second such example some of these techniques may not increase the visibility of the cursor against the background . As a first such example if the first technique is utilized that involves blinking the cursor the cursor may still not be visible positioned over a dynamic background such as an animating background image or user interface element that is also blinking or otherwise moving. Alternatively or additionally choosing a color for the cursor that contrasts with the background color may not increase the visibility of the cursor if the coloration of the background is dynamic. For example if the background is depicted as high contrast camouflage an automatic selection of the cursor color to contrast with the background color may also cause the cursor to appear as high contrast camouflage and the cursor may also inadvertently appear as camouflage and may blend in with the background .

As a third such example techniques that utilize some device resources of the device to present the cursor such as alpha blending support from the processor display device driver or an application programming interface API may fail on devices where such resources are not available. For example if the display device driver does not provide support for alpha blending operations an application that invokes such functionality may exhibit no noticeable alpha blending of the cursor and therefore may provide no visual assistance in identifying the location of the cursor . In some scenarios reliance upon such resources may result in an application failure such as a system crash. These and other problems may arise from the presentation of the cursor using the techniques illustrated in the example scenario of .

In this example scenario the cursor involves a first cursor layer in a first cursor color and a second cursor layer in a contrasting cursor color that contrasts with the first cursor color . A composite cursor is generated as the second cursor layer presented under the first cursor layer . In some variants including the example scenario of the second cursor layer is slightly larger than the first cursor layer such as at least one pixel larger to the left top right and bottom of the first cursor layer such that the second cursor layer is visible under the first cursor layer in the composite cursor . Additionally in some variants including the example scenario of the first cursor color is selected to coordinate with a color of a background of a display and the contrasting cursor color is selected to contrast with the color of the background of the display .

At a first time a device may present on a display the composite cursor as the first cursor layer and the second cursor layer under the first cursor layer . At a second time the device may present the composite cursor on the display by removing the first cursor layer thus revealing the portion of the second cursor layer that was obscured by the first cursor layer . At a third time the device may restore the first cursor layer again obscuring the second cursor layer presented under the first cursor layer . In this manner the device may present a composite cursor on the display in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

Various uses of the techniques presented herein to present a cursor on a display of a device may result in a variety of technical effects.

As a first technical effect the presentation of the cursor in accordance with the techniques presented herein may present a cursor that is visually apparent to a user . For example in some scenarios the user may have difficulty identifying the location of the cursor on the display such as where the cursor blends into a background color or where the cursor is stationary among many other stationary visual objects on the display . The techniques presented herein provide a composite cursor that is apparent on the display in these circumstances due to the contrasting color of the second cursor layer that contrasts with the first cursor color and or the cyclic hiding and replacement of the first cursor layer over the second cursor layer .

As a second technical effect the presentation of the cursor in accordance with the techniques presented herein may conserve computing resources particularly in devices of limited computational power such as mobile and embedded devices. Some devices have specialized hardware or software for graphics rendering such as a sprite buffer that holds a bitmap to be displayed at a location on the display. A technique that causes a cursor to change appearance may have to provide a continuing stream of graphics updates such as a complete re rendering of the bitmap for the current appearance of the cursor many times per second. However a device that simply stores the first cursor layer and second cursor layer in different portions of memory such as different hardware or software defined sprite buffers may simply indicate alternatively that the first cursor layer is to be removed or replaced. The simplified instruction path between the cursor control module and the graphics rendering hardware may reduce the consumption of computational resources such as processor capacity and stored power. Such savings may be comparatively small for a single iteration but if the cursor is continuously updated many times per second for a long duration such as an entire day the savings in computational resources may present a significant technical effect.

As a third technical effect the alternation technique presented herein may be significantly advantageous on particular types of displays . For example on an electrophoretic e ink display animating the cursor by removing and replacing the first cursor layer may be achieved through a selective screen refresh of only the pixels comprising the first cursor layer and may do so at a comparatively low frequency such as twice per second. The second cursor layer and other portions of the display may be left alone and may not have to be redrawn. By contrast other techniques for drawing attention to the cursor such as mouse trails cursor ripple effects or more complex and or high frequency animation may entail a more extensive redrawing of part or all of the display which may be inefficient and costly for computational resources such as stored power.

As a fourth technical effect the techniques presented herein may be provided as an alternative to other cursor animation techniques in order to support a wider variety of devices. For example an application may execute on some devices that provide specialized hardware or software support for a particular type of cursor animation such as alpha blending. However on devices that lack such support the presentation of the application may cause the cursor to disappear or to exhibit reduced visibility. The techniques presented herein may be provided as a backup or alternative technique on such devices in order to support the visibility of the cursor . At runtime a device may determine whether or not specialized support is provided for cursor animation and may either invoke such specialized support or utilize the techniques presented herein based on such determination. Many such technical effects may arise from various embodiments of the techniques presented herein.

The example system comprises a cursor presenter which presents at a cursor location a first cursor layer of the cursor in a first cursor color . The example system also comprises a cursor blinker which presents at the cursor location and under the first cursor layer a second cursor layer of the cursor in a contrasting cursor color that contrasts with the first cursor color . The cursor blinker also periodically removes the first cursor layer to reveal the second cursor layer . For example at a first time the example system may present the composite cursor as the first cursor layer over the second cursor layer at a second time after the first time the example system may present the composite cursor as only the second cursor layer and at a third time after the second time the example system may again present the composite cursor as the first cursor layer over the second cursor layer . In this manner the example system enables the example device to present the cursor on the display in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The example method begins at and involves executing the instructions on a processor of the device. Specifically executing the instructions on the processor causes the device to present at the cursor location a first cursor layer of the cursor in a first cursor color . Executing the instructions on the processor also causes the device to present at the cursor location and under the first cursor layer a second cursor layer of the cursor in a contrasting cursor color that contrasts with the first cursor color . Executing the instructions on the processor also causes the device to periodically remove the first cursor layer to reveal the second cursor layer . In this manner the example method causes the device to present the cursor in accordance with the techniques presented herein and so ends at .

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that excludes communications media computer computer readable memory devices such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An example computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable memory device e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions that when executed on a processor of a device cause the device to operate according to the principles set forth herein.

In a second system embodiment the processor executable instructions may provide a system that causes a device to display a cursor at a cursor location of a display in accordance with the techniques presented herein such as the example system in the example scenario of .

In a third such example the processor executable instructions may cause a device to perform a method of displaying a cursor at a cursor location of a display in accordance with the techniques presented herein such as the example method of . Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the example device of the example system of the example method of and or the example computer readable storage device of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized.

As a first variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to achieve the configuration of a variety of devices and servers such as workstations laptops tablets mobile phones game consoles portable gaming devices portable or non portable media players media display devices such as televisions appliances home automation devices computing components integrated with a wearable device integrating such as eyewear or a watch and supervisory control and data acquisition SCADA devices.

As a second variation of this third aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to present cursors on a wide variety of displays such as a liquid crystal display LCD or light emitting diode LED device connected to a computer a display integrated with a mobile and or wearable device such as an eyepiece on a pair of eyewear a visual interface of a vehicle integrated device such as a dashboard of an automobile a projector that remotely projects a display of a computer and a first device and or a second device that collaborate to transmit a computing environment of the first device for presentation on a display of the second device.

As a third variation of this third aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to present cursors for many types of pointing applications such as a mouse trackpad or joystick a touch based or other manual gesture system and a gaze tracking system. The techniques presented herein may also be utilized to present many types of cursors such as cursors for selecting and or identifying visual objects navigating among visual objects and drawing or handwriting.

As a fourth variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized in conjunction with other systems for presenting the cursor on the display . As a first such example an application may be deployed to a device that may or may not have specialized support for presenting a cursor on the display such as hardware and or software support for an inverse alpha blending of shapes presented on the display. It may be desirable for the application to utilize such specialized resources if available and to utilize an alternative technique such as the technique presented herein if not. Accordingly an embodiment of these techniques may detect whether the device supports inverse alpha blending of shapes presented on the display and if so may refrain from presenting the cursor on the display using the second cursor layer and instead present the cursor on the display using inverse alpha blending but if inverse alpha blending is not supported the device may present the cursor as a periodically appearing first cursor layer over a second cursor layer . Many such scenarios may be devised wherein the techniques presented herein may be advantageously utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein involves the appearance of the cursor presented on the display .

As a first variation of this second aspect a device may present the first layer and the second layer of the cursor with different shapes. As a first such example the first cursor layer and the second cursor layer may comprise the same shape and size such that periodically removing the first cursor layer causes the device to toggle between the first cursor layer and the second cursor layer. As a second such example the first cursor layer may be smaller and or differently shaped than the second cursor layer such that at least a portion of the second cursor layer appears while the first cursor layer is presented over it. As one such example the first cursor layer of the composite cursor may be presented in the first cursor color and having a first cursor layer shape and the second cursor layer may be presented under the first cursor layer in the contrasting cursor color and also having a second cursor layer shape that is at least one pixel larger in at least one dimension than the first cursor layer shape of the first cursor layer . This variation is illustrated in the example scenario of wherein the second cursor layer is two pixels wider and taller than the first cursor layer and therefore presents an appearance of a thin border around the first cursor layer when present.

As a second variation of this second aspect the first cursor color and or contrasting cursor color for the composite cursor may be selected in various ways. As a first such example one or both colors may be specified by a user and or selected as a default.

As a third example of this second variation of this second aspect a device may transition among one or more colors in a number of ways. As a first such example the device may choose the first cursor color and or the contrasting cursor color with respect to a range of the display within a distance threshold of the cursor location .

As a second example of this third variation of this second aspect the opacity of the second cursor layer may vary such as between approximately 50 and 100 . For example the device may determine a background blend ratio of the first cursor color with a background color of the background and may set the opacity of the second cursor layer in inverse proportion with the background blend ratio e.g. increasing the opacity of the second cursor layer if the second cursor color does not strongly contrast with the background color and decreasing the opacity of the second cursor layer if the second cursor color strongly contrasts with the background color . Many such variations may be utilized to choose the appearance of the composite cursor in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein involves the periodic presentation and removal of the first cursor layer over the second cursor layer .

As a first variation of this third aspect the frequency with which the first cursor layer is periodically presented over the second cursor layer may be fixed such as a user or environment selected frequency that does not vary as the composite cursor moves within the operating environment of the device.

As a second variation of this third aspect the period with which the first cursor layer is presented over the second cursor layer may vary according to various properties of the operating environment. As a first such example the period may vary in inverse proportion with a movement rate of the cursor e.g. if the cursor is moving quickly the period may be decreased to facilitate visual tracking of the fast moving composite cursor and if the cursor is moving slow the period may be increased to avoid making the composite cursor appear overly busy.
