The present disclosure generally relates to a sensor data broker for directing collection of sensor data between a mobile collector device and one or more sensor consumers.

This section describes approaches that could be employed but are not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or employed. Hence unless explicitly specified otherwise any approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and any approaches described in this section are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.

The Internet of Things IoT is expected to result in the deployment of millions of sensor devices deployed by organizations to capture sensor data in locations worldwide including remote locations that do not have any existing wireless infrastructure e.g. wireless telephony such as 3G or 4G LTE wireless Internet etc. . Delay tolerant networking has been proposed to enable a mobile collector device e.g. a smart phone smart tablet etc. to serve as a store and forward device that can collect sensor data from an isolated sensor and forward the sensor data to another network device.

Different proposals suggest an incentive for a user of a portable device where the incentive would stimulate the user to use his or her portable device as a mobile collector device to collect the sensor data from an isolated sensor and forward the sensor data to another network device.

In one embodiment a method comprises receiving by a broker device in a persistent data network a request from one or more sensor consumers for sensor data originated by one or more isolated sensor devices the isolated sensor devices not reachable by any wired or wireless infrastructure sending by the broker device via the persistent data network in response to the request a message to a mobile collector device indicating an instruction for obtaining the sensor data from the one or more isolated sensor devices and receiving by the broker device in the persistent data network the sensor data from the mobile collector device having established a local data connection with the one or more isolated sensor devices and in response causing sending of a credit for receiving the sensor data to a registered user of the mobile collector device.

In another embodiment an apparatus comprises a device interface circuit and a processor circuit. The device interface circuit is configured for receiving in a persistent data network a request from one or more sensor consumers for sensor data originated by one or more isolated sensor devices. The isolated sensor devices are not reachable by any wired or wireless infrastructure. The processor circuit is configured for generating and sending in response to the request a message to a mobile collector device indicating an instruction for obtaining the sensor data from the one or more isolated sensor devices. The device interface circuit further is configured for receiving via the persistent data network the sensor data from the mobile collector device having established a local data connection with the one or more isolated sensor devices. The processor circuit further is configured for causing sending of a credit for receiving the sensor data to a registered user of the mobile collector device in response to reception of the sensor data.

In another embodiment one or more non transitory tangible media are encoded with logic for execution by a machine and when executed by the machine operable for receiving by a device in a persistent data network a request from one or more sensor consumers for sensor data originated by one or more isolated sensor devices the isolated sensor devices not reachable by any wired or wireless infrastructure sending by the device via the persistent data network in response to the request a message to a mobile collector device indicating an instruction for obtaining the sensor data from the one or more isolated sensor devices and receiving by the device in the persistent data network the sensor data from the mobile collector device having established a local data connection with the one or more isolated sensor devices and in response causing sending of a credit for receiving the sensor data to a registered user of the mobile collector device.

In yet another embodiment method comprises receiving by a mobile collector device from a broker device via a persistent data network a message indicating an instruction for obtaining sensor data originated by one or more isolated sensor devices the isolated sensor devices not reachable by any wired or wireless infrastructure establishing while the mobile collector device is disconnected from the persistent data network and the wired or wireless infrastructure a local data connection with the one or more isolated sensor devices based on being within proximity thereof the mobile collector device retrieving and storing the sensor data from the one or more isolated sensor devices via the local data connection based on the message and the mobile collector device forwarding the sensor data to the broker device in response to having reconnected to the persistent data network following disconnecting from the local data connection including receiving notification of a credit for forwarding the sensor data.

In another embodiment an apparatus comprises a first device interface circuit a second device interface circuit a processor circuit and a memory circuit. The first device interface circuit is configured for receiving from a broker device via a persistent data network a message indicating an instruction for obtaining sensor data originated by one or more isolated sensor devices the isolated sensor devices not reachable by any wired or wireless infrastructure. The second device interface circuit is configured for establishing while the apparatus is disconnected from the persistent data network and the wired or wireless infrastructure a local data connection with the one or more isolated sensor devices based on being within proximity thereof. The processor circuit is configured for retrieving the sensor data via the local data connection from the one or more isolated sensor devices based on the message. The memory circuit is configured for storing the sensor data. The processor circuit further is configured for forwarding the sensor data to the broker device in response to the first device interface circuit having reconnected to the persistent data network following the second device interface circuit having disconnected from the local data connection. The processor circuit further is configured for receiving notification of a credit for forwarding the sensor data.

In another embodiment one or more non transitory tangible media are encoded with logic for execution by a machine and when executed by the machine operable for receiving by a mobile collector device from a broker device via a persistent data network a message indicating an instruction for obtaining sensor data originated by one or more isolated sensor devices the isolated sensor devices not reachable by any wired or wireless infrastructure establishing while the mobile collector device is disconnected from the persistent data network and the wired or wireless infrastructure a local data connection with the one or more isolated sensor devices based on being within proximity thereof the mobile collector device retrieving and storing the sensor data from the one or more isolated sensor devices via the local data connection based on the message and the mobile collector device forwarding the sensor data to the broker device in response to having reconnected to the persistent data network following disconnecting from the local data connection including receiving notification of a credit for forwarding the sensor data.

Particular embodiments enable a sensor data broker device in a persistent data network to provide an instruction to direct a user of a mobile collector device e.g. a smart phone smart tablet toward isolated sensor devices that are not reachable by any wired or wireless infrastructure enabling the mobile collector device to act as a temporary agent for sensor data consumers i.e. sensor consumers unable to reach the isolated sensor devices. The mobile collector device can utilize information from the sensor data broker device to retrieve and store sensor data from the isolated sensor devices upon reaching proximity e.g. wired or wireless proximity with the isolated sensor devices. The mobile collector device upon reconnecting with the wired or wireless infrastructure can forward the sensor data to the sensor data broker device enabling the user of the mobile collector device to receive a credit for collecting and forwarding the sensor data on behalf of the sensor consumers.

Hence the sensor data broker device enables sensor consumers to provide an instruction for directing users of mobile collector devices to obtain sensor data from isolated sensor devices. The instruction can be implemented in the form of an incentive that provides motivation for a user of the mobile collector device to travel within proximity of the isolated sensor devices to collect the sensor data and then forward the collected sensor data upon reconnection with the wired or wireless infrastructure. The incentive set by one or more of the sensor consumers can vary based on the relative importance of the sensor data and or the age of the last update of sensor data or other factors.

The sensor data broker also can output location information identifying at least an identifiable region containing the isolated sensor devices. The location information enables the user of the mobile collector device to locate the isolated sensor devices the sensor data broker also can announce within the instruction sent to the mobile collector device a treasure hunt for isolated sensor devices that do not yet have an identified position e.g. newly deployed sensor devices sensor devices attached to migratory wildlife etc. . In some cases certain details of the collected sensor data e.g. a portion of the sensor data metadata associated with the sensor data etc. also can be displayed on the mobile collector devices further enhancing a user experience for example in the case of interactive wildlife encounter tours.

Each isolated sensor device is isolated in that the isolated sensor devices are not reachable by any wired or wireless infrastructure provided by a wired or wireless gateway to the persistent data network . An isolated sensor device can be isolated for various reasons for example lack of a long range transceiver that can reach any wired or wireless infrastructure . An example wired or wireless infrastructure can include a wireless telephony network such as 3G or 4G LTE Long Term Evolution having a gateway providing Internet Protocol IP based access between the mobile collector device and the sensor data broker device via a secure data connection e.g. Transport Layer Security TLS and or HTTPs the wired or wireless infrastructure also be implemented as a wireless data network such as a Wi Fi network generated by the wireless gateway e.g. a wireless access router wireless access point etc. . An isolated sensor device could be configured for low power only operation including for example low power wireless transmission using Bluetooth LE low energy or IEEE 802.15.4 hence an isolated sensor device could have a wireless proximity range of about ten 10 meters or less.

An isolated sensor device also could be isolated if it had a long range transceiver e.g. 3G or LTE or even satellite transceiver but was still incapable of establishing any data connection with the wired or wireless infrastructure for example the wired or wireless infrastructure may have poor wireless coverage at the location occupied by the isolated sensor device that prevents any reliable consistent or persistent data connection from being established by the isolated sensor device alternately even with adequate wireless coverage for establishing a reliable consistent or persistent data connection the isolated sensor device may disable the long range transceiver to minimize costs e.g. battery consumption cost monetary data usage cost etc. associated with establishing a data connection via the wired or wireless infrastructure .

Hence each sensor consumer device is incapable of reaching any of the isolated sensor devices for any sensor data generated by the isolated sensor device because the isolated sensor devices do not have a reliable consistent or persistent data connection with the wired or wireless infrastructure .

According to an example embodiment the sensor data broker device can receive a request from one or more of the sensor consumer devices for example via a secure data connection for sensor data originated by one or more of the isolated sensor devices . The request can be in the form of one or more registration requests for a sensor consumer registration of one or more isolated sensor devices that associate the isolated sensor devices and or a sensor consumer identifier associated with a sensor consumer with the sensor consumer device and or location information that identifies the last known location s if any of the isolated sensor devices . The request also can identify an incentive that the identified sensor consumer e.g. B is willing to pay for acquisition of the sensor data from an identified isolated sensor device .

The sensor data broker device can respond to the request by sending a message also referred to as a message sensor incentive message or data collection request message to the mobile collector device indicating the instruction for obtaining the sensor data from one or more of the isolated sensor devices . The instruction optionally can specify an incentive for obtaining the sensor data. The sensor incentive message can be sent to the mobile collector device for example in response to the mobile collector device sending a registration message to the sensor data broker device as part of a user of the mobile collector device registering downloading of an executable application Sensor Data Broker App of for locating the isolated sensor devices .

The sensor incentive message sent to the mobile collector device by the sensor data broker device in response to the registration message can enable the Sensor Data Broker App executed in the mobile collector device to direct the user of the mobile collector device to locate isolated sensor devices that are either within a determined distance of the mobile collector device or along a prescribed path e.g. the Appalachian Trail . In particular the sensor incentive message can identify the incentive for each isolated sensor device and optionally can identify a last known location or region of the isolated sensor device alternately the sensor incentive message can identify that an incentive is part of a treasure hunt for an isolated sensor device having an unknown location. The sensor incentive message also can include secure communication parameters enabling the Sensor Data Broker App executed in the mobile collector device to establish a secure data connection with an isolated sensor device as the mobile collector device moves within the wireless proximity range of the isolated sensor device . Hence the sensor data broker app can establish secure communications with the isolated sensor device even if the user of the mobile collector device is an untrusted third party.

Hence the mobile collector device can retrieve and store sensor data from each isolated sensor device within wireless proximity range as the user of the mobile collector device travels along a path while the mobile collector device is disconnected from the persistent data network and the wired or wireless infrastructure . Upon returning to the coverage area of the same wired or wireless infrastructure or a different wired or wireless infrastructure at event the mobile collector device can reconnect to the wired or wireless infrastructure or and the persistent data network and forward the sensor information containing sensor data sensor metadata and collection metadata to the sensor data broker device . The sensor data broker device in response to receiving the sensor information can cause the sensor consumer device to obtain the sensor information including the sensor data and can send to the mobile collector device a credit message indicating the user of the mobile collector device has been sent a credit for forwarding the collected sensor information to the sensor data broker device the credit optionally can be contingent on the sensor data broker device receiving an acknowledgement of the sensor consumer device having received the sensor information or at least the sensor data .

Hence the example embodiments enable the sensor data broker device to direct a user of a mobile collector device toward sensor consumer devices for collection of sensor information on behalf of one or more sensor consumer devices that cannot reach the isolated sensor devices . The users can be directed based on location information transmitted in the sensor incentive message sent to the mobile collector device and or varying incentives identified for each isolated sensor device . The incentives can be various forms for example cash based incentives points based incentives e.g. airline mileage points club points vendor points or virtual dollars reputation points in social organizations or gaming systems etc. or other credit schemes.

Each apparatus and or can include a device interface circuit a processor circuit and a memory circuit . Depending on implementation the device interface circuit can include one or more distinct physical layer transceivers for communication with any one of the other devices and or for example the device interface circuit of an isolated sensor device can include a transceiver for low power communications using Bluetooth LE and or IEEE 802.15.4 in contrast the mobile collector device can include a first device interface circuit for low power communications with the isolated sensor device a second device interface circuit e.g. 3G or 4G LTE for communications in the wired or wireless infrastructure a third Wi Fi transceiver circuit for Wi Fi communications in the wired or wireless infrastructure and a fourth GPS receiver circuit for reception of GPS signals. The mobile collector device also can include other transceivers e.g. a universal serial bus USB transceiver etc. .

The device interface circuit of the wireless gateway can include a first transceiver for wireless communications with the mobile collector device e.g. via the device interface circuit and or the Wi Fi transceiver circuit and an IEEE based Ethernet transceiver for communications with the devices and or in the persistent data network . Any of the devices or also can include a transceiver for communications via a wired or wireless link an optical link etc. .

The processor circuit can be configured for executing any of the operations described herein and the memory circuit can be configured for storing any data or data packets as described herein. Although not shown in each of the devices and or can include a power source such as a rechargeable battery etc.

Any of the disclosed circuits of the devices and or including the device interface circuit the processor circuit the memory circuit and their associated components can be implemented in multiple forms. Example implementations of the disclosed circuits include hardware logic that is implemented in a logic array such as a programmable logic array PLA a field programmable gate array FPGA or by mask programming of integrated circuits such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC . Any of these circuits also can be implemented using a software based executable resource that is executed by a corresponding internal processor circuit such as a microprocessor circuit not shown and implemented using one or more integrated circuits where execution of executable code stored in an internal memory circuit e.g. within the memory circuit causes the integrated circuit s implementing the processor circuit to store application state variables in processor memory creating an executable application resource e.g. an application instance that performs the operations of the circuit as described herein. Hence use of the term circuit in this specification refers to both a hardware based circuit implemented using one or more integrated circuits and that includes logic for performing the described operations or a software based circuit that includes a processor circuit implemented using one or more integrated circuits the processor circuit including a reserved portion of processor memory for storage of application state data and application variables that are modified by execution of the executable code by a processor circuit. The memory circuit can be implemented for example using a non volatile memory such as a programmable read only memory PROM or an EPROM and or a volatile memory such as a DRAM etc.

Further any reference to outputting a message or outputting a packet or the like can be implemented based on creating the message packet in the form of a data structure and storing that data structure in a non transitory tangible memory medium in the disclosed apparatus e.g. in a transmit buffer . Any reference to outputting a message or outputting a packet or the like also can include electrically transmitting e.g. via wired electric current or wireless electric field as appropriate the message packet stored in the non transitory tangible memory medium to another network node via a communications medium e.g. a wired or wireless link as appropriate optical transmission also can be used as appropriate . Similarly any reference to receiving a message or receiving a packet or the like can be implemented based on the disclosed apparatus detecting the electrical or optical transmission of the message packet on the communications medium and storing the detected transmission as a data structure in a non transitory tangible memory medium in the disclosed apparatus e.g. in a receive buffer . Also note that the memory circuit can be implemented dynamically by the processor circuit for example based on memory address assignment and partitioning executed by the processor circuit .

The operations described with respect to any of the Figures can be implemented as executable code stored on a computer or machine readable non transitory tangible storage medium e.g. floppy disk hard disk ROM EEPROM nonvolatile RAM CD ROM etc. that are completed based on execution of the code by a processor circuit implemented using one or more integrated circuits the operations described herein also can be implemented as executable logic that is encoded in one or more non transitory tangible media for execution e.g. programmable logic arrays or devices field programmable gate arrays programmable array logic application specific integrated circuits etc. . Hence one or more non transitory tangible media can be encoded with logic for execution by a machine and when executed by the machine operable for the operations described herein.

In addition the operations described with respect to any of the Figures can be performed in any suitable order or at least some of the operations in parallel. Execution of the operations as described herein is by way of illustration only as such the operations do not necessarily need to be executed by the machine based hardware components as described herein to the contrary other machine based hardware components can be used to execute the disclosed operations in any appropriate order or at least some of the operations in parallel.

Referring to operation of the device interface circuit of the sensor data broker device is configured for receiving in the persistent data network a request from one or more of the sensor consumer devices . The request also can be sent by an authorized agent acting on behalf of a given sensor consumer. For example a sensor consumer device e.g. sensor consumer A can be interested in obtaining its own proprietary and private sensor data from isolated sensor devices that are deployed on behalf of the sensor consumer A . Alternately a sensor consumer device e.g. sensor consumer B can be interested in obtaining sensor data from isolated sensor devices that can be publicly advertised as available for collecting data for example the sensor consumer B e.g. a public company utility or government agency can advertise availability of the isolated sensor devices to encourage a user of a mobile collector device to download a Sensor Data Broker App of for locating the isolated sensor devices and retrieving the associated sensor data the sensor consumer B also can encourage participation by another sensor consumer C interested in consuming the sensor data where the sensor consumer can contribute in offering an incentive for acquiring the sensor data from the isolated sensor devices .

Hence one or more sensor consumer devices associated with one or more sensor consumers e.g. A B and or C can send respective requests received by the device interface circuit of the sensor data broker device via the persistent data network for the sensor data originated by one or more of the isolated sensor devices that are not reachable by the wired or wireless infrastructure .

In response to receiving the request the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device in operation is configured for performing consumer registration in response to parsing the request . For example the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device can determine that the request includes a consumer registration request for a new consumer enabling the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device to register the sensor consumer B of the sensor consumer device as a new sensor consumer with a new consumer ID e.g. Consumer ID B having a prescribed payment identifier e.g. Payment ID Acct B for issuing credits for incentives upon receipt of sensor data. As described previously the payment identifier can be used for issuing credits for various types of incentives for example cash based incentives points based incentives e.g. airline mileage points club points vendor points or virtual dollars reputation points in social organizations or gaming systems etc. or other credit schemes.

The processor circuit in operation can create a database entry e.g. a consumer entry in a sensor database of that associates the consumer identifier corresponding payment identifier and address of the sensor consumer device e.g. Consumer ID B Payment ID Acct B IPv6 ABCD B000 . The sensor database can be internal database stored within the memory circuit of the sensor data broker device or an external database that is stored within another machine directly connected to the sensor data broker device or reachable via a local or wide area network connection. The request from the same sensor consumer device or a separate request message from a different sensor consumer device associated with the consumer also can specify one or more incentive indicators i.e. incentive identifiers that identify an incentive for obtaining the sensor data from one or more of the isolated sensor device . For example a cash based incentive can specify a flat fee for a single isolated sensor device or a prescribed group of isolated sensor devices a sliding scale based on the amount of time that has lapsed since sensor data was last collected different payment classes for different sensor classes. For example a given area such as a ten thousand acre wilderness management area may have various classes of isolated sensor devices such as weather class for water temperature water level sensor devices ambient air temperature humidity sensor devices wind speed and or direction seismic class for seismic sensor devices remote traffic class for pneumatic road tube sensor devices wildlife migration class sensor devices attached to for migratory wildlife etc. .

The request from the same sensor consumer device or a separate request message from a different sensor consumer device associated with the consumer also can specify sensor registration information. For example the same request received in operation also can specify one or more isolated sensor device for sensor registration the isolated sensor devices also can be registered separately from the consumer registration for example in the case of sensor deployment following the consumer registration in operations and where the device interface circuit of the sensor data broker device receives in operation a sensor registration request message for registration of newly deployed isolated sensor devices . The request can specify individual sensor devices based on sensor identifier Sensor ID for example a unique Bluetooth LE address used by the corresponding isolated sensor device the request also can specify one or more sensor group identifiers for example a box identifier Box ID generated by a sensor manufacturer that can associate the box identifier with a prescribed range of sensor identifiers. If the sensor registration information is received in a sensor registration request message distinct from the initial request for sensor consumer registration the sensor registration request message also can identify one or more sensor consumers e.g. B .

Hence the processor circuit in operation can create or update a sensor entry in the sensor database that associates the sensor identifier and incentive indicator of each isolated sensor device with one or more consumer identifiers e.g. B of sensor consumers that participate in providing an incentive for obtaining the corresponding sensor data.

The processor circuit of the sensor data broker device in operation is configured for updating one or more of the sensor entries in the sensor database in response to the device interface circuit receiving in operation any new or updated location information received from any sensor consumer device and or any mobile collector device having collected sensor data. The request and or the subsequently received sensor registration message can optionally specify location information for one or more of the isolated sensor device that enables the processor circuit in operation to register location information for the path before during or after deployment.

In one example the device interface circuit in operation can receive one or more of the sensor entries in the sensor database in response to receiving a shipment identifier Shipment ID for an identifiable group of box identifiers Box IDs enabling the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device to identify in operation the isolated sensor devices based on accessing the sensor manufacturer or distributor to determine the range of sensor identifiers based on the box identifier the location information can be based on the shipment identifier indicating shipment or deployment to a prescribed destination for example an identifier park nature preserve mountain range etc.

In another example the device interface circuit in operation can receive sensor specific location information in response to specific sensor deployment for example rural customers residential customers of a heating oil company of a sensor consumer B of the sensor consumer device can respond to a mass mailing of sensor devices by posting an isolated sensor device on their property e.g. a temperature sensor where a rural customer having received an isolated sensor device can call a prescribed toll free number assigned to sensor consumer B and enter their customer identifier and sensor identifier enabling the sensor consumer B to associate the rural customer address as the sensor location for the identified isolated sensor device . Alternately an employee of the sensor consumer B can input one or more location identifiers for installed isolated sensor device following deployment by the employee. In another example no location information may be initially available for example in the case of a broadcast deployment involving a free give away at a trade show or another public venue or deployment based on depositing the isolated sensor devices as floating sensor devices within a moving body of water such as a river.

At a minimum the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device in operation can update the sensor database to associate a consumer entry specifying consumer identifier and payment identifier of a sensor consumer of a sensor consumer device with one or more sensor entries specifying at least a sensor identifier and payment identifier . If available the processor circuit also updates a sensor entry to include a location identifier that identifies the location information for the sensor as apparent from the foregoing the initial location identifier may either be non existent or for a very large geographic region such as a ten thousand acre wilderness management area. Hence the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device can associate at least a first of the sensor consumers B with requesting the sensor data from the isolated sensor devices within an identifiable region based on the location information for the incentive identified by the incentive indicator.

Referring to the user of a mobile collector device can cause the processor circuit to download and install in operation a sensor data broker app while the mobile collector device is within the wired or wireless infrastructure enabling the mobile collector device to reach a download server e.g. sensor data broker device or other server providing the sensor data broker app . The processor circuit executing the sensor data broker app in the mobile collector device can generate a registration message that identifies the user by user identifier and the mobile collector device by MCD identifier such as allocated telephone number and or IP address the device interface circuit and or the Wi Fi transceiver circuit of the mobile collector device can output the registration message while within the coverage area of the wired or wireless infrastructure enabling the device interface circuit of the sensor data broker device to receive the registration message via the persistent data network . The registration message also can optionally include location information for example based on an IP address of the wireless gateway providing the wired or wireless infrastructure and or GPS coordinates detected by the GPS receiver circuit of the wired or wireless infrastructure .

In response to the device interface circuit of the sensor data broker device receiving the registration message the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device in operation can create or update a user entry in the sensor database that associates the user identifier MCD identifier and optionally MCD location with an identifiable user account established for receiving incentive credits.

In response to the request the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device can generate and send in operation a message i.e. the sensor incentive message to the mobile collector device via the persistent data network and the wired or wireless infrastructure . The processor circuit of the sensor data broker device can send the sensor incentive message to the mobile collector device in response to registration of the mobile collector device in operation the sensor incentive message also can be sent without registration by the mobile collector device for example in response to the mobile collector device accessing an advertised website listing the availability of incentives and or locations of the isolated sensor devices etc. Hence the user registration also can be executed following collection of sensor data described below.

Assuming the sensor data broker device receives location information about the mobile collector device the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device also can select from among the available isolated sensor device identified in the sensor database based on a determined correlation between the determined location of the mobile collector device and the respective identified locations of the isolated sensor device . For example the processor circuit can limit the identification of the isolated sensor device to sensor devices to within a prescribed distance for example within a two hundred 200 mile radius of the current location of the mobile collector device within the wired or wireless infrastructure other filters can be applied to limit the identification of the isolated sensor device for example sensor type user type public user employee etc. user interest e.g. hiker fisherman hunter bird watcher botanist etc. . The sensor incentive message also can specify one or more isolated sensor devices having unknown sensor locations that can be advertised as part of a treasure hunt where the incentive can have a corresponding higher treasure hunt value.

In response to the device interface circuit e.g. and or a USB transceiver of the mobile collector device in operation receiving the sensor incentive message the processor circuit of the mobile collector device can store the instructions from the received sensor incentive message in the memory circuit of the mobile collector device including for example sensor identifier incentive indicator and or optionally sensor location identifier . The storage of the information in the sensor incentive message in the memory circuit enables the mobile collector device in operation to disconnect from the wired or wireless infrastructure for example as the user of the mobile collector device travels to a remote location containing the isolated sensor devices for example a segment of the Appalachian Trail spanning approximately 2 200 miles across Georgia to Maine. Although disconnected from the wired or wireless infrastructure the mobile collector device can detect GPS signals via its GPS receiver circuit enabling the sensor data broker app executed by the processor circuit to display nearby isolated sensor devices as the mobile collector device moves along a path containing identifiable isolated sensor devices .

The processor circuit of the mobile collector device can determine the current detected position displayed in the map based on GPS signals received from the GPS receiver circuit . The displayed sensor identifier can be a true identifier assigned by the sensor consumer device e.g. EPA 16552 illustrated in or a logical identifier assigned by the execution state e.g. the numerical identifiers 1 2 3 as appropriate. The incentive indicator which indicates an incentive for obtaining the sensor data originated by the corresponding identified isolated sensor device can be displayed in various forms based on the incentive type for example currency 1.20 for one dollar and twenty cents or number of points miles game credits etc. The identified sensor location can be illustrated as a sensor icon on the map . The direction information can specify information for locating the isolated sensor device relative to the current detected position for example distance and or direction based on any appropriate vector based coordinate system e.g. 30 feet at 190 degrees true for sensor 1 375 feet at 90 degrees true for sensor 2 400 feet at 310 degrees true for sensor 3 or map based system e.g. 30 feet on trail 1 for sensor 1 375 feet at trail 2 for sensor 2 400 feet on trail 7 for sensor 3 . Hence the execution state generating the map of identified sensor locations enables the mobile collector device to direct a user toward the identified isolated sensor devices .

The mobile collector device in operation establishes a local data connection with one or more isolated sensor devices for example a wired e.g. USB connection or a wireless connection e.g. Bluetooth or Wi Fi or infrared . For example the low power device interface circuit of the mobile collector device in operation can detect an isolated sensor device as the mobile collector device moves within wireless proximity range of the isolated sensor device and the low power device interface circuit in response can establish a wireless connection with one or more isolated sensor devices e.g. sensor 1 EPA16552 while within the wireless proximity range . The processor circuit of the mobile collector device can respond to the wireless connection by retrieving stored sensor data and optionally sensor metadata from the isolated sensor device e.g. sensor 1 EPA16552 . The sensor data and or the sensor metadata can be stored within a secure data container or secure container e.g. encrypted within the secure data container that is otherwise inaccessible by the mobile collector device alternately a portion of the sensor data and or the sensor metadata can be unencrypted enabling the processor circuit of the mobile collector device to display the unsecured portions of the sensor data or the sensor metadata for use and enjoyment of the user of the mobile collector device as illustrated in .

The processor circuit of the mobile collector device in operation can store the received sensor data and sensor metadata in the memory circuit of the mobile collector device and generate an execution state in that can selectively display an sensor data or sensor metadata that includes a sensor pickup icon and that provides visual notification of receiving sensor data from an isolated sensor device identified by its sensor identifier . Other sensor metadata generated by the isolated sensor device can be received from the isolated sensor device by the mobile collector device including for example sensor identifier e.g. EPA16552 of sensor detection time sensor status e.g. battery level device health or device alarms sensor location identifier as determined by isolated sensor device etc. As illustrated in the sensor data illustrates river height levels in feet with the sensor metadata illustrating respective sensor detection times by year month and date .

In response to receiving the sensor data and the sensor metadata from the isolated sensor device in operation the processor circuit of the mobile collector device in operation can create collection metadata associated with the collection or retrieving of the sensor data and sensor metadata from the corresponding isolated sensor device example collection metadata can include collection time and or collection location based on the GPS signals received by the GPS receiver circuit collected data size user identifier User ID for the user of the mobile collector device etc. The processor circuit in operation can store the collection metadata with the sensor data and sensor metadata associated with the connection with the corresponding isolated sensor device . Hence in operation the sensor data the sensor metadata and the collection metadata can be stored in the memory circuit by the execution state on a per sensor device basis.

The overall interaction of the mobile collector device with the isolated sensor device can be under the control of the sensor data broker app executed by the processor circuit in operations and . The operations and can be repeated for each isolated sensor device as the user travels along the path .

Referring to and the mobile collector device can forward the sensor information for one or more of the isolated sensor devices including the sensor data sensor metadata and collection metadata stored in the memory circuit after having traveled the path disconnecting from all the isolated sensor devices and reconnecting to a wired or wireless infrastructure or at event . In particular the device interface circuit or of the mobile collector device can detect the wired or wireless infrastructure or and in response reconnect to the wired or wireless infrastructure in operation to establish reachability to the sensor data broker device . The sensor data broker app executed by the processor circuit in operation can establish a secure data connection with the sensor data broker device and forward the sensor information for all the isolated sensor devices detected along the path .

In response to the device interface circuit of the sensor data broker device receiving the sensor information from the sensor data broker app executed in the mobile collector device the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device in operation can update the sensor entries in the sensor database with the sensor data sensor metadata and collection data including for example updating the sensor location based on the collection location and updating the collection time based on the collection metadata collected in operation . The processor circuit of the sensor data broker device in operation also can cause one or more of the sensor consumer devices to obtain any portion of the sensor information stored in the sensor database for one or more of the isolated sensor devices e.g. the sensor data the sensor metadata and or the collection metadata for example based on sending a notification that the sensor entries for respective identified isolated sensor devices have been updated. One or more of the sensor consumer devices e.g. B can respond to the notification by retrieving the sensor information for one or more of the identified isolated sensor devices from the for example as part of a database update that includes the sensor consumer device and or the sensor database generating an acknowledgement that the sensor consumer device has received the sensor information including the sensor data the sensor metadata and or the collection metadata.

In response to the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device detecting in operation an acknowledgement e.g. from the sensor consumer device that the sensor consumer device has obtained the sensor information including the sensor data the sensor metadata and or the collection metadata the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device in operation can send a credit message to the mobile collector device via the persistent data network and the wired or wireless infrastructure or alternately the processor circuit of the sensor data broker device can output the credit message in operation in response to detecting the sensor data broker device has received the sensor information without the necessity of any communication the sensor consumer device e.g. no acknowledgement needed from the sensor consumer device .

In response to the device interface circuit of the mobile collector device receiving in operation the notification of credit for the one or more incentives based on forwarding the sensor information the sensor data broker app executed by the mobile collector device can display that the user of the mobile collector device has been issued a credit for the one or more incentives associated with the isolated sensor devices detected by the mobile collector device along the path . The processor circuit of the sensor data broker device in operation also can respond to the update of the sensor entries in the sensor database by outputting updated sensor incentive messages advertising updated incentives based on the updated locations and or updated collection times.

According to example embodiments users of mobile collector devices can be directed toward isolated sensor devices based on sensor incentive messages output from a sensor data broker device on behalf of sensor consumer devices that are unable to access the isolated sensor devices via any wired or wireless network connection. Hence owners or managers of the isolated sensor devices can cause the sensor data broker device to advertise incentives to owners of mobile collector devices enabling a scalable merging of IoT based technology with wide area network based technology based on directed collection of sensor data using secured collection between the mobile collector devices and the isolated sensor devices even if the owners of the mobile collector devices are untrusted third parties. Since the users of the mobile collector devices may be untrusted third parties the sensor information or any portion thereof can be transported in secure data containers that can protect privacy for the sensor information and or maintain data integrity for the sensor information. The example embodiments can provide an accelerated acquisition of sensor information from IoT sensor devices deployed worldwide that eliminates the necessity of dedicated data acquisition personnel.
