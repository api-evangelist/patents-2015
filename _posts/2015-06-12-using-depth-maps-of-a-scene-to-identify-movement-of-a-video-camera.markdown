title: Using depth maps of a scene to identify movement of a video camera
abstract: A process recomputes zones for a scene. The process is performed at a computing device having one or more processors and memory. The memory stores one or more programs configured for execution by the one or more processors. The process receives a first image of a scene taken by an array of image sensors of a camera system at a first time and receives designation from a user of a zone within the first image. The process also receives a second image of the scene taken by the array of image sensors at a second time that is after the first time. The process compares the first and second images to identify movement of the camera and notifies the user about a change to the zone when the camera has moved.
