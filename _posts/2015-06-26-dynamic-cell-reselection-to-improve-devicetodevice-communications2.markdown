title: Dynamic cell reselection to improve device-to-device communications
abstract: The disclosure generally relates to dynamic cell reselection to improve device-to-device (D2D) communications where two or more D2D peers are camped onto different cells and one or more D2D peers are located in an overlap region between the cells. For example, in various embodiments, the D2D peers may exchange one or more communication parameters over the (inter-cell) D2D connection and detect that the D2D peers are camped on different base stations (i.e., attached to different cells) based on the exchanged communication parameters. The D2D peer(s) located in the cell overlap region may then obtain measurements on the neighbor cell and a forced cell reselection may be triggered at the appropriate D2D peer(s) located in the cell overlap region such that the D2D peers are camped on the same base station, thereby converting the inter-cell D2D connection into an intra-cell D2D connection that can be more easily maintained.

The various aspects and embodiments described herein generally relate to device to device D2D communication and in particular to dynamically reselecting a new cell while engaged in a D2D communication session in which at least one peer device is located in a cell overlap region to improve D2D communication performance.

Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content including voice video packet data messaging and broadcast among many others. Wireless communication systems e.g. multiple access networks that can share available network resources to support multiple users have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks and third generation 3G and fourth generation 4G high speed data Internet capable wireless services. There are presently many different wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Example cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA Orthogonal FDMA OFDMA Single Carrier FDMA SC FDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM TDMA variation and newer hybrid digital communication systems that use both TDMA and CDMA technologies. More recently Long Term Evolution LTE has been developed as a wireless communication protocol for wireless communication of high speed data for mobile phones and other data terminals. LTE is based on GSM and includes contributions from various GSM related protocols e.g. Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS protocols e.g. High Speed Packet Access HSPA .

In general a wireless communication network may include various base stations also referred to as evolved node Bs eNBs or access nodes that can support communication for various user equipments UEs . In a WAN a UE typically communicates via uplink downlink channels between the UE and a base station to thereby communicate with the base station. However if two or more UEs are in within sufficient proximity to one another the UEs may be enabled to communicate directly that is without communicating through any base station. A UE may therefore support direct peer to peer P2P or device to device D2D communication with one or more other UEs. For example LTE Direct LTE D sometimes also referred to as LTE Advanced is a proposed 3GPP Release 12 D2D solution for proximate discovery. LTE D dispenses with location tracking and network calls by directly monitoring for services on other LTE Direct devices within a large range 500 m line of sight . Accordingly among other advantages LTE D can directly monitor for services on other LTE D devices in a synchronous system and concurrently detect potentially thousands of services in proximity in a continuous and battery efficient manner.

LTE D operates on licensed spectrum as a service to mobile applications and provides D2D solution that enables service layer discovery. Mobile applications on LTE D devices can instruct LTE D to monitor for mobile application services on other devices and announce their own services at the physical layer for detection by services on other LTE D devices which allows the applications to be closed while LTE D does the work in a substantially continuous manner and notifies the client application when a match to the monitor is detected. Accordingly LTE D is an attractive alternative to mobile developers seeking to deploy proximate discovery solutions to extend their existing services. For example LTE D is a distributed discovery solution versus the centralized discovery that exists today whereby mobile applications may forego centralized database processing in identifying relevancy matches because relevance may instead be determined autonomously at the device level via transmitting and monitoring for relevant attributes. LTE D offers additional power consumption benefits because LTE D does not perpetually track location to determine proximity and privacy benefits because discovery may be kept on the device such that users have more control over information shared with external devices.

Furthermore LTE D can increase network efficiency because devices communicate directly using cellular spectrum without utilizing the cellular network infrastructure. As such because LTE D uses licensed cellular spectrum cellular coverage can be extended and interference from other devices can be controlled unlike D2D communication in unlicensed bands . Accordingly LTE D may use direct connections to transfer substantial data between LTE D enabled devices that are within sufficient proximity thereby offloading traffic from the network infrastructure. Moreover in addition to allowing high data transfer rates LTE D offers low delays and low energy consumption at the UEs communicating over an LTE D link. Furthermore LTE D offers applications in national security and public safety networks because LTE provides high data rates that can enable real time data and multimedia exchange between emergency personnel in crisis situations and the D2D functionality can improve performance in LTE based public safety networks in the event that the LTE infrastructure may be totally or partially disabled e.g. in disaster scenarios such as earthquakes hurricanes terrorist attacks etc. .

Accordingly techniques to efficiently support D2D communication are desired to enable new services improve existing services eliminate and or reduce interference and or reduce traffic load on network infrastructures among other things.

According to various aspects the disclosure generally relates to dynamic cell reselection to improve device to device D2D communications where two or more D2D peers are camped onto different cells and one or more D2D peers are located in an overlap region between the cells. For example in various embodiments the D2D peers may exchange one or more communication parameters over the inter cell D2D connection and detect that the D2D peers are camped on different base stations i.e. attached to different cells based on the exchanged communication parameters. The D2D peer s located in the cell overlap region may then obtain measurements on the neighbor cell and a forced cell reselection may be triggered at the appropriate D2D peer s located in the cell overlap region such that the D2D peers are camped on the same base station thereby converting the inter cell D2D connection into an intra cell D2D connection such that proximity services between the D2D peers can be more easily maintained and the D2D peers may not be forced to revert to more inefficient legacy links with their respective base stations.

As shown the EPS network architecture provides packet switched services however those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the various concepts disclosed herein may be extended to networks that provide circuit switched services.

In various embodiments implementation the E UTRAN may include a first evolved Node B eNB in communication with UE and a second eNB eNB in communication with UE. The eNBs may provide user and control plane protocol terminations toward the UEs and may be connected to each other via a backhaul e.g. an X2 interface . The eNBs may also be referred to as base stations Node Bs access points base transceiver stations radio base stations radio transceivers transceiver functions a basic service set BSS an extended service set ESS or some other suitable terminology. The eNBs each provide an access point to the EPC for the respective UEs . Example UEs may include without limitation a cellular phone a smart phone a session initiation protocol SIP phone a laptop a personal digital assistant PDA a satellite radio a global positioning system a multimedia device a video device a digital audio player e.g. MP3 player a camera a game console a tablet or any other similar functioning device. Furthermore those skilled in the art will appreciate that the UE and or UE may also be referred to as a mobile station a subscriber station a mobile unit a subscriber unit a wireless unit a remote unit a mobile device a wireless device a wireless communications device a remote device a mobile subscriber station an access terminal a mobile terminal a wireless terminal a remote terminal a handset a user agent a mobile client a client etc.

The eNBs may each connect to the EPC via an Si interface wherein the EPC may include a Mobility Management Entity MME other MMEs a Serving Gateway a Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service MBMS Gateway a Broadcast Multicast Service Center BM SC and a Packet Data Network PDN Gateway . The MME is the control node that processes the signaling between the UEs and the EPC . Generally the MME provides bearer and connection management. All user IP packets are transferred through the Serving Gateway which may be connected to the PDN Gateway . The PDN Gateway provides UE IP address allocation as well as other functions. The PDN Gateway is connected to the Operator IP Services which may include the Internet an intranet an IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS and a PS Streaming Service PSS . The BM SC may provide functions for MBMS user service provisioning and delivery.

The MBMS Gateway may be used to distribute MBMS traffic to the eNBs e.g. belonging to a Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network MBSFN area broadcasting a particular service and may be responsible for session management start stop and for collecting eMBMS related charging information.

In various embodiments a UE pair e.g. UE and UE may establish a device to device D2D connection to communicate directly without utilizing the respective eNB and eNB and subsequently transfer data traffic over the D2D connection. In general one or more entities in the network infrastructure e.g. eNBs entities in the EPC etc. may coordinate the D2D communication between the UE pair in that the network entities may assist in establishing the D2D connection control use in a D2D mode versus a legacy mode provide security support etc. As used herein the term D2D mode and variants thereof may generally refer to direct communication between two or more UEs and the term legacy mode and variants thereof may generally refer to communication between two or more UEs via the network e.g. via the eNBs . In various embodiments the UE pair may establish the D2D mode autonomously wherein initial discovery and establishing the D2D connection may be based on an ability to communicate signals directly between the UEs . Additionally or in the alternative UEs that are attached to a network that does not support the D2D mode but permits the D2D mode the UEs may connect via the network and exchange serving cell and location information to determine whether the D2D mode is possible. Once the D2D mode is in progress one or more UEs may monitor relative locations associated therewith. Furthermore a group including three or more UEs may enter D2D mode whereby some or all UE pairs in the group may maintain direct D2D communication between one another and whereby some UEs in the group may act as relays to relay D2D communication between other UEs in the group. For example one UE in the group may be designated to operate in a relay role to maintain direct D2D communication with the other UE s in the group and act in a relay role in order to enable the other UE s to communicate indirectly via D2D communication. In this example the UE operating in the relay role may relay communications between the other UE s in the group. A group that includes several UEs employing D2D communication between one another may monitor relative locations associated therewith and assign and or reassign the relay role to any UE in the group based on the current relative locations associated therewith.

Returning to in another aspect the network may assist the two or more UEs to enter the D2D mode in cases where the legacy mode may be unavailable and or impossible e.g. if the network is congested or portions thereof have temporarily failed or do not provide continuous radio coverage to both UEs . In another aspect the network e.g. one or more network entities may control entry to the D2D mode and support handover between the D2D mode and legacy mode.

According to various aspects illustrates an exemplary access network in an LTE network and in which certain devices may communicate over a direct device to device D2D connection using LTE Direct LTE D while also connecting to a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN or other LTE network infrastructure. Referring to an application server or network controller may be connected to a first cell having a first base station a second cell having a second base station and the application server may be further coupled to the first base stations and the second base station via a network link e.g. an Rx link a Gx link etc. . The coverage area associated with a given base station is represented via the cell in which the given base station is located whereby in the first cell includes the coverage area corresponding to the first base station and the second cell includes the coverage area corresponding to the second base station . The cells in the access network include various UEs that communicate with the respective base stations and with the application server via the respective base stations . For example in the first cell includes UE UE and UE while the second cell includes UE UE and UE wherein one or more of the UEs in the access network may be mobile or stationary. Although not shown in the base stations may be connected to one another via a backhaul link.

According to various aspects one or more of UE UE UE UE UE and UE may support direct device to device D2D whereby such UEs may support communicating with one another directly without having to communicate through another device or a network infrastructure element such as the first base station and the second base station and may further support communications through the network infrastructure elements such as the first base station and or the second base station . In legacy communications that involve network infrastructure signals may generally be transmitted and received through uplink and downlink connections between various UEs and the base stations such as link in the first cell and link in the second cell wherein the base stations each generally serve as the attachment point for the UEs in the corresponding cells and facilitate communications between the UEs served therein. In accordance with various aspects when two or more UEs such as UE and UE wish to communicate with one another and are located in sufficient proximity to each other then a direct D2D link can be established therebetween which may offload traffic from the base station serving the UEs allow the UEs to communicate more efficiently or provide other advantages that will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

As shown in the UE can communicate with UE through intermediate base station via link and UEs may further communicate via a D2D link . Furthermore for inter cell communications where the participating UEs are in different nearby cells a direct D2D communications link is still a possibility which is illustrated in where UE and UE may communicate using direct D2D communications illustrated by dashed link . However in an LTE Direct LTE D supported network where UEs in different nearby cells can form a direct D2D connection certain problems may arise when the D2D peer UEs are camped onto different base stations e.g. in a cell overlap region as in the case where UE and UE are camped onto different cells . In particular certain measurement difficulties in maintaining the D2D connection between the peer UEs may arise whereby the proximity services therebetween may be lost and the UEs will be forced to use the legacy link with respective base stations for various data and signaling communications which may be inefficient for several reasons. For example reverting to the legacy link may result in unnecessary resource consumption at the base stations which can lead to resource constraints and impact the throughput associated with other UEs that are attached to the same base station s . Furthermore unnecessary power consumption can occur at the UEs in that the UEs may need to transmit at high power to close the loop with the respective base stations relative to the proximity D2D link. Accordingly as will be described in further detail below the above mentioned problems may be alleviated via dynamically triggering a forced cell reselection at either UE or UE such that the UE moves to the same cell as the peer UE when residing in the cell overlap region thereby facilitating the proximity services and maintaining an intra cell D2D link between the UEs . Accordingly UEs may communicate efficiently via the intra cell D2D link without consuming substantial network resources which may allow other users in the same network to be allocated more resource blocks from the base stations and thereby achieve high throughput.

For example the various data and signaling issues that may arise when UEs camped onto different cells are engaged in a D2D communication session will become clearer with reference to and which respectively illustrate an exemplary downlink DL frame structure in LTE and an exemplary uplink UL frame structure in LTE.

More particularly referring to the DL frame structure in LTE may divide a ten millisecond 10 ms frame into ten 10 equally sized sub frames . Each sub frame may include two 2 consecutive time slots . A resource grid may be used to represent two time slots wherein each time slot includes a resource block RB . In LTE the resource grid may be divided into multiple resource elements. Further in LTE a RB may contain twelve 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain and for a normal cyclic prefix in each OFDM symbol seven 7 consecutive OFDM symbols in the time domain or eighty four 84 resource elements. For an extended cyclic prefix a resource block may contain six 6 consecutive OFDM symbols in the time domain and may have seventy two 72 resource elements. A physical DL control channel PDCCH a physical DL shared channel PD SCH and other channels may be mapped to the resource elements. Furthermore some resource elements as indicated as R include DL reference signals DL RS which may include Cell specific reference signals CRS also sometimes called common RS and UE specific reference signals UE RS . In general the UE RS may be transmitted only on the resource blocks upon which the corresponding PD SCH is mapped. The number of bits that each resource element carries may vary depending on the modulation scheme. Accordingly the more RBs that an eNB allocates to a UE and the higher the modulation scheme the higher the data rate for the UE.

In LTE Direct e.g. D2D communications in an LTE environment and as applicable to D2D communications as described herein scheduling D2D communication links may be performed through distributed scheduling. In one aspect a request to send RTS clear to send CTS handshake signaling may be performed before each device in a D2D pair attempts to communicate data over a D2D communications link. In LTE Direct LTE D 24 RBs may be available for RTS CTS signaling. Further in LTE D a RB may be assigned as a RTS block and another RB may be assigned as a CTS block for each D2D communication link. In other words each D2D communication link may use a RB pair for RTS CTS signaling. As used herein the RB pair may be referred to as a connection identifier CID . As such in the above mentioned scenarios where two or more UEs that have a D2D connection are camped onto different cells the eNB associated with each cell may allocate at least some resource blocks to the respective UEs camped therein which may reduce the resource blocks available to allocate to other UEs in the respective cells. However if one or more of the D2D peer UE s that are present within an overlap region between the different cells were to perform a forced reselection or otherwise move to the same cell as the other peer UE s associated with the D2D connection the eNB in the original cell could allocate more resource blocks to other UEs in the original cell that are not involved in the D2D communication i.e. from the resource blocks that no longer need to be allocated to the UE s that moved away from the original cell such that the other UEs that are still in the original cell may experience higher data dates and or throughput.

Referring now to the uplink UL frame structure in LTE may partition the available resource blocks on the UL into a data section and a control section. The control section may be formed at the two edges of the system bandwidth and may have a configurable size. The resource blocks in the control section may be assigned to UEs for transmission of control information. The data section may include all resource blocks not included in the control section. The UL frame structure may result in the data section including contiguous subcarriers which may allow a single UE to be assigned all of the contiguous subcarriers in the data section.

A UE may be assigned resource blocks in the control section to transmit control information to an eNB. The UE may also be assigned resource blocks in the data section to transmit data to the eNB. The UE may transmit control information in a physical UL control channel PUCCH on the assigned resource blocks in the control section. The UE may transmit only data or both data and control information in a physical UL shared channel PUSCH on the assigned resource blocks in the data section. A UL transmission may span both slots of a subframe and may hop across frequency.

A set of resource blocks may be used to perform initial system access and achieve UL synchronization in a physical random access channel PRACH . The PRACH may carry a random sequence and may not carry any UL data signaling. In an aspect a RACH sequence may be reserved for communications of ACK NACK information from a UE while in idle mode. Each random access preamble may occupy a bandwidth corresponding to six consecutive resource blocks. The starting frequency may be specified by the network. That is the transmission of the random access preamble may be restricted to certain time and frequency resources. There may be no frequency hopping for the PRACH. The PRACH attempt may be carried in one subframe 1 ms or a few contiguous subframes and a UE may make only a single PRACH attempt per frame 10 ms .

In context with the above mentioned scenario s where two or more LTE D peer UEs are camped onto different cells and therefore have one or more inter cell LTE D connections performing D2D signal measurements and maintaining the LTE D connection may be difficult especially when the respective cells to which the LTE D peers are attached are not synchronized. Moreover the inter cell LTE D connection may result in additional UL signaling traffic because multiple cells are involved in the signal measurements that the respective peer UEs need to perform in order to maintain the D2D connection. However if one peer UE were to perform a forced reselection or otherwise move to the neighboring cell i.e. the cell to which the other peer UE is attached the inter cell D2D connection becomes an intra cell D2D connection such that only one cell is involved in the signal measurements that the respective peer UEs perform to maintain the D2D connection because the peer UEs would be attached to the same cell. Accordingly any synchronization issues and or other problems that may have existed due to the peer UEs being camped onto different cells may be substantially eliminated and the LTE D peer UEs may perform the necessary D2D measurements and maintain the LTE D connection more easily. Furthermore maintaining the D2D connection according to the approach whereby one or more peer UEs perform a forced reselection to the same cell as the other peer UE s such that the peer UEs may each be attached to the same cell and thereby efficiently use D2D communications offload certain UL and DL data traffic from the cellular network e.g. in the original cell s attain higher throughputs and further permit other UEs in the cellular network to attain higher throughputs.

According to various aspects illustrates an exemplary user plane and control plane radio protocol architecture for the user and control planes in LTE to support radio communication between a UE and a UE via an eNB SWG and PDN Gateway . Furthermore in various embodiments those skilled in the art sill appreciate that substantially the same and or similar signaling to that described herein may occur between an eNB SWG and PDN Gateway supporting UE not shown . In various embodiments the UE shown in may correspond to UE and UE may correspond to UE as depicted in . In a similar respect eNB may correspond to eNB in SWG may correspond to SWG in and PDN Gateway may correspond to PDN Gateway in . As noted above further entities that are not shown in may be present to convey user plane signaling between PDN Gateway and UE e.g. an eNB SWG PDN Gateway etc. .

In various embodiments the radio protocol architecture for the UE and the eNB is shown with three layers Layer 1 Layer 2 and Layer 3. Communication of data signaling may occur between UE and eNB across the three layers. Layer 1 L1 layer is the lowest layer and implements various physical layer signal processing functions. The L1 layer may also be referred to as the physical layer . Layer 2 L2 layer is above the physical layer and is responsible for the link between the UE and eNB over the physical layer .

In the user plane associated with UE the L2 layer includes a media access control MAC sublayer a radio link control RLC sublayer and a packet data convergence protocol PDCP sublayer which are terminated at the eNB on the network side. The UE may have several upper layers above the L2 layer including a network layer e.g. IP layer that may correspond to a layer 3 and that is terminated at the PDN Gateway on the network side and an application layer that is terminated at the other end of the connection e.g. far end UE server etc. .

The PDCP sublayer provides multiplexing between different radio bearers and logical channels. The PDCP sublayer also provides header compression for upper layer data packets to reduce radio transmission overhead security by ciphering the data packets and handover support for UEs between eNBs. The RLC sublayer provides segmentation and reassembly of upper layer data packets retransmission of lost data packets and reordering of data packets to compensate for out of order reception due to hybrid automatic repeat request HARQ . The MAC sublayer provides multiplexing between logical and transport channels. The MAC sublayer is also responsible for allocating the various radio resources e.g. resource blocks in one cell among the UEs. The MAC sublayer is also responsible for HARQ operations. In an operational aspect user plane signaling from UE e.g. MAC layer signaling RLC layer signaling and PDCP layer signaling may be conveyed across the network using other protocol layers such as some level 2 L2 protocol a user datagram protocol IP UDP IP and general packet radio service GPRS tunneling protocol user plane GTP U .

In the control plane the radio protocol architecture for the UE and eNB is substantially the same for the physical layer and the L2 layer with the exception that there is no header compression function for the control plane. The control plane also includes a radio resource control RRC sublayer in Layer 3 L3 layer . The RRC sublayer is responsible for obtaining radio resources i.e. radio bearers and for configuring the lower layers using RRC signaling between the eNB and the UE .

According to various aspects illustrates an exemplary LTE network entity e.g. eNB MME PDN Gateway CSCF etc. in direct or indirect communication with an exemplary UE wherein the UE may be UE or in and the LTE network entity may be any of the entities associated with the E UTRAN EPC etc. in . On the downlink DL upper layer packets from the core network are provided to a controller processor that implements the functionality of the L2 layer. In the DL the controller processor provides header compression ciphering packet segmentation and reordering multiplexing between logical and transport channels and radio resource allocations to the UE based on various priority metrics. The controller processor is also responsible for HARQ operations retransmission of lost packets and signaling to the UE .

The transmit TX processor implements various signal processing functions for the L1 layer i.e. physical layer . The signal processing functions includes coding and interleaving to facilitate forward error correction FEC at the UE and mapping to signal constellations based on various modulation schemes e.g. binary phase shift keying BPSK quadrature phase shift keying QPSK M phase shift keying M PSK M quadrature amplitude modulation M QAM . The coded and modulated symbols are then split into parallel streams. Each stream is then mapped to an OFDM subcarrier multiplexed with a reference signal e.g. pilot in the time and or frequency domain and then combined together using an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform IFFT to produce a physical channel carrying a time domain OFDM symbol stream. The OFDM stream is spatially precoded to produce multiple spatial streams. Channel estimates from a channel estimator may be used to determine the coding and modulation scheme as well as for spatial processing. The channel estimate may be derived from a reference signal and or channel condition feedback transmitted by the UE . Each spatial stream is then provided to a different antenna via a separate transmitter TX . Each transmitter TX modulates an RF carrier with a respective spatial stream for transmission.

At the UE each receiver RX receives a signal through a respective antenna . Each receiver RX recovers information modulated onto an RF carrier and provides the information to the receive RX processor . The RX processor implements various signal processing functions of the L1 layer. The RX processor performs spatial processing on the information to recover any spatial streams destined for the UE . If multiple spatial streams are destined for the UE they may be combined by the RX processor into a single OFDM symbol stream. The RX processor then converts the OFDM symbol stream from the time domain to the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform FFT . The frequency domain signal comprises a separate OFDM symbol stream for each subcarrier of the OFDM signal. The symbols on each subcarrier and the reference signal is recovered and demodulated by determining the most likely signal constellation points transmitted by the LTE network entity . These soft decisions may be based on channel estimates computed by the channel estimator . The soft decisions are then decoded and deinterleaved to recover the data and control signals that were originally transmitted by the LTE network entity on the physical channel. The data and control signals are then provided to the controller processor .

The controller processor implements the L2 layer wherein the controller processor can be associated with a memory that stores program codes and data. The memory may be referred to as a computer readable medium. In the UL the controller processor provides demultiplexing between transport and logical channels packet reassembly deciphering header decompression control signal processing to recover upper layer packets from the core network. The upper layer packets are then provided to a data sink which represents all the protocol layers above the L2 layer. Various control signals may also be provided to the data sink for L3 processing. The controller processor is also responsible for error detection using an acknowledgement ACK and or negative acknowledgement NACK protocol to support HARQ operations.

In the UL direction a data source in UE is used to provide upper layer packets to the controller processor . The data source represents all protocol layers above the L2 layer. Similar to the functionality described in connection with the DL transmission by the LTE network entity the controller processor implements the L2 layer for the user plane and the control plane by providing header compression ciphering packet segmentation and reordering and multiplexing between logical and transport channels based on radio resource allocations by the LTE network entity . The controller processor is also responsible for HARQ operations retransmission of lost packets and signaling to the LTE network entity .

Channel estimates derived by a channel estimator from a reference signal or feedback transmitted by the LTE network entity may be used by the TX processor to select the appropriate coding and modulation schemes and to facilitate spatial processing. The spatial streams generated by the TX processor are provided to different antenna via separate transmitters TX . Each transmitter TX modulates an RF carrier with a respective spatial stream for transmission.

The UL transmission is processed at the LTE network entity in a manner similar to that described in connection with the receiver function at the UE . Each receiver RX receives a signal through a respective antenna . Each receiver RX recovers information modulated onto an RF carrier and provides the information to a RX processor . The RX processor may implement the L1 layer.

According to various aspects and illustrate an exemplary wireless network in which forced cell reselection may be triggered at a UE engaged in a D2D communication session to improve D2D communication wherein the forced reselection procedure may have particular application in a network that supports LTE Direct D2D communication. In particular as described above LTE Direct LTE D sometimes referred to as LTE Advanced is a proposed 3GPP Release 12 device to device D2D solution for proximate discovery. LTE D dispenses with location tracking and network calls by directly monitoring for services on other LTE D devices within a large range 500 m line of sight doing so continuously in a synchronous system that offers battery efficiency and the ability to concurrently detect thousands of services in proximity. LTE D has a wider range than other D2D P2P technologies such as Wi Fi Direct WFD or Bluetooth and operates on licensed spectrum as a service to mobile applications. LTE D is a D2D solution that enables service layer discovery and also D2D communication wherein mobile applications on LTE D devices can instruct LTE D to monitor for mobile application services on other devices and announce locally available services for detection by services on other LTE D devices at the physical layer which allows the applications to close while LTE D does the work in a substantially continuous manner and notifies the client application when a match to a monitor established by an associated application is detected. For example the application can establish a monitor for tennis events and the LTE D discovery layer can wake up the application when a tennis related LTE D message is detected. LTE D is thus an attractive alternative to mobile developers seeking to deploy proximate discovery solutions as extensions of their existing cloud services. LTE D is a distributed discovery solution versus the centralized discovery that exists today whereby mobile applications forego centralized database processing in identifying relevancy matches instead autonomously determining relevance at the device level by transmitting and monitoring for relevant attributes. LTE D offers certain benefits in terms of privacy as well as power consumption in that LTE D does not utilize perpetual location tracking to determine proximity. By keeping discovery on the device rather than in the cloud the user has more control of what information is shared with external devices.

LTE D generally uses Expressions to both discover proximate peers and facilitate communication between proximate peers. Expressions at the application layer and or the service layer are referred to as Expression Names e.g. ShirtSale Gap.com Jane Facebook.com etc. wherein Expression Names at the application layer and or the service layer are mapped to bit strings referred to as Expression Codes at the physical layer. In one example each Expression Code can have a 192 bit length e.g. 11001111 . . . 1011 etc. . As will be appreciated any reference to a particular Expression can refer to the associated Expression Name Expression Code or both depending on context and furthermore Expressions can be either Private or Public based on the mapping type. As such Public Expressions are made public and can be identified by any application whereas Private Expressions are targeted for specific audiences. Discovery in LTE D operates in a synchronous manner based on parameters that are configured by the LTE network. For example frequency division duplexing FDD and or time division duplexing TDD may be assigned by a serving eNB via a Session Information Block SIB . The serving eNB can also configure an interval at which LTE D devices to are announce themselves e.g. every 20 seconds etc. via transmission of a Service Discovery or P2P Discovery message. For example for a 10 MHz FDD system the eNB can allocate 44 Physical Uplink Shared Channel PUSCH radio bearers RBs to be used for discovery in accordance with a discovery period that occurs every 20 seconds and includes 64 sub frames such that the number of direct discovery resources DRIDs is 44 64 2816.

In at least one embodiment after two or more LTE D devices discover each other and wish to establish an LTE D session for communication the LTE network may be required to authorize establishment of the LTE D session referred to herein as network assisted connection setup. If the LTE network authorizes the LTE D session the actual media is exchanged via D2D communication between the LTE D devices wherein peer LTE D capable devices may use Expressions to discover proximate services applications and context and establish direct communications in an efficient manner.

For example illustrates an exemplary structure associated with an LTE D Expression that two or more LTE D devices may broadcast such that the LTE D devices can discover one another and establish an appropriate LTE D session for D2D communication. In various embodiments each LTE D device may broadcast and or discover the LTE D Expression at periodic intervals e.g. every twenty 20 seconds wherein the serving eNB s associated therewith may configure the periodic interval via a Service Discovery message a P2P Discovery message or another suitable message. In various embodiments as shown in the LTE D Expression may include an Expression type field having six 6 bits an Expression code field having 192 bits and a cyclic redundancy check CRC field having twenty four 24 bits. In general the Expression type field the Expression code field and the CRC field may be encoded as a single coding block through a convolutional encoder. Furthermore in various embodiments the Expression code field may comprise a Unique Identifier associated with the broadcasting LTE D device and one or more content fields that can include other suitable data. For example in an LTE D network such as the wireless network shown in certain measurement issues may arise when two or more D2D peer UEs are camped onto different base stations i.e. attached to different cells and at least one D2D peer is located in a cell overlap region which may lead to difficulties in maintaining the D2D link between and or among the two or more peer UEs such that the proximity services between the two or more peer UEs may be lost.

Accordingly in various embodiments the content fields in the LTE D Expression shown in may include a legacy link information field that includes the cell information associated with the broadcasting peer UE e.g. a Cell ID a public land mobile network PLMN an E UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number EARFCN etc. such that the other peer UE may discover the broadcasted LTE D Expression and learn the cell information associated with the broadcasting peer UE based on the legacy link information field contained therein. Furthermore in various embodiments the content fields in the LTE D Expression may optionally include one or more neighbor cell measurements in the event that the broadcasting peer UE is located in an overlap region between the serving cell associated therewith and the neighboring cell to which the other peer UE is attached. For example in various embodiments the neighbor cell measurements may include a reference signal received power RSRP a reference signal received quality RSRQ a received signal strength indicator RSSI etc. associated with one or more signals that the broadcasting peer UE observed in the neighbor cell. As such where the LTE D peer UEs are attached to different cells and at least one D2D peer is located in the cell overlap region the LTE D peer UEs may exchange LTE D Expressions having the structure shown in and use the legacy link information and the neighbor cell measurements contained therein to coordinate a forced reselection procedure whereby one peer UE moves to the same cell as the other peer UE.

For example in the event that multiple peer UEs are located in the cell overlap region and observe energy above a particular reselection threshold value on the respective neighbor cells the forced cell reselection may be triggered at the peer UE s that obtain the stronger neighbor cell measurement s . In another example where the legacy link information indicates that one or more of the peer UEs that are located in the cell overlap region have an active legacy link and the other peer UE s have inactive legacy links the forced cell reselection may be triggered at the peer UE s with the inactive legacy link s . In still another example where several peer UEs that are attached to different cells are involved in the D2D connection and more than one of the peer UEs are located in the overlap region s between the different cell the appropriate target cell to which the forced reselection is performed may depend on how many peer UEs are camped on the respective cells e.g. in a D2D connection involving ten UEs that include eight UEs attached to a first cell and two UEs attached to a second cell the forced reselection may be triggered at the two UEs attached to the second cell because having the two UEs force reselection to the first cell may be substantially easier than having the eight UEs attached to the first cell force reselection to the second cell . In other words depending on how many UEs are involved in the inter cell D2D connection how many D2D peer UEs are present in the respective cells and or how many D2D peer UEs are present in the overlap region s between the different cells and therefore represent suitable candidates to perform the forced cell reselection the forced reselection may be triggered at the appropriate peer UE s to minimize the number of peer UE s that need to perform the forced reselection and or maximize the number of peer UE s that will be attached to the same cell once the forced reselection is successfully carried out. Furthermore those skilled in the art will appreciate other examples and or use cases with respect to how the D2D peer UE s may use the information contained in the LTE D Expression s to negotiate or otherwise coordinate the peer UE s that perform the forced reselection based on the description provided herein.

For example referring again to a first UE camped onto a first eNB in a first cell may have an LTE D connection with a second UE camped onto a second eNB in a second cell wherein the first UE and the second UE are both located in an overlap region between the first cell and the second cell . In a similar respect the first UE may have another LTE D connection with a third UE also camped onto the second eNB in the second cell except that only the first UE is located in the overlap region between the first cell and the second cell . Nonetheless similar intra cell measurement difficulties may arise in each scenario. In particular the various D2D peer UEs may generally be required to measure a known signature transmitted from each D2D peer e.g. sequence signal pattern etc. and report the measured signature to the D2D peer and to a respective serving eNB in order to maintain the D2D link e.g. the first eNB in the case of the first UE and the second eNB in the case of the D2D peer UEs associated therewith . In general when two or more D2D peer UEs are attached to the same cell e.g. as shown in where D2D peer UEs are camped onto the eNB in cell the D2D peer UEs may be synchronized and obtain measurements relatively easily i.e. because the measurements are intra cell measurements . However where two or more D2D peer UEs are attached to different cells as with D2D peer UEs and D2D peer UEs and one or more of the D2D peer UEs are in the cell overlap region the measurements needed to maintain the D2D link become inter cell measurements that are generally more difficult to obtain e.g. especially when the cells are not synchronized . Accordingly when i two or more D2D peers are camped onto different eNBs or otherwise attached to different cells and ii one or more of the D2D peers are located in an overlap region between the cells difficulties in obtaining the inter cell measurements may interfere with maintaining the D2D link between the D2D peers and proximity services between the D2D peers may be lost. As a consequence with reference to the D2D peer UEs that lose proximity service benefits will have to use legacy links with the eNBs with respect to both data and signaling transmission as depicted at . As such the scenario s shown in may result in unnecessary resource consumption at the eNBs and moreover the UEs may suffer from faster battery drain among other negative consequences due to the need to transmit at a high power to close the loop with the eNB .

Accordingly to address the above mentioned problems and thereby improve D2D performance over LTE D a forced cell reselection may be dynamically triggered at one D2D peer UE such that the D2D peer UEs are camped onto the same eNB i.e. the D2D peer UE that performs the forced cell reselection may move to the cell to which the other D2D peer UE is attached . As such even though one or more D2D peer UEs may still be located in the cell overlap region the D2D peers are all camped onto the same eNB and attached to the same cell such that the easier intra cell measurements can be obtained and the D2D link can be maintained such that the D2D peers can continue to avail the proximity services associated with one another subject to the D2D peers remaining within sufficient proximity to each other . For example referring to the forced cell reselection may be triggered at the peer UE that had been camped onto the eNB in cell such that the peer UE has moved over to the eNB in cell whereby D2D peers are now intra cell D2D peers and D2D peers are likewise intra cell D2D peers. However those skilled in the art will appreciate that where multiple D2D peers are located in the cell overlap region e.g. as with D2D peers the forced cell reselection may only be triggered at the D2D peer s located in one cell and the other D2D peer s that are located in the other cell i.e. the target cell associated with the forced reselection may continue undisturbed as forcing cell reselection at each D2D peer may result in the same problem except in the reverse. Furthermore those skilled in the art will appreciate that where one or more D2D peers are located in the cell overlap region and one or more D2D peers are located outside the cell overlap region e.g. as with D2D peers the forced cell reselection may be triggered at the D2D peer s located in the cell overlap region and the other D2D peer s may continue undisturbed as the D2D peer s outside the cell overlap region may not have the ability to observe sufficient energy if any on the new cell and survive on the new cell without issues. In that sense a cell reselection threshold Mmay be maintained as a safeguard to control the decision about whether to force cell reselection where the threshold Mmay have an implementation specific value.

For example in various embodiments the cell reselection threshold Mmay have an implementation specific value that depends on a reference signal received power RSRP associated with one or more signals that one or more D2D peers observe in the respective neighbor cells. More particularly the RSRP may be considered an important parameter that conveys the signal strength associated with a cell and typically ranges from about 44 dbm to 130 dbm. Accordingly in one example the cell reselection threshold Mcould have a 90 dBm value meaning that forced cell reselection may only be triggered to a cell having a RSRP value greater than 90 dBm. Furthermore in various embodiments base station performance may vary from time to time according to user loads e.g. during peak hours the base station may be heavily loaded and interference may be high which can heavily impact reference signal received quality RSRQ . Accordingly because the RSRQ parameter indicates the interference levels and might vary from time to time according to user loads the cell reselection threshold Mmay be further adjusted to depend upon base station performance e.g. the base station user load according to the RSRQ parameter.

In one example operational aspect with reference to and the UEs operating in D2D mode i.e. UEs have the ability to broadcast information to D2D peers associated therewith and therefore have the ability to exchange certain information e.g. Cell ID public land mobile network PLMN E UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number EARFCN etc. . As such in various embodiments any D2D peer located in the cell overlap region may force reselection to the cell associated with the other D2D peer s depending on which cell may be more a feasible reselection target under the circumstances. For example in various embodiments where more than one D2D peer measures sufficient energy on the other neighbor cell that exceeds the safeguard cell reselection threshold M the forced reselection may be triggered at the D2D peer s that measured more energy from the neighboring cell and would therefore have a stronger new legacy link. Alternatively where one or more D2D peers measure energy on the neighbor cell that exceeds the safeguard threshold Mand the other s measure energy on the neighbor cell that does not exceed the safeguard threshold M the forced reselection may be triggered at the D2D peer s that measured sufficient energy to survive the move to the neighboring cell. However those skilled in the art will appreciate that the forced cell reselection can be triggered provided that at least one D2D peer observes energy on both the current cell associated therewith and the neighbor cell associated with the D2D peer s . In various embodiments after the forced cell reselection has been carried out and the D2D peer has moved to the same cell as D2D peers the D2D peers may perform intra cell measurements such that the D2D link between the D2D peers and the D2D link between the D2D peers may be maintained relatively easily.

According to various aspects the forced cell reselection procedure described above may therefore be triggered based on certain conditions and UE states that may exist at any particular time to prevent losing connectivity via legacy links . For example in various embodiments forced cell reselection may not be triggered at any D2D peer UE that has an active legacy data connection with a current cell at a particular time i.e. the D2D peer UE is actively exchanging data with the eNB in the current cell . In that sense connectivity with the eNBs via legacy links may be considered primary and D2D connectivity may be considered secondary. Furthermore as mentioned above an implementation specific safeguard threshold Mmay be maintained to control the decision about whether to force cell reselection wherein a D2D peer UE may only move to a new cell when the D2D peer UE observes energy on the new cell that exceeds the safeguard threshold Mand can therefore survive on the new cell without issues. In various embodiments the measured or otherwise observed energy on the new cell and the safeguard threshold Mmay be based on any suitable communication parameters e.g. a reference signal received power RSRP a reference signal received quality RSRQ a received signal strength indicator RSSI etc. associated with one or more signals that are received from the eNB in the new cell . Further still if a D2D peer UE moves to a new cell to ease the D2D communication the D2D peer UE may still have the capability or freedom to fall back to the original cell at any particular time via legacy cell reselection algorithms running in the background.

Accordingly the forced cell reselection algorithm described above may essentially transform an inter cell D2D connection into an intra cell D2D connection which may facilitate easier D2D communication without hampering the performance connectivity or benefits associated with legacy cellular links. As such the forced cell reselection algorithm may enable efficient communication between D2D peers without consuming substantial eNB and or network resources whereby the eNBs could allocate more resource blocks to other users in the same network such that the other users may achieve higher throughput. For example referring again to UEs that are not within sufficient proximity to establish an LTE D link may be allocated more resource blocks from the eNB after the D2D peer UE performs forced cell reselection to eNB . Further benefits from the forced cell reselection algorithm may include reduced battery consumption at the D2D peer UE s which should be able to use less transmit power to close the loop with nearby UEs after the forced cell reselection has been carried out which may be especially important on smartphones and other power hungry devices.

According to various aspects illustrates an exemplary method to force cell reselection at a UE engaged in a D2D communication session to improve D2D performance in a scenario where the UE is located in a cell overlap region. In general the method may generally comprise an algorithm corresponding to a forced cell reselection procedure that may be performed where a particular UE is camped on a first base station has one or more D2D connections with one or more peer UEs that are camped onto different base stations or otherwise attached to different cells i.e. the UE has one or more inter cell D2D connections . In various embodiments the forced reselection may be started at block in response to the UE detecting that the UE is present or otherwise located in an overlap region between the respective cells to which the D2D peers are attached and further that the other D2D peer s are outside the cell overlap region. Furthermore note that the scenario s in which more than one D2D peer is located in the cell overlap region will be described below with reference to .

In various embodiments in response to determining that one or more triggering criteria to start the forced cell reselection procedure are met e.g. that the UE is located in the cell overlap region and camped onto a different base station than one or more peer UEs certain conditions and UE states that may exist at any particular time may then be checked to determine whether or not to trigger the forced cell reselection. For example a check may be performed at block to determine whether the inter cell D2D connection is active wherein the forced cell reselection procedure may end at block in the event that the inter cell D2D connection is inactive e.g. because there may not be any active proximity services that need to be maintained . However if the inter cell D2D connection is active such that there are one or more active proximity services to maintain a further check may be performed at block to determine whether the UE has an active legacy link in which an ongoing data transfer may be occurring over a primary data connection with the original cell. As such the forced cell reselection procedure may also end at block in the event that the UE has an active legacy link with the original cell because connectivity with the eNB in the original cell via the active legacy link may be considered primary and the D2D connectivity may be considered secondary. Otherwise if the inter cell D2D connection is active and the legacy link is inactive the forced cell reselection procedure may proceed as described herein.

More particularly at block the UE in the cell overlap region may obtain one or more measurements Mon the neighboring cell in which the D2D peer is camped wherein the one or more measurements Mmay comprise a reference signal received power RSRP a reference signal received quality RSRQ a received signal strength indicator RSSI and or other suitable communication parameters associated with one or more signals received at the UE from the eNB in the neighboring cell. The measurements Mobtained on the neighboring cell may then be compared to an implementation specific safeguard threshold Mat block wherein the safeguard threshold Mmay be maintained to control the decision about whether to trigger the forced cell reselection. Accordingly in response to determining that the measurements Mobtained on the neighboring cell do not exceed the safeguard threshold Mat block the forced cell reselection procedure may end at block e.g. because the UE may only move to a new cell when sufficient energy is observed on the neighboring cell such that the UE can survive on the neighboring cell without issues . However in the event that the measurements Mobtained on the neighboring cell exceed the safeguard threshold M reselection to the neighboring cell may be forced or otherwise triggered at block because the UE observed sufficient energy on the neighboring cell to survive the move. The UE may then determine whether the cell reselection succeeded at block in which case the forced cell reselection procedure may end at block . However as mentioned above if the UE successfully reselects the neighboring cell to ease the D2D communication at blocks the UE may still have the capability or freedom to fall back to the original cell at any particular time via legacy cell reselection algorithms that may be running in the background. Otherwise if the forced cell reselection did not succeed the UE may camp back onto the original cell and maintain the current legacy link at block before ending the forced cell reselection procedure at block .

According to various aspects illustrates another exemplary method to force cell reselection to improve D2D performance wherein the method shown in may apply to the scenario s in which two or more UEs have an inter cell D2D connection i.e. the two or more D2D peer UEs are camped on different base stations or otherwise attached to different cells while located in a cell overlap region. In various embodiments the method may be performed at any such UE that detects presence in the cell overlap region e.g. based on location observing energy from a neighbor cell etc. while camped on a different base station from one or more other UEs that are involved in the inter cell D2D connection and also present in the cell overlap region. As such in various embodiments the forced reselection procedure shown in may be started at in response to the UE detecting presence in the cell overlap region and further detecting that at least one of the D2D peer s that are camped onto or otherwise attached to a different cell are also present within the cell overlap region.

In various embodiments at block the UE may then determine whether one or more triggering criteria to start the forced cell reselection procedure are satisfied. More particularly starting from the assumption that the UE is present in the cell overlap region while engaged in an inter cell D2D connection with one or more peer UEs that are further present in the cell overlap region the UE may check one or more conditions and or states at block to determine whether or not to proceed with the forced cell reselection procedure. For example in various embodiments the UE may determine whether the inter cell D2D connection is active at block and appropriately end the forced cell reselection procedure at block in the event that the inter cell D2D connection is inactive e.g. because there may not be any active proximity services that need to be maintained . However if the inter cell D2D connection is active such that there are one or more active proximity services to maintain a further check may be performed at block to determine whether the UE has an active legacy link being used to conduct an ongoing data transfer over a primary data connection with the original cell i.e. the cell currently serving the UE . As such the forced cell reselection procedure may also appropriate end at block in the event that the UE has an active legacy link because connectivity with the eNB in the original cell via the active legacy link may be considered primary and the D2D connectivity may be considered secondary. Otherwise in response to the UE determining that the inter cell D2D connection is active and the legacy link is inactive at block the forced cell reselection procedure may proceed further as described in further detail herein.

According to various embodiments at block the UE may obtain one or more measurements Mon the neighboring cell in which the other D2D peer s are camped wherein the one or more measurements Mmay comprise a reference signal received power RSRP a reference signal received quality RSRQ a received signal strength indicator RSSI and or other suitable communication parameters associated with one or more signals that the UE receives or otherwise observes from the eNB in the neighboring cell. The UE may then create a private LTE D Expression that includes the measurements Mthat the UE obtained on the neighboring cell in addition to information describing the legacy link associated with the UE e.g. a Cell ID a public land mobile network PLMN an E UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number EARFCN etc. a unique identifier associated with the UE and or any other suitable information that may be relevant to the forced cell reselection procedure. Furthermore the other D2D peer UE s involved in the inter cell D2D connection that are present in the cell overlap region may similarly obtain measurements on the neighboring cell i.e. the cell on which the UE performing the method is camped and create an appropriate private LTE D Expression that includes at least the neighboring cell measurements that the D2D peer UE s obtained in addition to information describing the legacy link s associated therewith the UE. As such at block the various UEs that are involved in the inter cell D2D connection and present in the cell overlap region may then exchange i.e. broadcast and discover the respective private LTE D Expressions such that each D2D peer UE performing the forced cell reselection procedure may learn the legacy link information and the neighbor cell measurements associated with one another and negotiate the appropriate D2D peer UE s at which to trigger the forced cell reselection.

More particularly in various embodiments to negotiate or otherwise select the appropriate D2D peer UE s at which to trigger the forced cell reselection the neighbor cell measurement s that each UE obtained may be compared to the above mentioned safeguard threshold Mat block wherein the safeguard threshold Mmay be maintained to control the decision about whether to trigger the forced cell reselection. For example in various embodiments the safeguard threshold Mmay have a value that depends on a reference signal received power RSRP associated with the one or more signals received or otherwise observed in the respective neighbor cells wherein the RSRP typically ranges from 44 to 130 dbm such that the safeguard threshold Mcould have a 90 dBm value in one example e.g. a D2D peer UE that obtains measurements Mwith an RSRP value greater than 90 dBm may be a suitable candidate at which to trigger the forced cell reselection . Furthermore in various embodiments base station performance may vary from time to time according to user load e.g. a base station may be heavily loaded and interference may be high during peak hours which can heavily impact reference signal received quality RSRQ whereby the safeguard threshold Mmay be further adjusted according to the RSRQ parameter that generally depends upon base station performance . Accordingly in response to determining at block that the neighbor cell measurements Mobtained at the UE do not exceed the safeguard threshold M the UE may instruct the other inter cell D2D peer s to attempt a forced reselection to the current serving cell associated with the UE at block . Alternatively in the event that the neighbor cell measurements Mobtained at the UE exceed the safeguard threshold Msuch that the UE may be a suitable forced reselection candidate the negotiation may proceed to block .

For example in various embodiments the factors that the inter cell D2D peers consider to negotiate or otherwise select the appropriate D2D peer UE s at which to trigger the forced cell reselection may further depend on the respective neighbor cell measurements obtained at each inter cell D2D peer. In the simplest use case the forced cell reselection may be triggered at the UE executing the method where the neighbor cell measurements Mobtained at the UE exceed the safeguard threshold Mand that the other inter cell D2D peer UE s each obtained neighbor cell measurements that do not exceed the safeguard threshold M. In another use case where the UE and one or more other inter cell D2D peer UEs each obtained neighbor cell measurements that exceed the safeguard threshold M the forced cell reselection may be triggered at the UE that obtained the stronger neighbor cell measurement s . In other examples the inter cell D2D peers may negotiate the forced reselection at block according to the legacy link state associated therewith wherein the forced reselection may be triggered at an appropriate D2D peer UE that has an inactive legacy link in the event that one or more D2D peers have an active legacy link. In still another example where the inter cell D2D communication involves several peer UEs e.g. three or more the target cell to which the forced reselection is performed may depend on how many inter cell D2D peers are camped on or otherwise attached to the various cells. For example where the current cell serving the UE has more UEs involved in the inter cell D2D connection than the neighbor cell the UE may instruct the D2D peer s in the neighbor cell to attempt a forced reselection to the current cell at block because triggering the forced reselection at the comparatively fewer UEs in the neighbor cell may be easier than having the larger number of UEs attached to the current cell force reselection to the neighbor cell. On the other hand where the current cell has fewer UEs involved in the inter cell D2D connection than the neighbor cell block may comprise triggering the forced reselection at the UE for similar reasons.

Accordingly in response to the UE instructing the D2D peer s in the neighbor cell to attempt to force reselection to the current cell based on the negotiation s performed at blocks the D2D peer s in the neighbor cell may appropriately attempt the forced cell reselection and then send a notification to the UE to indicate whether the D2D peer s successfully forced reselection to the current cell serving the UE. As such in response to the notification received from the D2D peer s in the neighbor cell indicating that the forced reselection to the current cell was successful at block the UE and the D2D peer s may each be attached to the same cell such that the inter cell D2D connection becomes an intra cell D2D connection and the method may then appropriately end at block . However in the event that the D2D peer s in the neighbor cell were unable to successfully force reselection to the current cell the UE executing the method may attempt to force reselection to the neighbor cell at block assuming that the neighbor cell measurements Mobtained at block exceed the safeguard threshold Mand that the UE has an inactive legacy link otherwise the method may end at block without converting the inter cell D2D connection to an intra cell D2D connection . In the alternative the UE may attempt to force reselection to the neighbor cell at block based on the negotiation s that were performed at blocks in which case the neighbor cell measurements Mobtained at block can be safely assumed to exceed the safeguard threshold Mand the UE can be safely assumed to have an inactive legacy link because the D2D peer s would have otherwise been instructed to attempt the forced reselection at block .

In either case once the forced reselection has been triggered at the UE block may comprise the UE attempting to force reselection to the neighbor cell and the UE may then determine whether the forced cell reselection succeeded at block . In the affirmative the UE may send a notification to the D2D peer s indicating that the UE successfully reselected the neighbor cell and the forced cell reselection procedure may then appropriately end at block . However as mentioned above the UE may still have the capability or freedom to fall back to the original cell at any particular time via legacy cell reselection algorithms running in the background after reselecting to the neighbor cell to ease the D2D communication. Alternatively where the forced cell reselection attempted at block was unsuccessful the UE may camp back onto the original cell maintain the current legacy link and send a notification to the D2D peer s indicating that the UE was unable to reselect the neighbor cell prior to ending the forced cell reselection procedure at block .
