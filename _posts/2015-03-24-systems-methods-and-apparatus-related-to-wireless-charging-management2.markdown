The disclosure of each is hereby expressly incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.

The present disclosure relates generally to wireless power transfer and more specifically to devices systems and methods related to wireless power transfer to remote systems such as vehicles including batteries and communications therebetween.

Remote systems such as vehicles have been introduced that include locomotion power derived from electricity received from an energy storage device such as a battery. For example hybrid electric vehicles include on board chargers that use power from vehicle braking and traditional motors to charge the vehicles. Vehicles that are solely electric generally receive the electricity for charging the batteries from other sources. Battery electric vehicles electric vehicles are often proposed to be charged through some type of wired alternating current AC such as household or commercial AC supply sources. The wired charging connections require cables or other similar connectors that are physically connected to a power supply. Cables and similar connectors can sometimes be inconvenient or cumbersome and have other drawbacks. Wireless charging systems that are capable of transferring power in free space e.g. via a wireless field to be used to charge electric vehicles can overcome some of the deficiencies of wired charging solutions.

In some cases the near field can correspond to a region that is within about of wavelength of the base system induction coil A and vice versa for the electric vehicle induction coil as will be further described below.

In some exemplary implementations the base wireless charging system A can be configured to communicate with the electric vehicle via a magnetic field. For example the base wireless charging system A can communicate with the electric vehicle by providing an information signal via a magnetic field the signal provided at intensity level lower that the level for wireless power transmission and having one or more characteristics to uniquely identify the base wireless charging system A from a plurality of base wireless charging systems. In some implementations the information signal can be configured at a frequency other than the frequency used for wireless power transfer WPT the signal can further be configured as a modulation of the magnetic field. The electric vehicle can sense the information signal e.g. low level magnetic beacons in the presence of strong emissions emanating from active base wireless charging systems located in the immediate vicinity. Since it can be undesirable to have power transfer interrupted when an electric vehicle is sensing magnetic beacon signals the beacons can be emitted in a separate frequency band that is sufficiently offset from the WPT operating frequency to avoid interference e.g. 10 20 kHz . Since the base wireless charging system A emits the magnetic beacon signals at low levels the signals can be generated by WPT hardware without need for returning resonant circuits e.g. charging inductions coils can be driven off resonance provided that pulse width modulation PWM waveform can be synthesized in fine enough frequency steps.

To separate different beacon signal emissions and to avoid mutual interference the base wireless charging system A can modulate the magnetic field. The modulation can be any type of modulation or combination of modulation such as for example a single pulse digital sequence frequency division time division code division etc. For example for a frequency division scheme the signal frequencies can be assigned fixed or dynamically on a temporary basis in a separate frequency that is offset from the wireless power transmission operating frequency by at least 10 kHz to avoid interference between the signal and the wireless power transfer and interference between multiple signals. The electric vehicle can receive the signal via one or more sensors not shown configured to detect and receive a signal via a magnetic field. The electric vehicle can also use the signal to determine the distance and or direction of the base wireless charging system A.

In some implementations an electric vehicle can utilize the magnetic signal for pairing purposes i.e. to pair with a corresponding base wireless charging system . In some implementations such pairing can be accomplished by detecting and identifying the magnetic field of the base wireless charging system the electric vehicle is going to be supplied from and by correlating signals transmitted out of band i.e. UHF with signals transmitted on the LF magnetic field. This procedure however can require the magnetic field being modulated in one form or another as describe above e.g. single pulse digital sequence frequency division etc. 

In some exemplary implementations the magnetic field signal transmit and receive capabilities can be configured to be reciprocal such that the electric vehicle provides a signal via a magnetic field to the base wireless charging system A and the base wireless charging system A receives the signal to uniquely identify the electric vehicle from a plurality of electric vehicles.

In accordance certain aspects of implementations described herein allow for establishing in a scenario where multiple base charging systems A are positioned in close proximity to each other a communication link between an electric vehicle wireless charging system and a selected base wireless charging system A before the electric vehicle is positioned over the inductions coil A of the base wireless charging system A. As a result of pairing with the correct base wireless charging system A before alignment or guidance the communication link can be used to communicate guidance and alignment information to allow an operator of the electric vehicle to move into the correct position for charging.

Local distribution center can be configured to communicate with external sources e.g. a power grid via a communication backhaul and with the base wireless charging system A via a communication link .

With reference to base wireless charging systems A and B can be configured to communicate with the electric vehicle wireless charging system via antennas and or via electric vehicle induction coils A and B. For example the wireless charging system A can communicate with the electric vehicle wireless charging system using a communication channel between antennas and . The communication channels can be any type of communication channels such as for example Bluetooth zigbee cellular wireless local area network WLAN etc.

In some implementations the electric vehicle induction coil can be aligned with the base system induction coil A and therefore disposed within a near field region simply by the driver positioning the electric vehicle correctly relative to the base system induction coil A. In other implementations the driver can be given visual feedback auditory feedback or combinations thereof to determine when the electric vehicle is properly placed for wireless power transfer. In yet other implementations the electric vehicle can be positioned by an autopilot system which can move the electric vehicle back and forth e.g. in zig zag movements until an alignment error has reached a tolerable value. This can be performed automatically and autonomously by the electric vehicle without or with only minimal driver intervention provided that the electric vehicle is equipped with a servo steering wheel ultrasonic sensors and intelligence to adjust the vehicle. In still other implementations the electric vehicle induction coil the base system induction coil A or a combination thereof can have functionality for displacing and moving the induction coils and A relative to each other to more accurately orient them and develop more efficient coupling therebetween.

The base wireless charging system A can be located in a variety of locations. As non limiting examples some suitable locations include a parking area at a home of the electric vehicle owner parking areas reserved for electric vehicle wireless charging modeled after conventional petroleum based filling stations and parking lots at other locations such as shopping centers and places of employment.

Charging electric vehicles wirelessly can provide numerous benefits. For example charging can be performed automatically virtually without driver intervention and manipulations thereby improving convenience to a user. There can also be no exposed electrical contacts and no mechanical wear out thereby improving reliability of the wireless power transfer system . Manipulations with cables and connectors may not be needed and there can be no cables plugs or sockets that can be exposed to moisture and water in an outdoor environment thereby improving safety. There can also be no sockets cables and plugs visible or accessible thereby reducing potential vandalism of power charging devices. Further since an electric vehicle can be used as distributed storage devices to stabilize a power grid a docking to grid solution can be used to increase availability of vehicles for Vehicle to Grid V2G operation.

A wireless power transfer system as described with reference to can also provide aesthetical and non impedimental advantages. For example there can be no charge columns and cables that can be impedimental for vehicles and or pedestrians.

As a further explanation of the vehicle to grid capability the wireless power transmit and receive capabilities can be configured to be reciprocal such that the base wireless charging system A transfers power to the electric vehicle and the electric vehicle transfers power to the base wireless charging system A e.g. in times of energy shortfall. This capability can be useful to stabilize the power distribution grid by allowing electric vehicles to contribute power to the overall distribution system in times of energy shortfall caused by over demand or shortfall in renewable energy production e.g. wind or solar .

With reference to a power supply e.g. AC or DC supplies power Pto the base wireless charging system to transfer energy to an electric vehicle . The base wireless charging system includes a base charging system power converter . The base charging system power converter can include circuitry such as an AC DC converter configured to convert power from standard mains AC to DC power at a suitable voltage level and a DC low frequency LF converter configured to convert DC power to power at an operating frequency suitable for wireless high power transfer. The base charging system power converter supplies power Pto the base system transmit circuit including the capacitor Cin series with the base system induction coil to emit an electromagnetic field at a desired frequency. The capacitor Ccan be provided to form a resonant circuit with the base system induction coil that resonates at a desired frequency. The base system induction coil receives the power Pand wirelessly transmits power at a level sufficient to charge or power the electric vehicle . For example the power level provided wirelessly by the base system induction coil can be on the order of kilowatts kW e.g. anywhere from 1 kW to 110 kW or higher or lower .

The base system transmit circuit including the base system induction coil and electric vehicle receive circuit including the electric vehicle induction coil can be tuned to substantially the same frequencies and can be positioned within the near field of an electromagnetic field transmitted by one of the base system induction coil and the electric vehicle induction coil . In this case the base system induction coil and electric vehicle induction coil can become coupled to one another such that power can be transferred to the electric vehicle receive circuit including capacitor Cand electric vehicle induction coil . The capacitor Ccan be provided to form a resonant circuit with the electric vehicle induction coil that resonates at a desired frequency. Element k d represents the mutual coupling coefficient resulting at coil separation. Equivalent resistances Rand Rrepresent the losses that can be inherent to the induction coils and and the anti reactance capacitors Cand C. The electric vehicle receive circuit including the electric vehicle induction coil and capacitor Creceives power Pand provides the power Pto an electric vehicle power converter of an electric vehicle charging system .

The electric vehicle power converter can include among other things a LF DC converter configured to convert power at an operating frequency back to DC power at a voltage level matched to the voltage level of an electric vehicle battery unit . The electric vehicle power converter can provide the converted power Pto charge the electric vehicle battery unit . The power supply base charging system power converter and base system induction coil can be stationary and located at a variety of locations as discussed above. The battery unit electric vehicle power converter and electric vehicle induction coil can be included in an electric vehicle charging system that is part of electric vehicle or part of the battery pack not shown . The electric vehicle charging system can also be configured to provide power wirelessly through the electric vehicle induction coil to the base wireless charging system to feed power back to the grid. Each of the electric vehicle induction coil and the base system induction coil can act as transmit or receive induction coils based on the mode of operation.

While not shown the wireless power transfer system can include a load disconnect unit LDU to safely disconnect the electric vehicle battery unit or the power supply from the wireless power transfer system . For example in case of an emergency or system failure the LDU can be triggered to disconnect the load from the wireless power transfer system . The LDU can be provided in addition to a battery management system for managing charging to a battery or it can be part of the battery management system.

Further the electric vehicle charging system can include switching circuitry not shown for selectively connecting and disconnecting the electric vehicle induction coil to the electric vehicle power converter . Disconnecting the electric vehicle induction coil can suspend charging and also can adjust the load as seen by the base wireless charging system A acting as a transmitter which can be used to cloak the electric vehicle charging system acting as the receiver from the base wireless charging system A. The load changes can be detected if the transmitter includes the load sensing circuit. Accordingly the transmitter such as a base wireless charging system can have a mechanism for determining when receivers such as an electric vehicle charging system are present in the near field of the base system induction coil .

As described above in operation assuming energy transfer towards the vehicle or battery input power is provided from the power supply such that the base system induction coil generates a field for providing the energy transfer. The electric vehicle induction coil couples to the radiated field and generates output power for storage or consumption by the electric vehicle . As described above in some implementations the base system induction coil and electric vehicle induction coil are configured according to a mutual resonant relationship such that the resonant frequency of the electric vehicle induction coil and the resonant frequency of the base system induction coil are very close or substantially the same. Transmission losses between the base wireless charging system and electric vehicle charging system are minimal when the electric vehicle induction coil is located in the near field of the base system induction coil .

As stated an efficient energy transfer occurs by coupling a large portion of the energy in the near field of a transmitting induction coil to a receiving induction coil rather than propagating most of the energy in an electromagnetic wave to the far field. When in the near field a coupling mode can be established between the transmit induction coil and the receive induction coil. The area around the induction coils where this near field coupling can occur is referred to herein as a near field coupling mode region.

While not shown the base charging system power converter and the electric vehicle power converter can both include an oscillator a driver circuit such as a power amplifier a filter and a matching circuit for efficient coupling with the wireless power induction coil. The oscillator can be configured to generate a desired frequency which can be adjusted in response to an adjustment signal. The oscillator signal can be amplified by a power amplifier with an amplification amount responsive to control signals. The filter and matching circuit can be included to filter out harmonics or other unwanted frequencies and match the impedance of the power conversion module to the wireless power induction coil. The power converters and can also include a rectifier and switching circuitry to generate a suitable power output to charge the battery.

The electric vehicle induction coil and base system induction coil as described throughout the disclosed implementations can be referred to or configured as loop antennas and more specifically multi turn loop antennas. The induction coils and can also be referred to herein or be configured as magnetic antennas. The term coils is intended to refer to a component that can wirelessly output or receive energy four coupling to another coil. The coil can also be referred to as an antenna of a type that is configured to wirelessly output or receive power. As used herein coils and are examples of power transfer components of a type that are configured to wirelessly output wirelessly receive and or wirelessly relay power. As discussed above coils and can be further configured to provide magnetic field signals at a different frequency and lower intensity level than for wireless power transmission to communicate with the electric vehicle or base system A respectively. Loop e.g. multi turn loop antennas can be configured to include an air core or a physical core such as a ferrite core. An air core loop antenna can allow the placement of other components within the core area. Physical core antennas including ferromagnetic or ferromagnetic materials can allow development of a stronger electromagnetic field and improved coupling.

As discussed above efficient transfer of energy between a transmitter and receiver occurs during matched or nearly matched resonance between a transmitter and a receiver. However even when resonance between a transmitter and receiver are not matched energy can be transferred at a lower efficiency. Transfer of energy occurs by coupling energy from the near field of the transmitting induction coil to the receiving induction coil residing within a region e.g. within a predetermined frequency range of the resonant frequency or within a predetermined distance of the near field region where this near field is established rather than propagating the energy from the transmitting induction coil into free space.

A resonant frequency can be based on the inductance and capacitance of a transmit circuit including an induction coil e.g. the base system induction coil as described above. As shown in inductance can generally be the inductance of the induction coil whereas capacitance can be added to the induction coil to create a resonant structure at a desired resonant frequency. As a non limiting example as shown in a capacitor can be added in series with the induction coil to create a resonant circuit e.g. the base system transmit circuit that generates an electromagnetic field. Accordingly for larger diameter induction coils the value of capacitance needed to induce resonance can decrease as the diameter or inductance of the coil increases. Inductance can also depend on a number of turns of an induction coil. Furthermore as the diameter of the induction coil increases the efficient energy transfer area of the near field can increase. Other resonant circuits are possible. As another non limiting example a capacitor can be placed in parallel between the two terminals of the induction coil e.g. a parallel resonant circuit . Furthermore an induction coil can be designed to have a high quality Q factor to improve the resonance of the induction coil. For example the Q factor can be 300 or greater.

As described above according to some implementations coupling power between two induction coils that are in the near field of one another is disclosed. As described above the near field can correspond to a region around the induction coil in which electromagnetic fields exist but may not propagate or radiate away from the induction coil. Near field coupling mode regions can correspond to a volume that is near the physical volume of the induction coil typically within a small fraction of the wavelength. According to some implementations electromagnetic induction coils such as single and multi turn loop antennas are used for both transmitting and receiving since magnetic near field amplitudes in practical implementations tend to be higher for magnetic type coils in comparison to the electric near fields of an electric type antenna e.g. a small dipole . This allows for potentially higher coupling between the pair. Furthermore electric antennas e.g. dipoles and monopoles or a combination of magnetic and electric antennas can be used.

The vehicle segment can include a vehicle charging unit VCU a vehicle battery a vehicle or battery management system BMS engine control unit ECU and a display and logging unit DLU . In various implementations the vehicle can include one or more additional processors or controllers configured to interface with an interface control unit . In various implementations units controllers and or blocks described herein can be integrated into a single component or can be separated into one or more separate components. The VCU can further include a vehicle power controller VPC an interface control unit ICU and a vehicle pad . The VPC can be communicatively coupled to the battery the vehicle pad and the ICU . The VPC can integrate with the battery and or the BMS in order to charge the battery . The VPC can control and regulate power flow between the charging station segment and the battery . In addition the VPC can communicate with the BCU utilizing a wireless connection for example a Bluetooth zigbee cellular or other communication link. In various implementations subsystems such as the VPC and BCU may not have a direct link to wireless radio. In various implementations such subsystems can be configured to relay communications for example over a bus to a communication module or radio interface. The vehicle pad can be configured to receive wireless power via a magnetic field generated by the base pad . The vehicle pad can include similar components to those describe above with respect to the electric vehicle induction coil and the electric vehicle receive circuit of .

The ICU can be communicatively coupled to the vehicle or BMS ECU e.g. via a controller area network CAN bus interface a K Line interface ISO 9141 etc. and the VPC . The ICU can also be connected to a vehicle power supply e.g. 12V battery . The ICU can make decisions about the overall charging cycle start charge restart stop charge and fault handling. The ICU can also communicate with a Living Object Protection LOP system not shown configured to detect moving living objects a Foreign Object Detection FOD system not shown configured to detect objects that can interfere with wireless charging and or any other system for detecting non charging objects. The ICU can also be connected to the DLU for user interaction with the wireless power transfer system . In some implementations the ICU and VPC may be combined and or implemented as a single controller. In some other implementations the ICU and the VPC may be implemented as separate controllers.

The DLU can be used as a user interaction interface that can be part of the vehicle head end display also called a human machine interface HMI and as a logging unit. The DLU can include an in dash vehicle display or a separate unit implemented in a device such as a smartphone. In aspects where the display unit is part of the vehicle in dash display the interaction between the VCU ICU and the DLU can take place over a CAN bus integration with the vehicle or other communication link such as Bluetooth.

In contrast to conductive e.g. wired charging systems wireless charging systems can employ additional steps and or processes for efficacy safety and convenience in vehicle charging. Wireless electric vehicle charging WEVC can employ magnetic coupling increasing the desirability of proper alignment between the vehicle pad e.g. vehicle pad and the base pad e.g. base pad for the efficient power transfer. Accordingly the vehicle communication network can improve communication of vehicle charging information which can be passed to the charging station or BCU .

Implementations described herein are directed at managing wireless charging functions in an electric vehicle. In particular certain implementations are directed to providing a high level interface for example to a human user or machine user agent for managing various aspects of wireless electric vehicle charging. In some implementations it can be beneficial for a user interface to manage presentation of lower level functions errors faults etc.

As shown in a V can denote an action or state presented or initiated by the vehicle for example the BMS ECU while a U an can denote action or state presented by a user for example through the DLU . As used herein user can include a human user and or a machine user agent such as for example an automated system computer program etc. In various implementations user actions can be received or generated at the DLU and can be communicated to the ICU .

In various implementations the VCU can transition from any state to the first C0 state upon disconnect of the wireless e.g. Bluetooth connection between the VCU on the vehicle side and the BCU on the charging station side. The vehicle controller e.g. VCU can be in the C0 Not Connected state while an electric vehicle e.g. is driving or while the electric vehicle is stationary e.g. parked position and not connected to a charging station e.g. charging station or BCU . In some implementations the electric vehicle can implement a system to put the VCU in a sleep state based on the electric vehicle state like speed parked state distance traveled etc. In some implementations the C0 Not Connected state can be similar to the electric vehicle position illustrated in as described above. As will be described in greater detail herein in various implementations the VCU can enter a paused state an interrupted state and or a fatal fault state or severity level while in the C0 Not Connected state . In various implementations the VCU can transition to the C1 Connected Not Aligned state when the VCU connects to the charging station through the BCU via a communication link.

In the C1 Connected Not Aligned state the VCU and BCU can share charging information e.g. battery charge level etc. . From this state the alignment with a charging station can commence. In this state there can be user interaction via the DLU . In some aspects the electric vehicle can receive user input via the DLU to initiate the alignment process for example a Start Alignment command . In some aspects the electric vehicle can start restart the alignment process on its own. In some implementations the VCU may only start alignment when it receives a Start Alignment instruction from both the vehicle and user.

In some implementations the C1 Connected Not Aligned state can be similar to the electric vehicle position illustrated in as described above. As will be described in greater detail herein in various implementations the VCU can enter a paused state an interrupted state and or a fatal or severity level while in the C1 Connected Not Aligned state . In various implementations the VCU can transition to the C2 Aligning state when the VCU determines that it should start alignment with the charging station if the driver of the electric vehicle determines it should start alignment or if both the VCU and the user determine the electric vehicle should start alignment with the charging station .

In the C2 Aligning state the electric vehicle can instruct the VCU to start an alignment procedure which can include an alignment animation screen on the DLU . During the C2 Aligning state the VCU can report an alignment score to the DLU and the electric vehicle . In some implementations the C2 Aligning state can be similar to the electric vehicle positions illustrated in as described above. As will be described in greater detail herein in various implementations the VCU can enter a paused state an interrupted state and or a fatal fault state or severity level while in the C2 Aligning state . The VCU can then transition to the C10 Aligned state if during the C2 Aligning state the alignment score satisfies a certain threshold.

In some implementations the alignment score can be based on a degree of magnetic coupling between the vehicle pad and the base pad . In some aspects the alignment score can be based the location of the vehicle pad in relation to the base pad . In some implementations the DLU can show that the vehicle pad is aligned with the base pad . When the alignment score satisfies a certain threshold the VCU can interpret the result to mean that the vehicle pad and the base pad are aligned for efficient wireless power transfer and can transition to the C10 Aligned state .

In some implementations the C10 Aligned state can be similar to the electric vehicle position illustrated in as described above. Once in the C10 Aligned state the VCU can receive a signal from the vehicle to stop alignment. In some aspects the signal can be the driver removing the key from the ignition or setting a gear to park. As will be described in greater detail herein in various implementations the VCU can enter an interrupted state and or a fatal fault state or severity level while in the C10 Aligned state . The VCU can then transition to the C4 Ready To Charge state after receiving the stop alignment signal.

In various implementations when in the C4 Ready To Charge state the VCU awaits a command to charge. In some aspects the DLU can show a ready to charge screen with an option to start restart charging. In some implementations the VCU can wait for a command from the user to charge e.g. via the DLU or the VCU can determine to start charging on its own or VCU can require both a driver input and a VCU determination to start charging in order transition to the C13 Preparing To Charge state . If the electric vehicle moves away from the base pad or is out of alignment the VCU can transition back to the C1 Connected Not Aligned state . As will be described in greater detail herein in various implementations the VCU can enter a paused state an interrupted state and or a fatal fault state or severity level while in the C4 Ready To Charge state .

In the C13 Preparing To Charge state once the user instructs charge and vehicle is ready to charge the VCU can start restart the charging process. In this state VCU and BCU can go through preparation stages such as exchanging charging information and powering up. As will be described in greater detail herein in various implementations the VCU can enter an interrupted state and or a fatal fault state or severity level while in the C13 Preparing To Charge state . Once the C13 Preparing To Charge state is complete the VCU can transition to the C3 Charging state .

In the C3 Charging state the VCU can report instantaneous charging parameters e.g. voltage current etc. to the vehicle and DLU for showing charging progress. If during the C3 Charging state the VCU receives a stop charging command from the vehicle or user the VCU can transition to the C4 Ready To Charge state and await further input. As will be described in greater detail herein in various implementations the VCU can enter a paused state an interrupted state and or a fatal fault state or severity level while in the C3 Charging state .

In some implementations regardless of the state the VCU can receive a stop alignment command or a stop charge command. The VCU can continue to receive such stop alignment command or stop charge command for a period of time. In some aspects once the period of time of receiving stop commands reaches a threshold and the stop commands are still being sent to the VCU the VCU can automatically enter into a low power mode a particular sleep level . In this low power mode the VCU can at a later time transition out of the low power mode when a start command e.g. start aligning start charge etc. is received or enter a deep sleep and or power off state if a sleep command is received.

In some aspects the VCU can move the DLU to this state to notify the user of the fault. Faults can have different severity levels such as for example fatal or service required critical user interventions required recoverable user action slow recovery informational warning or other designation. In various implementations fault severity can escalate to higher fault levels for example due to repeated occurrence. As shown below Table 1 shows exemplary fault severities and accompanying actions.

The VCU can enter the C7 Interrupted fault state when there is interruption of charging due to LOP triggers or FOD triggers or any other software or hardware fault VCU stops the charging or alignment process. The interruption can occur in any state. In some aspects the DLU can show a screen with the appropriate message and can have an option to restart previous activity. In some implementations the VCU can wait for the DLU and or the vehicle to acknowledge the C7 Interrupted fault state in order to clear the fault and transition to another state. The VCU can enter the C8 Paused state when there is interruption in a state due to transient faults. The VCU can pause the activity and the DLU can display information about the interruption. Once the fault is recovered or cleared the VCU can automatically resume the previous activity.

In some implementations the fault severities described above allow for a much larger number of internal faults to be mapped to just one of the fault severities. For example internal faults that may be mapped to fault severities may include faults such as software loading errors internal memory failures foreign object detection system reset and operation fan errors current or voltage values exceeding one or more thresholds mains frequency incompatibilities coil tuning errors one or more temperatures exceeding thresholds foreign or living objects detected communications errors firmware failures vehicle battery brown outs or low levels hardline communication faults alignment problems and the like. Some of these faults may include faults from the infrastructure side including the BCU VAC supply PSU and or the base pad which can be propagated through the VCU during operation. While all these faults may be logged and handled differently by the VCU the VCU may map each fault to a severity level and base any communications and or interaction with the vehicle user based on the severity level. As described above this may allow for controlling what information is reported to the user to allow in certain cases the user not to have to specifically know details of faults the user has no control over and to improve the user experience. In addition the upstream system such as a DLU may be able to take action based on a severity level without having to have knowledge of the specific fault to allow for better user experience.

In addition in certain implementations the system may require at least some acknowledgment by an upstream system e.g. the DLU for any fault to allow continuing on when the fault is recovered. This may allow the vehicle to always have full control over the charging system regardless of the fault. While the DLU may automatically acknowledge the fault the VCU is required to wait at least until the acknowledgment from the DLU before clearing the fault.

As shown below Table 2 shows the mapping of the VCU state to either vehicle or user interaction according to various implementations.

Likewise as shown below Table 3 shows various exemplary electric vehicle interactions with the VCU based on a state of the VCU according to various implementations.

In some implementations the commands described above in connection with the various vehicle and VCU states with respect to A A and B B can be implemented in a communication interface. In some aspects the communication interface can allow communication between the electric vehicle and the VCU e.g. via the connection shown in . In some aspects the communication interface can allow communication between the electric vehicle or VCU and the BCU . In some aspects the communication interface can be an application programming interface API . In some aspects the VCU can receive the commands e.g. start charge align stop charge align sleep wake etc. via the communication interface from the electric vehicle . The VCU can then perform the functions associated with the commands. In some aspects the BCU can receive the commands e.g. start charge align stop charge align sleep wake etc. via the communication interface from the vehicle or the VCU . The BCU can then perform the functions associated with the commands.

FIGS. A A and B B are state diagram showing state transitions in an exemplary wireless power transfer system in accordance with another exemplary implementation. FIGS. A A and B B are similar to and show additional or alternative state transitions user inputs vehicle inputs and or fault states. In particular FIGS. A A and B B show various state transitions within the C0 Not Connected state the C1 Connected Not Aligned state and the C4 Ready To Charge state discussed above with respect to .

As shown in FIGS. A A and B B various states can be associated with user notification and or input preconditions. For example a C7A Interrupted state can include a user notification including an OK button see for example . In the C7A Interrupted state the ICU can wait for user acknowledgement from the DLU before proceeding to the next state. Similarly a C7B Interrupted state can include a user notification including a Restart button see for example . In the C7B Interrupted state the ICU can wait for user acknowledgement from the DLU before proceeding to the next state.

Various states including a C1B Alignment Off state and a C4A Charge Off state can include a notification with no input button see for example . In contrast a C1 Connected Not Aligned state and a C4 Ready to Charge state can include a user notification including an input button see for example . In the C1 Connected Not Aligned state the ICU can wait for user acknowledgement from the DLU before proceeding to the next state.

Turning back to block a determination is made as to whether the vehicle is parked. Such a determination may be made if one or more of the following exemplary but not limiting conditions are met the ignition key state is off the gear state is park the parking break is engaged there are no faults or errors currently associated with the WEVC system. If the determination is no the flowchart may advance back to block . If the determination is yes the flowchart may advance to block . At block a determination may be made as to whether a sleep timer has expired as described below in connection with . If the determination is no the flowchart may advance back to block . If the determination is yes the flowchart may advance to block where the WEVC system may transition to a sleep mode. Once the vehicle sends the sleep command it may continue to decide whether to send the WEVC system to sleep or to power the WEVC system off or to start align charge again by transitioning back to block .

Turning back to block if the determination is no the flowchart may advance to block where a determination is made as to whether charging is desired. However in contrast to block at block the determination is yes if the vehicle speed is less than the high threshold for at least the threshold amount of time as described above. If the determination is no the flowchart may advance to block . If the determination is yes the flowchart may advance back to block . Accordingly the vehicle may utilize the vehicle states to determine if the WEVC system is to be enabled or disabled using signals such as the ignition key state the gear state the parking break state and or the speed acceleration or distance traveled by the vehicle.

In an aspect this may allow the electric vehicle to determine whether or not a user intends to charge even when the wireless charging system in the vehicle detects that there is a charger nearby. For example if car is moving it may be inferred that no charging should be initiated even if the vehicle is in proximity to base pad. Rather than implementing functions to detect car movement or any other vehicle function within the wireless charging components and controllers integrated in the vehicle other vehicle controllers may be able to detect this information and determine when charging should be initiated. In one aspect separating functions between different controllers in the vehicle may allow the same wireless charging system components to be integrated into a variety of different types of vehicles with different ways to detect based on vehicle states how to control charging. As such communications between the systems may be implemented in accordance with aspects described herein to support certain separation of functions and allowing the vehicle to control general charging functions based on vehicle speed etc. but independent of information the VCU may need to actually control the transfer of power and functions specific to wireless charging such as alignment.

By contrast when the vehicle is in a parked mode the WEVC system may be in one of the following states connected to the BCU and aligned e.g. parked over the base pad of the WEVC system connected to the BCU but not aligned e.g. parked near the base pad but not over the base pad of the WEVC system and not connected to the BCU e.g. parked away from a WEVC system . In some implementations separate protocols may be utilized for enabling or disabling the WEVC system depending on whether the vehicle is in a drive mode or a parked mode. The park mode may be described in more detail in connection with below.

If the electric vehicle is not aligned with the base pad or if the electric vehicle commands the VCU to enter the sleep state the vehicle may also start a deep sleep timer . After the deep sleep timer elapses the electric vehicle may command the VCU to enter a deep sleep mode . In some implementations the deep sleep mode may correspond to powering off the VCU during T as illustrated and described in .

Turning back to block at block a determination may be made as to whether a sleep timer has expired. If the determination is no the flowchart may advance back to block . If the determination is yes the flowchart may advance to block where the system may transition to a sleep mode.

The VCU can then determine whether it should continue aligning as indicated in block . If yes in block the electric vehicle sends a start alignment command and the VCU continues aligning. If no in block the electric vehicle can send a stop alignment command and the VCU transitions to the C7 Interrupted fault state as indicated in block . In some implementations the user can send the stop alignment command via the DLU . As the VCU is aligning after block it can receive an alignment score that indicates that the vehicle pad is aligned with the base pad . The VCU can enter the C10 Aligned state and in block can check the electric vehicle state to determine whether to continue aligning. If no then the electric vehicle can send a start alignment command as indicated in block and the VCU can continue aligning and return to block . If yes then the vehicle can send a stop alignment command as indicated in block and the VCU can transition from the C10 Aligned state to the C4 Ready To Charge state of block .

Turning back to block at block a determination as to whether a wait timer loop has been exceeded is made. If the determination is no the flowchart may advance back to block . If the determination is yes the flowchart may advance to block .

Turning back to block at block a determination as to whether the wait timer loop has been exceeded is made. If the determination is no the flowchart may advance back to block . If the determination is yes the flowchart may advance to block . At block the application stored in the flash memory CRC may be verified against a stored CRC. The flowchart may then advance to block . Since the application CRC has been verified in the previous block as being accurate e.g. good at block a determination is made whether to run the application on main. If the determination is no the flowchart may advance to block where an App error response RSP is sent and the flowchart advances back to block . If the determination is yes the flowchart may advance to block where the application is run on main.

Turning back to block at block a determination is made whether a CRC Good response RSP has been received from the on target microcontroller. If the determination is yes the flowchart may advance back to block and then to the final block where the flash has completed successfully. If the determination at block is no the flowchart may advance to block where a determination is made whether a threshold number of flash retries has been exceeded. If the determination is yes the flowchart advances to the final block where the flash has completed and failed. If the determination at block is no the flowchart advances to block where a message indicating that the flash has failed and is being retries at a lower BAUD rate is displayed on the PC. The flowchart then advances to block where the BAUD rate is automatically stepped down or reduced to a particular rate or reduced by a particular amount. The flowchart then advances back to block for flash transfer retry. Thus according to the flowchart new software may be downloaded to the on target e.g. on vehicle microcontroller at a predetermined BAUD rate. If such a transfer at the predetermined BAUD rate is unsuccessful for any reason e.g. increased interference etc. the PC may automatically reduce transfer speed and retry the transfer to the vehicle.

In one aspect the methods described with reference to as described above may allow for providing a variable speed e.g. bit rate for loading a program into the VCU . For example in some implementations a vehicle and or an environment surrounding the vehicle may be subject to a high degree of electrical noise e.g. as electrical systems are only grounded relative to the vehicle . This noise may cause corruption of program data as it is transferred. Therefore providing variable loading rates as described above may allow for successfully loading software on a VCU in a noisy environment. As such in one aspect of some implementations a rate for loading a new program on a VCU may be based at least in part on a level of electrical noise associated with a vehicle or its environment.

In various implementations Keep Alive messages discussed herein can allow the system to allow the various units exchanging the Keep Alive messages to indicate and or detect termination of communication before a physical communication link fails. For example when a vehicle departs a charging station the VPC can stop sending and or responding to Keep Alive messages from the BCU . Thus the BCU can determine that the vehicle is departing while the vehicle is still in wireless communications range. Accordingly detection latency can be improved as compared to simply waiting for the vehicle to leave wireless communications range.

The VPC can connect to the BCU . In the C1 Connected Not Aligned state the ICU can provide one or more status messages to the DLU for example indicating that the VPC is connected to the BCU but not aligned. The DLU can receive and or generate a user instruction to start alignment and can provide the instruction to the ICU . Meanwhile the infrastructure side and the BCU can exchange one or more Keep Alive messages. Similarly the VPC and the ICU can exchange one or more Keep Alice and or Status messages. The infrastructure side the BCU and the VPC can exchange identifiers and or other information.

In the C10 Aligned state the DLU can optionally cancel provide or generate an instruction to the ICU to cancel alignment. Meanwhile the ICU can provide one or more status messages to the DLU for example indicating that the system is ready to charge. The infrastructure side and the BCU can exchange one or more Keep Alive messages. Similarly the VPC and the ICU can exchange one or more Keep Alive and or Status messages. The infrastructure side can deactivate AC power in response to an instruction to stop alignment and or successful alignment.

As discussed above in various implementations the infrastructure can deactivate wireless charging power with or without a delay. For example the ICU or another component can detect a non charging object such as a living object. The DLU and or the ICU can instruct the VPC the BCU and or the infrastructure to deactivate wireless charging power for example for safety reasons. In various implementations the ICU can delay restarting wireless charging so as to reduce false positives in the LOP.

As shown in the ICU starts in an initial state of charging with no LOP detected. In various implementations this initial state can be for example the C3 Charging state of . At a time LOP is triggered for example due to detection of a living object in the charging area. Accordingly the ICU turns off wireless charging. At a time the LOP trigger is cleared. For example the detected object may have left the charging area. In some implementations the LOP system is not restarted immediately. For example the LOP system can be paused until at least a predetermined time until a user restarts wireless charging in response to a fault notification or both.

After the predetermined time or restart of wireless charging by a user the ICU can wait for an LOP hold ignore time . During the LOP hold ignore time output from the LOP can be ignored. Accordingly false positives can be reduced or eliminated. In various implementation the LOP hold ignore time can be 1 60 seconds long 10 30 seconds long or more particularly 15 or 25 seconds long.

After the LOP hold ignore time the ICU can start LOP measurement again at a time . After restarting LOP measurement at the time the ICU can wait for an LOP detect time . The ICU can keep wireless charging deactivated during the LOP detect time . If no LOP trigger occurs during the LOP detect time the ICU can restart wireless charging at a time . Accordingly repetitive restarts can be avoided.

In various implementations if another LOP trigger e.g. at time occurs during the LOP detect time the ICU can return to the state at the original LOP trigger e.g. time . Thus the ICU can again wait for the LOP trigger to clear the user to restart charge the LOP hold ignore time the LOP detect scan time etc. before restarting charging. Waiting for the LOP trigger to clear the user to restart charge the LOP hold ignore time the LOP detect scan time etc. can be repeated one or more times in response to one or more additional LOP triggers.

Although is discussed herein with respect to LOP triggers equivalent alternative or additional mechanisms can be employed with respect to FOD and or any other fault trigger or condition. In various implementations one or more aspects can be omitted such as for example the precondition of user input the hold ignore time and or the detect scan time.

To allow for delaying charging the VCU may perform one or more validation functions at the time of the scheduled charge to ensure system safety and efficient operation particularly where the user is driving at the time of the scheduled charged or has moved the car in between. For example at the time of the scheduled charge the VCU may check one or more car states e.g. car is not moving or is in a parked state to determine whether charging may occur at the delayed time. In addition the VCU may determine whether the vehicle is still aligned at the time of the delayed charge. In this case while the VCU may have progressed to a ready to charge state when the charge was scheduled or some other state upon detection that it is time to charge according to the schedule the VCU may transition to one of the alignment states e.g. the charge state to automatically check alignment.

If the VCU detects misalignment then the vehicle may not charge and send the user a notification that charging will not occur at the scheduled time. When the vehicle is not scheduled for charge the VCU may have any LOP or FOD systems deactivated. At the scheduled time the VCU may activate these systems and in accordance with the delays described above with reference to the LOP system the VCU may re validate that it is safe to charge. The VCU may perform other validation checks at the time of the scheduled charge and only initiate charging based on validating that charging may safely occur. Validation checks can be particularly useful in situations where the vehicle was previously aligned but subsequently moved the vehicle was not aligned to begin with the vehicle is currently moving etc.

In various implementations delayed charging parameters can include a recurring charging schedule. For example charging can be set to begin and or end at one or more times every day every week and so forth. In various implementations a recurring charging schedule can be subject to exceptions such as for example different schedules for weekdays and weekends preconditions such as a threshold charge state or other vehicle or environmental conditions real time energy pricing thresholds etc.
