OFF is set as the standby flag before the cooperation operation starts. The processing in which the standby flag is used will be described in a modified embodiment.

The cooperation operation list can be arbitrarily prepared and edited by the user of the portable device . The portable device may receive new registration and editing of the cooperation operation list by the user through the display and the user interface for example. A specific operation method of the new registration and editing of the cooperation operation list is omitted. Also a plurality of the cooperation operation lists can be stored in the data storage area B. For this reason the cooperation operation list stored in the data storage area B is assigned a cooperation operation ID for identifying the cooperation operation list.

The server apparatus is a storage server configured to store therein data for example. Although the specific example of the server apparatus is not particularly limited the server apparatus is an apparatus configured to provide services such as Dropbox registered trademark of Dropbox Inc. Google Drive registered trademark of Google Inc. Evernote registered trademark of Evernote Corporation and the like. Also the present disclosure is not limited to the configuration where the server apparatus is connected to the Internet and the server apparatus may be a local storage server belonging to the LAN .

Operations of the cooperation system are described with reference to . First a basic flow of the cooperation operation that is controlled by the portable device is described with reference to . The control program of the portable device displays a cooperation operation selection screen on the display S . illustrates an example of the cooperation operation selection screen. The cooperation operation selection screen shown in includes one or more cooperation operation icons. The cooperation operation icon is denoted with a cooperation operation ID for identifying the cooperation operation list stored in the data storage area B.

Then when the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping a position of the cooperation operation icon S Yes the control program reads out a cooperation operation list identified with the cooperation operation ID denoted at the cooperation operation icon from the data storage area B S . The processing of step S is an example of the reception processing of receiving a start instruction to start the cooperation operation. Also the processing of step S is an example of the reception processing of receiving a selection instruction to select the cooperation operation identification information and the start instruction. Further the processing of step S is an example of the acquisition processing.

Also the control program displays a cooperation operation screen on the display S . illustrate examples of the cooperation operation screen. The cooperation operation screens shown in include status images corresponding to the first apparatuses and second apparatus included in the cooperation operation list acquired in step S a variety of icons added to the respective status images and a cancel icon for ending the cooperation operation indicated on the cooperation operation screen. The processing of step S is an example of the display control processing. The cooperation operation screen is an example of the status screen.

In the status images to the apparatus IDs included in the cooperation operation list and progressing statuses associated with the apparatus IDs are indicated. That is the information indicated in the status images to is changed as the cooperation operation progresses. More specifically the progressing statuses indicated in the status images to shown in correspond to the progressing statuses included in the cooperation operation list shown in . Also the status images to are arranged in accordance with execution sequences of the cooperation operation list.

In the cooperation operation screens shown in the status image represents a progressing status of the first operation that is executed by the server apparatus identified with the apparatus ID server A . The status image represents a progressing status of the first operation that is executed by the multi function device A identified with the apparatus ID MFC A . The status image represents a progressing status of the first operation that is executed by the multi function device B identified with the apparatus ID MFC B . The status image represents a progressing status of the second operation that is executed by the multi function device C identified with the apparatus ID MFC C .

The icons that can be added to the status images to include a C icon an E icon a Re icon and a D icon for example. The C icon is an example of the stop instruction object for receiving a stop instruction to stop an operation that is executed by a corresponding apparatus. The E icon is an example of the correction instruction object for receiving an instruction to correct an operation content of an operation that is executed by a corresponding apparatus. The Re icon is an example of the resumption instruction object for receiving a resumption instruction to resume a stopped operation. The D icon is an example of the deletion instruction object for receiving a deletion instruction to delete the target data that has been already received from a corresponding first apparatus. Also the C icon and the D icon are examples of the change instruction object for receiving a change instruction to change an operation that is executed by a corresponding apparatus.

In the meantime the icons added to the respective status images to are changed in accordance with the progressing statuses of the operations indicated in the status images to . Specifically as shown in the status images of the first and second apparatuses of which the progressing statuses are operation standby are added with the C icon and the E icon. The status images of the first and second apparatuses of which the progressing statuses are under operation are added with the C icon. The status image of the first apparatus of which the progressing status is operation completed is added with the D icon. The status image of the second apparatus of which the progressing status is operation completed is not added with the icon. The status image of the first apparatus of which the progressing status is under suspension is added with the Re icon and the D icon. The status image of the second apparatus of which the progressing status is under suspension is added with the Re icon. The status images of the first and second apparatuses of which the progressing statuses are cancel are added with the Re icon and the E icon.

Then the control program enables each of the first apparatuses to execute the first operation in the execution sequence indicated in the cooperation operation list S to S . Specifically the control program initializes a parameter m S . When OFF is set for the standby flag of the m th first apparatus of the cooperation operation list S Yes the control program transmits operation instruction information to the first apparatus through the communication interface S . The operation instruction information is information for enabling a destination apparatus to execute a corresponding operation. The processing of step S and step S is an example of the operation instruction processing. The details of the operation instruction processing will be described later.

Subsequently the control program changes the progressing status of the m th first apparatus from operation standby to under operation S and hides the E icon added to the status image of the first apparatus. That is the control program adds the E icon to the status image of the first apparatus after the position of the cooperation operation icon is tapped until the operation instruction information is transmitted to the first apparatus S Yes to S . In the meantime when the operation instruction information is transmitted to the first apparatus S the control program hides the E icon added to the status image of the first apparatus.

Then the control program suspends execution of subsequent processing until transmission completion information is received from the m th first apparatus through the communication interface S No . Also the control program sequentially receives the target data which has been divided into multiple data from the first apparatus through the communication interface and stores the same in the data storage area B until the transmission completion information is received from the first apparatus S No .

The transmission completion information is information indicating that transmission of the target data to the portable device of the first operation to be executed by the first apparatus is completed. That is when the transmission completion information is received from the first apparatus through the communication interface the control program determines that the reception of the target data from the first apparatus is completed. Although the specific example of the transmission completion information is not particularly limited it may be a packet in which ON is set for a FIN flag of a Transmission Control Protocol hereinafter also referred to as TCP header.

Subsequently when the transmission completion information is received from the m th first apparatus through the communication interface S Yes the control program changes the progressing status of the first apparatus from under operation to operation completed S hides the C icon added to the status image of the first apparatus and newly adds the D icon to the status image.

That is the control program adds the C icon to the status image of the first apparatus after the position of the cooperation operation icon is tapped until the transmission completion information is received from the first apparatus S Yes to S No . On the other hand when the transmission completion information is received from the first apparatus S Yes the control program hides the C icon added to the status image of the first apparatus. Also when the transmission completion information is received from the first apparatus S Yes the control program adds the D icon to the status image of the first apparatus.

Then when the first operation not executed yet is included in the cooperation operation list S Yes the control program increments the parameter m by 1 one S and again executes the processing of steps S to S. That is in step S that is repeatedly executed the control program transmits the operation instruction information to each of the first apparatuses in the execution sequence indicated in the cooperation operation list.

When all the first operations registered in the cooperation operation list are executed S Yes the control program hides all the icons added to the status image of the first apparatus S . That is the control program adds the Re icon and the D icon to the status image until the reception of the target data from all the other first apparatuses is completed S No . On the other hand when the reception of the target data from all the other first apparatuses is completed S Yes the control program hides the Re icon and the D icon added to the status image .

Subsequently when all the first apparatuses registered in the cooperation operation list are enabled to execute the first operation the control program enables each of the second apparatuses to execute the second operation in the execution sequence indicated in the cooperation operation list S to S . Since the processing of step S to S is common to the processing of steps S to S the detailed descriptions thereof are omitted and the differences are described.

First when the operation instruction information is transmitted to the second apparatus through the communication interface S the control program changes the progressing status of the second apparatus from operation standby to under operation S and hides the E icon added to the status image of the second apparatus. That is the control program adds the E icon to the status image of the second apparatus after the position of the cooperation operation icon is tapped until the operation instruction information is transmitted to the second apparatus S Yes to S . On the other hand when the operation instruction information is transmitted to the second apparatus S the control program hides the E icon added to the status image of the second apparatus.

Also the control program sequentially transmits the target data which has been divided into multiple data to the second apparatus through the communication interface until reception completion information is received from the n th second apparatus through the communication interface in step S. The reception completion information is information indicating that the reception of the target data from the portable device of the second operation is completed. That is when the reception completion information is received from the second apparatus through the communication interface the control program determines that the transmission of the target data to the second apparatus is completed. Although the specific example of the reception completion information is not particularly limited it may be a packet in which ON is set for a FIN flag and an ACK flag of a TCP header.

Further when the progressing status of the n th second apparatus is changed from under operation to operation completed in step S the control program hides the C icon added to the status image of the second apparatus. That is the control program adds the C icon to the status image of the second apparatus after the position of the cooperation operation icon is tapped until the reception completion information is received from the second apparatus S Yes to S No . On the other hand when the reception completion information is received from the second apparatus S Yes the control program hides the C icon added to the status image of the second apparatus. Then when all the second operations registered in the cooperation operation list have been executed S No the control program ends the cooperation operation control processing.

In the illustrative embodiment the user s operation of tapping the positions of the various icons added to the status images can be received on the user interface while the cooperation operation described with reference to is being executed. The processing which is executed when the position of each icon is tapped at timing shown in is described in detail with reference to .

First when the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping a position of the cooperation operation icon the control program changes all the progressing statuses of the cooperation operation list identified with the cooperation operation ID denoted at the tapped cooperation operation icon to operation standby as shown in . Also the control program displays the cooperation operation screen shown in on the display in accordance with the cooperation operation list shown in S . In the cooperation operation screen shown in the progressing statuses of all the status images to are operation standby and all the status images to are added with the C icon and the E icon.

Subsequently the control program transmits the operation instruction information to the server apparatus of which execution sequence is first through the communication interface S . This operation instruction information is an instruction to transmit target data stored in the server apparatus to the portable device . Also as shown in the control program changes the progressing status of the apparatus ID server A from operation standby to under operation. Further as shown in the control program changes the progressing status of the status image from operation standby to under operation and hides the E icon added to the status image .

Meanwhile the server apparatus having received the operation instruction information from the portable device executes the first operation of transmitting the target data to the portable device S . The control program of the portable device stores the target data which has been received from the server apparatus through the communication interface in the data storage area B. Then when the transmission of the target data to the portable device is completed the server apparatus transmits the transmission completion information to the portable device S .

When the user interface receives the user s operation of tapping the position of the C icon added to the status image S before the transmission completion information is received from the server apparatus through the communication interface for example the control program of the portable device executes cancel processing S . The cancel processing of the illustrative embodiment is an example of the change processing of excluding operation information of a corresponding apparatus from the cooperation operation list. The cancel processing is described in detail with reference to .

First the control program determines whether the operation instruction information has been already transmitted to the apparatus corresponding to the tapped C icon S . In this illustrative embodiment when the user interface receives the user s operation of tapping the position of the C icon corresponding to the multi function device A S No before the operation instruction information is transmitted the control program excludes the operation information of the multi function device A from the cooperation operation list S . Specifically as shown in the control program makes the execution sequence corresponding to the apparatus ID MFC A blank and moves up the execution sequences of the subsequent operations.

Also as shown in the control program changes the progressing status corresponding to the apparatus ID MFC A from operation standby to cancel S . Accompanied by this the control program changes the progressing status of the status image from operation standby to cancel and adds the Re icon instead of the C icon to the status image as shown in . That is in this illustrative embodiment when the position of the C icon corresponding to an apparatus before the operation instruction information is transmitted is tapped the Re icon is added to the corresponding status image. In the meantime processing which is executed when the position of the C icon corresponding to an apparatus having already transmitted the operation instruction information is tapped Yes in S S S will be described in a modified embodiment.

When the transmission completion information is received from the server apparatus through the communication interface S the control program transmits the operation instruction information to the multi function device B of which the execution sequence is second through the communication interface S . This operation instruction information is an instruction to enable the scanner unit to execute the scan processing and to transmit the target data generated in the scan processing to the portable device .

Also as shown in the control program changes the progressing status corresponding to the apparatus ID server A from under operation to operation completed and changes the progressing status corresponding to the apparatus ID MFC B from operation standby to under operation. Accompanied by this as shown in the control program changes the progressing status of the status image from under operation to operation completed and adds the D icon rather than C icon to the status image . Also as shown in the control program changes the progressing status of the status image from operation standby to under operation and hides the E icon of the status image .

The control program of the multi function device B having received the operation instruction information from the portable device through the communication interface executes the first operation of transmitting the target data generated in the scan processing to the portable device S . The control program of the portable device stores the target data received from the multi function device B through the communication interface in the data storage area B. When the transmission of the target data to the portable device is completed the control program of the multi function device B transmits the transmission completion information to the portable device S .

When the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping a position of the Re icon added to the status image S before the transmission completion information is received from the multi function device B through the communication interface for example the control program of the portable device executes resumption processing S . In this illustrative embodiment the resumption processing is an example of the registration processing of re adding the operation information of a corresponding apparatus to the cooperation operation list. The resumption processing is described in detail with reference to .

First the control program determines whether the operation instruction information has been already transmitted to the apparatus corresponding to the tapped Re icon S . In this illustrative embodiment since the operation instruction information has not been transmitted yet to the multi function device A S No the control program re adds the operation information of the multi function device A to the cooperation operation list S . Specifically as shown in the control program sets the execution sequence corresponding to the apparatus ID MFC A to a third and sets the execution sequence corresponding to the apparatus ID MFC C to a fourth.

Also the control program changes the progressing status corresponding to the apparatus ID MFC A from cancel to operation standby S . Accompanied by this the control program changes the progressing status of the status image from cancel to operation standby and adds the C icon rather than the Re icon to the status image as shown in . In the meantime processing which is executed when the position of the Re icon corresponding to the apparatus having already transmitted the operation instruction information is tapped Yes in S S S will be described in a modified embodiment.

The execution sequence of the first operation of reregistering the operation information in the cooperation operation list in step S is not particularly limited inasmuch as it is executed before the second operation. That is the corresponding operation may be executed after the first operation being currently executed or after the final first operation. This is also the same for the execution sequence of the second operation of reregistering the operating information in the cooperation operation list in step S.

Subsequently when the transmission completion information is received from the multi function device B through the communication interface S the control program transmits the operation instruction information to the multi function device A of which the execution sequence is third through the communication interface S . This operation instruction information is an instruction to enable the scanner unit to execute the scan processing and to transmit the target data generated in the scan processing to the portable device . In the meantime since the processing of updating the cooperation operation list and cooperation operation screen which is executed as the operation instruction information is transmitted to the multi function device A is common to the above example the overlapping description is here omitted.

The control program of the multi function device A having received the operation instruction information from the portable device through the communication interface executes the first operation of transmitting the target data generated in the scan processing to the portable device S . The control program of the portable device stores the target data received from the multi function device A through the communication interface in the data storage area B. Then when the transmission of the target data to the portable device is completed the control program of the multi function device B transmits the transmission completion information to the portable device S .

When the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping the position of the D icon added to the status image S before the transmission completion information is received from the multi function device A through the communication interface for example the control program of the portable device deletes the target data stored in the data storage area B S . The processing of step S is an example of the deletion processing. That is the target data is not transmitted to the multi function device C in step S which will be described later.

Subsequently when the transmission completion information is received from the multi function device A through the communication interface S the control program hides all the icons added to the status images to . Also the control program transmits the operation instruction information to the multi function device D of which the execution sequence is fourth through the communication interface S . This operation instruction information is an instruction to enable the printer unit to receive the target data from the portable device and to execute the recording processing of the target data . Further the control program transmits the target data to the multi function device C through the communication interface . Since the processing of updating the cooperation operation list and cooperation operation screen which is executed as the operation instruction information is transmitted to the multi function device C is common to the above example the overlapping description is here omitted.

The control program of the multi function device C having received the operation instruction information from the portable device through the communication interface executes the second operation of receiving the target data from the portable device and enabling the printer unit to record images represented by the target data on a recording sheet S . Also when the reception of the target data from the portable device through the communication interface is completed the control program transmits the reception completion information to the portable device through the communication interface S . In the meantime the reception completion information may also be transmitted before the recording processing by the printer unit is completed.

According to the above illustrative embodiment when the operation instruction information is transmitted the E icon is set to be unselectable and when the transmission completion information or reception completion information is received the C icon is set to be unselectable. That is since the states of the corresponding E icon and C icon are changed in correspondence to the progressing statuses of the operations of the respective apparatuses it is possible to enable the user to easily recognize whether it is possible to change the operation of each apparatus. That is it is possible to implement a user interface for easily changing the operation of each apparatus individually. In the above illustrative embodiment the processing that is executed when the positions of the various icons corresponding to the first apparatus are tapped has been described. However the description also applies to a case where the positions of the various icons corresponding to the second apparatus are tapped. The processing of modified embodiment which will be described later is also the same.

In particular according to the above illustrative embodiment when the cooperation operation is executed based on the cooperation operation list including an unnecessary operation it is possible to selectively exclude only the unnecessary operation by the C icon during the execution of the cooperation operation. Also it is possible to delete the target data which is acquired by the unnecessary first operation by the D icon. Further it is possible to re add a falsely excluded operation to the cooperation operation by the Re icon. As a result it is possible to optimize the cooperation operation without re executing the cooperation operation from the beginning.

In the above illustrative embodiment when the variety of icons are displayed on the cooperation operation screen they can be selected at all times and when the icons are hidden they cannot be selected. However the method of disabling the various icons from being selected is not limited thereto. That is the variety of icons may be displayed in an unselectable aspect as such by displaying the icon on the cooperation operation screen in a grayed out mode. In the meantime the description a state where an icon can be selected conveys the meaning that the processing associated with the icon is executed by the tapping operation and the like for example. In the meantime the description a state where an icon is set to be unselectable conveys the meaning that the processing associated with the icon is not executed by the tapping operation and the like for example.

Also the function which is implemented by tapping the position of the C icon is not limited to the example of the above illustrative embodiment. For example when the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping the position of the C icon corresponding to all the first apparatuses the control program may stop the operation instruction processing S for the second apparatus. As another example in the change processing that is executed when the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping the position of the C icon corresponding to all the second apparatuses the control program may transmit stop instruction information which will be described later to all the first apparatuses being executing the first operation through the communication interface .

That is when one of all the first operations and all the second operations are cancelled it is not necessary to execute the other operations. That is when the position of the C icon corresponding to all the first operations or all the second operations is tapped the cooperation operation is preferably ended. In the meantime when only one first or second apparatus is included in the cooperation operation list the control program may set the C icon corresponding to the apparatus that is unselectable. In this case the user who wants to end the cooperation operation has only to tap the position of the cancel icon.

Meanwhile in the above illustrative embodiment a next operation is enabled to start after one operation is completed. However the start timing of each operation is not limited thereto. For example the control program of the portable device may transmit the operation instruction information to all the first apparatuses through the communication interface without waiting for the reception of the transmission completion information. Then when the transmission completion information is received from all the first apparatuses through the communication interface the control program may transmit the operation instruction information to all the second apparatuses through the communication interface without waiting for the reception of the reception completion information. Thereby since the plurality of first operations or the plurality of second operations is executed in parallel the throughput of the cooperation operation is improved.

Also in the above illustrative embodiment one of the cooperation operation lists registered in advance is selected on the cooperation operation selection screen so that the cooperation operation is enabled to start. Thereby the operation registered in advance in the cooperation operation list can be deleted or changed after the cooperation operation starts. At this time the input method of the start instruction and the acquisition method of the cooperation operation list are not limited to the above examples.

As an example when the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping a position of a start instruction icon not shown of the cooperation operation after the user interface receives the user s operation of tapping the position of the cooperation operation icon in step S the control program may start the cooperation operation. In this case the processing of receiving the tapping operation two times and starting the cooperation operation is another example of the reception processing of receiving the selection instruction and the start instruction.

As another example the selection of the first apparatus and the second apparatus the selection of the operation to be executed by each apparatus the designation of the execution sequence of each operation and the input of the start instruction may be performed on one screen. That is the description the cooperation operation list is acquired in step S conveys the meaning of reading out the cooperation operation list registered in advance from the data storage area B or acquiring the cooperation operation list from the user through the user interface .

A modified embodiment of the operation of the cooperation system is described with reference to . In the meantime the common elements of the above illustrative embodiment are denoted with the same reference numerals the descriptions thereof are omitted and the differences are mainly described.

For example when the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping the position of the C icon of the apparatus ID server A S on the cooperation operation screen shown in before the transmission completion information is received from the server apparatus through the communication interface the control program of the portable device executes the cancel processing S . The cancel processing of the modified embodiment is an example of the change processing of stopping an operation being executed in a corresponding apparatus. The cancel processing is described in detail with reference to .

When the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping the position of the C icon corresponding to the server apparatus having already transmitted the operation instruction information S Yes the control program transmits stop instruction information to the server apparatus through the communication interface S . The stop instruction information is information for enabling an apparatus of a transmission destination to stop an operation being executed.

Also as shown in the control program changes the progressing status corresponding to the apparatus ID server A from under operation to under suspension S . Accompanied by this the control program changes the progressing status of the status image from under operation to under suspension and adds the Re icon and D icon rather than the C icon to the status image as shown in . That is in the modified embodiment when the position of the C icon corresponding to the apparatus having transmitted the operation instruction information is tapped the Re icon and the D icon are added to the corresponding status image.

The server apparatus having received the stop instruction information from the portable device stops the first operation being executed S and transmits resumption information to the portable device S . The resumption information is information for specifying a resumption position of the first operation. For example the resumption information may be information for specifying a position of target data of which transmission is completed or information for specifying a position of target data that is to be transmitted next time.

Subsequently the control program of the portable device stores the resumption information received from the server apparatus through the communication interface in the data storage area B and stands by until the user interface receives a user s input operation. In the meantime when predetermined standby time elapses after the position of the C icon is tapped or when predetermined standby time elapses after the resumption information is received the control program may start an operation that should be executed subsequently to the operation under suspension. Also when the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping the position of the D icon the control program may delete the target data which has been received by the first operation under suspension from the data storage area B and start an operation that should be executed subsequently to the first operation.

Then when the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping the position of the Re icon which corresponds to the server apparatus in which the first operation is under suspension within a standby time period S the control program executes the resumption processing S . The resumption processing of the modified embodiment is an example of the resumption instruction processing of resuming an operation under suspension in a corresponding apparatus. The resumption processing is described in detail with reference to .

When the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping the position of the Re icon corresponding to the server apparatus having already transmitted the operation instruction information S Yes the control program transmits the resumption instruction information to the server apparatus through the communication interface S . The resumption instruction information is information for enabling an apparatus of a transmission destination to resume an operation under suspension. The resumption instruction information includes the resumption information stored in the data storage area B for example. The server apparatus having received the resumption instruction information from the portable device resumes the first operation from the resumption position specified by the resumption information S .

Also the control program of the portable device changes the progressing status corresponding to the apparatus ID server A from under suspension to under operation as shown in S . Accompanied by this the control program changes the progressing status of the status image from under suspension to under operation and adds the C icon rather than the Re icon and D icon to the status image as shown in .

Subsequently when the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping the position of the E icon added to the status image S before the transmission completion information is received from the server apparatus through the communication interface the control program executes correction processing S . The correction processing is processing of correcting an operation content of an operation to be executed by a corresponding apparatus. The correction processing is described in detail with reference to .

First as shown in the control program sets ON for the standby flag of the apparatus ID MFC A corresponding to the tapped E icon S . Then the control program displays a correction reception screen rather than the cooperation operation screen on the display S . illustrates an example of the correction reception screen. The correction reception screen shown in includes the setting information registered in the cooperation operation list an icon for receiving correction of each setting information and an OK icon. When the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping a position of the icon on the correction reception screen the control program receives an input of corrected setting information. Although the specific input method of the setting information is not particularly limited the setting information may be selected from a pull down menu for example.

Subsequently when the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping a position of the OK icon S Yes the control program changes an operation content of the apparatus ID MFC A of the cooperation operation list to the corrected operation content received through the correction reception screen S . Also the control program displays the cooperation operation screen rather than the correction reception screen on the display . Further as shown in the control program sets OFF for the standby flag corresponding to the apparatus ID MFC A S .

In the meantime when the transmission completion information is received from the server apparatus through the communication interface S No at timing at which the correction reception screen is displayed on the display i.e. before the position of the OK icon on the correction reception screen is tapped the control program stands by for the transmission of the operation instruction information to the multi function device A. Then when the user interface receives a user s operation of tapping the position of the OK icon on the correction reception screen S Yes i.e. when the display of the correction reception screen is over in other words when OFF is set for the standby flag S Yes the control program transmits the operation instruction information to the multi function device A through the communication interface S .

According to the modified embodiment since it is possible to individually correct the falsely set operation content it is not necessary to again execute the cooperation operation from the beginning. Also while ON is set for the standby flag i.e. while the operation content is being corrected the operation instruction information is not transmitted to the apparatus. Therefore it is possible to prevent the operation from starting based on the falsely set operation content. In the modified embodiment the cooperation operation is under suspension while ON is set for the standby flag. However the control of the cooperation operation is not limited thereto. For example the operation in which ON is set for the standby flag may be skipped over and a subsequent operation may be first executed.

Also according to the above modified embodiment it is possible to enable an apparatus under operation to temporarily stop the operation by tapping the position of the C icon and to resume the operation by tapping the position of the Re icon. Also since the stopped operation is resumed from the middle of the operation based on the resumption information the decrease in the throughput of the cooperation operation is suppressed. The resumption control on the operation by the resumption information is particularly effective for the second apparatus configured to execute the second operation of recording images on a plurality of recording media for example. For example when the operation is stopped at timing at which images are recorded on two sheets of 10 recording sheets an image may be recorded on a third recording sheet and thereafter upon the resumption.

In the above illustrative embodiment the variety of programs stored in the program storage area A A of the storage of the multi function device or portable device are executed by the CPU so that the respective processing to be executed by the control unit of the present disclosure is implemented. However the configuration of the control unit is not limited thereto and a part or all of the configurations may be implemented by hardware such as IC abbreviation of Integrated Circuit .

Further the present disclosure can be implemented not only by the multi function device or portable device but also by a program configured to enable the multi function device or portable device to execute the processing. The program may be provided with being recorded in a non transitory recording medium. The non transitory recording medium may include a storage mounted to a server that can be connected to the multi function device or portable device through the communication network in addition to a CD ROM a DVD ROM and the like. The program stored in the storage of the server apparatus may be delivered through the communication network such as the Internet as information or signal representing the program.
