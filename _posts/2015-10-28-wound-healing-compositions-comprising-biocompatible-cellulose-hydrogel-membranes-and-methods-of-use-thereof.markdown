This application is a divisional of U.S. Nonprovisional application Ser. No. 13 295 515 filed Nov. 14 2011 which claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 450 251 filed Mar. 8 2011 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

This invention was made with U.S. Government support under contract number X81XWH 09 2 0173. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

The field of the invention relates to wound healing and compositions and methods that are useful to treat wounds. More particularly the field relates to compositions comprising cellulose hydrogel membranes that are useful to treat wounds including ocular wounds.

Wounds that do not heal readily can cause a subject considerable physical emotional and social distress as well as significant financial expense. In addition wounds that are not properly treated shortly after injury have an increased incidence of complications and a longer recovery and sometimes do not heal properly. Wounds that fail to heal properly and become infected often require excision of the affected tissue.

The most commonly used treatment for wound healing involves the use of wound dressings. Wound dressings are typically occlusive and provide a moist environment to facilitate healing. Numerous types of wound dressings are now in use.

Ocular wounds are particularly challenging wounds to treat. Ocular injuries are common especially in certain work environments and have potential to cause significant morbidity and disability. Workers who have the highest risk of eye injuries include fabricators laborers equipment operators repair workers and production and precision workers. More than one half of work related eye injuries occur in the manufacturing service and construction industries. Most chemical and thermal eye injuries occur when persons are at work. Injuries can range from mild damage to ocular surface from foreign material to severe penetrating trauma usually related to blast or projectile injury. Penetrating injuries often require primary surgical intervention to close the wounds and treatment or provision of prophylaxis against secondary ocular infection.

Ocular injury is also highly prevalent on the battlefield in combat situations. Despite the eye s seemingly insignificant size accounting for only 0.1 of the body s frontal silhouette the incidence of ocular injury in combat has been shown to be 20 to 50 times greater than expected by its surface area. Typical injuries include penetration from metallic fragments corneal laceration and corneal punctures.

In the military context current mitigation techniques for ocular injuries focus on prevention through routine use of eye shields which is not particularly successful. Treatment of injuries frequently requires donor tissue which is not always readily available especially in the theater of combat. Secondary repair and ocular reconstruction from battlefield injuries typically occurs at major military hospital settings. However access to adequate ophthalmic facilities for primary repair of penetrating injuries varies tremendously with the location and context of the military environment.

Hydrogels are water insoluble polymers having the ability to swell in water or aqueous solution without dissolution and to retain a significant portion of water or aqueous solution within its structure. Hydrogels can possess a degree of flexibility similar to natural tissue due to their significant water content and hydrogels can have various applications. Attempts have been made to improve upon certain properties of hydrogels for example to increase strength water content transparency permeability or biocompatibility properties often with mixed results. For example attempts have been made to optimize certain physical properties of hydrogels such as strength to suit various applications. However such increases in strength often come at the expense of other properties of the hydrogel such as transparency or water content.

A number of hydrogel compositions comprising synthetic or natural polymers have been discussed in the literature. There exists a need for improved compositions and methods comprising biocompatible hydrogel membranes to treat various types of wounds for example skin wounds ocular abrasions and ocular surface damage caused by particulates and or chemical exposure. There exists a further need for improved compositions and methods comprising biocompatible hydrogel membranes for tissue engineering applications such as ocular reconstruction following complex injury.

For example in some embodiments a surgeon must rely on the ability of the implantable material to not only accept suture without tearing during needle insertion but also to retain the suture without tearing away from the sutured edge of the implant. To perform suture retention strength studies cellulose hydrogel membrane samples can be cut from cellulose sheets. For example samples can be cut to be rectangles 2 cm 4 cm. The samples can be tested using a 500N capacity tabletop mechanical testing system 5942R4910 Instron with a 5N maximum static load cell 102608 Instron . Pneumatic side action grips can be used to secure the samples 2712 019 Instron . Before testing the thickness of the sample can be measured at three points along one of the short edges designated the top edge . The sample can then be secured in the stationary bottom pneumatic grip with half of the sample inside of the grip and a suture was threaded through the sample once in the center of the sample with a bite size of 2 mm from the top edge. For example Ethicon Ethilon 10 0 ophthalmic sutures can be used 7756G and 7711G Ethicon Inc. . Both ends of the suture can be secured in the movable top pneumatic grip. See for a diagram of the sample setup. Samples can be tested with a constant extension rate for example of 10 mm min until failure.

In some embodiments oxygen permeability of the cellulose hydrogel membrane can be tested using a polarographic method. This method directly measures the number of oxygen molecules diffusing though the material by measuring an electric current generated by the reduction of oxygen at the cathode. In a single polarographic determination four samples of the same material with different thicknesses can be used. This results in a linear relation between the inverse of oxygen transmissibility and the sample thickness. The sample can be placed onto the surface of the electrode cell fixed gently by pressing toward the electrode and retained with an o ring. Then a saline solution e.g. 0.9 NaCl pH 7.4 is poured into the reservoir on the material and the system is ready for the measurement of the electric current. The system is held in a humidity chamber at 35 C. with high humidity the polarographic cell and the saline solution were in the humidity chamber prior the measurement to achieve equilibrium conditions . The saline solution and the sample are saturated with atmospheric oxygen. To remove it nitrogen gas is bubbled through a glass frit while monitoring current until the current decreases to nearly zero. Once most of the oxygen is removed air is bubbled into the solution and the increase in electric current is observed as the oxygen molecules react with the cathode. The current is recorded until it reaches a stationary state.

Seven different types of cellulose were evaluated to determine suitable material for synthesis of a cellulose hydrogel.

The cellulose hydrogel was synthesized by activating 2 5 grams of cellulose powder in 100 ml N N dimethylacetamide DMAc and stirring for example at 350 rpm for 24 hours. In a separate beaker 8 grams of LiCl was dissolved in 100 ml DMAc and stirred at 350 rpm. The DMAc was decanted from the activated cellulose powder and the LiCl DMAc solution was poured onto the cellulose and stirred for 10 minutes. The resulting transparent solutions were poured into desired molds and allowed to gel overnight. The gels were de molded and washed in running water for several hours.

The hydrogels were subjected to various analyses including Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy FTIR X ray diffraction XRD and thermogravimetric analysis TGA to determine 1 whether there were any chemical differences between different varieties of cellulose 2 how different phases of cellulose compare raw powder wet hydrogel dry gel re wet gel and 3 whether the gels were washed successfully. As shown in there were no significant chemical differences between the varieties of cellulose and the washing procedure was successful.

X ray diffraction analysis was performed to determine whether there were any differences in crystallinity between the varieties of cellulose and how crystallinity compared between the raw powder and hydrogel phases. The degree of crystallinity I 1 I I was calculated according to Buschle Diller and Zeronian 45 967 1992 . The hydrogels are less crystalline than the raw powders .

The ratio of cellulose I to cellulose II was also investigated according to the method of Gindl and Keckes 46 10221 10225 2005 . The ratio of cellulose I II is significantly lower in the hydrogel phase and bacterial cellulose has a much greater cellulose I II ratio in the raw phase than the other varieties. The results are shown in Table 2 below.

Cellulose hydrogels prepared under different concentrations 2 3 4 and 5 g were analyzed by TA instrument Q5000 Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer TGA . All samples were heated from RT to 500 C at 20 C min under N2 purge. During the test sample weight change versus temperature was recorded. Derivatives of wt with regard to temperature dWt dT was used to probe the peak temperature for each thermal transition. The mass lost during the temperature increase reflected the water content. As shown in the range of water content obtained for the various wet hydrogels was about 91 95 . TGA analysis comparing dried re wet and never dried hydrogels is shown in .

The transparency of 100 micron thick cellulose hydrogels was also determined. Percent transmittance values were generated at a wavelength of 550 nm. The transparency of all cellulose hydrogels exceeded 95 in the visible range. The results are shown in .

The refractive index of the cellulose hydrogels was measured. The results are shown in Table 3 along with a comparison with various commercially available contact lenses.

The tear strength of cellulose hydrogels in three different states hydrated dehydrated and rehydrated was characterized. All samples were made to conform to the geometry stated in ASTM standard D 624 00 sample type C. Samples in the hydrated state were made by pouring the cellulose LiCl DMAc solution into a mold with the appropriate sample geometry. Cheesecloth was placed in the ends of the mold before pouring to assist in gripping the hydrated gels during testing. Hydrated samples were allowed to gel overnight washed in running tap water for 2 4 hours soaked in tap water with frequent water exchange for 24 48 hours and stored in tap water. Sheets of cellulose hydrogel were made by pouring the cellulose LiCl DMAc solution onto a glass plate and allowing to gel overnight. Sheets were dehydrated between glass plates lined with Teflon film in an oven above 100 C. for approximately 5 hours. The sheets were then rehydrated in tap water for several hours. Samples were cut from rehydrated sheets by hand and either returned to water rehydrated or allowed to air dry dehydrated . The thickness of all samples was measured prior to testing in three locations near the site of tearing at the apex above and below the apex and the three values were averaged to obtain the sample thickness. All samples were tested using a 500N capacity tabletop mechanical testing system 5942R4910 Instron with a 5N maximum static load cell 102608 Instron . Pneumatic side action grips were used to secure the samples 2712 019 Instron . Samples were tested with a constant extension rate of 2 mm min until failure. The tear strength was calculated as the force at failure divided by the average thickness N mm . Two different cellulose materials Avicel 101 and Aldrich 4 and two different concentrations 2 g and 5 g were characterized and compared in each state hydrated dehydrated and rehydrated . See . Tear strength of typical contact lenses is 0.37 0.49 N mm.

The suture retention strength of cellulose hydrogels was characterized as a measure of their surgical feasibility. Cellulose hydrogels in three states hydrated dehydrated and rehydrated were characterized. Samples were cut from cellulose sheets as described above. Samples were cut in rectangles 2 cm 4 cm. The testing procedure described by Trowbridge et al. was modified for use in this study Trowbridge E. A. Lawford P. V. and Crofts C. E. Pericardial heterografts a comparative study of suture pull out and tissue strength. 11 1989 311 14 . All samples were tested using a 500N capacity tabletop mechanical testing system 5942R4910 Instron with a 5N maximum static load cell 102608 Instron . Pneumatic side action grips were used to secure the samples 2712 019 Instron . Before testing the thickness of each sample was measured at three points along one of the short edges designated the top edge . The sample was then secured in the stationary bottom pneumatic grip with half of the sample inside of the grip and a suture was threaded through the sample once in the center of the sample with a bite size of 2 mm from the top edge. Ethicon Ethilon 10 0 ophthalmic sutures were used 7756G and 7711G Ethicon Inc. . Both ends of the suture were secured in the movable top pneumatic grip. shows a diagram of the sample setup and shows results of the testing. Samples were tested with a constant extension rate of 10 mm min until failure. The suture retention strength was taken to be the force at failure divided by the average sample thickness N mm .

Puncture strength was measured according to the method described by Radebaugh et al. Radebaugh et al. 45 1988 p 39 46 . A schematic of their setup is shown in and the fixture used for testing is shown in . Rather than fixing the hydrogel between two plates using screws which can pinch or tear the gel the hydrogels were secured to the fixture with cyanoacrylate. A hemispherical probe with a 2 mm diameter was lowered onto the gel at a rate of 2 or 10 mm min. Elongation to puncture was measured as

The tensile strength of the prepared wet cellulose hydrogels was measured using a 500N capacity tabletop mechanical testing system 5942R4910 Instron with a 5N maximum static load cell 102608 Instron . Pneumatic side action grips were used to secure the samples 2712 019 Instron . A constant extension rate of 2 mm min until failure was used and the tensile strength was calculated from the stress vs. strain data plots. Samples were prepared by pouring the cellulose LiCl DMAc solution into a dogbone mold as shown in . Cheesecloth was placed in both ends of the mold before pouring to assist in gripping the gels during testing. Samples were allowed to gel overnight washed in running tap water for 2 4 hours soaked in tap water with frequent water exchange for 24 48 hours and stored in tap water until use. Prior to testing the width and thickness of the hydrogel at the center of the dogbone as well as the gauge length were measured for all samples. Initially six different cellulose materials Avicel 101 Avicel 102 Avicel 105 Avicel 200 Aldrich 310697 and Aldrich 435236 at a concentration of 2 w v dry cellulose to LiCl DMAc solution were characterized. Avicel 101 and Aldrich 435236 were further characterized at varying concentrations 2 5 and varying stir times in the LiCl DMAc solution 5 30 minutes .

The transmittance of the cellulose hydrogels was measured in the range of wavelengths from 250 to 800 nm using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 9500 series UV visible spectrophotometer. As transmittance is dependent upon thickness the thickness of each sample was measured with calipers prior to loading the sample in the spectrophotometer. Transmittance values were then normalized to a thickness of 100 m according to

Oxygen permeability of the cellulose and collagen materials can be determined using a polarographic method. This method directly measures the number of oxygen molecules diffusing though the material by measuring an electric current generated by the reduction of oxygen at the cathode. In a single polarographic determination for example four samples of the same material with different thicknesses can be used. This results in a linear relation between the inverse of oxygen transmissibility and the sample thickness. The sample is placed onto the surface of the electrode cell fixed gently by pressing toward the electrode and retained with an o ring. Then a saline solution 0.9 NaCl pH 7.4 is poured into the reservoir on the material and the system is ready for measuring the electric current. The system is held in a humidity chamber at 35 C. with high humidity the polarographic cell and the saline solution are in the humidity chamber prior the measurement to achieve equilibrium conditions . The saline solution and the sample are saturated with atmospheric oxygen. To remove the oxygen nitrogen gas is bubbled through a glass frit while monitoring current until the current decreases to nearly zero. Once most of the oxygen is removed air is bubbled into the solution and the increase in electric current is observed as the oxygen molecules react with the cathode. The current is recorded until it reaches a stationary state.
