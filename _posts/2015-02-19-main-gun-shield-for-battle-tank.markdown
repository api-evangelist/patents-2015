title: Main gun shield for battle tank
abstract: A shield for mounting a 120 mm gun to a tank turret includes a casting with a through hole configured to receive the 120 mm gun. A mounting flange is disposed in the through hole for fixing the 120 mm gun to the casting. A pair of trunnions are defined by a combination of the casting and a pair of respective trunnion caps.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to military tanks and in particular to apparatus and methods for upgrading the main gun on a military tank.

The U.S. M60 series main battle tank includes a 105 mm main gun with a rifled barrel. There is a desire to upgrade the main gun on the M60 to a 120 mm gun with a smooth bore barrel. The main gun upgrade improves the lethality of the M60 series tanks. The 120 mm gun such as the M256 120 mm smooth bore gun will not fit in the existing shield casting for the M68 105 mm gun.

One method of upgrading the M60 to a 120 mm gun is to completely replace the turret with an M1A1 Abrams turret. This method involves a complete replacement of every component of the tank above the hull of the main battle tank. The new components include the M256 120 mm smooth bore gun fire control thermal sights ammunition storage and suspension.

Another method of upgrading the M60 to a 120 mm gun includes installing an Israeli Military Industries IMI 120 mm smooth bore gun into an up armored existing M60 turret as well as upgrading the engine armor and chassis of the tank.

A third method includes modifying the existing M60A3 shield casting which is the interface between the gun system and the turret. This method includes boring out the shield casting to accept the larger 120 mm M256 gun.

The known methods of upgrading the M60 to a 120 mm gun require extensive changes and expense. A need exists for a less complicated and less expensive apparatus and method for upgrading the M60 tank to a 120 mm gun.

One aspect of the invention is a shield for mounting a main gun to a tank turret. The shield has a central longitudinal axis. The shield includes a casting with a through hole to receive the main gun. A mounting flange is disposed in the through hole for fixing the gun to the casting. A pair of trunnions are defined by a combination of the casting and a pair of respective trunnion caps. The trunnions have an axis that is transverse to the central longitudinal axis.

A front surface of the casting includes a convex portion and a planar portion. A gunner s sight through bore is formed in the casting and has a longitudinal axis parallel to the central longitudinal axis. A small caliber weapon through bore is formed in the casting and has a longitudinal axis parallel to the central longitudinal axis.

A shroud is fixed to the casting and has a through hole configured to receive the gun. The shroud has a pair of bosses that interlock with a pair of protrusions in an interior of the casting.

The shield may include a first tube inserted in the gunner s sight through bore and a second tube inserted in the small caliber weapon through bore.

The pair of protrusions in the interior of the casting may fit in respective slots formed forward of the pair of bosses on the shroud. The shroud may be rotated with respect to the casting to interlock the bosses and protrusions. The shroud may cover the mounting flange in the casting. The perimeter of the shroud may have a contour that matches a contour of a perimeter of the through hole in the front surface of the casting.

Another aspect of the invention is a method that includes providing a monolithic casting with a through hole configured to receive a gun. The casting includes a flange disposed in the through hole for fixing the gun to the casting and a pair of protrusions formed in an interior of the casting.

The method includes providing a shroud having a through hole configured to receive the gun and having a pair of bosses. The shroud is fixed to the casting by rotating the shroud inside the casting so that the pair of bosses interlock with the pair of protrusions in the interior of the casting.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel shield for upgrading an M60 tank with a 120 mm gun uses the existing shield interfaces on the M60 tank. The novel shield includes a monolithic casting made of armor steel. The casting has features that may be formed by casting or by machining or a combination of both. A second smaller casting functions as a shroud for the shield. The shroud protects portions of the shield. The shield is the main interface between the tank turret and the main gun . The shield includes interfaces for the gunner s sight the coaxial weapon the resolver and the fire control system. The shield and shroud mimic the exterior shape of an M60 tank having a 105 mm gun to thereby maintain the tank s visual signature.

As shown in the novel shield includes a shield casting having a through hole configured to receive the 120 mm gun . The shield casting has a central longitudinal axis A. A mounting flange is disposed in the through hole for fixing the cradle not shown of the 120 mm gun to the casting . A pair of trunnions are defined by a combination of the casting and a pair of respective trunnion caps . The trunnions have an axis B that is transverse to the central longitudinal axis A. The trunnions receive the trunnion pins not shown that are fixed to the turret . The elevation of the gun is be adjusted by rotating the gun about axis B.

A front surface of the casting includes a convex portion and a planar portion . A gunner s sight through bore is formed in the casting and has a longitudinal axis C parallel to the central longitudinal axis A. A small caliber weapon through bore is formed in the casting and has a longitudinal axis D parallel to the central longitudinal axis A. The small caliber weapon may be for example a 7.62 mm or .50 caliber weapon. The horizontal offset of axis C of bore from axis A is preferably the same distance X as the horizontal offset of axis D of bore from axis A.

A shroud is removably fixed to the casting and has a through hole configured to receive the 120 mm gun . The shroud includes a pair of bosses that interlock with a pair of protrusions in an interior of the casting . The pair of protrusions fit in respective slots formed forward of the pair of bosses . After gun is inserted and fixed to shield casting shroud fits over gun and is inserted in hole in the front surface of casting . Shroud is then rotated a quarter turn inside casting so that protrusions in casting lock into slots forward of bosses on shroud . Shroud is then fastened to casting using for example threaded fasteners fixed in holes .

The contour of the perimeter of the shroud is configured to mate with or complement the contour of the perimeter of the opening in the front surface of casting . The mating surfaces create the appearance of a continuous surface. Shroud protects mounting flange from for example hostile fire. Shroud is easily removable for access to the interior of casting . Shroud is much simpler to install and remove than prior art devices which often included many separate pieces bolted to the turret.

Compared to prior art shields the inventive shield assembly and shroud have fewer parts fewer fasteners require dramatically less welding to install and weigh less. The assembly and shroud maintain the shape of the turret interface area of a tank having a 105 mm gun thereby keeping the tank appearance and signature similar. The shroud matches the contour of the shield assembly to provide sleek and uniform transitions between surfaces.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
