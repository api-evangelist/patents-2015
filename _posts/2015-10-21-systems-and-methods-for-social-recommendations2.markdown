The present application is a non provisional of and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 62 067 355 filed on Oct. 22 2014 and 62 108 953 filed on Jan. 28 2015 the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Existing social networking websites or applications are investing efforts in making recommendations to their users in many aspects of our daily life. Some recommendations are results from a combination of marketing strategies website operation strategies and a universal collection of opinions or comments from a wide variety of users. A proper recommendation or non recommendation can be informative and helpful while a less proper recommendation or non recommendation on the contrary can be misleading and sometimes destructive.

Undeniably variations exist in making a recommendation regarding an item. A highly recommended item by a large number of strangers doesn t necessarily ensure that the item is going to be a good fit for a specific user whereas going through each individual recommendation in detail is a time consuming and inefficient way of finding out the result. A less popular item may very possibly be a good fit to a specific user if it is recommended by someone reliable or known to the user. There is an obvious need for an easy to use and efficient system to fill these existing gaps in making accurate and reliable recommendation.

Described herein are systems methods and media for making social recommendations. The present invention focuses not only on the recommendation but also the recommender and the relationship and similarity between the recommender and the user receiving a recommendation in order to ensure the accuracy and reliability in the recommendation. The present invention takes into account a degree of similarity between the recommender and the user receiving the recommendation. Such degree of similarity is analyzed within a full spectrum or any selected partial range of interests of the recommender and the user. The present invention further allows rating of an item via a gamified rating model. With this gamified model the rating can be performed conveniently within a social recommendation application using one or more games. Only simple interactions with an input device are needed from a user e.g. a touch screen in order to complete a rating. A rating of an item that has not been directly experienced by a user is also collected by pre checking the impression regarding these items. Such aforementioned ratings are used in generating a recommendation or a non recommendation by the social recommendation application. Further the present invention makes recommendation to a group of users based on their mutual similarity in interests and their average social distance to the recommender. The present invention also enables the user or the group of users to solicit advices with simple to use and structured message. The user or the group of users can directly select or modify predetermined questions in the structured message to their friends or friends of friends. The replies can also be directly selected or modified from predetermined common answers. The present invention provides systems methods and media that allow making or receiving a recommendation to be easy efficient accurate and reliable.

Unless otherwise defined all technical terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. As used in this specification and the appended claims the singular forms a an and the include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Any reference to or herein is intended to encompass and or unless otherwise stated.

Described herein are systems methods and media for making social recommendations. The present invention focuses not only on the recommendation but also the recommender and the relationship and similarity between the recommender and the user receiving a recommendation in order to ensure the accuracy and reliability in the recommendation. The present invention takes into account a degree of similarity between the recommender and the user receiving the recommendation. Such degree of similarity is analyzed within a full spectrum or any selected partial range of interests of the recommender and the user. The present invention further allows rating of an item via a gamified rating model. With this gamified model the rating can be performed conveniently within a social recommendation application using one or more games. Only simple interactions with an input device are needed from a user e.g. a touch screen in order to complete a rating. A rating of an item that has not been directly experienced by a user is also collected by pre checking the impression regarding these items. Such aforementioned ratings are used in generating a recommendation or a non recommendation by the social recommendation application. Further the present invention makes recommendation to a group of users based on their mutual similarity in interests and their average social distance to the recommender. The present invention also enables the user or the group of users to solicit advices with simple to use and structured message. The user or the group of users can directly select or modify predetermined questions in the structured message to their friends or friends of friends. The replies can also be directly selected or modified from predetermined common answers. The present invention provides systems methods and media that allow making or receiving a recommendation to be easy efficient accurate and reliable.

In certain embodiments the systems media and methods described herein include a social distance an average social distance or use of the same. In some embodiments the social distance is calculated by determining how close the social relationship is between two users i.e. mutual friend friend of friend or nth degree contact. In some embodiments the two users are 1degree contact i.e. mutual friends 2degree contact i.e. friend of friend or 3degree contact friend of friend of friend or ndegree contact. n is an integer greater than 0 but less than 10. In some embodiments the social distance equals n when the two users are the nth degree of contact to each other. In some embodiments the social distance equals 1 when the two users are mutual friends and the social distance equals 2 when the two users are friends of friend.

In certain embodiments the average social distance is calculated by determining how close the social relationship is between a non group user and a group of users. In certain embodiments the social distance between each member of the group of user and the non group user are calculated individually and the average social distance is calculated as the average of the individual social distances between each member of the group of users and the non group user. In further embodiments the average social distance is a finite number or a finite decimal number. For example a group of users has 3 members 2 of them are 2degree contact with a non group user and the other one member is a 3degree contact with the non group user. The average social distance between this group of users and the non group user is 2.33. In some embodiments the closer the social relationship the smaller the social distance.

In various embodiments the calculation of social distance has a further thresholding or weighting mechanism determined by a social recommendation application or manually selected by a user. Such thresholding or weighting mechanism emphasizes users that are in close social relationship to each other. In further embodiments the social distance is equal to n when n is less than or equal to 3 4 5 6 7 8 or 9. In some embodiments the social distance is set to one or more predetermined values when the social distance is not less than 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10. For example a social recommendation application sets a social distance to be 10 when the two users are not friends or friend of friend to emphasize a close social relationship between the two users.

In some embodiments the calculation of social distance is based on social relationships i.e. friend friend of friend nth degree contact obtained from one or more selected from an external social network an external social graph an email contact list an online messaging contact list a mobile phone contact list an internal social network social graph or contact list in a social recommendation application. In further embodiments the external social network or social graph are obtained from social networking websites online messaging or chat applications microblog contact lists or online calling applications. In further embodiments non limiting examples of external websites includes Facebook Twitter Google Yahoo massager MSN massager GTalk Renren ICQ Wechat Jabber Neighbors AIM Skype Ebuddy Kik messenger or the like.

In some embodiments even if the social relationship may look the same different weightings can be given to the identical social relationships obtained from different sources. In further embodiments higher weighting is given to social relationships defined within a social recommendation application over external sources. In other embodiments higher weighting is given to social relationships from a source that has a larger number of contacts or a more complete social network or social graph. For example a user has 80 contacts in Facebook but only 5 contacts in Twitter. Thus the weighting of the social relationship in Facebook is higher than that of Twitter. In some embodiments higher weighting is given to social relationships selected based on a user s preference. In some embodiments higher weighting is given to the social relationships that overlap among different sources. In some embodiments when the social relationship is the same higher weighting in a social relationship indicates a closer social distance. For example the user has user X as friend in 3 different sources i.e. Facebook Gtalk and phone contact and the user has user Y as friend only in Skype then more weighting is given to the friend X than friend Y. User X has a closer social distance to the user than user Y. In some embodiments more weighting indicates a smaller numerical value of weighting therefore a smaller social distance.

In certain embodiments a social distance or an average social distance is automatically calculated by a social recommendation application. In further embodiments a social distance or an average social distance is automatically calculated by a social recommendation application when making a recommendation. In other embodiments a social distance or an average social distance is automatically calculated by a social recommendation application when there is some update in a user or a group of user s social relationship. In further embodiments the calculation is performed for each user or a group of user with following user or followers. In some embodiments a social distance or an average social distance is stored in a database within a social recommendation application.
