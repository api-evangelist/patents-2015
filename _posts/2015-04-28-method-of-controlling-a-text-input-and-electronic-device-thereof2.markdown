In operation the electronic device can determine whether a text input that is to be used as a replacement is generated in output text. For example the electronic device can determine whether a text input is generated through the keypad in the application program for providing a text input.

In operation the electronic device determines whether a text similar to the text that is to be used as a replacement exists in the voice recognized text. For example as illustrated in when Maetan dong is entered from the keypad the electronic device can determine whether a text similar to Maetan dong exists in the voice recognized text Samsung Electronics is located in Maetang dong .

In operation the electronic device can correct the recognized text. For example as illustrated in when a text similar to Maetan dong entered from the keypad exists in the voice recognized input the electronic device correct Maetang dong with Maetan dong and the corrected recognized text is Samsung Electronics is located in Maetan dong . In addition the electronic device stores Maetan dong entered from the keypad in a database so as to provide the same to recognize Maetan dong when voice is input for hereafter cases.

Referring to an electronic device determines whether a text input event occurs in operation . For example as illustrated in an electronic device can determine whether a keypad call event for inputting a text occurs in the application program for providing a text input. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the electronic device can determine whether at least one event for inputting text from among menu selection gesture detection and button inputting occurs.

In operation the electronic device can determine whether a keypad input event occurs. For example as illustrated in the electronic device can determine whether a keypad input event for inputting a text occurs in the application program for providing a text input.

When the keypad input event occurs the electronic device can output a text based on a keypad input in operation . For example as illustrated in the electronic device can output How a based on an input of a user through the keypad .

In operation the electronic device can determine whether a voice input event occurs. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure the electronic device can simultaneously execute text inputting through a keypad and text inputting through a voice input.

In operation the electronic device can output a text based on a text input by the keypad and the voice input. For example as illustrated in when How are you is recognized through the voice input after How a is entered from the keypad the electronic device can output How are you as illustrated in .

According to an embodiment of the present disclosure when inputting the text does not end and Maetan dong is where I is additionally input after How are you that is previous input as illustrated in the electronic device can determine whether a voice input is generated. When Maetan dong is where I live is recognized through a voice input as illustrated in the electronic device can input Maetan dong is where I live as illustrated in .

According to various embodiments operations of an electronic device for controlling a text input can include detecting an input of a first text detecting a voice input executing voice recognition with respect to the detected voice so as to detect a second text corresponding to the detected voice and converting at least a part of the second text into the first text.

According to various embodiments converting at least a part of the second text into the first text includes detecting text similar to the first text from the second text and converting into the first text the text similar to the first text in the second text.

According to various embodiments the electronic device can further include a display unit that converts at least a part of the second text into the first text and displays the same.

As described above the electronic device receives an input of text that is to be used as a replacement when voice is input so as to increase the accuracy in inputting text associated with a voice input.

It will be appreciated that embodiments of the present disclosure according to the claims and description in the specification can be realized in the form of hardware software or a combination of hardware and software.
