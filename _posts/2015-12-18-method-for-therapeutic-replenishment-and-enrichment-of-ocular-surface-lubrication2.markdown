This invention was made with government support under EY05612 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to the management of ocular lubrication. In particular the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and method of use thereof for treating diseases associated with compromised lubrication at the corneal and conjunctival surfaces.

The proteoglycan 4 prg4 gene encodes for highly glycosylated proteins termed megakaryocyte stimulating factor MSF lubricin and superficial zone protein SZP 1 . Lubricin was first isolated from synovial fluid and demonstrated lubricating ability in vitro similar to synovial fluid at a cartilage glass interface 2 . Lubricin was later identified as a product of synovial fibroblasts 3 and also shown to possess boundary lubricating ability at a latex glass interface by Jay et al. 3 9 . O linked 1 3 Gal GalNAc oligosaccharides within a large mucin like domain of 940 amino acids 10 encoded for by exon 6 were subsequently shown to mediate in part this boundary lubricating ability 8 . SZP was first localized at the surface of explant cartilage from the superficial zone and isolated from conditioned medium 11 . SZP also demonstrated lubricating ability at a cartilage glass interface 12 . These molecules are collectively referred to as PRG4. PRG4 was also shown to be present at the surface of synovium 58 tendon 13 and meniscus 14 . In addition PRG4 has been shown to contribute both at physiological and pathophysiological concentrations to the boundary lubrication of apposing articular cartilage surfaces 59 .

The functional importance of prg4 was shown by mutations that cause the camptodactyly arthropathy coxa vara pericarditis CACP disease syndrome in humans. CACP is manifest by camptodactyly noninflammatory arthropathy and hypertrophic synovitis with coxa vara deformity pericarditis and pleural effusion 15 . Also in PRG4 null mice cartilage deterioration and subsequent joint failure were observed 16 . Therefore PRG4 expression is a necessary component of healthy synovial joints.

PRG4 is a member of the mucin family which are generally abundant on epithelial linings and provide many functions including lubrication and protection from invading microorganisms 17 . The functional properties of mucins are generally determined by specialized glycosylation patterns and their ability to form multimers through intermolecular disulfide bonds 18 both of which are altered in chronic diseases e.g. cystic fibrosis asthma 17 . Biochemical characterization of PRG4 isolated from synovial fluid 2 19 showed molecular heterogeneity in O glycosylation which appears to influence lubricating properties 8 Recently PRG4 from bovine synovial fluid has been shown to exist as disulfide bonded dimers in addition to the monomeric forms as suggested by the conserved cysteine rich domains at both N and C terminals along with an unpaired cysteine at the C terminal 20 .

In tissues such as synovial joints physicochemical modes of lubrication have been classified as fluid film or boundary. The operative lubrication modes depend on the normal and tangential forces on the articulating tissues on the relative rate of tangential motion between these surfaces and on the time history of both loading and motion. The friction coefficient provides a quantitative measure and is defined as the ratio of tangential friction force to the normal force. One type of fluid mediated lubrication mode is hydrostatic. At the onset of loading and typically for a prolonged duration the interstitial fluid within cartilage becomes pressurized due to the biphasic nature of the tissue fluid may also be forced into the asperities between articular surfaces through a weeping mechanism. Pressurized interstitial fluid and trapped lubricant pools may therefore contribute significantly to the bearing of normal load with little resistance to shear force facilitating a very low . Also at the onset of loading and or motion squeeze film hydrodynamic and elastohydrodynamic types of fluid film lubrication occur with pressurization motion and deformation acting to drive viscous lubricant from and or through the gap between two surfaces in relative motion.

The relevant extent to which fluid pressure film versus boundary lubrication occurs classically depends on a number of factors 31 . When lubricant film can flow between the conforming sliding surfaces which can deform elastically elastohydrodynamic lubrication occurs. Pressure surface roughness and relative sliding velocity determine when full fluid lubrication begins to break down and the lubrication enters new regimes. As velocity decreases further lubricant films adherent to the articulating surfaces begin to contribute and a mixed regime of lubrication occurs. If the velocity decreases even further and only an ultra thin lubricant layer composed of a few molecules remain boundary lubrication occurs. A boundary mode of lubrication is therefore indicated by a friction coefficient ratio of the measured frictional force between two contacting surfaces in relative motion to the applied normal force during steady sliding being invariant with factors that influence formation of a fluid film such as relative sliding velocity and axial load 35 . For articular cartilage it has been concluded boundary lubrication is certain to occur although complemented by fluid pressurization and other mechanisms 36 39 .

In boundary lubrication load is supported by surface to surface contact and the associated frictional properties are determined by lubricant surface molecules. This mode has been proposed to be important because the opposing cartilage layers make contact over 10 of the total area and this may be where most of the friction occurs 30 . Furthermore with increasing loading time and dissipation of hydrostatic pressure lubricant coated surfaces bear an increasingly higher portion of the load relative to pressurized fluid and consequently this mode can become increasingly dominant 31 32 . Boundary lubrication in essence mitigates stickslip 31 and is therefore manifest as decreased resistance both to steady motion and the start up of motion. The latter situation is relevant to load bearing articulating surfaces after prolonged compressive loading e.g. sitting or standing in vivo 33 . Typical wear patterns of cartilage surfaces 34 also suggest that boundary lubrication of articular cartilage is critical to the protection and maintenance of the articular surface structure.

With increasing loading time and dissipation of hydrostatic pressure lubricant coated surfaces bear an increasingly higher portion of the load relative to pressurized fluid and consequently can become increasingly dominated by this mode of lubrication. A boundary mode of lubrication is indicated by values of during steady sliding being invariant with factors that influence formation of a fluid film such as relative sliding velocity and axial load. Boundary lubrication in essence mitigates stickslip and is therefore manifest as decreased resistance both to steady motion and the start up of motion.

The accumulation of PRG4 within synovial fluid and at the articular surface are likely key functional determinants of PRG4 s boundary lubricating ability. Recently it was demonstrated that a significant threefold secretion of PRG4 resulted from the dynamic shear loading of cultured cartilage explants as compared to free swelling or statically compressed cultures 27 . This PRG4 synthesis and secretion by chondrocytes could significantly contribute to the concentration of PRG4 within synovial fluid in both homeostatic and pathological conditions where physiological regulators are present 23 . Although the amount of PRG4 bound to the surface does not appear to correlate with secretion rates previous studies suggest surface bound PRG4 can exchange with endogenous PRG4 in synovial fluid 25 especially under the influence of mechanical perturbation 26 27 . Clarification of the spatial and temporal aspects of PRG4 metabolism within the joint particularly at the articular surface would further the understanding of PRG4 s contribution to the low friction properties of articular cartilage and possibly lead to treatments to prevent loss of this function 40 41 . More remains to be determined about the processing and the potentially additional or alternative functions of various PRG4 molecules of different molecular weight 10 27 28 61 . Moreover the combination of chemical and mechanical factors to stimulate PRG4 expression in chondrocytes near the articular surface may be useful for creating tissue engineered cartilage from isolated sub populations 29 with a surface that is bioactive and functional in lubrication.

The precise mechanisms of boundary lubrication at biological interfaces are currently unknown. However proteoglycan 4 PRG4 may play a critical role as a boundary lubricant in articulating joints. This secreted glycoprotein is thought to protect cartilaginous surfaces against frictional forces cell adhesion and protein deposition. Various native and recombinant lubricin proteins and isoforms have been isolated and characterized. For instance U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 326 558 6 433 142 7 030223 and 7 361 738 disclose a family of human megakaryocyte stimulating factors MSFs and pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more such MSFs for treating disease states or disorders such as a deficiency of platelets. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 960 562 and 6 743 774 also disclose a lubricating polypeptide tribonectin comprising a substantially pure fragments of MSF and methods of lubricating joints or other tissues by administering tribonectin systemically or directly to tissues.

Described in certain instances of the present invention is the observation that the role PRG4 protein serves on the ocular surface is to protect the cornea and conjunctiva against significant shear forces generated during an eyelid blink contact lens wear and other undesirable conditions. The impact of the tear film including the impact of inflammation proinflammatory cytokines sex steroid imbalance and proteases on the composition and function of the films suggest a course of therapy for ocular tissues which promotes boundary lubrication.

The present invention provides in certain embodiments a novel approach to manage ocular lubrication including the therapeutic replenishment and enrichment of boundary lubricant molecules at the ocular surface. It should be noted that the importance and the mechanism of ocular boundary lubrication has not heretofore been recognized within the ophthalmic community. For years the scientific consensus within the orthopaedic research community was that hydrodynamic lubrication was by far the dominant mode of lubrication for articular cartilage and that boundary lubrication was simply an afterthought. Moreover those researchers studying boundary lubrication at cartilage surfaces suggest that boundary lubrication is likely only important under high load and low velocity which are opposite to the conditions at the ocular surface where there are relatively low axial loads and relatively fast sliding velocities. See e.g. 54 . Moreover boundary lubrication involving the corneal glyocalyx has not heretofore been considered. Jay et al. compared purified lubricating factor from bovine synovial fluid to mucinous glycoprotein from human submandibular saliva and stimulated tears and concluded mucin secreted by the lacrimal gland did not lubricate overlooking the possibility that the corneal epithelium was a source of lubricant or that boundary lubrication was an important contributor at the ocular surface. See e.g. 55 . The most recent mathematical models of tear film dynamics also ignore the possibility of boundary lubrication claiming a lubrication approximation for the height of the tear film such that the mucus layer on the cornea can be taken to provide a no slip surface for the aqueous film and that it should be noted that the model only predicts the evolution prior to the tear film thickness reaching some critically thin value at which the model breaks down. See e.g. 57 .

There is a need to manage ocular lubrication and protect the cornea and conjunctiva against significant shear forces generated from the undesirable conditions described herein including by way of non limiting example aqueous or evaporative dry eye disease Sj gren s syndrome keratoconjunctivitis sicca androgen deficiency meibomian gland disease estrogen replacement therapy contact lens wear refractive surgery allergy reduced tear film breakup time allergy ocular surface disorders increased protease levels in the tear film and at the ocular surface chronic inflammation hyperosmolarity and aging.

In some instances the loading of cornea and conjunctiva is likely dominated by shear forces. In certain instances eyelid blinking as well as contact lens wear generates significant stress upon ocular surface epithelial cells and this is especially true in the presence of a compromised tear film. As shown in it is suggested that increased shear stress leads to tear film instability evaporative tear loss hyperosmolarity changes in swelling pressure and a feedback elevation in shear stress. In some instances increased shear stress is also thought to promote inflammation androgen deficiency and decreased expression of proteoglycans. In certain instances increased shear stress and its sequelae may over time lead to a loss of boundary lubrication at the ocular surface.

A deficiency in ocular lubrication and symptoms associated therewith can be determine by any suitable method. In some instances a deficiency in ocular lubrication and symptoms associated therewith is defined either qualitatively e.g. a feeling of low lubrication dry eye discomfort etc. or quantitatively e.g. measured through mechanical biochemical electrical optical or other methods of quantitative assays .

In certain instances in undesirable conditions for ocular boundary lubrication such those resulting from aqueous or evaporative dry eye disease Sj gren s syndrome keratoconjunctivitis sicca androgen deficiency meibomian gland disease estrogen replacement therapy contact lens wear refractive surgery allergy reduced tear film breakup time allergy ocular surface disorders increased protease levels in the tear film and at the ocular surface chronic inflammation hyperosmolarity and aging a compromised tear film will exist. In some of these situations increased evaporation may preclude efficient fluid film lubrication but allow boundary lubrication and a molecular sacrificial mechanism to reduce shear stress at the cell surface. Certain embodiments of the present invention provide that therapeutic replenishment and enrichment of boundary lubricant molecules at the ocular surface would interrupt the feedback loop through which the unfavorable conditions associated with a deficiency in ocular lubrication promote ocular surface distress.

In certain instances and as provided herein PRG4 protein plays a critical role in the eye as a boundary lubricant. In some instances this secreted glycoprotein protects the ocular surface to protect the cornea and conjunctiva against significant shear forces generated during an eyelid blink contact lens wear and any other undesirable ocular boundary lubrication caused by chronic inflammation and hyperosmolarity that result from dry eye disease androgen deficiency estrogen replacement therapy compromised tear film allergy aging ocular surface diseases and increased protease levels in the tear film and at the ocular surface. Given the relationship between osmotic pressure and the electromechanical interactions within charged molecules the present invention provides in some embodiments a pharmaceutical composition for managing a deficiency in ocular lubrication by modulating hyperosmolarity or osmolarity at the ocular surface via interrupting the feedback mechanisms that prevent secreted components from reducing friction coefficients and mitigating shear stress.

In another exemplary embodiment the present invention features a sacrificial mechanism for ocular boundary lubrication whereby surface bound receptors reversibly bind one or more gel forming or surfactant constructs. In some instances the gel forming or surfactant constructs detach during a shear event thereby preventing the shear stress from reaching or reducing the shear stress reaching the epithelial surface. In certain embodiments following the transient shearing event the gel forming and surfactant constructs allowed to return to their undisturbed equilibrium rebind to the surface bound receptors. In some embodiments the entire construct can detach during shear. One could imagine in certain instances that the thermodynamics of this equilibrium would increase the probability of release from the receptor with increasing shear amplitude but that any one association is easily reversible.

In one embodiment of the current invention the pharmaceutical composition comprising a PRG4 protein suspended in an ophthalmically acceptable balanced solution is applied topically to the ocular surface where the PRG4 protein associates or binds to. In certain instances of this embodiment PRG4 acts as the surface bound receptor that is allowed to interact with endogenous proteins and proteoglycans within the tear film to establish a sacrificial mechanism to reduce the friction during eyelid blinks at the ocular surface prevent protein adsorption at the ocular surface and reduce dry spots caused by tear film instability.

In another embodiment of the current invention PRG4 is applied topically and associates or binds to the ocular surface in combination with one or more of hyaluronic acid and phospholipid constructs. In certain instances of this embodiment PRG4 acts as the surface bound receptor that interacts with the exogenously supplied hyaluronic acid and or phospholipids to establish the sacrificial mechanism to reduce the friction during eyelid blinks at the ocular surface prevent protein adsorption at the ocular surface and reduce dry spots caused by tear film instability. In this embodiment the hyaluronic acid and phospholipid constructs disassociate from the PRG4 during a shear event. In yet another embodiment the entire construct detaches during a shear event to prevent the shear stress from reaching the epithelium.

In yet another embodiment functional fragments multimers e.g. dimers trimers tetramers etc. homologs or orthologs of PRG4 act as the surface receptor and or gel forming constructs in the sacrificial mechanism. Functional fragments and homologs of PRG4 include those with a fewer repeats within the central mucin like KEPAPTT repeat SEQ ID NO 4 domain glycosylated forms of the protein splice variants recombinant forms and the like may be used. A lubricating fragment of PRG4 exhibits at least 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 or 95 of the ophthalmic lubricating effect of human PRG4 as measured qualitatively mechanically optically electrically or by biochemical assay.

In one embodiment a biologically active portion of the PRG4 protein can be used as a therapeutic agent alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for treating undesirable or decreased ocular boundary lubrication.

The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of several native and recombinant PRG4 or lubricin proteins and characterization of the PRG4 proteins and various isoforms are disclosed in for instance U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 326 558 6 433 142 7 030 223 7 361 738 to Turner et al. and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 743 774 and 6 960 562 to Jay et al.

Methods for isolation purification and recombinant expression of a PRG4 protein are well known in the art. In certain embodiments the method starts with cloning and isolating mRNA and cDNA encoding PRG4 proteins or isoforms using standard molecular biology techniques such as PCR or RT PCR. The isolated cDNA encoding the PRG4 protein or isoform is then cloned into an expression vector and further transformed and expressed in a host cell for producing recombinant PRG4 protein.

As used herein recombinant refers to a polynucleotide synthesized or otherwise manipulated in vitro e.g. recombinant polynucleotide to methods of using recombinant polynucleotides to produce gene products in cells or other biological systems or to a polypeptide recombinant protein encoded by a recombinant polynucleotide. Recombinant also encompasses the ligation of nucleic acids having various coding regions or domains or promoter sequences from different sources into an expression cassette or vector for expression of e.g. inducible or constitutive expression of a fusion protein comprising an active domain of the PRG4 gene and a nucleic acid sequence amplified using a primer of the invention.

Unless otherwise specified or required any embodiment of this invention that is a polynucleotide encompasses both the double stranded form and each of two complementary single stranded forms known or predicted to make up the double stranded form.

As used herein the term polynucleotide sequence is the alphabetical representation of a polynucleotide molecule. A polynucleotide is composed of a specific sequence of four nucleotide bases adenine A cytosine C guanine G thymine T and uracil U in place of thymine when the polynucleotide is RNA instead of DNA. This alphabetical representation can be inputted into databases in a computer and used for bioinformatics applications such as for example functional genomics and homology searching.

As used herein the term isolated polynucleotide cDNA includes polynucleotide molecules which are separated from other polynucleotide molecules which are present in the natural source of the polynucleotide. For example with regard to genomic DNA the term isolated includes polynucleotide molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably an isolated polynucleotide is free of sequences which naturally flank the polynucleotide i.e. sequences located at the 5 and 3 ends of the polynucleotide of interest in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the polynucleotide is derived. For example in various embodiments the isolated polynucleotide molecule encoding the PRG4 protein used in the invention can contain less than about 5 kb 4 kb 3 kb 2 kb 1 kb 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the polynucleotide molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the polynucleotide is derived. Moreover an isolated polynucleotide molecule such as a cDNA molecule can be substantially free of other cellular material or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized.

As used herein a gene includes a polynucleotide containing at least one open reading frame that is capable of encoding a particular polypeptide or protein after being transcribed and translated.

The subunits may be linked by peptide bonds. In another embodiment the subunit may be linked by other bonds e.g. ester ether etc. As used herein the term amino acid includes either natural and or unnatural or synthetic amino acids including glycine and both the D or L optical isomers and amino acid analogs and peptidomimetics. A peptide of three or more amino acids is commonly referred to as an oligopeptide. Peptide chains of greater than three or more amino acids are referred to as a polypeptide or a protein.

In certain embodiments the PRG4 protein used herein refers to PRG4 proteins or various homologs or isoforms thereof that are naturally or recombinantly expressed in humans or other host cells. As used herein express or expression includes the process by which polynucleotides are transcribed into RNA and or translated into polypeptides. If the polynucleotide is derived from genomic DNA expression may include splicing of the RNA if an appropriate eukaryotic host is selected. Regulatory elements required for expression include promoter sequences to bind RNA polymerase and transcription initiation sequences for ribosome binding. For example a bacterial expression vector includes a promoter such as the lac promoter and for transcription initiation the Shine Dalgarno sequence and the start codon AUG. Similarly a eukaryotic expression vector includes a heterologous or homologous promoter for RNA polymerase II a downstream polyadenylation signal the start codon AUG and a termination codon for detachment of the ribosome. Such vectors can be obtained commercially or assembled by the sequences described in methods well known in the art for example the methods described below for constructing vectors in general. As used herein the term vector includes a self replicating nucleic acid molecule that transfers an inserted polynucleotide into and or between host cells. The term is intended to include vectors that function primarily for insertion of a nucleic acid molecule into a cell replication vectors that function primarily for the replication of nucleic acid and expression vectors that function for transcription and or translation of the DNA or RNA. Also intended are vectors that provide more than one of the above function.

As used herein a host cell is intended to include any individual cell or cell culture which can be or has been a recipient for vectors or for the incorporation of exogenous polynucleotides and or polypeptides. It is also intended to include progeny of a single cell. The progeny may not necessarily be completely identical in morphology or in genomic or total DNA complement to the original parent cell due to natural accidental or deliberate mutation. The cells may be prokaryotic or eukaryotic and include but are not limited to bacterial cells yeast cells insect cells animal cells and mammalian cells including but not limited to murine rat simian or human cells. As used herein a host cell also includes genetically modified cells. The term genetically modified cells includes cells containing and or expressing a foreign or exogenous gene or polynucleotide sequence which in turn modifies the genotype or phenotype of the cell or its progeny. Genetically modified also includes a cell containing or expressing a gene or polynucleotide sequence which has been introduced into the cell. For example in this embodiment a genetically modified cell has had introduced a gene which gene is also endogenous to the cell. The term genetically modified also includes any addition deletion or disruption to a cell s endogenous nucleotides. As used herein a host cell can be any cells that express a human PRG4 protein.

As used herein homologs are defined herein as two nucleic acids or peptides that have similar or substantially identical nucleic acids or amino acid sequences respectively. The term homolog further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from one of the nucleotide sequences due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encodes the same amino acid sequences. In one of the preferred embodiments homologs include allelic variants orthologs paralogs agonists and antagonists of nucleic acids encoding the PRG4 protein e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 .

As used herein the term orthologs refers to two nucleic acids from different species but that have evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation. Normally orthologs encode peptides having the same or similar functions. In particular orthologs of the invention will generally exhibit at least 80 85 more preferably 85 90 or 90 95 and most preferably 95 96 97 98 or even 99 identity or 100 sequence identity with all or part of the amino acid sequence of any known PRG4 proteins e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 isoforms or analogs thereof and will exhibit a function similar to these peptides. As also used herein the term paralogs refers to two nucleic acids that are related by duplication within a genome. Paralogs usually have different functions but these functions may be related.

To determine the percent sequence identity of two amino acid sequences the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes e.g. gaps can be introduced in the sequence of one polypeptide for optimal alignment with the other polypeptide or nucleic acid . The amino acid residues at corresponding amino acid positions are then compared. When a position in one sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue as the corresponding position in the other sequence then the molecules are identical at that position. The same type of comparison can be made between two nucleic acid sequences. The percent sequence identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences i.e. percent sequence identity numbers of identical positions total numbers of positions 100 . Preferably the isolated amino acid homologs included in the present invention are at least about 50 60 preferably at least about 60 70 and more preferably at least about 70 75 75 80 80 85 85 90 or 90 95 and most preferably at least about 96 97 98 99 or more identical to an entire amino acid sequence of any known PRG4 protein e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 .

In certain embodiments an isolated nucleic acid homolog encoding the PRG4 protein comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least about 40 60 preferably at least about 60 70 more preferably at least about 70 75 75 80 80 85 85 90 or 90 95 and even more preferably at least about 95 96 97 98 99 or more identical to a nucleotide sequence encoding amino acid sequences of such PRG4 protein e.g. SEQ ID NO 1 .

The determination of the percent sequence identity between two nucleic acid or peptide sequences is well known in the art. For instance the Vector NTI 6.0 PC software package InforMax Bethesda Md. to determine the percent sequence identity between two nucleic acid or peptide sequences can be used. In this method a gap opening penalty of 15 and a gap extension penalty of 6.66 are used for determining the percent identity of two nucleic acids. A gap opening penalty of 10 and a gap extension penalty of 0.1 are used for determining the percent identity of two polypeptides. All other parameters are set at the default settings. For purposes of a multiple alignment Clustal W algorithm the gap opening penalty is 10 and the gap extension penalty is 0.05 with blosum62 matrix. It is to be understood that for the purposes of determining sequence identity when comparing a DNA sequence to an RNA sequence a thymidine nucleotide is equivalent to a uracil nucleotide.

Furthermore the PRG4 protein used herein includes PRG4 protein encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes to the polynucleotide encoding PRG4 protein under stringent conditions. As used herein hybridization includes a reaction in which one or more polynucleotides react to form a complex that is stabilized via hydrogen bonding between the bases of the nucleotide residues. The hydrogen bonding may occur by Watson Crick base pairing Hoogstein binding or in any other sequence specific manner. The complex may comprise two strands forming a duplex structure three or more strands forming a multi stranded complex a single self hybridizing strand or any combination of these. A hybridization reaction may constitute a step in a more extensive process such as the initiation of a PCR reaction or the enzymatic cleavage of a polynucleotide by a ribozyme.

Hybridization reactions can be performed under different stringent conditions. The present invention includes polynucleotides capable of hybridizing under reduced stringency conditions more preferably stringent conditions and most preferably highly stringent conditions to polynucleotides encoding PRG4 protein described herein.

The present invention further provides a method for treating decreased or undesired ocular boundary lubrication symptoms associated therewith or a condition that is associated with or causes a deficiency in ocular lubrication in an individual in need thereof comprising topically administering to the ocular surface of the individual in need a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of PRG4 protein.

The term treating or treatment also encompasses both prevention of a disorder in a predisposed individual and treatment of the disorder in a clinically symptomatic individual.

In certain embodiments the decreased ocular boundary lubrication is caused by increased evaporative tear loss or unstable tear film in the ocular boundary loop. Such decreased or undesired ocular boundary lubrication is associated with aqueous or evaporative dry eye disease Sj gren s syndrome keratoconjunctivitis sicca KCS androgen deficiency meibomian gland disease estrogen replacement therapy contact lens wear refractive surgery allergy reduced tear film breakup time compromised tear film ocular surface disorders increased protease levels in the tear film and at the ocular surface chronic inflammation hyperosmolarity and aging. As discussed above the increased shear stress leads to tear film instability evaporative tear loss hyperosmolarity changes in swelling pressure and a feedback elevation in shear stress. Increased shear stress also promotes inflammation androgen deficiency and decreased expression of proteoglycans. Over time increased shear stress and its sequelae leads to a loss of boundary lubrication at the ocular surface. Accordingly the present invention provides a method for reducing shear stress by replenishing and enriching the expression of proteoglycans such as PRG4 protein at the ocular surface so as to prevent or increase ocular boundary lubrication.

Human corneal epithelial cells were isolated from the corneoscleral rims of male and female donors. Cells were processed either directly n 8 or first cultured in phenol red free keratinocyte serum free media n 2 . Bulbar conjunctivae n 2 conjunctival impression cytology samples n 9 immortalized human conjunctival epithelial cells after culture n 1 NOD mouse lacrimal glands n 5 adult mice sex 10 glands sample and BALB c mouse meibomian glands n 7 adult mice sex glands from 28 lids sample were obtained during surgical procedures. These samples were processed for the analysis of PRG4 mRNA by using primarily RT PCR n 18 human all mouse and Affymetrix GeneChips n 4 human corneas . The PRG4 primers for PCR spanned over 1 kbp of intron sequences in order to suppress amplification of contaminating chromosomal DNA Table 1 . Amplified samples were screened for the presence of PRG4 products by using agarose gel electrophoresis and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. To confirm the identity of amplicons PCR products from cornea samples n 2 conjunctival epithelial cells n 1 and a human liver standard n 1 were sequenced with a 3100 Genetic Analyzer at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary DNA Sequencing Center for Vision Research Boston Mass. and resulting data were analyzed with BLASTn searches of GenBank databases.

It was demonstrated that PRG4 mRNA is present in all human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cell and impression cytology samples. The identity of PRG4 PCR products was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis Table 2 . The results show that PRG4 is transcribed in human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells.

An in vitro friction test with clinically relevant interfaces such as an ocular surface eyelid and ocular surface contact lens interface is described below. Clinically relevant methods capable of quantitatively assessing the lubricating ability of artificial tears are currently lacking. Friction tests with synthetic e.g. latex and glass or non ocular native surfaces e.g. umbilical cord vein segments may facilitate some but likely not all of the molecular interactions that occur during articulation blinking. Indeed the relevance of data obtained with non tissue interfaces is unclear.

An annulus on disk rotational test configuration has been shown to be ideal for studying boundary lubrication at an articular cartilage cartilage interface. A boundary mode of lubrication is indicated by kinetic friction being invariant with factors that influence formation of a fluid film including sliding velocity and axial load. This is because surface to surface contact is occurring and surface bound molecules contribute to lubrication by decreasing friction and wear . Boundary lubrication has been discovered to be a critical and operative mechanism at the ocular surface like it is at the articular cartilage surface. Therefore the in vitro friction test previously developed and characterized to study boundary lubrication at an articular cartilage cartilage interface was modified for the study of ocular surface eye lid and ocular surface contact lens interfaces.

To determine the test conditions in which boundary lubrication is dominant at the ocular surface eyelid and ocular surface contact lens interfaces the dependence of frictional properties on axial load and sliding velocity was examined. Normal fresh human ocular surfaces resected corneas with 3 mm of sclera were obtained from the Lions Eye Bank of Alberta. The resected corneas were stored in Optisol GS at 4 C. and used within 2 weeks. Eyelids age 60 80 years old were obtained from the University of Calgary Body Donation Program within 1 3 days after death and used immediately or stored at 20 C. in saline for at most 2 weeks until use. Comparative lubricants consisted of Lens Plus Sterile Saline Solution Advanced Medical Optics as a negative control Systane Lubricant Eye Drops Alcon Laboratories Refresh Tears Lubricant Eye Drops Allergan Aquify Long Lasting Comfort Drops CIBA Vision and Blink Tears Lubricant Eye Drops Advanced Medical Optics as test lubricants.

The friction test schematic is shown in . The corneal ocular surface was fastened to the spherical end of an inert non permeable semi rigid rubber plug cylinder radius r 6 mm by applying super glue to the sclera. This plug cylinder was attached to the rotational actuator of the mechanical testing machine BoseELF 3200 thus forming the bottom articular surface. An annulus outer radius 3.2 mm inner radius 1.5 mm was punched from the eyelid and was attached to the linear actuator coupled with an axial load N and torsion load cell thus forming the upper articulating surface. Lubricant bath was formed by securing an inert tube around the plug cylinder .

Samples were first tested in saline then in one of the three 3 test lubricants. The lubricant bath was filled with 0.3 ml and the articulating surfaces allowed to equilibrate with the lubricant. The sample surfaces were slowly 0.05 mm s brought into contact and compressed until the spherical plug flattened out and the entire annular eyelid surface was in contact with the cornea . The resulting normal stress calculated from axial load as in units of MPa as N r r can be varied by using different stiffness rubber plugs to mimic physiological stresses 5 kPa. The test sequence was initiated by preconditioning the sample by rotating 4 revolutions rev and reset with 4 revolutions at a physiologically relevant effective linear sliding velocity veff 30 mm s where veff Reff is the angular frequency and Reff 2.4 mm is the effective radius calculated by integrating the shear stress distribution over the annular contact area . Samples were then tested by rotating 4 revolutions immediately followed by 4 reset revolutions at veff 30 10 1 0.3 and then 30 mm s with a dwell time of 12 second between each revolution. The test sequence was then be repeated in the opposite direction of rotation.

To evaluate the lubrication properties of the ocular surface two friction coefficients of the form RN where is torque Ris effective radius and N is axial load described above. A static friction coefficient which reflects the resistance to the onset of motion was calculated as the peak value of just after within 10 the start of rotation. An average kinetic friction coefficient which reflects the resistance to steady state motion was calculated from averaged during the third and fourth complete test revolution. Both and were averaged for the and revolutions in each test to account for potential directional effects on measurements. Data was collected at a frequency of 20 Hz.

The results of lubricin PRG4 added to the corneal surface at a concentration in the range of 100 300 g mL are shown in . Lubricin had a friction lowering effect at the eyelid interface both in terms of kinetic and static friction at all velocities. At a concentration 1 10th of that of physiological hyaluronic acid lubricin was similar to Blink Tears Lubricant Eye Drops which contains hyaluronic acid. In combination the two lubricants are better than either alone.

A patient complaining of ocular surface irritation is examined for ocular lubrication or conditions associated with a deficiency in ocular lubrication by measuring symptoms greater than 2 positive responses on the McMonnies questionnaire greater than a score of 5 on the Ocular Surface Disease Index OSDI or through evidence of some symptoms on the Visual Analog Scale in combination with objective signs including one or more of a reduced tear film breakup time less than 10 seconds inferior lateral tear meniscus osmolarity greater than 308 mOsms L low Schirmer strip value less than 10 mm sodium fluorescein corneal or conjunctival staining scores 0 with multiple macropunctates significant debris resulting from impression cytology meibomian gland dysfunction however determined a decrease in the rate of post blink displacement of a contact lens a change in the spatiotemporal transfer function of a contact lens following application of a series of pressure impulses a decrease in the rate of post blink interferometric tear film relaxation an increase in the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines a reduced concentration of lactoferrin or lysozyme or an increase in the rate of post blink point spread function decoherence.

The patient administers 1 to 2 drops on the surface of each eye a solution containing 200 g mL PGR4 protein suspended in an ophthalmically acceptable balanced salt solution. The patient is instructed to close their eyes for 10 seconds.

Follow up visits may track a reduction in inferior lateral tear osmolarity increased tear film breakup time or the other aforementioned signs. In particular if the tear film osmolarity is reduced from an abnormal value perhaps 330 mOsms L to a more normal value perhaps 304 mOsms L the therapeutic modulation and replenishment of the ocular surface lubrication would be deemed successful.
