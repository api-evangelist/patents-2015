title: Reranking of groups when content is uploaded
abstract: Systems and methods for the forming of user device groups are presented. In one example, logical relationship information describing logical relationships among a plurality of users is accessed. Potential membership of a first user in a first group of users is determined based on scores generated for each of a plurality of possible groups of users, the scores based on the logical relationship information. Then the first user is added to the first group of users. Content from an electronic device of the first user is received for broadcast to the first group of users. In response to the receiving of content, the scores for each of the plurality of possible groups of users are regenerated based on the content. Then the first user is added to or removed from a second group of users selected from the plurality of possible groups of users based on the regenerated scores.

This application relates generally to user devices and more specifically to systems and methods for forming user device groups.

As portable communication devices such as cellular phones tablet computers and laptop computers continue to evolve to provide improved audio video and still image capture capability the opportunity for users of these devices to capture various forms of content and share that content with others such as friends and relatives continues to increase. In some situations a user may distribute the content to others by way of explicitly determining the recipients of the content manually attaching the content to an e mail picture mail or similar communication message and transmitting the message and attached content using the communication device of the user to the communication devices of each of the recipients. Typically the user distributing the content has programmed the contact information such as an e mail address or telephone number of each of the recipients into his communication device prior to capturing the content to be distributed.

In another example the user distributing the content may post the content to a separate Internet website or other data site accessible by the intended recipients of the content and subsequently inform the recipients of the message as to how to access the content. Typically the site providing access to the content is password protected or provides some other means by which only the intended recipients may access the content.

Example methods and systems for the forming of user device groups such as device groups formed primarily for the sharing of content including for example photographs audio content video content and textual content are discussed. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of example embodiments. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. It will also be evident that the types of software development described herein are not limited to the examples provided and may include other scenarios not specifically discussed.

In accordance with an example embodiment illustrates a communication system including multiple client user devices A B C D more generally devices coupled with a server via a communication network . In this specific example three of the client devices A B C belong to a group for which the server distributes content captured by one of the group client devices A B C to the remaining members of the group . In this implementation a fourth client device D does not belong to the group and thus does not receive the content posted to the group by any of the group client devices A B C. While displays a group of three member client devices A B C any number of client devices greater than one may constitute a group . As is described in greater detail below the member client devices of the group may be determined by way of interactions between the client devices such as communications between the devices the physical proximity of the devices and other parameters describing how closely or strongly the client devices may be logically connected or related to each other during a period of time.

In another example the method may be encoded as instructions on a non transitory computer readable storage medium such as for example an integrated circuit magnetic disk or optical disk which are readable and executable by one or more computers or other processing systems such as the client devices and the server of .

In the client devices are capable of capturing content such as photographs audio and or video textual data such as that generated by a user of the device or any other type of content of interest to one or more users and displaying that content to the user of the device . Examples of the client devices may include but are not limited to mobile communication devices such as cellular phones personal digital assistants PDAs digital cameras laptop computers tablet computers and netbooks.

The communication network may be any communication network capable of facilitating communications including the transfer of the content either by wire or wirelessly between the client devices and the server . Examples of the communication network may include but are not limited to any and or all of a wide area network such as the Internet a local area network LAN such as an IEEE 802.11x Wi Fi network a Bluetooth connection a Near Field Communication NFC connection an Ethernet connection a mobile or cellular communications device network such as a third generation 3G or fourth generation 4G connection and a microcell network. The communication network may constitute a direct connection between the server and each of the client devices or may include any number of transmitters receivers switches repeaters and other components to facilitate communications between the server and the client devices .

The server may be any device or system capable of receiving the content from the client devices forwarding the content to other client devices and performing other tasks associated with the server as further described below. The server may be for example a processor based system programmed to coordinate the forming of a group of client devices and facilitating the transfer of the content generated by one or more member devices of the group to other members of the group . In one example the server may implemented as one or more components such as a processing system and associated database possibly embodied as a cloud solution accessible via the communication network . In another example the server may be a system or device deployed at a communication service provider site a conference center or a location at which a particular event or meeting is taking place. In some implementations the server may be combined with one or more components of the communication network or devices attached thereto such as a wireless or microcell access point a localized hub or even one of the client devices . For example instead of using an explicit client server topology the communication system may be configured as a peer to peer network with one or more of the client devices performing the duties of the server as described herein.

In some embodiments the client device group represents a number of client devices that are identified by way of interactions detected by the server that occur between the member devices . Interactions between client devices may be both passive for example client devices left in close proximity to each other for periods of time and active for example a call SMS message or other communication initiated from one client device to another . Types of interactions between client devices that may cause them to be identified with the same group may include but are not limited to the number of communications that have occurred between the client devices the length of time of the communications between the client devices the physical distance between the client devices a length of time during which the client devices are in close physical proximity and other circumstances and or activities involving the client devices . In some implementations two client devices of the same group need not maintain close proximity or engage in direct communications between the devices if some type of logical interaction of a unique or important character between the two devices is occurring or has occurred. For examples client devices whose users have identified each other as friends and thus may have communicated directly and extensively in the past may belong to a group regardless of the physical proximity of the associated client devices . Such friends may include but are not limited to personal friends friends of friends relatives and users sharing or holding one or more common interests or backgrounds. Such logical interactions together with the more explicit interactions between users mentioned above may be considered interactions or logical relationships between the various users or user devices for the purpose of defining the client device group in some examples.

Any or all of these interactions as detected by or communicated to the server may contribute to the server determining or calculating a connection strength or affinity between two of the client devices . In some examples client devices exhibiting a relatively higher connection strength or affinity tend to indicate that the devices should be identified with or be members of a group while a relatively lower connection strength or affinity between client devices tends to indicate that the devices should not be members of the same group . In at least some embodiments since the server may detect or receive information regarding interactions between client devices as described above the focus of the information describing the interactions may be on the client devices themselves and not on the users of the client devices . As a result the server need not collect personally identifiable information of any users of the client devices in order to determine or calculate the connection strength or affinity between any two client devices . Personally identifiable information would normally include sensitive information such as full name driver s license number credit card account numbers and the like.

Additionally since the server may join client devices into a group on the basis of client device interactions explicit guidance from users regarding which client devices to include in a network or group may be unnecessary. Further the server may construct the group and manage membership of client devices in the group without any formalized client device authentication process such as the explicit use of passwords or other security measures.

In some examples the connection strength or affinity between two or more client devices may not remain constant over time. For example two users capturing photographs with their respective client devices at a particular event may never communicate directly with each other and may not be present at any other location at the same time for any significant length of time. As a result the server may treat such a connection between the two client devices as temporary or ephemeral thus causing the two client devices to be associated with the same group for a brief time period. Thus membership in a group may wax and wane over time and even the group may be short lived. Thus such a group may be considered a kind of elastic network or dynamic network in which membership may change over time due to continuing interactions or lack thereof between client devices within the group as well as external to the group . In this case the term network is employed to refer to the group of client devices as described above.

In one embodiment once the server forms a group of client devices any member of the group may post content such as audio video text still images and the like to the server which may then distribute the content to the other members of the group . In the specific example of the server has formed the group including a first client device A a second client device B and a third client device C. A fourth client device D is not included in the group D due to not possessing a connection strength or affinity comparable to the connection strength or affinity between the other client devices A B C. When the first client device A then posts content to the server via the communication network the server in turn forwards the content to all other members of the group in this case the second client device B and the third client device C but not to those client devices that are not members of the group in this example the fourth client device D . Similarly the server may distribute content posted by the second client device B or the third client device C to the other members of the group .

In the client device the user interface module may facilitate access of the user of the client device to various aspects of the sharing of content within a group including but not limited to providing explicit input as to which group to join posting content to the group and receiving content posted by other client devices in the group . More specific examples of the user interface provided by the user interface module are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with .

The location services module may provide or generate information regarding the physical location of the user client device . In one example the location service module may determine location by way of signals received from the GPS system an Assisted GPS A GPS system a Wi Fi Positioning System and or cell site triangulation. The location services module may receive such signals by way of circuitry of the client device and process one or more of the signals to determine the location.

The environment detection module may receive signals from one or more sensors residing on or in communication with the client device to indicate various environmental conditions in the vicinity of the client device . Such signals may indicate for example atmospheric pressure temperature light velocity acceleration orientation and so on as generated by sensors such as light meters accelerometers gyroscopes thermometers and the like. For example persistent changes in acceleration may indicate the client device is located in a moving car or the detection of multiple voices may indicate presence within a crowd. The environment detection module may also employ signals from various communication network interfaces such as Near Field Communication NFC signals Bluetooth communication signals Wi Fi communication signals and the like to supplement and enhance the location information of the client device generated by the location services module to more closely define the location of the client device .

The time synchronization module may provide timing information such as a timestamp that is periodically received from the server and maintained locally in the time synchronization module to mark when various location data from the location services module and or environmental data from by the environment detection module were received or generated. As is described more fully below the location and environmental data along with their timing information may be uploaded to the server which may then compare that data with corresponding data from other client devices to determine the relative physical proximity of the client devices and thus at least partially determine which of the client devices may be grouped together.

Generally the coasting module aids in determining how long the client device may remain in a particular group during periods of time in which the client device has lost contact with the server or during periods of intermittent contact with the server . In one example the coasting module takes into account various types of information such as location information time information and activity of the client device within the group for example posting of content to the group initiation of the group by the client device and so on to help determine if the client device should remain in same group as it did prior to the last significant contact with the server .

The content caching module may store locally on the client device content that has been captured at the client device but has not been posted to the server such as during times when the client device has lost contact with the server . In response to the connection between the server and the client device being restored the cached content including photos audio video annotations and the like may then be uploaded to the server for subsequent transfer to the other client devices of the group .

The content push mechanism module facilitates reception of content and other data from the server via the communication network under a push data transfer model. For example a Comet web application model may be employed to receive content and other data under a hanging GET protocol in which the server maintains a HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP request from the client device indefinitely to push the content and other data to the client device .

The content ingestion module may be responsible for taking the content captured at the client device and possibly modifying adjusting or otherwise processing the content before posting the data to the server . For still image content examples of such processing may include but are not limited to scaling the image and adjusting the resolution orientation brightness sharpness color contrast or focus of the image. These operations may depend on several factors including but not limited to the capture and display capabilities of the client device and the speed of the communication network coupling the client device and the server . The content ingestion module may also package various metadata with the content such as the location and environmental data discussed above possibly to allow the server to determine the group to which the content is to be distributed.

The tuning parameters module may receive one or more parameters from the server that may condition or modify the operation of one or more of the modules of the client device . In one implementation the tuning parameters module may receive parameters that affect the operation of the coasting module based on the last known location of the client device . For example the length of time the client device may be out of contact with the server or the distance the client device has traveled before being removed from a group may be adjusted based on available network access in the area of the client device . In some examples other tuning parameters may be received from the server that affect other modules such as the location services module the environment detection module and the content push module . Such parameters may include for example how to process the proximity and environmental data being received at the client device what communication address the client device should use to receive content updates and so on.

In the server may include for example any or all of an API module a user metadata module an interaction recording module an affinity calculator module a group content ranker module which in turn may include a group candidate indexer and a candidate scorer module a push subscribe module a presence module a content queue module a face detection recognition module and an image quality detection module . In other servers one or more of the modules may be omitted and other modules not depicted in may be added.

The user metadata module contains information associated with each of multiple client devices for various users such as identifiers associated with the client device to allow communication with the other client devices . The user metadata may also include a list of contacts such as other client devices with which the client device has interacted in the past. In one example the contacts may be divided into an active contact list and an all contacts list. Based on recent interactions between the client device and other client devices the server may promote client devices from the all contacts list to the active list for the client device and demote client devices in the active list to the all contacts list. The promotion and demotion operations are the result of calculations made by the affinity calculator module described below. The contacts lists can also be modified due to direct override instructions from the user of the client device . Other user preferences such as which groups the client device has initiated or formed and which groups the client device are to remain in regardless of previous client device interactions referred to below as pinning may be stored via the user metadata module as well. In some implementations additional contacts may be added to the lists based on one or more inferences or algorithms. For example a particular prospective contact may be added to the contact lists of a client device A based on for example triangle closing in which the client device A and the prospective contact each have one or more common contacts.

The API module facilitates at least two functions via two other modules of the server . For one the API module enables the recording of interactions between client devices via the interaction recording module . Further the API module facilitates the answering of queries regarding affinity with other client devices which are calculated by the affinity calculator module . In one example the API module maintains an affinity score between each client device and other client devices based on the recorded interactions with the affinity scores generated by the affinity calculator module being compared with a threshold value to determine whether other client devices are placed in the active contacts list or the all contacts list maintained in the user metadata module with a contact in the active contacts list indicating that the contact is active. The threshold may be a floating threshold in some implementations the value of which may depend on how many other client devices with which the first client device has interacted. Other factors may affect the value of the threshold in some examples.

In one example the interaction recording module may keep track of the most recent interactions between the client device and another client device such as 100 or 200 interactions in a type of first in first out FIFO scheme. As a result older interactions are deleted in most cases as they are presumably of lesser importance than newer interactions. Some interactions may not be treated strictly according to such a FIFO scheme in some examples such as another client device that the first client device has either friended or explicitly blocked as such user preferences may be preserved regardless of their age.

In the example of the group content ranker module includes two sub modules a candidate indexer module and a candidate scorer module . Generally the candidate indexer module determines one or more possible groups into which the client device belongs. Such action may occur for example when the client device is first powered up or when an application that implements the various methods discussed herein is initiated. The candidate indexer module may then forward the one or more identified groups to the candidate scorer module which may then generate a score such as by way of a formula each time the group content ranker module is requested to perform the function. For example the group content ranker module performs the ranking for a client device relative to the one or more groups available when the client device first attempts to join a group or when the client device uploads an item of content such as a photograph video clip audio segment text block or the like.

The group content ranker module may then use the scores provided by the candidate scorer module to sort and rank the content according to the one or more groups . The group with the highest score relative to the content may then be selected for the client device to join. In some implementations the user of the client device may have specifically indicated a preference for a particular group in which case the group content ranker module may select that group for the content . In one example the group content ranker module compares the highest score for a group to a threshold value. If the score attains the threshold the server may recommend the associated group to the client device for joining or automatically join the client device to the group . If instead the score is less than the threshold the server may generate a new group for the client device and push metadata associated with that group to other client devices such as those located proximate to the first client device and allow those client devices the option of joining the newly generated group . In one example the group content ranker module receives metadata regarding proximity connections and the like between the first client device and other client devices each time the group content ranker module ranks the candidate groups for particular content to adjust the ranking.

The presence module may be employed by the server to determine which client devices are located within some predetermined distance of the first client device . This server may use this information to identify those client devices that may be interested in joining a new group initiated by the first client device . To this end the presence module may maintain a real time index of those client devices in proximity to the first client device . For those client devices not proximate to the first client device the server may poll those client devices to determine their location in order to provide a group with which they may be associated.

The push subscribe module may provide the functionality for the server to push content to the client devices of a particular group as well as to provide one or more potential groups to a client device to which the user of the client device may then subscribe or join. In one example the server automatically joins the client device to the group without requesting confirmation from the client device . As mentioned above the pushing of content may be facilitated by way of a Comet web application model to distribute content and other data to the client devices under a hanging GET protocol.

The content queue module may maintain and manage content that is yet to be distributed to one or more client devices . For example the push subscribe module may not distribute each item of content immediately to all client devices of a group if the number of client devices is high enough to cause a significant delay in distributing the content to all of the group members. In such cases the push subscribe module may then forward the content and possibly any associated metadata to the content queue module which then may hold the content or transfer the content to only a subset of the group member devices until a later time. The decision to queue the content in the content queue module may be based upon several factors possibly including but not limited to the number of client devices associated with the group and the available bandwidth of the communication network .

The face detection recognition module may be employed to adjust still or video image content for example by cropping based on the faces or other important features detected in the image prior to distributing the resulting content to the group . In one example the face detection recognition module may also correlate facial features with names of people in order to generate metadata identifying the person represented in the content . The metadata may then be attached to the content prior to distribution to the group .

The image quality detection module may process still images one or frames of a video segment and the like to ascertain one or more aspects of the images or frames such as scaling resolution orientation brightness sharpness color contract focus and the like. The image quality detection module may then determine the relative qualify of the image and decide whether the image or frame is to be distributed to the remaining client devices of the group or should be discarded instead. In some implementations the image quality detection module may adjust the image such as cropping out of focus areas or less interesting portions of the image brightening the image and so forth before distributing the image to the group .

Each group data structure may be logically associated with each client device identified as a member of the group . Further the server may organize the client devices according to their involvement in the group as either contributing devices for example those client devices providing or posting content to the group or presence devices those client devices that are receiving content but not providing the content . In some implementations the presence devices are not considered to possess as strong a connection to the groups as the contributing devices as they may possess only ephemeral presence in the group by being associated with the group temporarily before being associated with another group such as by physically moving away from the first group without contributing content and then coming in close proximity to a second group .

In a client device A may provide an initial message to the server via the API module upon powering up or initiating a specific application operation . Such a message may be termed a bootstrap message. In response the server may supply one or more tuning parameters via the API module for various modules of the client device operation as described above. At some point after receiving the tuning parameters the client device A retrieves or generates location information via the location service module and environmental data via the environment detection module operation . The client device A may then transmit a recurring message sometimes referred as a polling or I am here message containing the generated location and environment data to the server via the API module operation .

In response to the polling message the API module of the server may record information specific to the client device A operation . For example the API module may inform the presence module of this information so that the presence module may determine other potential client devices B within physical proximity to the first client device A. The API module may also cause the push subscribe module to subscribe the client device A to the server so that the client device A will receive updates regarding new content new groups new member client devices B for a group to which the client device A belongs and so on.

Also in response to the polling message the API module may invoke the group content ranker module with the received location and presence information to generate group recommendations for the client device A operation . A more detailed example of this operation is provided in . In that example the group content ranker module may provide the client device A location and environmental information to the candidate indexer module operation so that the candidate indexer module may identify candidate groups for the client device A operation . The candidate groups may include all groups in the vicinity of the client device A. In one example the vicinity of the client device A may be defined relative to a predefined area so that the candidate indexer module may then determine the location of the client device A relative to other client devices for various groups in the same or adjacent areas. Other groups not in the vicinity may also be considered such as current or recent groups to which friends of the client device A may belong or have recently belonged or to which the client device A may have been attached previously.

The candidate indexer module may then provide the candidate groups to the candidate scorer operation which may then independently score each of the candidate groups provided by the candidate indexer module as described above operation and provide those scores to the group content ranker module operation . In one example the candidate scorer module may receive several input factors to determine the score for a particular group. One such type of factor is explicit actions taken by users of the client device A regarding previous groups or associated client devices to which the client device A was attached. Such actions include for example manually joining a previous group manually creating a previous group manually maintaining an attachment to a previous group regardless of subsequent changes in location referred to as pinning to a group and designating a particular client device as a friend. Information may also be provided to the candidate index scorer module whether such a friend is present in the candidate group and whether the friend contributed content to the candidate group including annotations . The candidate index scorer module may also consider actions of the user of the client device A regarding previous interactions with the candidate group such as presence in the group and contribution of content and or annotations. In some examples the candidate index scorer module may also consider one or more factors indicating the relative loneliness of the client device A based on the number of friends contributors and the like previously associated with the client device A in other groups . The candidate index scorer module may also consider the time location and environmental information provided by the client device A via the API module of the server .

The candidate index scorer module may represent any and or all of these factors by numerical values which the candidate index scorer module may then subsequently weight to determine the relative importance of each factor. Various maximum or minimum limits may be placed on each of the values. Further one or more various time varying functions may be applied to each weighted factor value such as for example exponential decay asymptotic growth or a decreasing ramp to represent the effect of the passage of time on the factor. For example factors relating to the location of the client device A at various times may be conditioned with an exponential decay function such that older locations become less important to the scoring over time. An asymptotic growth function which approaches a particular maximum value may be applied to factors addressing the amount of contribution activity of friends of the client device A. Other factors such as the manual actions of the user of the client device A relative to the joining creating and pinning of groups may not be conditioned with a particular time varying function.

Each of the resulting values may then be combined by way of an aggregating function to determine the overall score for a candidate group . In one example the overall algorithm including the factor weights the applied time varying functions and the aggregating function may remain constant or static while in other implementations they may be altered over time as a result of one or more machine learning algorithms.

Upon receiving the candidate groups and their scores the group content ranker module either selects one of the candidate groups for the client device A or generates a new group for the client device A operation . In one example the group content ranker module compares the score of each candidate group to a predetermined threshold. If at least one of the candidate groups possesses a score meeting or exceeding the threshold the group content ranker module may select one or more of the candidate groups with the highest scores exceeding the threshold for the client device A to join. Instead if none of the candidate groups possesses a score as high as the threshold the group content ranker module may create a new group for the client device A to join. In the case of a new group group content ranker module may also associate the location and environmental metadata for the client device A with the new group so that other client devices B in the vicinity of the client device A may be asked to join the new group .

In some implementations the group content ranker module may also take into account previous user preferences regarding groups in order to select a group for the client device A. Such preferences may include for example favoring the joining of a group that includes specific client devices B such as friends or blocking the joining of a group that includes other specific client devices B. Such preferences may override the scores for the candidate groups provided by the candidate scorer module .

After the group content ranker module selects the one or more groups for the client device A to join potentially the group content ranker module may then associate the client device A to the selected group or groups operation by indicating to the presence module that the client device A is to be joined to the candidate group or groups and is to be removed from other groups in which the client device A may have been active. The push subscribe module may also be employed to subscribe the client device A to all real time changes detected for that group operation such as new content changes in group membership and so on. The client device A may also be subscribed to other candidate groups nearby in case a switch to one of those groups is subsequently warranted due to location changes and other circumstances.

For at least some of the embodiments described herein the algorithms employed to perform various functions regarding the formation of a group such as those performed by the affinity calculator module the candidate indexer module candidate scorer module and or the group content ranker module for example may be based on one or more types of modeling. Examples of such modeling may include but are not limited to logistic regression Bayesian networks random forest modeling and neural networks.

Returning to the API module of the server provides the recommended groups to the client device operation . In one example the API module provides a strong recommendation for one of the recommended groups for the client device A to join based on the highest score generated by the candidate scorer module . In response the user of the client device A selects one of the recommended groups operation . The client device A may then inform the server of the selection via the API module operation . In another example the server may simply select the highest ranked group for the client device A and inform the client device A of the selection of the group in which case the client device A need not select a particular group to join or inform the server of the selection. In some cases the client device A may instead be able to explicitly change the group selected by the server to another of the candidate groups .

In one implementation the server may be capable of detecting circumstances in which multiple client devices attempt to create a new group nearly simultaneously which should logically be the same group . In this example the server analyzes one or more factors including but not limited to the location and environmental conditions of the client devices attempting to create a new group and the timing of the creation of the groups . Based on that analysis the server may instead create a single group for all of the involved client devices to join.

At this point the client device A and the server are in agreement as to the particular group that the client device A has joined. Further the entire evaluation process of operations of deciding whether the client device A should remain in the current group or be removed from the group possibly in order to join a new group may be performed again in response to one or more events . One such event may be the expiration of a timeout timer or heartbeat counter which may cause the client device A to gather location and environmental data operation and transmit another polling message containing that data operation once a certain period of time for example three or five minutes has elapsed since the last polling message was transmitted. The heartbeat counter may be maintained either in the server or the client A. Another such event may be the generation of a new group in the vicinity of the client device A in which case the server informs the client device A of the new group causing the client device A to transmit another polling message . Further another event may occur if the client device A detects significant physical movement via location or environmental data of the client device A . In some implementations the user of the client device A may explicitly request a re initiation of the grouping process thus constituting another type of the event . In each case the server may then determine that the client device A should either remain in the current group or switch to another group based on the scores generated for each group in the server . In other examples the grouping operations may also occur in response to the creation or capture of content in the client device A which is then uploaded to the server for distribution to other member client devices B of the group .

In some implementations a group may be strongly identified with or pinned to a particular location or venue such as a local pub or a stadium or arena. As a result the user of the client device A may explicitly request a re initiation of the grouping process when entering such an area or the server may initiate the process in response to detecting that the client device A has entered that area. Accordingly the server may thus provide the client device A with the option of joining that particular group . Similarly upon leaving such a predetermined area either the server or the client device A may again initiate the grouping process to find another group for the client device A.

In yet other embodiments the server may initiate the grouping process for the client device A with the intent of removing the client device A from its current group in response to unwanted objectionable or fraudulent behavior by the user of the client device A. For example other member client devices B of the group may signal the server to request that the client device A be removed from the group . Depending on the number and nature of the requests from the other client devices B the server may either reinitiate the grouping process while requiring the client device A to be removed from the current group or just unilaterally remove the client device A from the group without attempting to join the offending client device A to another group . In another implementation the server may perform such actions without requests or other input from the other client devices B of the group by way of some algorithm or heuristic. For example the server may base a decision to exclude the client device A from the group upon detection of the client device A posting an inordinate amount of content or posting objectionable content such as inappropriate comments photos and the like.

In the event that the client device A loses contact with the server for periods of time and thus is not able to provide the polling message with the location and environmental data in a timely manner the coasting module of the client device A can determine whether or for how long the client device A remains in the joined group . In one example the server pushes a set of guidelines or instructions employed by the coasting module to determine under what conditions the client device A has left its selected group . For example various conditions such as a lack of contact with the server for a predetermined minimum period of time movement by the client device A exceeding some minimum distance and or possibly some change in interaction between the client device A and another client device B such as a friend may cause the coasting module to determine that the client device A is no longer part of its selected group .

While joined with a group the client device A may upload content that is captured or generated in the client device A to the server for distribution to other member client devices B of the group . provides a flow diagram of a method for distributing or sharing the content . For example in response to the user of the client device A activating a camera button of the client device A entering text into the client device A or performing a similar action the client device A captures the associated content operation .

The client device A may also process the content such as provide thumbnail versions of a photo as well as other information relating to the photo to generate additional data to be included with the content operation . The client device A may also attach to the content the various location and environmental metadata provided via the location services module and the environment detection module as well as possibly the identity of the client device A operation . Other information regarding the content such as brightness and contrast scores for an image may also be attached as metadata to the content . The client device A may then upload the content and attendant metadata to the server via the API module operation .

Upon receipt of the content and metadata the server may then process the content operation . In some examples the server via the face detection recognition module and the image quality detection module may modify the content such as crop still images to show better show faces or eliminate portions of images or entire images that are of poor quality. Further the server may be capable of associating user names with faces appearing in images and providing those names as metadata to the receiving client devices B. That information may also be employed in some embodiments to associate other client devices B with the group . The server may employ other types of processing of the content in other examples.

The server also determines the group that the client device A is currently associated with operation . In one implementation if the client device A has maintained contact with the server prior to the uploading of the content and associated metadata operation the API module may determine that the current group with which the client device A is joined is the intended destination group . If instead the client device A had previously lost contact with the server the server API module may cause the group candidate ranker module to determine via the metadata associated with the content if the client device A belonged with another group at the time the content was captured or generated. Once the group determination has been made the API module may also store the content and associated metadata as a child data structure of the group data structure associated with the group .

Once the group associated with the client device A is determined the server may then download the content and metadata via the push subscribe module to the client devices B with the group operation . For example each of the other client devices B may be sent a message indicating that the content from the client device A is available for download via the Comet model mentioned earlier. In some implementations the other client devices B may download thumbnail sketches or other forms of the content prior to downloading the full content depending on the size of the content the bandwidth available in the connection between the server and the other client devices B and other factors.

After downloading the content and any related metadata the receiving client device B may present the content to the user operation such as by way of a user interface of the client device B. Also the content may be archived in the client device B for subsequent retrieval and presentation to the user such as by way of a content diary described below.

Other than content other types of information can be pushed to any of the client devices of a particular group . This information may include for example a notification that another client device has joined the group to which the client device receiving the notification is joined and that a new group is available to the client device receiving the notification. In one implementation these notifications including a notification of new content may be provided via the user interface of the receiving client module such as via an inbox window or similar area of the user interface.

Attached below are three appendixes with each appendix providing an example Java class of a function described above. Appendix 1 provides a definition of a SignalsScorer class that accepts a set of functions and data values applies the functions to the data and produces an output score. The class may take a valueFunction to be applied to each of the values individually an agingFunction to modify each of the values based on their age an arrayFunction to apply a modifying function to the values as a group and a finalFunction to generate the overall score for the values. The SignalsScorer class is used by both an example ContactScorer class Appendix 2 and an example GroupPhotoRanker class Appendix 3 both of which are shown below.

In Appendix 2 the example ContactScorer class employed in the affinity calculator module of produces an affinity score for one client device in relation to another client device based on an aggregation of a number of interactions between the client devices such as likes and text replies posted between the client devices the number of times one of the client devices was joined to the same group as the other client device automatically or explicitly and other factors. The produced score is ultimately used to determine which contacts should be placed in an active content list for a client device.

Appendix 3 provides the example GroupPhotoRanker class which calculates a score representing a connection strength or affinity for a client device in relation to a candidate group based on for example a group pin score representing an amount or degree of pinning as described above a group join score a group self create score a friend contribution score a friend presence score a loneliness score as discussed earlier a Wi Fi proximity score and a space time score. The GroupPhotoRanker class may be employed in the group content ranker module of .

As a result of at least some of the embodiments discussed herein sharing of content such as still images video clip audio segments and textual data may be shared easily among a number of client devices that form their own network based on previous or current physical proximity previous contacts between the various devices and or other factors. Such groups may be formed on the fly without the users of the client devices forming or configuring the group beforehand without explicit authorization of the client devices and without providing personally identifiable information of the users.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission signal or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone client or server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In various embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured e.g. as a special purpose processor such as a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry e.g. as encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the term hardware module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner and or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where the hardware modules comprise a general purpose processor configured using software the general purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple such hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured such processors may constitute processor implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may in some example embodiments comprise processor implemented modules.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments the processor or processors may be located in a single location e.g. within a home environment an office environment or as a server farm while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.

The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. APIs .

Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry or in computer hardware firmware or software or in combinations thereof. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product e.g. a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier in a machine readable medium for execution by or to control the operation of data processing apparatus e.g. a programmable processor a computer or multiple computers .

A computer program can be written in any form of programming language including compiled or interpreted languages and it can be deployed in any form including as a stand alone program or as a module subroutine or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communications network.

In example embodiments operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as special purpose logic circuitry e.g. a field programmable gate array FPGA or an application specific integrated circuit ASIC .

The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on their respective computers and having a client server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system it will be appreciated that both hardware and software architectures may be considered. Specifically it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware e.g. an ASIC in temporarily configured hardware e.g. a combination of software and a programmable processor or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set forth hardware e.g. machine and software architectures that may be deployed in various example embodiments.

The example computer system includes a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU or both a main memory and a static memory which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD or a cathode ray tube CRT . The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a user interface UI navigation device e.g. a mouse a disk drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device . The computer system may also include a environmental input device that may provide a number of inputs describing the environment in which the computer system or another device exists including but not limited to any of a Global Positioning Sensing GPS receiver a temperature sensor a light sensor a still photo or video camera an audio sensor e.g. a microphone a velocity sensor a gyroscope an accelerometer and a compass.

The disk drive unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of data structures and instructions e.g. software embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media.

While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium may include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more instructions or data structures. The term non transitory machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any tangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present subject matter or that is capable of storing encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions. The term non transitory machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories and optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of non transitory machine readable media include but are not limited to non volatile memory including by way of example semiconductor memory devices e.g. Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EPROM Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM and flash memory devices magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks magneto optical disks and CD ROM and DVD ROM disks.

The instructions may further be transmitted or received over a computer network using a transmission medium. The instructions may be transmitted using the network interface device and any one of a number of well known transfer protocols e.g. HTTP . Examples of communication networks include a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN the Internet mobile telephone networks Plain Old Telephone Service POTS networks and wireless data networks e.g. WiFi and WiMAX networks . The term transmission medium shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible media to facilitate communication of such software.
