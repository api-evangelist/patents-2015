title: Alternative semantics for zoom operations in a zoomable scene
abstract: A scene comprising a set of visual elements may allow a user to perform “zoom” operations in order to navigate the depth of the scene. The “zoom” semantic is often applied to simulate optical visual depth, wherein the visual elements are presented with different visual dimensions and visual resolution to simulate physical proximity or distance. However, the “zoom” semantic may be alternatively applied to other aspects of the visual elements of a scene, such as a user selection of a zoomed-in visual element, a “drill-down” operation on a data set, or navigation through a portal in a first data set to view a second data set. These alternative “zoom” semantics may be achieved by presenting the effects of a “zoom” operation within the scene on the visual presentation of the visual element in a manner other than an adjustment of the visual dimensions and resolution of the visual element.

The present application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 823 658 filed on Jun. 25 2010 and also entitled Alternative Semantics for Zoom Operations in a Zoomable Scene the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully rewritten herein.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a scene comprising a collection of visual elements such as an image album comprising a set of image images a map comprising a set of locations and a data set comprising a set of visually presented data items. These scenes may support zooming such as zooming in to view an image in an image album at a larger size and higher visual resolution or zooming out of a location in a map to achieve an understanding of the surrounding area. Such zooming may be achieved e.g. by performing click operations with a pointer by rotating a scroll wheel of a mouse or by performing pinch and stretch operations on a multi touch display. The zoom may be rendered in many ways such as a prompt transition from the first zoom level to the second zoom level a cross fading between the view of the scene at the first zoom level and the view of the scene at the second zoom level or a blurring of the scene at the first zoom level and a refocusing of the scene at the second zoom level.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In many scenarios that support a zoomable user interface various zoom operations result in the presentation of a new view of the scene where the visual elements are presented with larger or smaller visual dimensions or at a higher or lower visual resolution. For example a map may be rendered at an overview zoom level that may present various locations at small visual dimensions and or at a low visual resolution but when a user zooms in on a location the map may load e.g. from a map store higher visual resolution versions of the locations and may render the locations with larger visual dimensions. Thus zooming serves as a visual depth based semantic to render visual elements at lower or higher visual resolutions and with smaller or larger visual dimensions based on the proximity of the view to the proximity of the visual elements.

However zoom operations may also refer to other semantics. Zooming in on a visual element may result in a new presentation of the visual element having visual differences other than changes to the visual dimensions and visual resolution of the presented visual element. For example zooming in on a data set may be interpreted to view additional data relating to the zoomed in portion such as a drill down operation e.g. a scene representing an athletic sport might represent an entire league the first zoom level but might permit the user to zoom in on a team name to present details of the team at a second zoom level and to zoom in on the name of a player for the team to present details about the player at a third zoom level . Zooming in on an image may in addition to a higher visual resolution or larger view of the image result in a presentation of metadata about the image such as the names of individuals and topics located in the image and the time and place when the image was captured. Zooming in may also be utilized as a navigation semantic e.g. zooming in on a particular portion of a map of a website may result in a presentation of the web page of the website corresponding to the zoomed in portion. In these and other scenarios zooming within a zoomable scene may therefore be used to represent many types of interaction with the visual objects of a scene other than visual dimension and visual resolution based transformations.

Presented herein are techniques for achieving various presentations of a zoomable scene that utilize alternative semantics for zoom operations. These techniques involve storing a set of visual presentations for respective visual elements present in the scene. At a first zoom level a particular visual element may be presented with a first visual presentation but at a second zoom level the visual element may be presented with a second visual presentation that differs from the first visual presentation in aspects other than visual dimensions and visual resolution. For example the second visual presentation of a data set may supplement the first visual presentation of the data set with additional information a completely different data set or a data object. While the second visual presentation may also present visual dimensional and visual resolution based differences the present techniques relate to other visual differences between the first visual presentation and the second visual presentation. In one such context the zooming semantic is used to select a media item out of a set of media items for rendering e.g. a zoomed out collection of a set of video objects such as video files may present a set of preview images of respective represented videos and zooming in on one of the video objects may cause it to begin playing the full presentation video. Many such scenarios may be devised to utilize alternative semantics for zoom operations in regard to the visual elements of a zoomable scene. Configuring the scene to promote such visual transitions with visual elements presented differently at different zoom levels may be particularly useful while presenting a large number of items e.g. as an overview of grouped items on which the user may zoom in to view more details and or a hierarchically structured data e.g. where sub elements of a particular zoomed in level may be presented as small items on which the user may zoom in to navigate to a lower level in the hierarchy .

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a scene comprising a set of visual elements where the scene may be navigated through the use of a zoom operation. As a first example an image library may be presented as a scene comprising a set of images such as a set of thumbnail images arrayed in a linear tiled or arbitrary manner such that the user may zoom in on a particular image to view it in more detail. As a second example a document may be presented in a document reader application and a user may zoom in to receive a magnified view of the text of the document. As a third example a map may comprise a set of locations and a user may zoom in to view a particular location at a higher size and visual resolution. The zoom operations may be performed in many ways e.g. the user may use plus and minus keys on a keyboard a scroll wheel on a mouse a pointing gesture such as a click or a lasso of a zoom region with a pointing device such as a mouse or a multi touch gesture such as a pinch operation or a stretch operation. These and other operations may result in a transition within the application from a first zoom level to a second zoom level such as zooming in or zooming out. These operations may also be combined with other visual operations e.g. pan or rotate in order to control the position of the viewport within the view.

The nature of the zoomable scene presented in the exemplary scenario of may be presented in many other scenarios. As a first example a map application as a zoomable scene featuring a set of locations as visual elements may permit a user to zoom in on a location to view it in detail. As a second example an office productivity document as a scene may be rendered as a full page e.g. with the characters of a document the numbers of a spreadsheet or the records of a database comprising the visual elements and may permit a user to zoom in on a portion of the page to view the visual elements at a higher magnification for easier reading. As a third example an image editing application may present an overview an overview of an image at a low zoom level comprising a set of pixels as visual elements and may permit the user to zoom in on a portion of the image to permit examination and adjustment of particular sets of pixels. In these and other scenarios a device configured to present the scene may achieve this result by for a particular visual element storing a high quality version of each visual element and downscaling each version to generate a smaller and lower quality version for a lower zoom level by storing several versions of each visual element and presenting the version of each visual element that is appropriate for the zoom level and or by producing a low quality version of each visual element at the low zoom level and then supplementing the low quality version with additional data to achieve higher quality presentations of the visual element for higher zoom levels .

A common concept among these scenarios is the use of zoom as a semantic for adjusting the simulated physical depth of the view along a Z axis within the scene . For example visual elements may be presented at a low zoom level as small in order to simulate distance between the user and the visual element and the action of zooming in may resemble navigation along the Z axis that brings the user closer to the visual elements which are then presented with a larger size to simulate proximity. Therefore the use of zoom in these scenarios serves as a navigational semantic that allows the user to adjust the Z axis position of the view within the deep and zoomable scene . According to the mechanics of organic vision when a visual element is presented in proximity it appears larger and more detailed. Similarly adjustments in the zoom level of the scene may present simulations of depth by for various visual elements adjusting the visual dimensions and the visual resolution of the visual elements .

However it may be appreciated that in many scenarios featuring a zoomable scene comprising a set of visual elements the zooming factor may be partially decoupled from the zooming semantic such that zooming in or out yields a different result than visual elements having different visual dimensions and visual resolutions. As a first example a user may zoom in on a visual element of a scene in order to indicate a selection of a particular visual element for a subsequent operation. This example may differ e.g. from image editing applications where a user may zoom in on a set of pixels of an image but may then have to as a separate and non zoom operation select the pixels of interest with a lasso tool. As a second example a user may zoom in on a portion of a data set such as a set of numbers in a spreadsheet as a request to view more detailed data about the numbers e.g. a drill down operation to navigate from a summary view of a portion of a data set to a more detailed view or an expand operation applied to a collapsed node in a tree view of a hierarchical data set. Conversely zooming out of the scene from an expanded node may be translated as a collapse operation. As a third example the scene may represent a first object representing a group of sub objects and zooming in on a data element may result in a presentation of the sub object with possibly more levels of zooming to support additional navigation to even deeper constituent parts. For example a first scene may represent a university as a set of departments as visual elements and zooming in on a department may result in a presentation of a second scene representing the details of the department such as the current set of course listings and faculty members and zooming in still further may result in a detailed presentation of a particular faculty member such as his or her curriculum vitae and class schedule or a particular course such as a course description .

In these and other ways the zoom operation is presented as a semantic not of the physical depth of visual elements within the scene but for alternative semantics such as user interest in and selection of a visual element a drill down or expand operation to display additional detail about a visual element or navigation through a hierarchical data set from a parent element to a child element contained therein. However it may be helpful to represent the transition within the scene from a first zoom state to a second zoom state as a depth based zoom even if the effect on the visual elements represented therein is not a depth based zoom resulting in different visual dimensions and visual resolution. For example upon receiving a zoom operation the device rendering the scene may render a visual zoom into or out of the scene as a transition between a first zoom level and a second zoom level . However the zoom operation may cause a different effect than a visual depth based zoom with respect to a visual element such as selection of the visual element a drill down or expand operation that adds data navigation to a deeper or shallower level of a hierarchical data set or navigation to a related but different set of data e.g. navigating to the target of a hyperlink by zooming in on the hyperlink . This combination may be helpful e.g. for preserving the visual zoom concept as a familiar and intuitive navigational semantic within the depth of the represented visual elements while also applying the zoom operation to the visual elements not as a visual depth based semantic that results in changes to the visual dimensions and or resolution of the visual elements but for alternative semantics regarding the visual elements .

As a second example of the techniques presented herein when a second zoom operation is received that requests to zoom in on the name of the artist of the artwork depicted in the zoomed in visual element a second visual zoom transition may be rendered such as visually expanding the name of the artist while fading out the other visual elements of the scene and resulting in a third zoom level comprising a brief biography of the artist of the artwork. The second zoom operation therefore represents a conceptual navigation within an information hierarchy represented by the scene . Moreover in contrast with the first zoom operation that results in a supplementing of the information about a zoomed in visual element e.g. additional details about the artwork depicted in the visual element this conceptual navigation results in a presentation of a completely different set of information i.e. the biography of the artist does not particularly relate to the artwork represented in the visual element to which the zoom operation was applied but instead allows the user to navigate within the information set associated with the visual element to a different information set. However the navigation semantic of conceptual depth may be promoted through the rendering of the visual zoom transitions . Additionally reverse zoom operations e.g. zoom out may be invoked to reverse the conceptual depth navigation within the information set e.g. to transition from the third zoom level back to the second zoom level and then back to the first zoom level . These reverse zoom operations may also be supported through the rendering of visual zoom transitions e.g. zoom out visual transitions that return the view of the scene to a previous state and a fade in to cause visual elements that were not visible at the higher zoom level to appear in the scene at the lower zoom level .

The exemplary system of comprises a visual presentation store which is configured to store for respective visual elements at least two visual presentations that are respectively associated with a particular zoom level of the scene . For example the visual presentation store may store for a first visual element a first visual presentation whereby the first visual element may be presented at a first zoom level including a first range of zoom levels and a second visual presentation whereby the first visual element may be presented at a second zoom level including a second range of zoom levels . Additionally in accordance with the techniques presented herein the second visual presentation differs from the first visual presentation by a visual difference other than visual dimension s and or visual resolution. The exemplary system also comprises a scene transitioning component which is configured to upon receiving a zoom operation transitioning the scene to a new zoom level e.g. an operation performed by the user using an input component of the user device transition the scene to the new zoom level . The exemplary system also comprises a scene presenting component which is configured to present the visual elements of the scene . In particular at a first zoom level of the scene the scene presenting component presents for respective visual elements a first visual presentation of the visual element selected from the visual presentation store that is associated with the first zoom level and at a second zoom level presents within the scene a second visual presentation of the visual element associated with the second zoom level the scene presenting component presents for respective visual elements a second visual presentation selected from the visual presentation store that is associated with the second zoom level and that also has at least one visual difference other than visual dimension and visual resolution with respect to the first visual presentation of the visual element . The presentation of the various visual presentations of the visual elements of the scene may be generated and presented to the user e.g. for displaying on the display component of the user device . In this manner the exemplary system achieves the presentation of visual elements within the zoomable scene according to a zoom semantic other than a visual depth based zoom semantic in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of presenting within a scene having a zoom level at least one visual element having at least two visual presentations such as the exemplary method of . In another such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a system for presenting within a scene having a zoom level at least one visual element having at least two visual presentations such as the exemplary system of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a nontransitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of and the exemplary system of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein these techniques may be utilized. As a first example these techniques may be utilized to generate a visual presentation of many types of scenes representing many types of visual elements such as data sets comprising images audio or video recordings documents facts data objects or other forms of data maps of various types of objects and or locations and elements of an information hierarchy such as the set of rental properties depicted in the exemplary scenario of . As a second example of this first aspect many types of visual presentations of a scene may be utilized such as various two dimensional or three dimensional representations including a top or aerial view a front view a side or profile view or an isometric view or a simulated view of an information hierarchy where the zoom level represents a hierarchical level within the information hierarchy and where the visual elements of the scene depict the elements within the hierarchical level e.g. the nodes at a particular level of a tree view of a tree hierarchy .

As a third example of this first aspect many types of visual zoom transitions may be utilized as a visual indication to the user of the type direction focus and extent of the zoom. In a first such variation a visual zoom transition may be visually represented as a continuous zoom comprising a continuous set of incremental visual depth based view changes from the first zoom state to the second zoom state where visual elements change in visual dimensions and resolution. In a second such variation a visual zoom transition may be visually represented as a discrete step wherein the view rapidly changes from the first zoom state to the second zoom state with few or no intermediate transitional view stages. In a third such variation a visual zoom transition may be visually represented by rendering a zoomed in visual element to grow to fill the entire scene while possibly leaving the other visual elements and the remainder of the scene at the same proportions . In a fourth such variation a visual zoom transition may be visually represented as a cross fading effect wherein the view of the scene at the first zoom level fades out as the view of the scene at the second zoom level concurrently fades in. In a fifth such variation a visual zoom transition may be visually represented as a depth of field effect wherein visual elements that are within a focal depth of the scene based on the zoom level are presented in sharp focus and visual elements at other focal depths of the scene are presented as unfocused or blurry. Moreover variations or combinations of these exemplary visual zoom transitions may be utilized in different contexts e.g. a continuous visual zoom transition might be rendered to connote a drill down operation that adds data to a data set while a blur visual zoom transition might be rendered to connote a navigation within the visual element from a first data set to a second data set that is associated with but not necessarily related to the first data set such as in the second visual zoom transition in the exemplary scenario of . 

As a fourth example of this first aspect variations may be selected in the design of various implementations of embodiments of these techniques. As a first variation while the exemplary method depicts one such factoring and ordering of elements of a method embodiment of these techniques other factorings and orderings may be devised and some may present advantages with respect to other factorings and orderings. In one such embodiment the retrieval of visual presentations of various visual elements e.g. from a visual presentation store might be achieved apart from the rendering of the scene at a zoom level e.g. a visual presentation cache may be devised to store visual presentations of visual elements that may imminently be utilized to render a scene at a particular zoom level . As a second variation the exemplary system may be incorporated into a device configured to present various renderings of the scene to a user device for presentation on the display component e.g. the device may comprise a webserver of a property rental agency and may present to visitors of the website a rental property database regarding the availability and details of various rental properties and may therefore generate and present for rendering by a web browser on the user device various renderings of a scene representing the rental property database at various zoom levels . Alternatively the exemplary system might be implemented within the user device e.g. in order to present a conventional database presented by a property rental agency as a zoomable interface that promotes navigation through the hierarchical data contained therein.

As a fifth variation of this first aspect the zoom operation may be controlled in many ways. As a first such variation the zoom operation may be received from a user and or from an automated process such as another application or a script that controls the position of the viewport within the scene . As a second such variation the zoom operation may be controlled in many ways such as by specifying or adjusting the focal point of the zoom operation within the scene the speed of the zoom operation e.g. specifying a rate of change of the viewpoint the number of levels through a navigation of a hierarchy presented in the scene or a transition to a specific zoom level within the scene such as a transition to a particular scene context or a particular point in a hierarchically structured data set presented within the scene . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many scenarios wherein various implementations of the techniques presented herein may be utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to variable characteristics and uses of the zoom level of the scene . As a first example for a particular visual element many types of visual differences may be included in different visual presentations of the visual element at different zoom levels of the scene . In a first such variation the first visual presentation may comprise a content set and the second visual presentation may comprise a different content set e.g. a visual element representing the collected works of a particular artist may feature at different zoom levels different artworks created by the artist at different times. In this variation the zoom level may semantically represent a chronology selector for the chronology of the items represented in the visual element . In a second such variation the first visual presentation may comprise a visual style and the second visual presentation may comprise a different visual style e.g. a visual element may present a simplified view of a user interface or data set at a first zoom level and a more sophisticated view of the user interface or data set at a different zoom level . In this variation the zoom level may semantically represent a selector of various user interfaces of different levels of complexity for the visual element . In a third such variation the first visual presentation may comprise a data object of a data object type and the second visual presentation may comprise a data object of a different data object type e.g. a numeric data set may be presented at a first zoom level as a chart and at a second zoom level as a spreadsheet. In this variation the zoom level may semantically represent a selector for various views of the visual element . In a fourth such variation the first visual presentation may comprise a visual element functionality and the second visual presentation may comprise a different visual element functionality e.g. a visual element representing a document may permit the user to navigate through the document at a first zoom level but to edit a particular portion of the document upon zooming in on the portion. In this variation the zoom level may semantically represent a functionality selector for the visual element .

As a second example of this second aspect the zoom level may be used to represent various contexts of the scene . A non contextual use of the zoom level of the scene might arise e.g. where the visual elements of the scene are comparatively unrelated such as a collection of unrelated files in a file system. However some scenes might utilize the zoom level as a contextual metaphor where different zoom levels may represent different contexts of the interaction of the user with the concepts represented by the scene . The exemplary scenario of presents one such contextual use of the zoom level as a contextual metaphor wherein the scene represents a hierarchically structured information set. The first zoom level represents a neighborhood level context of the interaction of the user with the information set while a second level represents a unit level context of the interaction of the user with the information set and a third level represents a room level context of the interaction of the user with the information set. Additional zoom levels might represent different contexts e.g. a zoom level at a lower level than the first zoom level might contextually represent a set of property rental agencies or a set of regions such as cities where rental properties may be available and a zoom level at a higher level than the third zoom level might represent a transaction between the user and the rental property agency relating to a leasing agreement of the rental property zoomed in by the user at the second zoom level and the third zoom level . Moreover in some variations different visual elements may specify be associated with different sets of contexts for different sets of zoom levels e.g. a first visual element may have different visual presentations representing different contexts at a first zoom level and a second zoom level within the scene while a second visual element may have different visual presentations representing different contexts at the first zoom level and a third zoom level .

As a third example of this second aspect the association of various contexts with various zoom levels of the scene may affect the design and use of the user interface configured to present the zoomable scene . One such user interface may permit a free exploration of the zoomable scene by the user e.g. an unrestricted capability to pan tilt rotate and or zoom the view within the scene and when the user arrives at a zoom level e.g. zooming in at a particular magnitude on a particular visual element the user interface may adjust the visual presentation to indicate the scene context of the zoom level . Another user interface may constrain the selection of the zoom level and possibly other aspects such as panning capabilities such that the zoom level of the scene is always associated with a particular scene context of the scene . For example in the exemplary scenario of a user may be permitted to explore the zoomable scene freely and the user interface may present a particular scene context of the scene such as an inquiry into the availability and details of a particular rental unit such as the scene context of the second zoom level if and when the user transitions the scene to a corresponding zoom level . Alternatively the exemplary scenario of may constrain the zooming navigation within the scene to zoom levels having a particular scene context and may transition to a new zoom level only if the new zoom level represents a scene context of the scene . For example if the user performs a zoom operation indicating zooming into a particular area of the scene an embodiment of these techniques may either identify the zoom level nearest the zoom level indicates by the zoom operation that represents a scene context or may simply refuse the zoom operation if it is not sufficiently close to any zoom level associated with a scene context. In the latter case the user interface might detect that the user is having difficulty navigating within the scene and may display suggestions or hints such as visual indicators of valid locations for zoom operations within the scene . Moreover in scenarios featuring two or more visual elements having disjoint sets of contexts represented at different zoom levels the embodiment may constrain the zoom level of the scene to the zoom levels associated with the contexts for a particular visual element upon which the user may have selected.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the visual presentations that are selected for a visual element when the zoom level of the scene is and is not within a proximity of the visual element . For example whether or not a zoomable scene constrains the zoom level to various scene contexts a zoom level may be selected that has a proximity to a particular visual element e.g. zooming in on a particular visual element such that it fills or nearly fills the display component of the user device . The proximity of the zoom level to the visual element may indicate a particular semantic action of the user regarding the visual element e.g. the user may have selected the zoom level in order to express an intent to examine the visual element to select the visual element and or to interact with the visual element . Accordingly for a first zoom level that does not comprise a view proximity zoom level regarding the visual element a corresponding first visual presentation may comprise a distant version of the visual element and for a second zoom level that comprises a view proximity zoom level regarding the visual element a second visual presentation may comprise a proximate version of the visual element .

This semantic use of the zoom level and the corresponding selection of visual elements may result in many uses. As a first example where a visual element represents a media object the first visual presentation representing a distant version of the visual element may comprising a preview version of the media object and the second visual presentation comprising a presentation version of the media object. This variation might be presented e.g. in the exemplary scenario of where the third zoom level includes a video depicting a room of a rental unit and where the second zoom level includes a thumbnail image that might have been captured from the video or a lower quality or brief segment of the video and that might comprise a preview version of the video that may suggest an offer for the presentation version of the video if the user performs a zoom operation upon the preview version.

As a second example of this third aspect one or more visual elements may involve a computational process which may relate to the data or concepts represented by the visual element and or the context of the visual element within the scene . For example a visual element representing a data object may involve persistent updating of the visual presentation of the data object to reflect the current state of the data object a visual element representing a playing media object such as an audio or video recording may involve a rendering of the frames of the media object such as a decompressing of the media stream using a codec and a visual element representing a set of data retrieved from a data source may involve periodically refreshing the data from the data source to reflect fresh data. In these scenarios it may be advantageous to perform the computational processing of respective visual elements based on the zoom level and in particular based on the proximity of the zoom level to the respective visual element . For example where a visual element within the scene involves a foreground computational process such as an active computationally intensive process that relates to a proximity version of the visual presentation such as the rendering of a presentation version of a visual presentation of a video the foreground computational process may be executed when the zoom level is in the proximity of the visual element and may not be executed e.g. by pausing the rendering of the video when the zoom level is not within a view proximity zoom level of the visual element even if the distant version of the visual presentation of the visual element is presented within the scene . This configuration may allow many visual elements featuring intensive foreground computational processes to be located within the scene and to allocate the computational resource of the rendering device based on an expressed interest of the user in a particular visual element . Alternatively or additionally one or more visual elements within the scene may involve a background computational process such as a low level process that performs a small amount of computation in order to maintain the freshness of the visual presentation of the visual element and an embodiment may be configured to execute the background computational process when the zoom level is not within a view proximity zoom level of the visual element .

For example in the exemplary scenario illustrated in a first visual element representing the rental car travel option may involve a background computational process that retrieves an estimated cost and duration of the trip and a foreground computational process that negotiates with local car rental agencies to retrieve a current low rental price that generates a more accurate estimate of the travel duration in view of current road traffic and weather conditions that presents a map and directions for the road trip and that presents a portal to a car rental agent site e.g. an advertisement an offer for a discount on the rental a transactional form to complete the car rental or a communication session with an agent of the travel agency. Accordingly an embodiment of these techniques may at a first zoom level that is not in the proximity of the first visual element execute the background computational process of the first visual element and present a visual presentation comprising a distant version of the first visual element within the scene featuring a summary of estimated costs and durations and upon receiving a zoom operation that zooms into the proximity of the first visual element may execute the foreground computational process of the first visual element and present a visual presentation comprising a proximate version of the first visual element within the scene featuring the set of current and highly detailed information about the first travel option. Similarly the exemplary scenario also features a second visual element representing the air travel option that involves a background computational process that is configured to retrieve an estimated cost and duration of the air travel and a foreground computational process that negotiates with airlines to identify a suitable e.g. timely and low cost scheduled flight that presents the current costs times and seat availability on the flight and that initiates a transaction to purchase a ticket on behalf of the user . An embodiment of these techniques may at a first zoom level that is not in the proximity of the second visual element execute the background computational process of the first visual element and present a visual presentation comprising a distant version of the second visual element within the scene featuring a summary of estimated costs and durations and upon receiving a zoom operation that zooms into the proximity of the second visual element may execute the foreground computational process of the second visual element and present a visual presentation comprising a proximate version of the first visual element within the scene featuring the set of current and highly detailed information about the suitable flight. In this manner the embodiment may execute the foreground computational processes and the background computational processes of the visual elements while efficiently allocating the computing resources based on the zoom level of the scene . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many ways of differently presenting a distant view and a proximate view of a visual element in view of the current zoom level of the scene featuring the visual element while implementing the techniques presented herein.

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the visual presentations that are selected for a visual element when the zoom level of the scene is at a shallow zoom level or a deep zoom level regarding the visual element . For example for a particular visual element a range of proximity zoom levels may be available such as increasingly high zoom levels centered on different portions of the visual element . These different zoom levels may be interpreted accordingly e.g. a first zoom level within the proximity of a visual element may be interpreted as a shallow zoom level while a second zoom level within the proximity of a visual element may be interpreted as a deep zoom level. Accordingly different visual presentations of the visual element may be associated with the shallow zoom level and the deep zoom level regarding the visual element .

As a first example of this fourth aspect a first visual presentation of a visual element may comprise a portal to the second visual presentation of the visual element . For example where the visual element permits the user to navigate to a particular target such as a location such as a website data set or media object the second visual presentation may comprise a presentation of the target while the first visual presentation may comprise a portal to the target. For example in the exemplary scenario of the proximate view of the visual presentation of the visual element representing the first travel option includes as a visual presentation of the visual element associated with a shallow zoom level a portal to a rental agent site such as the website of a rental agency that may facilitate the rental of a car to the user . This portal may be presented e.g. as a simple indication of the target e.g. zoom in here to visit the website of the rental agency or as a preview version of the target e.g. a static screenshot of the front page of the website of the travel agency. However if the user performs a zoom operation resulting in a deep zoom of the visual element on this portal a different visual presentation of the visual element may be selected and presented that includes a fully operational version of the target such as an embedded web browser that is navigated to the front page of the website. In this manner the first visual presentation of the visual element associated with the shallow zoom level may semantically represent and visually indicate a portal to the target that is presented in the second visual presentation of the visual element associated with the deep zoom level. Moreover a portal may also a series of targets associated with a set of zoom levels and such targets may be arranged in multiple layers such as zooming in through a first portal in a first data set to view a second data set and zooming in through a second portal in the second data set to view a third data set.

As a second example of this fourth aspect the first visual presentation associated with a shallow zoom level may comprise a first data set and the second visual presentation associated with a deep zoom level may comprise the first data set supplemented with at least one supplemental data item. For example in the exemplary scenario of a first zoom level may present a distant view of a visual element such as an artwork and a second zoom level may present a proximity view of the visual element at a shallow view level e.g. a presentation of additional details about the artwork depicted in the zoomed in visual element . However although not shown in the exemplary scenario of it may be possible to designate a third zoom level that represents a deep zoom level relating to the visual element and that instead of navigating to a different data set such as the biography of the artist of the artwork depicted in the visual element supplements the data set presented with the visual element with at least one additional data item. For example upon zooming more deeply into the second zoom level additional information about the artwork might fade into view possibly in a smaller font between the already presented text such as the type of canvas the location where the artwork was created and the names of artistic styles and techniques presented in the artwork. In this manner the first visual presentation of the visual element associated with the shallow zoom level may be supplemented with additional data items by zooming into a deep zoom level regarding the visual element .

As a second example of this fourth aspect the first visual presentation associated with a shallow zoom level may comprise a first data set and the second visual presentation associated with a deep zoom level may comprise a presentation of a second data set that comprises an element within the first data set. For example a visual element within a presentation of a sports league may represent a particular sports team and zooming into the proximity of the visual element at a shallow zoom level may result in a visual presentation providing information about the sports team such as its history its win loss record and a roster of players. However zooming into the visual element to a deep zoom level on an entry in the roster of players may result in a visual presentation that provides information about the player such as his or her skills earned awards and scoring record in the current season. This example is also utilized in the exemplary scenario of wherein the first zoom level is associated with a first visual presentation comprising a distant view of a visual element representing a building in a neighborhood the second zoom level is associated with a second visual presentation comprising a proximity view of the visual element representing a shallow zoom level of the building as a first data set and the third zoom level is associated with a third visual presentation representing a deep zoom level of the building and also featuring a visual presentation of a rental unit within the building as a second data set . In this manner the shallow and deep zoom levels may permit the navigation of the zoom level of the scene among the constituent parts of a proximate visual element .

As a third example of this fourth aspect the first visual presentation associated with a shallow zoom level may comprise a first data set and the second visual presentation associated with a deep zoom level may comprise a presentation of a second data set that has no direct relationship with the first data set. This example is presented e.g. in the exemplary scenario of wherein a first zoom level of a scene presents a visual representation of a distant view of an artwork represented as a visual element and a second zoom level of the scene presents a visual representation of a proximate view of the artwork at a shallow zoom level that includes as a first data set additional information about the artwork. However the third zoom level presents a visual representation of the visual element at a deep zoom level . Moreover because the zoom operation is centered on the name of the artist who created the artwork depicted in the visual element the deep zoom level of the visual element presents a second data set involving the biography of the artist. This second data set has little relationship with the first data set involving the details of the creation of the artwork depicted in the visual element . Nevertheless the visual element may permit the user to zoom in on the name of the artist as a navigation option to view the unrelated second data set associated with the name of the artist. In this manner the shallow and deep zoom levels may permit the navigation of the zoom level of the scene among even unrelated data sets. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many such visual differences between the visual presentations associated with a shallow zoom level and a deep zoom level of a visual element while implementing the techniques presented herein.

A fifth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to additional features that may be included in various implementations of such techniques. As a first example a visual element may have a particular state such as a set of data associated with the visual element that may be altered by an interaction with the user and or based on a background computational process and or foreground computational process . An embodiment of these techniques may permit at least one visual presentation of the visual element to be updated to reflect the state of the visual element . For example a visual presentation of one of the visual elements in the exemplary scenario of may comprise a bitmap depicting the information included at the first zoom level and the background process of the visual element may periodically retrieve this information store it as part of the state of the visual element and if the information has changed since a retrieval during a previous period update the bitmap to reflect the refreshed information.

As a second example of this fifth aspect the retrieval of visual presentations may be performed in many ways. Some scenarios may involve a scene comprising a large number of visual elements and or a large number of visual presentations of such visual elements and or a large amount of data involved in one or more visual presentations of a visual element . Therefore it may be difficult for an embodiment of these techniques to retain in memory all of the data comprising all of the visual presentations for all of the visual elements of the scene . Accordingly the embodiment may be configured to manage the loading of visual presentations e.g. from the visual presentation store on an ad hoc basis. In a first such variation the embodiment may be configured to load from the visual presentation store a visual presentation of a visual element when the zoom level of the scene transitions to a zoom level associated with the visual presentation of a visual element that is presented within the scene . For example when a zoom operation is received that results in the transition of the scene to a new zoom level the embodiment may identify the visual elements that are visible within the scene at the new zoom level identify for each visual element a visual presentation stored in the visual presentation store that is associated with the new zoom level and may retrieve these visual presentations from the visual presentation store e.g. by loading these visual presentations into system memory or into a memory of a graphics processor. Additionally the embodiment may cache recently retrieved visual presentations and may only retrieve visual presentations from the visual presentation store that are not currently stored in the cache. Moreover these retrievals may be performed e.g. during the rendering of the visual zoom transition to the new zoom level . For example in the exemplary scenario of upon receiving the first zoom operation requesting a transition of the scene to the second zoom level an embodiment may request the second visual presentation associated with the zoomed in visual element while concurrently rendering the visual zoom transition using the already available first visual presentation of the visual element e.g. by upscaling the low resolution visual presentation to simulate the depth based visual zoom. This technique may permit the ad hoc retrieval of the second visual presentation while avoiding a performance delay such as a momentary pause during the retrieval of the second visual presentation from the visual presentation store .

However in some scenarios an ad hoc retrieval may be inadequate and may result in unacceptable performance or quality. As a first example a transition to a new zoom level may involve the loading of a potentially large number of visual presentations e.g. rapidly zooming out to show a large set of visual presentations of a large set of images in a scene representing an image set. As a second example one or more visual presentations involve a significant amount of data and or the visual presentation store may be accessible over a comparatively slow connection such as the internet and or the duration of the visual zoom transition may be brief as a result the visual presentations may not be available promptly upon completion of the visual zoom transition resulting in a momentary or even protracted application delay or loss of quality in the presentation. Accordingly as an additional variation of this second example an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to load visual presentations on an ad hoc basis but even before receiving a zoom operation by predicting a transition to a new zoom level that may imminently be requested by a user . If an embodiment of these techniques may predict imminent visual presentations of visual elements at an imminent zoom level within the scene then the embodiment upon achieving such a prediction load from the visual presentation store a visual presentation associated with the imminent zoom level for the visual element to be imminently presented. The embodiment may evaluate the current view of the scene and the actions of the user and other uses and may therefore predict the next actions including zoom operations that are likely to be received from the user and may therefore begin retrieving from the visual presentation store any visual presentations that may be involved in the presentation of the scene at the new zoom level and may not already have been retrieved and that may not be available in a cache .

To these ends an embodiment may predict the imminent zoom level and or the imminent visual presentations of the scene and or visual elements according to a set of visual presentation predictions such as detecting a user action of the user that suggests an imminent interaction of the user with the visual element at the imminent zoom level e.g. a visual element that the user is likely to select for zooming into proximity or into a deeper zoom level based on the history of the user the demographic information of the user and any other information about the user or the scene that may be predictive of imminent actions of the user . The embodiment might also identify at a prior zoom level of the scene that is equivalent with the zoom level of the scene a prior interaction of the user with the visual element at the imminent zoom level e.g. a previous viewing of the scene by the user at an equivalent zoom level that resulted in an interaction of the user with a particular visual element and that may be predictive of the user to wish to interact with the same or an equivalent visual element The embodiment might also identify at the zoom level of the scene a frequent interaction of users with the visual element at the imminent zoom level e.g. an action that is often taken by other users at the current zoom level of the scene that results in an interaction with a particular visual element and that may be similarly taken by the current user . Other predictive techniques might involve e.g. the evaluation of demographic information of the user to evaluate potential user interests in the visual elements statistical analyses of the behavior of the user and the use of learning techniques such as neural networks and genetic algorithms that may have been trained to predict user interactions with visual elements of the scene . By making such predictions the embodiment may begin loading the visual presentations of various visual elements in the scene significantly before the actual presentation of the visual presentations thereby improving the performance of the embodiment.

A particular technique for achieving the detection and prediction of imminent interactions of the user with visual elements within the scene involves the use of a scene graph. Particularly within the field of three dimensional graphics which may be involved in rendering the zoomable scene and visual elements the data comprising the scene is often stored in a scene graph data structure in order to promote the rapid identification of visual elements that are visible within a particular view of the scene . While the data objects residing within the scene graph typically indicate various visual properties of the objects of the three dimensional scene such as polygons and meshes it may be possible to utilize the scene graph to facilitate the prediction of imminent user interactions with various visual elements of the scene . In particular it may be possible to generate within the scene graph a trigger which may not represent a visible object but which may indicate a proximity of the actions of the user such as a cursor of a pointing device to a particular visual element as a predictive indicator of an imminent interaction therewith. The prediction of the interaction may then be detected when a three dimensional rendering technique that is configured to consume the scene graph to generate the three dimensional rendering of the scene detects a triggering of this trigger such as a proximity of the view or the cursor to the trigger which may prompt the embodiment to load a proximate visual presentation of one or more visual elements associated with the trigger. In this manner the scene graph may be utilized to facilitate the prediction of imminent presentations of particular visual elements of the scene at particular imminent zoom levels. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many predictive techniques that may facilitate the performance of embodiments thereof.
