This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 058 164 filed Oct. 18 2013 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 631 404 filed Dec. 4 2009 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 120 275 filed Dec. 5 2008 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 181 180 filed May 26 2009 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application.

This invention pertains to compounds which selectively inhibit the activity of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 family proteins compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases during which anti apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins are expressed.

Anti apoptotic Bcl 2 family proteins are associated with a number of diseases and are under investigation as potential therapeutic drug targets. These targets for interventional therapy include for example the Bcl 2 family proteins Bcl 2 Bcl Xand Bcl w. Recently inhibitors of Bcl 2 family proteins have been reported in commonly owned PCT US 2004 36770 published as WO 2005 049593 and PCT US 2004 367911 published as WO 2005 049594. While this art teaches inhibitors having high binding to the target protein compound binding affinity is only one of many parameters to be considered. One goal is to produce compounds that preferentially bind to that is are selective for one protein over another protein. To exhibit this selectivity it is well known that a compound not only displays a high binding affinity to a particular protein but a lower binding affinity for another member as well.

A typical measure of binding affinity of an anti apoptotic protein inhibitor is the balance between the binding and dissociation processes between the protein and the inhibitor K . The inhibition constant K is the dissociation constant of an enzyme inhibitor complex or a protein small molecule complex wherein the small molecule is inhibiting binding of one protein to another protein. So a large Kvalue indicates a low binding affinity and a small Kvalue indicates a high binding affinity.

A typical measure of cellular activity of an anti apoptotic protein inhibitor is the concentration eliciting 50 cellular effect EC .

Accordingly the inventors have discovered that while compounds taught in the art have utility for the treatment of various cancers and immune diseases they are not selective for anti apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins over anti apoptotic Bcl Xproteins and thereby result in a higher probability of side effects characterized by inhibition of anti apoptotic Bcl Xproteins such as thrombocytopenia.

This invention therefore comprises a series of compounds that demonstrate unexpected properties with respect to their selectivity for binding to and inhibiting the activity of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein over anti apoptotic Bcl Xprotein as significantly higher than those of the compounds taught in PCT US 2004 36770 and PCT US 2004 367911.

Geometric isomers may exist in the present compounds. Compounds of this invention may contain carbon carbon double bonds or carbon nitrogen double bonds in the E or Z configuration wherein the term E represents higher order substituents on opposite sides of the carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond and the term Z represents higher order substituents on the same side of the carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond as determined by the Cahn Ingold Prelog Priority Rules. The compounds of this invention may also exist as a mixture of E and Z isomers. Substituents around a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl are designated as being of cis or trans configuration. Furthermore the invention contemplates the various isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the disposal of substituents around an adamantane ring system. Two substituents around a single ring within an adamantane ring system are designated as being of Z or E relative configuration. For examples see C. D. Jones M. Kaselj R. N. Salvatore W. J. le Noble 1998 63 2758 2760 and E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen. 1994 . New York N.Y. John Wiley Sons Inc.

Compounds of this invention contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms in the R or S configuration in which the terms R and S are as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E Fundamental Stereochemistry Pure Appl. Chem. 1976 45 13 10. Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R and S configurations are racemic at those carbon atoms. Atoms with an excess of one configuration over the other are assigned the configuration present in the higher amount preferably an excess of about 85 90 more preferably an excess of about 95 99 and still more preferably an excess greater than about 99 . Accordingly this invention includes racemic mixtures relative and absolute stereoisomers and mixtures of relative and absolute stereoisomers.

Compounds of this invention containing NH C O OH OH or SH moieties may have attached thereto prodrug forming moieties. The prodrug forming moieties are removed by metabolic processes and release the compounds having the freed hydroxyl amino or carboxylic acid in vivo. Prodrugs are useful for adjusting such pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds as solubility and or hydrophobicity absorption in the gastrointestinal tract bioavailability tissue penetration and rate of clearance.

Compounds of the invention can exist in isotope labeled or enriched form containing one or more atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most abundantly found in nature. Isotopes can be radioactive or non radioactive isotopes. Isotopes of atoms such as hydrogen carbon phosphorous sulfur fluorine chlorine and iodine include but are not limited to H H C C N O P S F Cl and I. Compounds that contain other isotopes of these and or other atoms are within the scope of this invention.

In another embodiment the isotope labeled compounds contain deuterium H tritium H or C isotopes. Isotope labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope labeled reagent for a non labeled reagent. In some instances compounds may be treated with isotope labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope for example hydrogen for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as DSO DO. In addition to the above relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed for instance in Lizondo J et al. 21 11 1116 1996 Brickner S J et al. 39 3 673 1996 Mallesham B et al. 5 7 963 2003 PCT publications WO1997010223 WO2005099353 WO1995007271 WO2006008754 U.S. Pat.

The isotope labeled compounds of the invention may be used as standards to determine the effectiveness of Bcl 2 inhibitors in binding assays. Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope labeled parent compound Blake et al. 64 3 367 391 1975 . Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe effective therapeutic drugs either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic Foster et al. Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14 pp. 2 36 Academic press London 1985 Kato et al. J. 36 10 927 932 1995 Kushner et al. 77 79 88 1999 .

In addition non radio active isotope containing drugs such as deuterated drugs called heavy drugs can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to Bcl 2 activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 16 21 25 29 33 37 42 46 50 54 58 63 67 71 75 79 84 88 92 96 to about 100 mol . Replacement of up to about 15 of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals including rodents and dogs with minimal observed adverse effects Czajka D M and Finkel A J Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84 770 Thomson J F Ann. New York Acad. Sci 1960 84 736 Czakja D M et al. Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201 357 . Acute replacement of as high as 15 23 in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity Blagojevic N et al. in Dosimetry Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy Zamenhof R Solares G and Harling O Eds. 1994.

Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one the chemical and biological properties are the same with one important exception because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmcokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non isotopic compound.

Prodrugs are derivatives of an active drug designed to ameliorate some identified undesirable physical or biological property. The physical properties are usually solubility too much or not enough lipid or aqueous solubility or stability related while problematic biological properties include too rapid metabolism or poor bioavailability which itself may be related to a physicochemical property.

Prodrugs are usually prepared by a formation of ester hemi esters carbonate esters nitrate esters amides hydroxamic acids carbamates imines Mannich bases phosphates phosphate esters and enamines of the active drug b functionalizing the drug with azo glycoside peptide and ether functional groups c use of aminals hemi aminals polymers salts complexes phosphoramides acetals hemiacetals and ketal forms of the drug.

Esters can be prepared from substrates of formula I containing either a hydroxyl group or a carboxy group by general methods known to persons skilled in the art. The typical reactions of these compounds are substitutions replacing one of the heteroatoms by another atom for example 

Amides can be prepared from substrates of formula I containing either an amino group or a carboxy group in similar fashion. Esters can also react with amines or ammonia to form amides.

Another way to make amides from compounds of formula I is to heat carboxylic acids and amines together.

BiTE antibodies are bi specific antibodies that direct T cells to attack cancer cells by simultaneously binding the two cells. The T cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab Micromet MT201 blinatumomab Micromet MT103 and the like. Without being limited by theory one of the mechanisms by which T cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard Bcl 2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl 2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T cells when targeted to cancer cells V. R. Sutton D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani 1997 158 12 5783 .

SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides.

The siRNA can have varying lengths e.g. 10 200 bps and structures e.g. hairpins single double strands bulges nicks gaps mismatches and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double stranded siRNA dsRNA can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand blunt ends or asymmetric ends overhangs . The overhang of 1 2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and or the antisense strand as well as present on the 5 and or the 3 ends of a given strand. For example siRNAs targeting Mcl 1 have been shown to enhance the activity of ABT 263 i.e. N 4 4 2 4 chlorophenyl 5 5 dimethyl 1 cyclohex 1 en 1 yl methyl piperazin 1 yl benzoyl 4 1R 3 morpholin 4 yl 1 phenylsulfanyl methyl propyl amino 3 trifluoromethyl sulfonyl benzenesulfonamide or ABT 737 i.e. N 4 4 4 chloro 1 1 biphenyl 2 yl methyl piperazin 1 yl benzoyl 4 1R 3 dimethylamino 1 phenylsulfanyl methyl propyl amino 3 nitrobenzenesulfonamide in multiple tumor cell lines Tse et. al 2008 68 9 3421 and references therein .

The term multispecific binding protein means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain DVD binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific i.e. capable of binding one antigen or multispecific i.e. capable of binding two or more antigens . DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig s. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide a light chain DVD polypeptide and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF or C met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.

Inhibition constants K for compounds according to the invention and ABT 737 and the binding selectivity ratio Bcl XK Bcl 2 K for each are shown in TABLE 2 below. The inhibition constant K is the dissociation constant of an enzyme inhibitor complex or a protein small molecule complex wherein the small molecule is inhibiting binding of one protein to another protein or peptide. Where the Kfor a compound is represented as greater than a certain numerical value it is intended to mean that the binding affinity value e.g. for Bcl X is greater than the limits of detection of the assay used. Where the binding selectivity ratio for a compound is represented as greater than a certain numerical value it is intended to mean that the selectivity of a particular compound for Bcl 2 over Bcl Xis at least as great as the number indicated. Where the Kfor a compound is represented as 

TABLE 2 shows the utility of compounds having Formula I to functionally inhibit anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein. It also surprisingly demonstrates these compounds having comparatively less affinity for anti apoptotic Bcl xL protein which in turn gives rise to high binding selectivity ratios Bcl xL K Bcl 2 K ranging from 2 to 263 263. This selectivity for Bcl 2 protein is significantly greater than compounds previously disclosed in PCT US 2004 36770 and PCT US 2004 367911 as exemplified by ABT 737 in TABLE 2.

For some compounds e.g. 192 and 193 the assay did not detect any activity against either Bcl 2 or Bcl XL under the conditions stated above in the experimental description for the FRET assay. As those skilled in the art will appreciate the upper and lower limits of detection in an assay are influenced by the assay conditions and for the FRET assay specifically by the concentration of the probe that is used. Since compounds represented by Examples 192 and 193 show Kvalues that are greater than the limits of detection in the assay format used it can be stated that their affinity for Bcl 2 and Bcl XL is less than the upper limit of detection of the assays. However they may still have affinity for one or both proteins and the inventors expect that they also have selectivity for Bcl 2.

FL5.12 is an IL 3 dependent prolymphocytic murine cell line that undergoes apoptosis upon IL 3 withdrawal as a result of the upregulation of pro apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins such as Bim and Puma. Stable overexpression of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein FL5.12 Bcl 2 protects against apoptosis induced by IL 3 withdrawal by sequestration of Bim and Puma. Refs. Harada et. al. 101 15313 2004 Certo et. al. 9 351 2006 . The ability of compounds to kill FL5.12 Bcl 2 cells upon IL 3 withdrawal is a direct measure of the compounds ability to inhibit anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein function.

TABLE 3 shows the utility of compounds having Formula I to functionally inhibit anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein in a cellular context. FL5.12 is an IL 3 dependent prolymphocytic murine cell line that undergoes apoptosis upon IL 3 withdrawal as a result of the upregulation of pro apoptotic Bcl 2 family proteins such as Bim and Puma. Stable overexpression of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein FL5.12 Bcl 2 protects against apoptosis induced by IL 3 withdrawal by sequestration of Bim and Puma. Refs. Harada et. al. 2004 101 15313 Certo et. al. 2006 9 351. The ability of compounds to kill FL5.12 Bcl 2 cells upon IL 3 withdrawal is a direct measure of the compounds ability to inhibit anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein function. Compounds of Formula I are very effective in killing FL5.12 Bcl 2 cells under IL 3 withdrawal as demonstrated by low ECvalues.

Compounds of this invention bind to anti apoptotic Bcl 2 proteins with high affinity and potently inhibit the function of anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein in a cellular context and are therefore expected to have utility in treatment of diseases during which anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein is expressed.

The anti apoptotic Bcl xL protein has been disclosed elsewhere Cell Mar. 23 2007 128 1173 1176. to be the major regulator of the survival of circulating platelets in animals. Genetic mutations to Bcl xL protein that decrease Bcl xL protein stability and half life causes a decrease in platelet survival and life span in mice bearing these mutations. A potent pharmacologic inhibitor of Bcl xL ABT 737 causes a rapid concentration dependant decrease in circulating platelets following injection into C57BL 6 mice or in beagle canines Mar. 23 2007 128 1173 1176. May 2007 14 5 943 51 . Thus without being limited by theory compounds of this invention that have reduced affinity for Bcl xL can be expected to show lower levels of platelet apoptosis than previously reported compounds with higher Bcl xL affinity.

The effect of compounds on platelet survival can be directly evaluated ex vivo by examining the viability of isolated canine platelets in the presence of various concentrations of compound. The data in Table 3 shows that compounds of Formula I have significantly less to no effect on the viability of isolated canine platelets ex vivo higher ECvalues compared to compounds previously disclosed in PCT US 2004 36770 and PCT US 2004 367911 as exemplified by ABT 737. Furthermore the functional selectivity ratio canine platelet EC FL5.12 Bcl 2 EC for compounds of Formula I ranges from 32 to 4849 which is significantly higher than that for compounds previously disclosed in PCT US 2004 36770 and PCT US 2004 367911 as exemplified by ABT 737.

Because compounds having Formula I bind to anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein with comparatively lower binding to anti apoptotic Bcl Xprotein the compounds would have utility as medicaments for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune and immune diseases with reduction of the side effect of thrombocytopenia i.e. they would be circulating platelet sparing . Involvement of Bcl Xin thrombocytopenia is disclosed in Mar. 23 2007 128 1173 1176. As described herein and elsewhere a potent inhibitor of Bcl X ABT 737 causes a dose dependent decrease in circulating platelets following injection into C57BL 6 mice or in canines . May 2007 14 5 943 51 . Compounds with reduced Bcl Xaffinity exhibit substantially less to no decrease in circulating platelets. Thus without being limited by theory compounds of this invention that have reduced affinity for Bcl X can be expected to show lower levels of platelet apoptosis than previously reported compounds with higher Bcl Xaffinity. The ECdata in TABLE 2 show the effects of administration of compounds of this invention compared to ABT 737 on canine platelets.
