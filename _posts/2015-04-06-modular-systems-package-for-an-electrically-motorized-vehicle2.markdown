Many vehicles either individually or those within a common fleet may employ the electrically motorized wheel. As the vehicles are moving around various locations the electrically motorized wheel may be utilized to sample the environment. The data collected can thus be utilized to provide a spatial and temporal indication of various parameters that are sampled.

In one example current temperature data is sampled over the area covered by the vehicles at the location of each of the vehicles. As the vehicles move from location to location a collection of such data is a representation at different locations over time. This may be expanded to numerous parameters sampled by numerous vehicles over time to monitor multi dimensional phenomena to facilitate the generation of models that contain multivariate data and other scientific uses such as for predicting future environmental conditions.

In another example data may be collected and processed to profile the user. That is as the vehicles move from location to location a collection of data is generated to indicate how specific users operate the vehicle. Such data may facilitate generation of a feedback loop that may be utilized to improve infrastructure development e.g. traffic lights and municipal networks . The data may also be utilized to indicate to the user for example more efficient operations of the vehicle e.g. recommended mode utilization.

The data may also be utilized to interact with a transportation to alert other vehicles such as smart cars to the presence of the vehicle with the electrically motorized wheel as well as alert the user of the electrically motorized wheel to the presence of the other vehicles.

The electrically motorized wheel may additionally support a plurality of sensors that collect and process attributes related to the vehicle and the electrically motorized wheel itself such as torque applied velocity steadiness of the vehicle acceleration of the vehicle usage of vehicle including time distance and terrain traveled motorized assistance provided available battery power motor temperature etc.

The electrically motorized wheel may also include a data collection platform for integrating and analyzing the data collected by the plurality of sensors. In embodiments the collected data may be integrated with data from a plurality of other electrically motorized wheels as well as data from 3party sources such as traffic data systems geographical information systems GIS databases traffic cameras road sensors air quality monitoring systems emergency response systems mapping systems aerial mapping data satellite systems weather systems and many others.

This combined data may then be integrated and analyzed onboard the electrically motorized wheel off board the electrically motorized wheel or a combination thereof. Such combined data leverages the sensor data collected by the plurality of vehicles traversing a relatively large geographic area and correlates the terrain traversed to time. This readily facilitates determination of a variety of insights as the plurality of electrically motorized wheels essentially operate as distributed sensor network to provide sensor data for aggregation and interpretation. For example the plurality of wheels or a specific subset thereof may be viewed in the aggregate to determine the best bicycling routes through a city to promote the collective health of users such as by routing away from areas with low air quality and the like.

In embodiments the telecommunications system and the global positional system may transmit data and or communicate with infrastructure other vehicles or non infrastructure entities in the surrounding environment. This data transfer or communication can alert the vehicles of a potential collision cause traffic lights to switch etc.

The data collected from the plurality of electrically motorized wheels and viewed in the aggregate to may facilitate the generation of detailed analyses and maps . The maps may be utilized to depict for example environmental phenomena that vary over space and time. This data can be overlaid on existing street patterns land use maps topographical maps population density maps and open space maps creating layered maps which may be accessed through mobile devices or a webpage and which provide an overview of environmental conditions in real time as well as historical data detailing past conditions or predictions of future conditions.

These layered maps may be used as a tool with which cities businesses and or individuals may for example monitor environmental conditions facilitate determination of future environmental and traffic policy decisions such as the planning of new roads and paths planning of commercial real estate development positioning of new cell towers and network repeaters real time traffic analysis the study of phenomena like urban heat islands emergency preparedness noise and environmental pollution and when planning the least polluted routes through cities.

For example data collected relative to wind speed and direction may be used to understand airflow through a city and used to map the impact of a dirty bomb and how it might disperse through a city. Data collected relative to signal strength and traffic patterns may be utilized to facilitate wireless companies in decisions regarding the placement of new cell towers. Temperature data collected over time may lead to the creation of urban gardens to ameliorate urban heat islands. Data related to global position and elevation may be used to provide ground truth for existing maps. Data related to traffic patterns may be used in planning of new commercial locations and store layouts. For example bar graphs may be overlaid onto a street map to indicate high traffic areas slow commute areas high pollutant conditions etc.

Aggregated data may also be used to facilitate improved real time navigation adjust real time traffic patterns divert bicycle traffic to other areas of the city etc.

In embodiments a multi user game system permits users of vehicles having one or more electrically motorized wheels to exchange data such as location distance torque applied effort expended distance traveled total change in elevation calories burned heart rate elevation environmental data collected and others.

In one example a remote racing game may leverage the control systems of the individual electrically motorized wheels and the local environmental data to modify the electrically motorized wheel behavior in conjunction with the local terrain in such a way that players in different locations experienced a common effort of attempting to bicycle up a hill while riding across terrain that varied among players based on location. In embodiments the ability to modify the electrically motorized wheel behaviors might be used to handicap users of difference skill levels.

Embodiments may include achievements which may be unlocked after users surpass certain thresholds. For instance a user could get a medal after riding 1000 miles. Achievements may include other distance thresholds calorie thresholds number of trips number of cities number of friends power generated and others.

Embodiments may include a system for targeting commercial opportunities to users wherein the offer is partially based on the location of the electrically motorized wheel . Embodiments may include a variant on geo caching where the users visit specified geographic locations. The data collection system would be collecting data location and time and users would be able to compare locations visited and when.

In embodiments profiling a user of the electrically motorized wheel may include assessing a user s current physical capabilities and monitoring the user s physical capabilities over time to facilitate identification of trends. Data collected may include torque applied distance traversed over time stability of electrically motorized wheel and others. It should be understood that various sensors including heart rate sensors may be utilized to profile a user operating the electrically motorized wheel.

Analysis may be performed to sense changes in mobility patterns such as frequency force applied distance traveled steadiness times of day system accessed and others. Small changes in these measurements may be used to sense long term slowly developing diseases such as Parkinson s syndrome which are typically difficult to sense because the change in user capabilities is gradual over an extended period of time. This data may be provided directly from this system into an electronic medical record EMR or associated with an individual s healthcare data. The data may be aggregated with data from a plurality of other electrically motorized wheels to provide data sets for public health analysis.

An example data gathered from the electrically motorized wheel that facilitates physical therapy is the direct power the person s legs can output as compared to conventional sensors which may only measure steps taken and heart rate. The data gathered from the electrically motorized wheel may thereby be utilized to detect how the person s leg muscles are changing over time because torque is directly detected through the torque sensor.

In embodiments techniques such as collaborative filtering may be used to sort through different options then suggest to one user options used by other users that are determined to be most similar to that user. Statistical techniques for sensing similarity may be performed based on correlations e.g. based on matrices of the distances between users with respect to various defined attributes that can be measured or derived based on the data collected by electrically motorized wheel or entered by the user. Thus users who are similar to each other may be presented with similar applications user interfaces drive modes navigation options and others. For example two users who regularly ride similar routes may be utilized to identify that one route is substantially faster given similar exertion less hilly fewer stops intersections etc. Such route comparison may be utilized to suggest a different route to the user of the slower route

In an embodiment data may be collected from a fleet of vehicles such as delivery vehicles messenger services and others. Data collected may be analyzed and synthesized to facilitate a dispatcher in optimizing routes schedules estimating deliver times and others based on user fitness levels terrain covered during current excursion including mileage elevation change level of assistance already provided remaining battery life current location and terrain along proposed routes and others.

Data aggregated from public or private fleets may be analyzed to determine when bicycles need to be taken in for service where bike racks should be located where charging stations should be located how many bicycles are in service at any given time and other useful scenarios.

In embodiments the electrically motorized wheel may be installed on store shopping carts. The electrically motorized wheel may assistance shopper shoppers needing additional assistance for specialized large heavier carts such as those adapted for shopping with children as the cart increases in weight and others. The data collected may include aisles traversed time spent in which aisles where along the aisle vehicle stop and other such data. This data may be used to map the traffic flow through a store to facilitate planning for product placement improved store layout and others.

In embodiments the hardware API may facilitate hardware plug ins to further modify the performance of the vehicle on which the electrically motorized wheel is mounted. That is the hardware plug ins may include options upgrades or other selectable accessory devices that each particular user may select and readily install i.e. plug in to their electrically motorized wheel .

In embodiments the hardware plug in may be a gyroscopic sensor that plugs into an electrically motorized wheel on a bicycle to facilitate the performance of wheelies or other tricks. The gyroscopic sensor may be used to determine the orientation of electrically motorized wheeled vehicle. Several gyroscopic sensors may be used to determine the orientation of the vehicle in several dimensions. If these are monitored over a period of time the stability of the vehicle may be determined.

Data from the hardware interface may be processed by the mobile device and or transmitted via the mobile device to a server for processing. Data from the hardware interface may alternatively or additionally communicate directly from the electrically motorized wheel to a server using long range wireless or telecommunications system such as 2G 3G and 4G networks. Further the processed data may be communicated back to the electrically motorized wheeled vehicle to form a feedback loop to facilitate operation of the electrically motorized wheeled vehicle each vehicle within a fleet and or other electrically motorized wheeled vehicles that may benefit from the collected data.

The accessory port may support one or more sensors that are operable to measure environmental attributes such as temperature humidity wind speed and direction barometric pressure elevation air quality the presence of chemicals such as carbon dioxide nitrogen ozone sulfur and others radiation levels noise levels GPS signal strength wireless network signal levels and others. The data collected by the sensors may be stored locally on the electrically motorized wheel or transmitted wirelessly to a remote system such as a network computer. Data stored locally on the electrically motorized wheel may later be transmitted wirelessly or otherwise transferred from the electrically motorized wheel to one or more application data servers . The data collected by the sensors may be stored in conjunction with additional contextual data such as the date and time data was collected the GPS location associated with particular data other data collected at the same time date location and others.

In embodiments the electrically motorized wheel may be equipped with a system to alert users of objects in close proximity thus enhancing user safety. In embodiments the system may utilize the accessory port to support a proximity sensor such as an optical sensor an electromagnetic proximity sensing detector or the like. The proximity sensors facilitate detection of objects that approach the vehicle on which the electrically motorized wheel is mounted such as from behind or from the side then display data or warnings on the mobile device .

The proximity of an object which is detected by the proximity sensor may be used to trigger automated actions as well including decreasing speed electronic braking increasing speed or triggering actions to connected peripheral devices such as headlights blinkers hazard lights personal electronic devices bells alarms protective equipment and others.

Proximity sensors may be mounted within the motorized wheel hub adjacent to a window that allows an optical beam an electromagnetic beam or such transmission to pass through a static portion of the hub shell assembly . Alternatively RADAR SONAR or other beams may pass directly through the hub shell assembly .

The proximity sensors may communicate with the mobile device to provide an alert to the user when an object is detected within a certain threshold distance. This alert may be conveyed using one or more of audible visible and tactile methods. This alert may be incorporated into the electrically motorized wheel such as by shaking the vehicle or communicated to another device mounted elsewhere on the vehicle such as the mobile device a GPS unit a smart mobile device tablet or the like. The proximity data may be transmitted using short range wireless technologies such as wireless USB BlueTooth IEEE 802.11 and others.

With reference to another disclosed embodiment of an electrically motorized wheel is illustrated herein as a wheelchair retrofitted with at least two electrically motorized wheels that are daisy chained one to another. Although this embodiment has specific illustrated components in a wheelchair embodiment the embodiments of this disclosure are not limited to those particular combinations and it is possible to use some of the components or features from any of the embodiments in combination with features or components from any of the other embodiments.

The electrically motorized wheel includes a multiple of motorized wheel hubs comparable to those described above but these electrically motorized wheels are daisy changed together. Daisy chained as described herein indicates operation of the plurality of electrically motorized wheel in concert serial parallel or other coordination. That is the multiple of motorized wheel hubs may communicate one to another in a daisy chain or other distributed interparty communication and or may be individually controlled directly but with regard to others.

A plurality of electrically motorized wheels may be daisy changed together via a daisy chain protocol operable on the control system . The daisy chain protocol may be software resident on the control system or may be effectuated via a hardware device that plugs into each of the plurality of electrically motorized wheels to coordinate operation of the plurality of electrically motorized wheels and thereby facilitate operation of the vehicle. For example should a user input be communicated to one electrically motorized wheel the other electrically motorized wheel daisy chained thereto may rotate in an opposite direction to perform a pivot in place of the vehicle to which the daisy chained wheels are installed. It should be understood that although a wheelchair is illustrated various other vehicles may utilize daisy chained electrically motorized wheels.

For example power can be shared between daisy chained wheels through a wired interconnection. Adjustments may be performed locally on each wheel but may be compensated appropriately and smoothly in another daisy chained wheel. Alternatively adjustments could also be made in parallel.

For example wheels may be daisy chained by different firmware and a cable that ties all the CAN interfaces together. The firmware could have one of the wheels be a central controller communicating with all the other wheels. Alternatively control could be distributed each wheel determining its own command but in part based on the commands of the other wheels. It is also possible to add an external controller that performs coordination of the wheel command. For example a plug may be connected to an accessory port in each of the wheels to be daisy chained.

Power may flow either in or out of the power port. The direction of flow is based upon what is connected e.g. a charger will push current in and a load will draw current out. The battery management system controls when the power port is open. For example the power port opens when it detects a charge or when directed by the main wheel electronics which thereby permits an external device to be powered. For example a rider may connect an external device that needs power and use an app to command the power port to turn on.

With reference to one or more forces are applied f to electrically motorized wheeled vehicle that pass through the rigid body to a axles upon which the electrically motorized wheels are mounted. The forces provided to the vehicle f should be absorbed into the translational motion of the vehicle and the rotational motion of the electrically motorized wheel .

For force analyses purposes the electrically motorized wheelchair is assumed to be a rigid body. The force of earth f presents an equal and opposite reactionary force where the tire meets the ground. This reactionary force is exerted onto electrically motorized wheel tangentially at a distance R equal to the radius of the electrically motorized wheel from the axle causing a rotational applied torque T on electrically motorized wheel in a forward rotational direction equal to T fR. There is a frictional force f exerted between the axle and bearings that resists motion. This represents the frictional force for all wheels on the vehicle. The frictional force f at the bearings causes a frictional torque of t fr resisting rotation. This torque t can be replaced by an equivalent torque of a force F applied at a radius R. Therefore F f r R . Electrically motorized wheels rotate when the force provided by the user fexceeds the frictional gravitational incline forces and aerodynamic forces which are often negligible at wheel chair speeds.

The rolling force Fresisting rotation of the tire is small and may be ignored for these calculations as are other small forces .

The excess force over and above those described above is expressed in acceleration of the vehicle a. The force causing acceleration of the vehicle is described by the mass of the vehicle multiplied by the acceleration of the vehicle.

Therefore the total force applied to the vehicle fa is used to overcome the force of friction F the force required to rolling of the tires F the force to move up an incline Fand the force for acceleration F. tan 

When the applied force f exceeds the force of friction F the force of tire rotation F the force due to moving up an incline F it causes acceleration of the electrically motorized wheel in a forward direction. Therefore by knowing the force of friction fdue to electrically motorized wheel bearings the radius r of the bearings the radius R of electrically motorized wheel the mass m of the vehicle and sensing the angle of incline q and the acceleration a one may approximate the user input force f. This may then be used as an input to determine electric power to be provided to the electric motor in embodiments. Therefore sensors are required to measure acceleration and incline of the vehicle. An estimate is required for the frictional force and possibly the tire rolling force to be more exact . Weight and therefore mass could be an initial given parameter or it can be a measured parameter.

The electrically motorized wheel is accelerated when the user force fis applied to the axle . This force is applied to the ends of the axle as the electrically motorized wheel is mounted between the ends of the axles. If the axle is accelerated in a forward direction the translational inertia of electrically motorized wheel causes electrically motorized wheel to resist a change in velocity causing a force on the axle between the ends opposite the direction of acceleration. This may cause a slight flexing bending or displacement of the axle proportional to the force being exerted upon the axle . Pressure may be measured between the axle and the electrically motorized wheel as an input. A forward acceleration on the ends of the axle causes electrically motorized wheel to exert a rearward force of the middle of the axle causing it to flex or bend slightly to cause the spacing between the axle and electrically motorized wheel structures to change. Sensing these changes will assistance the motorized wheel hub in sensing that a user intends to move electrically motorized wheelchair forward. This may be used in embodiments for sensing input force applied to the vehicle f. Similarly stopping the electrically motorized wheelchair moving at a given speed causes the opposite forces on the axle indicating that the user intends to slow or stop electrically motorized wheelchair .

The friction of the bearings f of a rotating wheel cause torsion of the axle . This torsion may be measured and used to signal that the user is trying to accelerate forward. A reduction in this torque or an opposite torque sensed at the axle would cause the indication that a moving wheelchair should be slowed or stopped. If the force on electrically motorized wheelchair is sensed to be in a reverse direction and electrically motorized wheelchair is moving in a reverse direction determined by sensors then the motorized wheel hub determines that the user intends to accelerate in the reverse direction. Therefore the force applied to the vehicle may be determined.

By monitoring various motion and acceleration parameters and the forces torque applied outside forces applied to the vehicle both positive and negative may be estimated. The estimated outside forces are then used to power the electric motor in a direction in which the vehicle is moving or in a direction opposite the direction the vehicle is moving causing a braking effect or acceleration in a reverse direction.

In embodiments the user may also operate the electrically motorized wheelchair by rotating the electrically motorized wheels. A ring handle is attached to the motorized wheel hub . Typically a user rotates ring handle to cause electrically motorized wheelchair to move in one direction or rotates the ring handle of each wheel in an opposite direction to cause the electrically motorized wheelchair to pivot. It should be understood that in this vehicle embodiment the ring handle is the user input and in contrast to a bicycle embodiment is typically rotationally fixed rather than mounted via a freewheel typical of a bicycle. That is the ring handle is the mechanical drive system for the electrically motorized wheel .

In embodiments the torque sensors are attached between the electrically motorized wheel and the ring handle to measure the user input such as a rotation torque or other input. Since the ring handle does not freewheel the user input may be related to an applied torque. For example a rim torque transceiver transmits the sensed torque to the motorized wheel hub . The motorized wheel hub then determines which direction the user is attempting to move and assist in that direction. If the torque sensors sense that the user is attempting to slow using the ring handle the motorized wheel hub determines that a braking force is necessary.

By causing power to be provided urging the electrically motorized wheel to drive in a direction opposite that of the direction currently moving a braking effect is effectuated. Various other types of vehicles may provide power in a manner similar to a wheelchair such as various types of push carts used in medical food service moving warehouse and similar applications various riding toys and other applications where wheeled devices or vehicles are pushed or pulled by human power.

With reference to an example wheelbarrow is retrofitted with an electrically motorized wheel . Although this embodiment has specific illustrated components in for a wheelbarrow the embodiments of this disclosure are not limited to those particular combinations and it is possible to use some of the components or features from any of the embodiments in combination with features or components from any of the other embodiments.

The electrically motorized wheel includes a multiple of motorized wheel hubs comparable to those described above but that are daisy changed together. That is the plurality of electrically motorized wheels operate in concert. The motorized wheel hub rotates around an axle that is fixed relative to a handle .

The electrically motorized wheelbarrow may have comparable functionality to that described above with the exception that the attitude may be determined differently as the electrically motorized wheelbarrow is typically designed to be tilted when in operation and level when not being used. Therefore additional sensors may be used to determine the tilt relative to the ground and the inclination of the ground relative to a vertical line representing direction of gravity . This can be done by measuring the distance from the front of the hub to the ground and the back of the hub to the ground and sensing a difference in distance between these. The vertical line may be determined by various known means such as using gravity. Together these can be used to determine the incline angle of a hill up which electrically motorized wheelbarrow is travelling.

In embodiments an axle transceiver is utilized to transmit data from the handle via axle force sensors in communication with the control system . The handle may alternatively include handle sensors adjacent to the handles to facilitate differentiating whether differential forces between the axle and wheel hubs is the result of force applied to one or both handles or for example a change in terrain elevation. Data sensed by handle sensors may be transmitted via a handle transceiver to the control system which may then determine which direction the user is trying to move and assistance in that direction.

For example were the electrically motorized wheelbarrow be moving while the input from the axle force sensors and the handle sensors are interpreted to be an attempt to slow the electrically motorized wheelbarrow the control system may determine that a braking force is required. Power is then provided to the motorized wheel hub urging the motorized wheel hub to drive in a direction opposite the direction of movement to cause a braking effect. This braking effect will facilitate stopping of the electrically motorized wheelbarrow .

With reference to in embodiments a wagon has installed thereon one or more electrically motorized wheels with a motorized wheel hub comparable to those described above. Although this embodiment has specific illustrated components in a wagon embodiment the embodiments of this disclosure are not limited to those particular combinations and it is possible to use some of the components or features from any of the embodiments in combination with features or components from any of the other embodiments.

A user pulls a handle of the wagon which transmits the pulling force to an undercarriage of the wagon to which the electrically motorized wheels are mounted.

Again the wagon is assumed to be a rigid body such that the pulling force applied to the handle is also applied through the wagon and to axles . Each axle and electrically motorized wheel mounted thereto interact in a manner comparable to that of the electrically motorized wheelbarrow . As indicated the determination of the force being applied on the wagon is based upon one or more inputs provided to the control system of the motorized hub.

In embodiments a handle sensor that measures magnitude applied direction and applied force at the juncture of the handle and the undercarriage . A transceiver coupled to the handle sensor transmits the force data to a control system of the electrically motorized wheel . Based on the received data the control system operates to assist for example application of a positive force in the directions of motion a braking force applied opposite the direction of motion and relative motion such as to facilitate turning.

Even though the electrically motorized wheel has been described in connection with retrofitting a wagon other vehicles such as a trailer or other wheeled vehicle that are pulled may be retrofitted in a comparable manner.

With reference to embodiments of an electrically motorized wheel generally includes a static system a rotating system a battery system an electric motor a mechanical drive system a sensor system a control system a hub shell assembly a multiple of spokes a rim a tire a shaft and a free hub torque assembly . It should be understood that although particular systems and components are separately defined each or any may be otherwise combined or separated via hardware and or software except where context indicates otherwise. Further although this embodiment has specific illustrated components in a bicycle embodiment the embodiments of this disclosure are not limited to those particular combinations and it is possible to use some of the components or features from any of the embodiments in combination with features or components from any of the other embodiments.

The static system and the rotating system are arranged around an axis of rotation A of the electrically motorized wheel and the static system is coupled to the non motorized wheeled vehicle via a torque arm assembly or via torque transmitting features designed into the axle such that the rotating system is rotatable relate to the static system . The electric motor is selectively operable to rotate the rotating system relative to the static system to drive the spokes the rim and tire thereof.

The mechanical drive system is coupled to the rotational system to rotate the rotational system in response to an input applied by the user such as a pedaling input ring handle of a wheelchair pushing of a handle pulling of a handle etc. In a bicycle embodiment the mechanical drive system may include a multiple of sprockets for a multi speed wheel A often referred to as a cassette or a single sprocket for a single speed wheel B that receive a rotational input from a pedaling input via a chain or belt.

The sensor system may be operable to identify parameters indicative of the rotational input such that the control system in communication with the sensor system is operable to continuously control the electric motor in response to the input such as that induced by a user pedaling. That is the control system is in communication with the sensor system to continuously control the electric motor even if the control momentarily results in no power being exerted by the electric motor . The battery system is electrically connected to the control system and the electric motor .

In embodiments the battery system the electric motor the mechanical drive system the sensor system and the control system are contained with the hub shell assembly . The hub shell assembly may thereby be a device readily installed into a non motorized wheeled vehicle through for example installation onto the spokes or rim of the electrically motorized wheel to provide an electrically motorized wheeled vehicle. Alternatively the hub shell assembly with the enclosed battery system electric motor mechanical drive system sensor system and control system may be preinstalled on the electrically motorized wheel to provide a self contained device inclusive of the spokes the rim and the tire such that an entire wheel of the vehicle is replaced by the electrically motorized wheel . That is all operable componentry is on the electrically motorized wheel itself and is installed as a self contained device that does not require further modification of the vehicle.

With reference to the hub shell assembly according to embodiments generally includes a drive side shell a non drive side ring a removable access door a user interface system and the torque arm assembly . The hub shell assembly is defined around the axis of rotation A defined by a shaft .

In embodiments the hub shell assembly contains a contoured battery assembly of the battery system that contains a multiple of battery packs defined as a ring around the axis A. The battery system in embodiments is rotationally stationary however the battery system may alternatively rotate within the hub shell assembly . It should be understood that various shaped battery packs e.g. linear arced circular cylindrical L T etc. may be combined or otherwise assembled to achieve a desired configuration such as an essentially scalloped shaped contoured battery assembly that is passable through a contoured inner periphery of the non drive side ring .

The drive side shell is a generally circular lens shaped shell chassis that supports the mechanical drive system . The mechanical drive system may include a free hub torque assembly and the free hub sensor system . The convex contour of the drive side shell may be defined to specifically accommodate the mechanical drive system . For example the multi speed hub A may be relatively flatter than the single speed hub B .

With continued reference to the non drive side ring typically includes a multiple of spoke interfaces such as arcuate grooves to receive the spokes . The non drive side ring is held in contact with the drive side shell via the tension of the spokes fasteners or a combination thereof. A contoured inner periphery of the non drive side ring matches an outer contoured periphery of the door such that the door is readily removed without despoking or delacing to access the contoured battery assembly that contains the multiple of batteries packs of the battery system .

In one example the contoured inner periphery may be scalloped and the contoured battery assembly may be formed of a multiple of circumferential segments to facilitate removal. An inner periphery of the removable access door may be circular to receive the user interface system . As will be further described the user interface system is mounted to the static system and may include for example a power port on off switch status lights etc.

With reference to a torque arm provides a substantially rigid mechanical connection between the stationary portion of the hub assembly and the frame of the vehicle on which the electrically motorized wheel is mounted thereby maintaining the stationary portion in a fixed position relative to the frame of the vehicle. As various bicycle frames have various rear drop outs where the axle fits the frame one challenge is how to transfer the torque to the frame as in a non motorized vehicle the frame of reference is the pedal and forward force is resisted.

The torque arm generally includes a ring portion an arm portion and a hinge portion that extends from the ring portion . An inner periphery of the ring portion and an increased diameter shaft section may be non circular e.g. oval or polygonal to rotationally key the torque arm to the shaft yet permit the torque arm to pivot relative thereto.

The hinge portions extend from the ring portion to interface with respective indentations in the user interface system . The hinge portion defines a pivot for the torque arm such that the arm portion may interface with a frame member and alternatively may be secured thereto via a clamp . It should be understood that various clamps and other interfaces may be utilized to secure the arm to the frame member as well as positional relationships that do not require a clamp such as that which locates the arm portion to rotationally ground the static system to the frame member .

The hinge portions further permit the design of other torque resisting interfaces other than the illustrated torque arm design that couples the non rotating parts to a bike frame. For example a manufacturing tester might have a complete differently shaped reaction torque mount that utilizes the same mating features.

A lock nut may include a non planar surface such as a concave conical arcuate or semi spherical surface to interface with a related convex conical arcuate or semi spherical surface to accommodate any angle of the torque arm with respect to the shaft to interface with the frame member .

The torque arm facilitates accommodation of different bicycle frames is rotatable when aligning the electrically motorized wheel to the bicycle frame during install then pivot outwards or inwards with respect to the electrically motorized wheel such that the torque arm remains directly under the frame member onto which the electrically motorized wheel is installed. This facilitates effective torque transfer and uncomplicated installation of the electrically motorized wheel. Further although this torque arm embodiment has specific illustrated components in a bicycle embodiment the embodiments of this disclosure are not limited to those particular combinations and it is possible to use some of the components or features from any of the embodiments in combination with features or components from any of the other embodiments.

With reference to the user interface system include a user interface that is located on the non drive side to support the torque arm yet remain clear of the mechanical drive system chain sprocket etc. that are located on the drive side. This permits an accessible user interface as well as an effective support for the torque arm with respect to the bicycle frame. In other embodiments the user interface may include a display screen.

The user interface may include a power port such as a Rosenberger connection under a removable cover an on off switch an arrangement of battery power status lights and a power indicator light . In one example the arrangement of battery power status lights is arcuate to at least partially surround the removable cover and the power indicator light may be located adjacent to the rotary on off switch . The battery power status lights and the power indicator light are visible through respective windows in a user interface cover plate . In this example the rotary on off switch is generally flush with the interface cover plate to facilitate for example minimal aerodynamic resistance. It should be understood that various ports hardware interfaces and other user interfaces may alternatively or additionally be provided.

With reference to the user interface system may be mounted to a battery mount plate that supports the battery system in rotationally static manner. That is the user interface system is a portion of the static system that is at least partially supported by the battery mount plate about which the rotating system rotates.

Normal operations of the electrically motorized wheel may result in the heating of various components including motor components various electrical components mechanical components and energy storage components. The generated heat may eventually affect performance of such components impose stress as a result of thermal expansion and contraction of materials affect the stability or working lifetime of components or the like. For example semiconductor components in processors can be sensitive to heat batteries can be rendered inoperable and motors can provide reduced output or be damaged when overheated.

With reference to passive thermal management is performed through the conduction of heat along a conductive thermal path to the shaft thence into and or through the hub shell assembly . Both the electric motor windings of the stator and the main control board of the control system are non moving in embodiments.

In embodiments the motor windings surround a hub of the stator while a heat generating electronic board such as the main control board is mounted directly thereto. The control system thus utilizes a web of the hub of the stator as a heat sink for the main control board . A thermally conductive yet electronically insulated pad may also be utilized between the board and the stator .

The stator is mounted to the shaft that is attached to the frame of the bicycle. Some of the heat from for example the control board and the motor windings thus ultimately flows through the stator to the shaft thence to the bicycle frame along the conductive thermal path . The bicycle frame thus operates as a heat sink of significant volume.

With reference to a drive side shell may include internal convection elements . The convection elements may be fins of various thermally radiative shapes that are located for example on the interior surface of the drive side shell to maximize airflow such as within and or along gaps through which air may inherently flow. The convection elements may be otherwise positioned to facilitate direction of airflow. That is the convection elements may guide free stream airflow as well as that airflow which is generated from the rotation of the rotating hub shell assembly

The drive side shell may also be manufactured of a lightweight material such as aluminum magnesium titanium and other alloys for heat transfer without air exchange. Some of the heat from for example the battery system the main control board and or the motor stator heats the air inside the spinning hub shell assembly components and the air transfers the heat to the full internal surface area of the spinning hub shell assembly components which in turn transfer the heat through conduction to the external surface and through convection to the ambient air around the exterior of these hub shell assembly components.

In other embodiments an active cooling system communicates air through or over the heat generating components to conduct heat therefrom. The air may be introduced through a passage illustrated schematically such as a vent valve and or pump may be actively controlled to open and close so as to initiate moderate and control the airflow.

In one example airflow may be selectively induced by opening the passages to the ambient environment to provide passive cooling. Alternatively one or more heat exchangers within the hub shell assembly may be utilized to actively cool the airflow. For example the vent valve and or pump may induce airflow in response to a sensor that identifies a temperature above a predetermined or calculated threshold. Such selective operation may be performed so as to minimize aerodynamic interference. That is drag is typically greater when the passage or air scoop is open than when closed. Alternatively the vent may be operated by centripetal force opening under the force of rotation and closing when the wheel is stopped. This would facilitate water resistance yet provide ventilation.

In another example the passage is generally the internal cavity of the hub shell assembly such that intakes which may be located in the rotationally fixed UI panel intake air which is then essentially flung radially outward through outlets in the shell .

In embodiments another fluid such as a gas vapor or liquid may be used. The fluid cooling system may include one or more pumps valves or the like as well as sealed fluid channels that pass the fluid over parts that benefit from conductive cooling. For example a fluid may be passed over or through one or more of the heat generating components. Alternatively the fluid may be passed over or through the hub shell assembly to provide a chilled environment for the components therein. The fluid system may be under control of the control system which may be responsive to inputs such as from a user or based on a temperature sensor.

With reference to a rotating system and a static system may form a gap of for example about 2 mm between a stationary motor winding and a magnetic ring rotor that is fixed to and rotates with the shell . When power is supplied to the motor winding a magnetic current is induced from the electrical wires wound on the stator causing the magnetic ring rotor and the shell to rotate. In embodiments the magnetic ring rotor is arranged between a battery housing and the motor windings both of which are stationary but are organized such that the magnetic ring rotor located therebetween rotates with the shell .

A gap may also be located between the shell and the contoured battery assembly as the shell rotates relative to the rotationally stationary contoured battery assembly . These gaps operate as a thermal insulator. To avoid this insulation effect and induce airflow for cooling the gap widths may be optimized for passive thermal cooling mechanical operation and combinations thereof. Convection elements of thermal radiative shapes may be positioned to maximize airflow direction such as within and or along gaps to facilitate passive thermal cooling.

With reference to active thermal management according to embodiments is performed through control of the electric motor to limit temperatures below a desired maximum. Such active thermal management may be performed through control of power usage within the power distribution system of the electrically motorized wheel .

In embodiments active thermal control algorithms generally include sensing temperatures of the electric motor the main control board and energy stage components electronic controllers battery or other heat sensitive components then attenuating operation of the electric motor the primary heat source to limit these sensed temperatures below a desired maximums by selectively attenuating an assistance resistance .

With reference to a data flow can be provided between the electrically motorized wheel the user and a server such as a cloud based server API or other remote server module or system. Various communication and data links may be provided between the electrically motorized wheel the user and the server such as a mobile device which serves as an interface therebetween for relatively long range cellular and satellite type communication. That is a smart phone of the user associated with the electrically motorized wheel operates as a data link between the electrically motorized wheel and the server . The electrically motorized wheel is operable to calculate the assistance and resistance required at any given time i.e. essentially instantaneously.

The control system utilizes an algorithm that applies data from a sensor system and if available the mobile device to determine an essentially instantaneous energy transfers between a battery system and an electric motor . The control system may also regulate and monitor the sensors and connected components for faults and hazards for communication to the mobile device .

With reference to the control system may include a multiple of printed circuit boards to distribute control facilitate maintenance and thermal management thereof. In this example the control system includes a main control board a User Interface board a Battery Management System BMS board a motor interface board and a sensor system here disclosed as a wheel torque sensor and a wheel speed sensor . It should be understood that the boards may be otherwise combined or distributed. It should also be understood that other sensors such as a GSM GPS inertial measurement sensors weight on wheel strain sensors chain strain sensors cassette speed sensors environmental sensors and other sensors may be provided and integrated into the one or more of the boards. Further various ports and hardware interface may additionally be provided to include but not be limited to a diagnostic connector a charger connector and or others.

The User Interface board in one example may include relatively short range wireless systems such as Bluetooth IEEE 802.11 etc. for communication with the user interface .

In one example the motor interface board hosts the motor relay the motor commutation hall sensors and the motor temperature sensor. The motor interface board collects those signals to one connector for connection to the main control board .

The Battery Management System BMS board may in one example be mounted to the contoured battery assembly . The motor relay board may be mounted to the stator such that the stator operates as a heat sink.

The control system may further include a hardware interface e.g. input ports data ports charging ports device slots and other interfaces that permit the plug in of other sensors hardware devices and or peripherals to provide communication with the main control board and associated boards. Alternatively or in addition each board may have one or more hardware interface such as a power port for the Battery Management System BMS board .

Additionally a charging port that similar to a USB connector provides not only power but also data transfer. This may be performed through for example a controller area network CAN bus interface integrated into the connection. Between the hardware interface and CAN bus interface implementation of additional sensors or external plugin hardware components is readily enabled e.g. extended battery lights humidity sensors proximity sensors speakers anti theft devices charging racks etc.

Data from the hardware interface may be communicated to the mobile device via short range wireless systems. The data may be processed by the mobile device and or further transmitted via the mobile device to a server for processing. Data may be communicated directly from the electrically motorized wheel to the server using relatively long range wireless communications systems such as cellular satellite etc.

Feedback to the user alterations to control parameters and or other data may be communicated to the electrically motorized wheel on the basis of the processed data. In one example distance sensor data e.g. RADAR SONAR LIDAR imagery etc. that provide for identification of an approaching object may feedback such identification to the user in the form of an audible visual or tactile sensation. For example a rear directed camera might communicate imagery to the mobile device so that a user may be readily apprised of traffic approaching from the rear. Alternatively identification of an approaching object by the rear directed camera may result in a tactile output from the electrically motorized wheel e.g. a shaking or jitter to gain the attention of the user.

In another example environmental data indicating high humidity levels altitude and or other environmental factors may be utilized to adjust the control parameters for a given mode such that additional motor assistance is provided under such conditions. For example as the vehicle traverses a mountain additional assistance may be provided at higher altitudes.

The mobile device may collect data at a rate of for example about 1 data point per second. Each data point may include time and location data stamps from for example a GPS module or the inertia navigation system. Applications to interface with the electrically motorized wheel may thus perform minimal calculations. Other peripheral devices such as a wearable health monitor may also be utilized with or as a replacement for the mobile device to provide data collection and or communication with the electrically motorized wheel.

The electrically motorized wheel may also communicate with a server via the mobile device . The server enables reception and or streaming of data collected by one or more electrically motorized wheels for communication and display essentially in real time from the mobile device to the electrically motorized wheel another electrically motorized wheel and or a fleet of electrically motorized wheels such as a delivery service shopping cart fleet of a store etc.

The collected data may include direction of travel faults associated with the fleet vehicle and other data. Aggregated data collected from a single electrically motorized wheel or multiple electrically motorized wheels may then be utilized to for example analyze routes and modes provide different analyses of the data customize a user experience and or generate suggestions for a more efficient commute.

In embodiments the hardware interface may be utilized to charge devices such as a mobile device . That is the mobile device such as a smart phone may be utilized as a user interface to the electrically motorized wheel as well as being charged therefrom.

With reference to a mobile device user interface for a mobile device may provide selection among various operational modes . The mobile device user interface may be a downloadable application or other software interface to provide for example selection among the operational modes data communication and or data transfer to and from the electrically motorized wheel. In alternative embodiments the operational mode may be selected for the user such as based on user inputs a user profile information about user history environmental factors information about a route inputs of third parties e.g. a doctor or trainer or many other factors disclosed throughout this disclosure. Selection of an operational mode may occur at the wheel on the user mobile device or remotely such as on a server or other external system.

In embodiments an algorithm that governs a control regime for a device of the wheel such as to control operation of the electrically motorized wheel or device thereof typically includes a set of parameters in which each parameter is a placeholder for a multiplier or gain in the algorithm . The selected mode provides values for the set of parameters one of which may optionally select which algorithm or control regime to use. These values may be input into the selected algorithm to provide an associated level of assistance or resistance the user will experience in response inputs such as from to the sensor data from the sensor system data from external systems e.g. information systems containing terrain information weather systems traffic systems and the like and further input from the user. It should be understood that each parameter multiplier and or term may correlate to some control relationship such as exponential a linear function a step function or a separate calculation that relates a control input to a specified level of motor control output.

The system may transition among various operational modes such as based on user selection or other determination of the appropriate operational mode. Alternatively in embodiments where the wheel itself does not automatically select an operational mode based on sensor or similar inputs if no mobile device or other selection facility is in present communication with the control system a standard mode may be automatically set as a default operational mode or the wheel may use the most recently used past mode if a mobile device or other selection facility was previously connected. Generally in bicycle embodiments the user need only ride the bicycle and the wheel sensor system will sense various input data such as torque slope speed etc. that is then communicated to the control system that employs the algorithm . The operational mode selected by the user via the mobile device or otherwise selected essentially provides values for the parameters in the algorithm . When the parameters having the appropriate values for the selected operational model are applied to the present set of inputs such as sensed by the sensor system or otherwise obtained such as by a data collection facility of the wheel the algorithm produces an output. The output determines the current control command for the wheel which in embodiments is essentially a specification of the nature and extent of the energy exchange between a battery system and an electric motor . The output of the electric motor is the level of assistance or resistance that the user experiences when operating the wheel which varies for a particular situation based on the selected mode.

For some operational modes the value for a single parameter may be supplied to the algorithm . This value may represent an overall gain for the assistance provided. For example a standard mode may provide an overall gain value of one 1 to the algorithm in contrast to a turbo mode that may result in an overall gain value greater than one 1 being supplied to the algorithm . Conversely a selection of an economy mode may result in an overall gain value less than one 

For some operational modes a plurality of parameter values may be supplied to the algorithm . These values may be associated with parameters representing multipliers or gains for different portions of the algorithm to control various components that contribute to the overall ride such as wheel data user input data such as torque or cadence environmental factors such as slope or wind resistance gestures or command motions such as sensed at the user inputs such as backpedaling to control braking etc. The parameters may alternatively or additionally represent multipliers for different sensor values and or calculated values representative of various components that contribute to the overall ride.

In embodiments the algorithm can have a general form that relates control inputs to outputs. The control inputs may fall generally into a set of categories such as inputs that relate to inputs from the rider or another individual either sensed e.g. as rider torque or entered data e.g. as a riders weight or age a training goal entered by a physical therapist for the rider a work constraint entered by a physician of a rider or the like inputs that relate to the operational state of the electrically motorized wheel e.g. wheel speed inputs that relate to the conditions of the environment or operational context of the wheel e.g. slope temperature wind etc. and inputs collected from various data sources e.g. other vehicles other wheels traffic networks infrastructure elements and many others . These inputs may be combined with other parameters such as gains or passed through other conditioning functions such as a filter. The output of these combinations of inputs may be the terms of the algorithm . These terms may be linear non linear discrete continuous time dependent or time invariant.

These terms may then be summed multiplied divided or otherwise combined such as taking the maximum or minimum of some or all of the terms to provide one or more outputs. In some embodiments it may be advantageous to provide a multitude of terms in the control system that isolate or separate conditions under which a user would receive assistance or resistance. For example it may be advantageous to be able to have a separate terms for the amount of effort that a rider puts in and for aerodynamic forces such as riding against the wind.

This beneficially allows each term to have a form that is suited to the input and underlying phenomenon. For example in the case of the rider effort it may be a linear or proportional response and in the case of aerodynamic forces it may be proportional to the square of the wheel or vehicle speed at lower speeds and a cube or other function at higher speeds. The rider or one specifying the response of the wheel to inputs such as a provider of wheels may thereby readily adjust the gains independently to customize the response of the control to the conditions that they care about e.g. hills wind power or the like.

Additionally multipliers on some or all of the terms allow the gains for each term to be scaled together in response to another input. For example increasing the overall responsiveness to rider inputs with environmental temperature could provide the rider with more assistance when operating in high temperatures and thus prevent a user from excessive exertion or perspiration.

In embodiments the algorithm uses a combination of terms or types of terms . For example a mechanical drive unit input torque and a wheel operational state such as wheel speed may be summed to construct a motor command with the sum including a term proportional to rider input torque and a term proportional to wheel speed. In other examples terms such as ones based on environmental inputs or data collected by the wheel may similarly be combined with any of the other input types noted in this disclosure.

In another example the algorithm use a summation of a series of input terms each multiplied by gains which may be adjusted as noted above based on the selected operational mode of the wheel to yield a command such as a current command for the motor.

In embodiments given the various inputs e.g. rider inputs such as mechanical drive unit input torque mechanical drive unit input speed and rider weight various wheel operational states such as wheel speed and angle of the device with respect to gravity data inputs such as safety information from a traffic system or other vehicle and environmental inputs such as ambient temperature a motor command equation may be constructed such as by creating terms proportional to various inputs. For example the equation may include a term proportional to rider input torque a term proportional to the square of wheel speed a term proportional to the angle of the device with respect to gravity a multiplier that is proportional to ambient temperature a multiplier that is zero when input speed in zero and increases as input speed approaches wheel speed and a multiplier that is proportional to the rider s weight optionally normalized to a base weight . The terms may then be summed and where applicable the sum may be multiplied by a multiplier.

In an embodiment the gains may be independent and variable over time. This allows the rider provider or other user to adjust the response to a desired preference. Additionally multipliers may allow some overall multiplication of the response to factors that in general may warrant an overall increase in assistance such as a hot ambient temperature.

Alternatively or in addition the algorithm can be constructed in a manner that allows switching between different forms such as among the examples given above. In this case one parameter of the equation may be an identifier for which form of equation to use i.e. which terms gain parameters and multipliers are to be used such as for a selected operational mode .

With reference to the user may select an operational mode from a multiple of operational modes that alters the behavior of the electrically motorized wheel. Each mode may include one or more parameter settings and or combinations thereof to change the operational behavior of the electrically motorized wheel. Example operational modes as will be further described may include a turbo mode for maximum assistance a flatten city mode fitness challenge mode a maximum power storage mode a standard mode a exercise mode a rehabilitation mode a training mode a commuter mode a maximum help mode etc. The flatten city mode may provide motor assistance on ascents and hill climbs with braking on descents to thereby flatten the terrain. The commuter mode may allow a user to enter a not to be exceeded torque or exertion level to modulate the assistance. The exercise mode may allow a user to enter a total number of Calories to be burned a desired rate of Calorie burn a maximum level of exertion or torque etc. Each mode may also include adjustable parameters to automatically modulate the assistance provided over the duration of the ride by the electrically motorized wheel such as a minimum time that the assistance must be available maximum speed and or others.

The mobile device user interface may present the multiple of operational modes in an order that allows a user to browse different control parameters such as Eco Mode Maximum Assistance Mode Target Energy Mode Maximum Energy Storage etc. That is a user can essentially scroll through a multiple of operational modes.

Alternatively the mobile device user interface may provide an automatic mode that selects the desired mode automatically without user input. That is the automatic mode may be speed based to select between modes during a trip so that the vehicle obtains the shortest time. Alternately the automatic mode may be time based to select between modes during a trip so that the vehicle reaches a destination at a desired time. Such selections may be made based completely on sensor data determined by the electrically motorized wheel or alternatively or in addition with data from a server or from other data devices that a user may be using such as a health monitoring device such as a heart rate monitor.

The flatten city mode provides assistance or resistance on non level terrain. Adjustable parameters may include data about the level of assistance minimum incline of the hill before rendering assistance and others. That is the amount of assistance while travelling uphill and the amount of resistance while traveling downhill may be controlled to require user input about equivalent to a user input required on a level surface.

The maximum speed control mode introduces braking on hills to limit the maximum speed of the vehicle. Such a maximum speed control may also determine the maximum permitted speed to particular legal jurisdictions as determined by a global Positioning Unit.

The maximum energy storage mode maximizes the power storage achieved. Such maximum energy storage mode may also be related to energy conservation or energy recovery.

The fitness challenge mode might include applying resistance to the electrically motorized wheel to require additional effort by the user and thus provide a work out to the user.

The fitness challenge mode may provide parameter assistance and resistance to for example simulate intermittent uphill climbs an uphill climb of a desired duration height or other parameter. Such parameter assistance and resistance may be associated with a user s performance or preset conditions work outs heart rate etc. The fitness challenge mode may also provide visual audible encouragement to user via a mobile device. The encouragement may indicate up coming challenges and an expected output by the user and may be presented on the mobile device user interface .

Adjustable parameters for each mode may include data about the desired destination a maximum desired exertion for the user the maximum desired speed current location and others. Data such as destination may be used together with data on current geospatial location possible routes to a destination and associated road modes traffic data user preferences user capability fitness level together with data related to wheel capacity such as energy storage data and others. The combination of data may be used to suggest possible routes manage power utilization over the selected or anticipated commute route estimate remaining battery life based on available energy user fitness level topography of proposed route etc.

With reference to the user interface may include relatively large buttons and or icons for navigation functions such as scrolling through the different modes as well as other actions which may be performed while the vehicle is in motion or idle during a trip e.g. at a stop light . The use of the large buttons facilitates visibility and selection while riding. The large button may occupy a significant portion of the available screen area so as to enable easy selection by a user for example the buttons on the mobile device may each occupy a minimum of 1 inch by 1 inch of display space.

Similar to creating custom sound settings with an equalizer the user can create custom assistance modes from within the mobile application or by logging into their account online. With reference to upon selection of an operational mode the mobile user interface may permit the input of parameters such as a maximum speed of the cassette an acceleration in response to pedaling slope behavior and or other inputs. In one example the inputs may be provided via a slider. Once the parameters have been entered the user mobile interface may transition to a progress screen that highlights progress to the goal such as the destination and specified calorie burn.

With reference to a trip may be represented as a line with one or more events there along. The mobile device or other application may calculate the trip . A directional arrow may also be provided for guidance along a calculated route to navigate without a map and without turn by turn directions. Instead the directional arrow points in the direction of the destination which may be advantageous as bicycles need not be necessarily restricted to motor roadways.

The route may be accompanied by other symbology such as for example distance notation to indicate how far to the next turn. Further the view may be presented to account for the vehicle direction of travel such that the current direction is for example straight up to facilitate orientation. Other symbology such as an elevation graph may be provided to indicate upcoming hills a time such as ETA and other such navigation and trip related data.

In embodiments the route may be enhanced for a particular user through a slight alternation in the route . For example various third party data sources such as demographic data of an area may be utilized to determine the route so as to avoid areas based on various parameters in response to a user selection.

The data from each trip may be communicated either directly to a server using a wireless or cellular technology or from the control system of the electrically motorized wheel to the connected mobile device thence to the server or stored on the mobile device to be communicated to the server at a later time according to a set of rules that may include for example battery charge on the mobile device signal strength the presence of a Wi Fi connection and others.

Alternatively aggregated data from a multiple of other electrically motorized wheels may be searched to select for example a more efficient faster or more scenic route. Data from the server may be associated with the specific electrically motorized wheel that generated the trip data then aggregated with trip data from other electrically motorized wheels. The aggregated data may then be subjected to statistical techniques for sensing similarity based on correlations e.g. based on common segments of the trip data destinations origins etc. The aggregated data may then be provided to the user to for example make recommendations for routes mode selection and other guidance that will benefit the user.

The electrically motorized wheel and the mobile device may be utilized to catalogue potholes road conditions and other obstacles from for example GPS data and accelerometer data along the route. The GPS data and or other sensors can be utilize to facilitate such cataloging in an automated manner. For example start stops uneven terrain and other obstacles can be directly indicated from the electrically motorized wheel via the speed sensor the torque sensor and the inertial sensors accelerometers and gyroscopes of the sensor system. The torque sensor also directly measures power output from the user for association and catalogue with the route location and conditions.

In embodiments obstacle detection may be catalogued in response to sudden changes in elevation or acceleration that are detected by the sensor system. That is the cataloging is essentially automatic. For example a sudden swerve detection that the user is standing on the pedal or other such indices may be utilized to catalog a pothole to a particular GPS position.

Alternately or in addition the mobile device may be utilized to accept user input such as pothole detection along a route. That is the cataloging is essentially manual. For example should the user identify a pothole the user may touch a button on the mobile device which is then catalogued via GPS. Other represented pages may include last trip record trip user settings support and others . It should be understood that the illustrated pages are merely representative and various other pages may be alternatively or additionally provided.

With reference to the control system of the electrically motorized wheel may include an application module that executes various functions to include for example operation of control algorithms that manage the operation of the electrically motorized wheel. A boot loader module is in communication with the application module to facilitate loading and updating thereof. It should be understood that various hardware software and combinations thereof may be used to implement the modules.

In embodiments upon start up of the control system the electrically motorized wheel verifies that the version of the application module currently installed on the control system is valid and current. It should be understood that start up may include connection by various user interfaces that communicate with the electrically motorized wheel as well as various security and other communications. If for example the application module is valid and up to date system initialization occurs. If the application module is not valid the control system may initiate the boot loader module to update the application module .

In embodiments when a mobile device connects with the control system the control system may upload firmware version numbers for the application module the boot loader module and other elements such as a Bluetooth BT radio and the battery management system. The mobile device may check with a source such as a server operating such an application program interface API of a cloud based server to determine whether the uploaded version number of the application module is the most recent version.

In embodiments non mobile devices such as a desktop computer may connect locally with the control system such as via a Bluetooth connection.

If a newer version is available the user may based on a rule set be prompted via the mobile device to update the electrically motorized wheel. That is updated firmware for updated operation of the electrically motorized wheel. If the user elects to update the electrically motorized wheel the mobile device may direct the control system to enter the boot loader module . The rule set for updates may permit updates only under certain defined conditions such as when there is a minimum battery life on the electrically motorized wheel a minimum battery life on the mobile device a minimum signal strength for the mobile device availability of direct power for electrically motorized wheel and mobile device and others.

Upon downloading the updated version of the application module the mobile device may command the boot loader module to download the new version of the application module and if download is successful to erase the current application module from the control system . Alternatively the new version of the application module may be downloaded and stored on the mobile device for later update of the of the electrically motorized wheel such as via a Bluetooth connection.

The new version of the application module may be sent from the mobile device to the boot loader module via a wireless connection. The boot loader module may confirm the transfer of the individual packets and the total transfer of the new application module onto the control system . If the boot loader module confirms that the new application module was loaded successfully the mobile device may initiate a restart of the electrically motorized wheel and control system . Alternatively the boot loader module may proceed with updates though a hard wired interface such as a CAN bus that is made externally available at the User Interface panel or power port.

With reference to the application module of the control system may utilize various control techniques including algorithms that govern manage and or change operational parameters of the electrically motorized wheel. That is the operational parameter of the electrically motorized wheel may be changed via the control system that for example change the parameter based on various factors such as the maximum speed of the vehicle on which the electrically motorized wheel is installed the conditions of the environment e.g. terrain weather and others input from the user including the force sensed from pedaling effort data input to the electrically motorized wheel etc. and parameters that are based on multiple factors referred to herein in some cases as blended parameters the energy used such as by the user by a battery associated with the electrically motorized wheel or the like and or other control systems that provide various other modes.

In embodiments levels of gain such as the level of assistance and or resistance provided by the electrically motorized wheel in relation to a given user input such as pedaling effort can be managed in connection with the electrically motorized wheel. In some embodiments a progression of gains may be utilized to smooth the transition from one operational regime to another regime e.g. a change in terrain from uphill to downhill conditions a change in speed of the vehicle on which the electrically motorized wheel is installed environmental conditions such as wind direction and temperature etc. Other embodiments may include a step wise change between an initial gain one or more new levels of gain. Normally a step wise change in operational mode of the electrically motorized wheel e.g. between differing levels of assistance or from assistance to resistance or a change in gains may result in a discontinuity in the response of the electrically motorized wheel to torque command. Such discontinuities may be smoothed by 

3. creating an offset that is at least a portion of the difference between the prior command and the new command 

4. subtracting the offset from the new command this results in a new command that has a value of or in the range of the old command to the new command and

5. reducing the offset over a period of time until it is zero at which point the transition to the new command is completed.

This smoothing process beneficially effectuates gain changes and control regime changes because it preserves a degree of continuity in the user experience. The process can handle repeated transitions as new offsets are generated with each change e.g. in regime and condition that results in a new command. This may include offsets from prior transitions and there may be a variety of ways to reduce the command to give the transition different characteristics e.g. a finite transition time a fixed rate of command change a maximum level of change etc. 

With reference to a blending algorithm for operation of the electrically motorized wheel may also be controlled by blending inputs relating to different factors that may be sensed in connection with the operation of the electrically motorized wheel. For example sensor inputs may be considered from both a speed sensor that senses the speed of rotation of the electrically motorized wheel or displacement of the vehicle and as a torque sensor that senses the amount of torque on the electrically motorized wheel.

The control parameters of relevance to the user experience can vary significantly depending on for example the speed of the vehicle. In consideration a bicycle pedaling example at low speeds responding to pedal torque may be relatively more important to ride quality as significant effort is required to initiate movement of the vehicle. At higher speeds maintenance of a consistent cadence or speed may be relatively more important to ride quality. As such the amount of assistance in response to each user input in this example torque and cadence may vary based on the speed of the vehicle. Thus data from the torque sensor may be used as a primary factor in a control regime at low speeds while the data from the speed sensor may be used as the primary factor in the control regime at higher speeds. As a result control may be managed by delivering high responsiveness to the torque sensor at low speeds and by using less responsiveness to the torque sensor at high speeds. Components related to the torque and the speed can be factored into the control algorithm that ultimately determines the quantity of energy or rate of energy delivery from the battery system to the electric motor.

The blending algorithm is thereby operable to provide a fluid control scheme that scales the importance of each sensor as a factor in the control scheme based on speed.

With reference to an energy burn control algorithm permits a user to input the amount of energy step the user would like to burn on a particular ride e.g. how many calories to burn between home and work . The energy burned by the user relates to the amount of work performed in order to move the vehicle from a first point to a second point. This work may be modeled based on various physical factors including the terrain friction the weight of the user such as measured by a sensor of the vehicle or entered by the user the weight of the bicycle including any accessories and additional loads e.g. camping equipment the distance traveled and others.

A portion of the work may be performed by the user such as by pedaling while the remainder may be provided by the electrically motorized wheel. The portion of energy expended by the user may be modeled as the difference between the total work required to move a user of a given weight over the terrain which may be known based on a GPS model of the terrain or based on measurements such as altimeter measurements from past trips and the amount of assistance provided to the user by the electrically motorized wheel. Thus as the user indicates an amount of energy desired to be burned the control system may control the electrically motorized wheel to provide assistance such as on hills of the route to make up any difference between the desired work and the actual work required to cover the distance. If the desired portion of the work performed by the user is higher the electrically motorized wheel may provide resistance to the user re route the user to a longer route etc. Thus the algorithm may utilizes the user input and data about the route terrain to adjust the assistance resistance of the electric motor so that the user burns the desired amount of calories over the course of the route. Once the goal has been identified the ride may be previewed and as the ride progresses the user interface may transition to a progress screen that highlights progress to the goal such as the destination and specified calorie burn.

With respect to the mobile application may utilize available GPS location data and a stored database of data to determine legal limits as regulations vary geographically with respect to various factors that govern operation of electrically driven or assisted vehicles. These may include regulations of assisted speeds level of assistance provided and or motor output. The mobile application or other control system may use this data to create a custom mode or set of control parameters that can be sent to electrically motorized wheel such as to govern maximum assistance speed or the like. The mobile device or other control system may recalculate control parameters when the legal limits change and send updated control parameters to the electrically motorized wheel.

In one example the EU may have a standard regulation of a top assisted speed of 25 km h and 250 W of motor assistance while the US may have a top assisted speed of 32 km h and 750 W of motor assistance. By using the GPS data available at any given location it is possible to regulate the assistance cutoff within the electrically motorized wheel to comply automatically with the local regulations without further intervention.

Further many of the laws only apply to bicycles when they are riding on roads with other motor vehicles and pedestrians. If the GPS indicates the bicycle to be sufficiently far away from the road the bicycle may be assumed to be on a trail in which case the local regulations may be different or nonexistent in which case limitations on the assistance provided may be removed. In embodiments a user may be permitted such as through the mobile application to override the controls such as to allow more assistance in an emergency situation.

In embodiments the mobile application may also utilize available GPS location data to facilitate control while in operational modes. For example extremely hilly terrain will result in different battery regeneration calculations than flat terrain.

With reference to a fault detection and prediction system referred to herein as a faultless algorithm is operable to sense conditions that have the potential to damage wheel hardware or subsystems as they occur in essentially real time step then respond by performing mitigating actions based on the detection of same step . For example if the electric motor approaches a predetermined maximum temperature beyond which damage may occur to the electric motor the amount of assistance or resistance generated by the electrically motorized wheel to the user of a vehicle on which the electrically motorized wheel is disposed can be reduced to prevent a further rise in temperature of the motor.

With reference to a battery protection algorithm may provide different and optionally independent command attenuators including but not limited to 

5. Protecting the battery from high temperatures due to high loads or heat from other components like the motor and or

Each of these command attenuators can utilize automatic controls such as a single sided closed loop proportional integral PI control system to generate an attenuated gain ranging from 1.0 no attenuation to 0.0 full attenuation . Alternatively command limiters may be utilized instead of the command attenuators. The command attenuators provide an immediate and linear smooth response as command limiters are inherently non linear in nature and can present control challenges but are nonetheless a valid controllers.

In embodiments the gain from relevant attenuators can be determined combined and applied to the motor command. The algorithm may be based on the minimum gain among all control systems the maximum gain among all control systems the sum of gains from all control systems and various other ways for combining the gains multiplying them conditionally selecting limiting the assistance provided by the motor to the user etc.

Under some conditions the electric motor may be driven by the battery system while under other conditions the battery system may store energy from the motor such as when the motor is used to slow the vehicle in downhill operation. In situations with significant energy generation capability the battery system may be subjected beyond its normal operational limits for temperature voltage and or current. As such there are limits that may need to be enforced for operation of the battery system. There are at least three general sets of battery limits i.e. current voltage and temperature. As to limits relating to current there may be maximum discharge current and maximum battery regeneration current. As to voltage limits there may be a maximum voltage limit and a minimum voltage limit. As to temperature there may be a maximum temperature limit and a minimum temperature limit.

The battery protection algorithm may operate to manage the motor drive operation such as to maintain battery parameters within acceptable operational values for voltage current and temperature. This may address the electric motor contribution to the load on the battery system. Other sources of load on the battery system may also be managed separately.

In embodiments single sided proportional integral PI closed loop limiters e.g. one for each limit may be deployed in connection with limiting various operational conditions such as battery motoring current battery regeneration current battery over voltage battery under voltage etc.

The output of each PI closed loop limiter may be an attenuation gain. Each PI closed loop limiter may have its own control system with its own separate gains as the dynamics of each limiter may require individual tuning.

The minimum gain of all the limiters may be taken and applied to the motor current control command. As a particular limit is approached the motor command may be attenuated such as to reduce the demand on the battery. The voltage limiters may selectively apply the attenuation gain. For the over voltage limiter the attenuation gain for over voltage may be applied only when commanding regeneration of the battery. This allows motoring to then alleviate or avoid the over voltage condition. For the under voltage limiter the attenuation gain may be applied only when commanding motoring assistance which allows regeneration to then alleviate or avoid the low voltage condition.

In embodiments battery power control systems may run at the motor control system frequency as the battery control systems may need to have similar or higher bandwidth to keep limit excursions short in duration. In other embodiments battery power control systems may run just prior to the motor control current loop and after motor drive analog data has been collected such that the battery control systems attenuate the command for the motor control current loop. This sequence may reduce delay in the control response that would occur if the data collection and attenuation occurred at different times.

The control system may be initialized each time the motor drive is enabled as the motor drive can be enabled and disabled during normal operation. The battery control systems may have data items such as integrators that can be reset with every instance of enablement of the motor drive.

The control system can provide dynamic limits because limits of the battery system may not be static over time and may vary for example with state of charge temperature etc. Dynamic control system limits may be bounded by predetermined maximum and minimum values as this provides some protection against potential errors in measuring time varying gains. Battery current and battery voltage may need to be sampled at the same data rate as other motor control feedback as these control systems are part of the motor drive control and because they run at motor control update rates the sensor data may need to have the same frequency of sampling as other motor control data.

The control system may be single sided closed loop PI limiters that attenuate the motor current control loop command as PI limiters beneficially provide steady state limiting with good bandwidth. An attenuator output as compared to a limit output may provide immediate intervention.

Over voltage attenuation gains may be only applied when the sign of the motor current command is negative e.g. the motor is being commanded to oppose forward momentum i.e. regenerate because this allows motoring to alleviate high voltage conditions. Under voltage attenuation gain may be applied only when the sign of the motor current command is positive e.g. the motor is being commanded to assistance in driving the vehicle because this allows regeneration to alleviate low voltage conditions.

The PI control systems may have enough control authority to attenuate the motor current control system command to zero because attenuating the command to zero is the maximum control authority possible and maintain the battery system within operational limits may have priority over providing assistance to the user.

Sensors used in hardware protection algorithms may include sensing of battery voltage battery current motor voltage motor current battery temperature ambient temperature or humidity etc. Limits may be set statically in accordance with component design specifications or updated over time to account for factors such as component age or environment of usage as determined by GPS or weather data.

Pedal cadence is useful for a user to maintain a desired pace over the course of a ride. Typically a cyclists may desire to pedal at a specific cadence to make the most efficient use of their effort and provide the most benefit from an exercise physiology standpoint.

In typical bicycle cadence sensors measurements are performed directly at the crank however such direct measurements are not possible nor desired if the sensor system is to be contained within the electrically motorized wheel that is separated from the pedals by a drivetrain. Although this embodiment has specific illustrated components in a bicycle embodiment the embodiments of this disclosure are not limited to those particular combinations and it is possible to use some of the components or features from any of the embodiments in combination with features or components from any of the other embodiments.

With reference to a pedal cadence estimation algorithm operates to estimate the pedal cadence from the torque input frequency which will have frequency content that is directly related to pedal cadence. Each time the user provides a rotational input i.e. pushes on the pedal the user is generating a torque into the system that is detectable. That is the pedal rotational frequency or cadence is detected by the torque sensor system and can be communicated to the control system for use by a gear estimation algorithm . The gear estimation algorithm is operable to calculate the gear ratio because the rotational velocity of the cassette is known from for example a cassette speed sensor and the pedal cadence is known by estimation. The gear ratio may be determined by a ratio of these two speeds.

In embodiments there are two speed sensors one for the electrically motorized wheel and one for the cassette of the mechanical drive system. With knowledge of a rotational velocity of the cassette and the torque frequency both pedal cadence pedal speed and the gear ratio are readily determined by the gear estimation algorithm . That is how the pedal frequency relates to the rotational velocity of the electrically motorized wheel is known even if the number of speeds on a particular bicycle or which gears are set on the rear cassette and the crank are not known.

For example the rotational velocity is known from the cassette speed sensor. The torque frequency t is related to cadence C C t 2. C is equal to the number of revolutions of the crank per second. Therefore CX or t 2 X where X is the gear ratio. Thus in simple forms X 2 t. Additional sophistication may exist in the estimator to update estimates under conditions where input signals may be small such as at low speed or low torques. This sophistication may include closed loop state estimation algorithms for example.

With reference to a braking dissipation algorithm accommodates an architecture in which the battery system may be relatively limited in the amount of energy that can be absorbed during braking in which energy can be directed to recharge the battery without damage occurring to the battery. In embodiments the motor control system of the electrically motorized wheel is field oriented and controls the magnetic flux generated in the stator as a vector that is precisely aligned with the rotor . This vector may be controlled to rotate through the stator in synchronization with the rotor of the motor by segregating the applied current vector into two orthogonal components. One component Iq the quadrature component is at a right angle to the back electromagnetic field back EMF vector generated by the motor. The other Id the direct component is directly aligned with the back EMF vector.

Maintaining the direct component which produces no torque in certain embodiments at zero Id 0 and the quadrature component at a commanded level Iq Icmd is how a field oriented control system normally ensures the most efficient use of battery power to produce motor torque. Allowing Id to stray from zero is less efficient and thus dissipates more energy in the motor which while normally inefficient in regimes in which the desire is to maximize efficiency of power generation to propel a vehicle creates an opportunity when other objectives are in play such as involving braking and or reducing current flow into the battery during regeneration to degrade efficiency of motor in transferring power to the battery.

The battery protection algorithm maintains regenerative charging currents within limits that will not damage the battery for example below about 5.5 A of regeneration in certain embodiments. Since the battery protection algorithm limits the quantity of power that can be delivered back into the battery the braking dissipation algorithm provides another place to send braking power in lieu of the battery without the addition of another dissipative load such as a traditional shunt resistor thus allowing or causing more braking than would otherwise be allowed. This is effectuated by reducing motor current used to control power as needed to maintain the regeneration current directed to the battery in check. Also the braking torque is reduced in some cases significantly at higher speeds.

This speed dependence is because at higher speeds the same amount of braking torque generates proportionally higher power levels. That is at the battery system since voltage is essentially constant higher regeneration power translates directly to higher current into the battery system. Since current is limited capacity for braking thus goes down as speed goes up.

The electric motor in embodiments may have windings with a relatively high resistance. One consequence of this is that during hard braking when the braking torque is high and thus the motor current is high the power dissipated in the electric motor is quite high so the motor absorbs significant braking energy. As the speed drops the braking power drops and the proportion of the braking power absorbed by the motor increases until it reaches the point where the motor is absorbing all of the braking power. At this point regeneration of power back into the battery system ceases and the available braking torque is at a maximum. This threshold can be reached fairly quickly when slowing down and can cause the braking experienced by the user to rise abruptly. This behavior is likely unexpected by the user and thus is potentially undesirable.

In embodiments the dynamic braking algorithm is activated by backpedaling so the user can use just one method of control i.e. pedaling forward is a control that signals acceleration assist while pedaling backwards is a control that signals braking in either case the user need utilize only a single user input that is typical of the vehicle i.e. pedaling in this example. The relative lack of desired braking at high speed and the abrupt increase in braking at lower speeds is addressed such that the user mode of control e.g. pedaling in this example is seamless. That is the braking that this technique provides at higher speeds also provides a partial solution to braking abruptness problem when slowing down by narrowing the difference in braking capability at high and low speeds.

In embodiments the motor control system is field oriented and controls the magnetic flux generated in the stator as a vector that is precisely aligned with the rotor for generating maximum torque. This vector is controlled to rotate through the stator in synchronization with the rotor of the motor by segregating the applied current vector into two orthogonal components. The quadrature component is thus at a right angle to the back EMF vector generated by the motor while the direct component is directly aligned with the back EMF vector such that each of these components has a control system therefor.

The quadrature component produces torque while the direct component produces no torque. Thus for maximum efficiency a control system is commanded to maintain the direct component at zero Id 0 while the quadrature component is controlled at the commanded current level Iq Icmd . If the control system were to allow the direct component to grow the overall motor current would increase but no additional torque would be produced and energy would be wasted in the resistance of the stator windings.

Embodiments for braking set Iq Id Icmd. This locates the current vector out of alignment with the back EMF vector by 45 degrees. As Icmd increases both Iq and Id would increase and vice versa. This has the benefit of allowing higher overall Iq values than when holding Id to zero because Id is dissipating at least some of the energy regenerated by Iq rather than it returning it all to the battery. If the motor current is to be attenuated to protect the battery motor or electronics both are attenuated equally. It should be understood however that ratios of Id to Iq other than one may alternatively be provided with different ratios affecting the level of regeneration relative to wasting of mechanical power and such ratios may be varied such as accounting for factors like vehicle speed the level of stored energy in the battery sensed state e.g. temperature of motor components and others.

In one example when the motor gets hot such as while braking during downhill travel in hot weather the motor may not have the capacity to accept the added power and the supplied braking may fade. Damage to the motor is avoided by having the control systems limit the motor current which is where the sensation of fading brakes originates. In embodiments this may prompt other actions such as activating supplemental braking systems prompting to the user via the mobile device to use manual braking etc.

In embodiments a directly connected electric motor is of the permanent magnet type such that the rotor rotates with the electrically motorized wheel. When the motor drive applies a voltage higher than the generated voltage of the electric motor the motor assists the user. The faster the electrically motorized wheel rotates the higher the voltage generated. If the speed is high enough to generate a voltage that is higher than an allowed voltage the electrically motorized wheel is in an over speed condition. The allowed voltage may be specified for safety hardware protection and or other reasons such as protection from high back EMF due to high wheel speeds. EMF is present however EMF may become a problem when wheel speed is high enough for it to exceed battery voltage.

An inherent function of the power bridge that drives the motor is full wave rectification of the back EMF voltage from the rotation of the electrically motorized wheel onto the DC bus. Thus it is possible for the user to pedal the bicycle to speeds that can generate this over speed condition especially downhill. In embodiments such as ones involving direct drive motors the voltage that can be generated is limited only by how fast the vehicle is moving and thus has the potential to damage embedded system electronics.

Electronic braking through regeneration can be used to facilitate automatic control of maximum vehicle speed. However the battery can only absorb so much energy before its voltage reaches its maximum limit such that a battery protection algorithm may automatically protect itself by disconnecting the battery from the DC bus if the voltage reaches a predetermined value. True power is related to current but at lower battery voltages the power limit will be lower P 1 V while the current limit is the same.

Further even when the battery state of charge is low enough to accept regeneration energy the rate at which the battery can accept the energy is bounded by its charging current limit. At higher speeds this charging current limit may severely reduce the braking capability of the electrically motorized wheel making it more likely for the user to overcome any automatic speed regulation the electrically motorized wheel may try to enforce especially on a steep downhill. To address this condition a warning may be provided to the user via the mobile device.

Reasonable speeds are allowed and mitigation of potential damage to the hardware may be provided such as by placement of a relay to isolate and protect the power electronics bridge and all other electronics connected to the DC bus from the high voltage generated by back EMF generated when the motor is mechanically driven to an over speed condition.

In embodiments diodes in the bridge operate as rectifiers if the back EMF voltage exceeds the DC bus voltage . As motor over speed increases back EMF potentially pushes the DC bus voltage to uncontrolled levels. To avoid such an over voltage condition relay contacts are opened based upon measured or estimated back EMF appearing at motor terminals approaching the DC bus voltage. In one embodiment Back Emf is estimated in accordance with 

SI units are used here with voltages measured line to line vs. line to neutral and 0 to peak of sine vs. RMS . So the units on Vemf are V on SpdMot are rad s and on Ke are V rad s .

That is the motor relay contacts are opened as the estimated back EMF of the motor based for example on the back EMF constant and the speed of the motor approaches the measured bus voltage which varies with battery state of charge.

With reference to an example thermal model schematic for the motor utilize capacitors to represent heat sinking characteristic of the various thermal generating components in the hub shell assembly. They are responsible for the fact that it takes some time for these components to heat up thus allowing the wheel to have higher performance until those thermal generating components are hot. The resistors represent the paths for heat to spread inside of then ultimately escape the hub shell assembly.

With reference to a thermal schematic for the electrically motorized wheel includes four major heat sources winding losses in the motor windings rotational losses in the motor stator steel losses in the power electronic bridge of the motor drive and losses in the battery pack. The heat sources are ultimately communicated to the shaft thence to the bicycle frame along mechanical conductive thermal paths. The bicycle frame thus ultimately operates as a heat sink of significant volume.

With reference to a torque sensing algorithm may be provided to measure different process parameters related to torque. The torque sensing algorithm may include non contact sensor technology that utilizes fundamental mechanical and magnetic properties of the material to measure different process parameters such as magnetoelastic materials. The process involves measuring changes in the properties of remnant magnetic fields as the mechanical characteristics change such as shear stress as external forces are applied onto the sensor host step .

The torque sensor may include highly sensitive fluxgate sensors located in close proximity to a magnetized member to sense the change in the magnetic field characteristics that are proportional to the applied force. The mechanical member may be directly magnetized instead of attaching additional elements such as a ring. The change in the magnetic field characteristics are linear and repeatable within the elastic limit of the material and are accurate under normal and extended operating conditions such that an applied force can be readily determined step .

For example when the shaft is subjected to a mechanical stress such as torque from pedaling the magnetic susceptibility of the magnetoelastic material changes and is detected by the surrounding sensor. The torque sensor produces a signal proportional to the torque applied by the user then communicated to the control system .

With reference to a vertical load sensing algorithm may be provided to measure different process parameters such as vertical load. The vertical load sensing algorithm may communicate with a magnetic field flux sensor measuring change in magnetic field step resulting from an initial mechanical stress applied such as for example when the user mounts the bicycle. The change in magnetic field may be generated by the shaft shell or other wheel component manufactured or including a magnetoelastic material that is deformed when a load is applied on electrically motorized wheel. The change in the magnetic field characteristics are linear and repeatable within the elastic limit of the material and are accurate under normal and extended operating conditions such that an applied force can be readily determined step .

The measured vertical load may be used as a modifier by the control algorithms. For example the measured vertical load may contribute to calculations controlling for calories burned due to a weight of the user identification of a user to unlock the electrically motorized wheel etc.

In embodiments various components of the shell such as the drive side shell the non drive side ring the removable access door and the like may include a magnetoelastic material. Alternately a thin coating of magnetoelastic material may be applied to a component. The coating may be applied overall or in a directional pattern and in various thicknesses. Magnetic flux sensors situated in close proximity to the magnetoelastic material enable the detection of changes in the magnetic flux created by the deformation of the component during operation. Insight into the deformation of a component such as the shell may be used to understand electrically motorized wheel environment and inform future design modifications.

With reference to a security algorithm may be provided for security of the electrically motorized wheel until authentication is performed in an exchange between a mobile device and the electrically motorized wheel. This may be automatic once an initial authentication is performed step . Initial authentication may be performed when first connecting to the electrically motorized wheel to collect the serial number step .

Once the electrically motorized wheel is registered to the account and mobile device step the electrically motorized wheel will search for registered mobile devices via a relatively short range wireless connection for example Bluetooth BT step . The electrically motorized wheel may store previously authenticated mobile devices and reconnect to them automatically when within a predetermined proximity step . Alternatively another key such as a wireless car key or other key is utilized to unlock the electrically motorized wheel step .

Alternatively or in addition a dongle plugs into the electrically motorized wheel to unlock the electrically motorized wheel step .

When locked the main control board can configure motor controller to resist or prevent rotation of the electrically motorized wheel. Alternatively the lock function could prevent the use of the electrically motorized wheel to provide assist while letting the wheel spin freely. In one example identification of the authenticated mobile device being within a predetermined proximity is sufficient to unlock the electrically motorized wheel. Alternatively or in addition a security input step to the mobile device or directly to the electrically motorized wheel such as entry of a code entry of a password facial recognition fingerprint scan unlock plug and others may be utilized to unlock the electrically motorized wheel.

The electrically motorized wheel may be triggered to lock step by a combination of criteria such as the electrically motorized wheel no longer being connected to the mobile device the mobile device being beyond a predetermined proximity from the vehicle a user not being seated on the vehicle the electrically motorized wheel not moving for a prescribed time period the vehicle not moving for a prescribed time period a timeout etc. Further the electrically motorized wheel may be selectively locked from the mobile device.

The electrically motorized wheel may receive input from various sensors and other data sources for interface with the control system . The support and or ports provided for additional sensors and other hardware may be used to enhance user safety in a variety of ways such as alerting the user to a danger alerting other s to the user s presence enhancing user visibility and others. Data from one or more sensors may be transferred to the main control board and from there to the user s mobile device or to a remote location. In some examples data may be sent to the user s mobile device and commands sent back to the electrically motorized wheel in response. In some examples data may be sent to a server then commands sent back to the electrically motorized wheel in response. In other examples data may be processed directly at the mobile device for the electrically motorized wheel. For example a proximity sensor may send data to the user s mobile device causing the mobile device to provide an alert to the user using one or more of an audio alert a visual alert and a tactile alert. A tactile alert may be delivered by providing commands to the electrically motorized wheel so as to cause a small perturbation in performance of the electrically motorized wheel such as a vibration a change in speed a change in the amount of assistance provided to a pedaling user a change in resistance and others which may be felt by a user and understood as a signal indicating a change in performance or the approach to an operational limit of the wheel such as maximum motor temperature or maximum regeneration current.

In embodiments a proximity sensor may provide data regarding the user s location such as via a traffic network for alerting drivers of other vehicles automobiles trucks buses other electrically motorized vehicles or the like of the user s presence. A proximity sensor may be GPS or other global location sensor or set of sensors such as used in triangulation to locations of infrastructure elements such as satellites cellular towers or the like a sensor or sensors associated with a network e.g. a cellular Bluetooth NFS or other local wireless network a sensor associated with a transportation infrastructure e.g. located at a road sign traffic signal crossing or the like a sensor associated with a mobile device e.g. a camera of a mobile device or any other sensor that would provide data about the location of vehicle enabled with an electrically motorized wheel. For example the electrically motorized wheel may communicate directly with other vehicles e.g. a cellular Bluetooth NFS or other wireless network to form an ad hoc local traffic network that provides relative positional information of the adjacent vehicles to for example alert a vehicle to the presence and relative position of the electrically motorized wheel. Alternatively the electrically motorized wheel may communicate globally with a local server such as that located at an intersection or a city wide server that then communicates with adjacent vehicles on the traffic net to provide relative positional information of the adjacent vehicles.

In another example an illumination level sensor may provide data to an application that would cause the bicycle lights to turn on when illumination falls below a set level. Alternatively a data source may provide daylight data based on geological clock which may be associated with proximity data such that the electrically motorized wheel sends a signal to turn on illumination when in use at night at the current location of the electrically motorized wheel.

With reference to a remote diagnostics algorithm may be provided for the electrically motorized wheel. The remote diagnostics algorithm operates to collect operational data from for example the various sensors in the sensory system of the electrically motorized wheel step .

The operational data may include software and hardware version numbers as well as an application state of the electrically motorized wheel to include but not be limited to system initialization sleeping listening stand by initiated standing by running initiated running locked service mode shutdown default boot loading and others. The operational data may also include hazard indicators both critical hazard indicators which require the cessation of assist functions such as motor overheated and transient hazard indicators which allow continued use but with restricted performance such as motor temperature being close to a limit but not over it.

The operational data may include system response data such as a reduction in motor assistance in response to a motor warm hazard indicator regenerative braking turned off in response to the battery being full results of a self test run in response to a torque sensor fault and others. The operational data may also include any system fault errors generated by the different subsystems such as battery motor drive sensors communications processing board peripheral system and others. The operational data may further include sensor data that is used for controlling the vehicle such as bicycle velocity pedal speed cassette torque cassette speed and others.

The operational data may be communicated on a predetermined frequency basis for analysis step . The data may be communicated either directly to a server via for example wireless or cellular technology such as 3G 4G or to the connected mobile device via a wired connection Bluetooth or other wireless technologies. Data communicated to the mobile device may then be sent directly to a server or stored on the mobile device to be communicated to the server at a later time according to a set of rules that may include for example battery charge on the mobile device signal strength the presence of a Wi Fi connection and others. Data may also be stored locally on the wheel and sent to the server at a later time either automatically once a mobile device connects to the wheel or when connected to service tool through a wireless or a wired connection port . Data sent to the server may be associated with the specific wheel that generated the data. This association enables a service representative to view and analyze the operational data when responding to a trouble call thus facilitating resolution of the issue step .

The operational data may be analyzed for internal consistency and error detection. For example if a positive torque is measured at the cassette but there a negative speed measured at the cassette there is a problem either with the torque or speed measurement. This is because in a bicycle with a freewheel positive torques cannot be sustained with negative pedal speed.

In another example data such as cassette speed may be checked for errors using a variety of sensors such as the speed sensor the torque frequency measured at the cassette torque sensor. Because the pedals cannot spin faster than the measured wheel speed if the pedal speed exceeds the motor speed there is a problem either with the cassette or wheel speed measurements.

Additionally operational data may be collected for understanding the context of usage. For example temperature data may be reviewed to determine the temperature at which the batteries were charged and discharged and or accelerometer data may be used to sense crashes falls drops and others. The operational data may thus be used to determine the occurrence of user actions and events outside the normal wear and tear that might void the warranty step .

Extensive testing may be performed during manufacturing to verify the robustness of various components prior to final assembly. For example the shell and the magnetic ring rotor may be assembled then torque applied to check for slippage of the magnetic ring rotor relative to the shell prior to full assembly. In another example torque may be applied to the torque sensor until destruction. In another example accelerated life testing may be performed and may include environmental and performance testing.

With reference to an electrically motorized wheel testing apparatus positions a drive wheel with a number of bumps fixed onto the circumference thereof into driving contact with the electrically motorized wheel to be tested. The bumps may be removable or otherwise configurable to represent various road conditions.

The electrically motorized wheel to be tested rotates the drive wheel and an outer cage protects personnel. The electrically motorized wheel may be supplied with external power to run for extended periods. Alternatively the drive wheel may be powered to drive the electrically motorized wheel. As the drive wheel rotates the electrically motorized wheel is thus subjected to a bumpy road. The electrically motorized wheel testing apparatus thus provides a compact extended life test cell to facilitate testing.

The ability to alter the amount of assistance or resistance provided by the electrically motorized wheel together with the reporting of data therefrom supports the use of electrically motorized wheel in remote rehabilitation therapies. Rehabilitation from an injury or recovery from a surgery may involve a progressive increase in usage time an increase in resistance weight and others for the recovering body part. For example rehabilitation of a knee may involve weight training with the weight increasing a given percentage per week or biking with the distance increasing a given percentage a week.

With reference to a rehabilitation system is disclosed in which a rehabilitation provider may prescribe an exercise regime for a patient. The prescription may include a desired a level of exertion resistance torque length of time frequency and other factors using a prescription system on a computing device accessible to the rehabilitation provider. The prescription may be communicated via a server to a corresponding rehabilitation application resident on a patient s mobile device.

The rehabilitation application may be utilized to generate a custom mode such that the control parameters sent to the patient s electrically motorized wheel provides the prescribed assistance and resistance to the user. Alternatively the rehabilitation application may calculate the appropriate assistance and resistance to effectuate the prescription. The rehabilitation application may additionally encourage the patient to use the electrically motorized wheel for the desired time and frequency.

The rehabilitation application together with the server provides compliance data and wheel performance data such as speed distance time torque energy used and others to the prescription system where a rehabilitation provider may review patient compliance relative to the prescription actual torque provided by patient leg to leg non uniformity of applied torque and others. This data may then be used to modify the patient prescription such as altering the level of assistance and resistance altering recommend training time notifying the patient of unexpected results and others.

In embodiments the mobile device may be in communication with a wearable sensor such as a heart rate monitor to selectively adjust the operational mode of the wheel in response thereto. Such selection may be utilized in concert with a training mode to maintain a desired heart rate or in rehabilitation mode to assure the user s heart rate does not exceed a predetermined value.

In embodiments the mobile device can be utilized to measure a force on the user such as a force applied to a user s knees via one or more sensors in communication therewith. The rehabilitation application may then be utilized to provide compliance and goal related data during performance of the physical therapy program. This data may then be used to modify the patient prescription such as altering the level of assistance and resistance so that user may experience optimized levels of assistance and resistance in essentially real time. A feedback loop is thus provided to control the level of assistance and resistance in based on a training or rehabilitation regimen.

With reference to a training system is disclosed in which a training application on a mobile device is in communication with an electrically motorized wheel . The training application permits the user to specify training goals such as a level of exertion level of resistance rate of Calorie expenditure maximum heart rate desired Calorie expenditure percent increase over previous performance fitness goals e.g. complete the tour de France .

The training application may then convert the specified goals to a custom set of control parameters to be transmitted to the electrically motorized wheel and provide the appropriate assistance and resistance to meet the specified goals. The electrically motorized wheel may provide performance data such as levels of assistance and resistance provided total calories burned rate of calories burned torque applied by the user and others to the training application for review by the user or a trainer.

Bicycle stands for stationary indoor training may be used with the electrically motorized wheel however when the electrically motorized wheel provides resistance for the user electricity is generated. Such generated electricity may be used to drive peripheral devices such as a fan power or charge mobile devices and others. The power generated may used to heat the room stored to an external battery or uploaded to the electrical grid. Alternatively the power generated may simply be dissipated via a resistor or other energy conversion device that for example plugs into the electrically motorized wheel when operated on a bicycle stand.

In embodiments the bicycle stands for stationary indoor training may also be particularly tailored to the electrically motorized wheel to provide power output connections docking for accessory devices peripheral devices battery charging stations etc.

With respect to a fleet management system includes a plurality of electrically motorized wheels that may be in communication with a server to receive data for interchange with one or more wheel databases .
