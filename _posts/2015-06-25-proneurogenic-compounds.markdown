No. 8 604 074 which claims the benefit and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 143 755 filed on Jan. 9 2009 each of these prior applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under Grant 5DP1OD00027605 5R37MH05938809 and 1RO1MH087986 which were awarded by the National Institute of Health the Government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates generally to the discovery of pro neurogenic compounds capable of promoting neurogenesis and or reducing neuronal cell death.

It is now accepted that the adult vertebrate brain fosters the birth and functional incorporation of newly formed neurons Goldman and Nottebohm 1984 Paton and Nottebohm 1984 Burd and Nottebohm 1985 . However it was long thought that no new neurons could be added to the adult mammalian brain. This dogma was challenged in the 1960 s when autoradiographic evidence of new neuron formation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus olfactory bulb and cerebral cortex of the adult rat was presented Altman 1962 1963 Altman and Das 1965 1966a b . It is now accepted that within all mammalian species including humans Eriksson et al. 1998 there are two major reservoirs of neuronal stem cells one located in the subgranular zone SGZ of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and another in the subventricular zone SVZ Gross 2000 . Neural stem cells in the SVZ facilitate formation of new neurons that migrate rostrally to populate the olfactory bulb while neural stem cells in the SGZ produce neurons that integrate locally in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus a region of the hippocampus that exhibits lifelong structural and functional plasticity.

The process of new neuron formation in the adult mouse brain can be influenced by environmental chemical and genetic variables. As demonstrated by Gage and colleagues neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain is enhanced when animals are exposed to an enriched environment Kempermann et al. 1998 or able to exercise voluntarily van Praag et al. 1999 . More recently anti depressant drugs have been shown to enhance levels of adult neurogenesis in animals including humans Schmidt and Duman 2007 Boldrini et al. 2009 . Among many genes reported to impact adult neurogenesis is the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 NPAS3 a central nervous system CNS specific transcription factor that has been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Kamnsasaran et al. 2003 Pickard et al. 2005 2006 2009 Lavedan et al. 2008 . Animals missing both copies of the NPAS3 gene suffer a profound loss of adult hippocampal neurogenesis coupled with significant behavioral deficits Pieper et al. 2005 . Knowing that impaired post natal neurogenesis elicits unfavorable phenotypic deficits it is predicted that pro neurogenic chemical compounds should exhibit favorable therapeutic benefits.

This invention relates generally to compounds that promote the generation or the survival of existing neurons in the mammalian brain. For the purpose of simplicity we refer to these compounds as being pro neurogenic. In certain embodiments the compounds promote the generation or survival of neurons in the post natal mammalian brain. In certain embodiments the compounds promote the survival growth development and or function of neurons particularly CNS brain cerebral and hippocampal neurons. In certain embodiments the compounds stimulate post natal hippocampal neurogenesis which while not wishing to be bound by theory is believed to represent a therapeutic target for a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases including but not limited to schizophrenia major depression bipolar disorder normal aging epilepsy traumatic brain injury post traumatic stress disorder Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease Down syndrome spinocerebellar ataxia amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Huntington s disease stroke radiation therapy chronic stress and abuse of neuro active drugs such as alcohol opiates methamphetamine phencyclidine and cocaine. The invention also features compositions e.g. pharmaceutical compositions that include such compounds as well as methods of making identifying and using such compounds. Other features and advantages are described in or will be apparent from the present specification and accompanying drawings.

Similarly the terms heteroarylheterocyclyl and heteroarylcycloalkyl refer to bicyclic tricyclic or other polycyclic ring systems that include a heteroaryl ring fused to a heterocyclyl and cycloalkyl respectively. Any atom can be substituted e.g. by one or more substituents. For example arylcycloalkyl can include indanyl arylheterocyclyl can include 2 3 dihydrobenzofuryl 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroisoquinolyl and 2 2 dimethylchromanyl.

The term oxo refers to double bonded oxygen when a substituent on carbon. When oxo is a substituent on nitrogen or sulfur it is understood that the resultant groups has the structures N O and S O and SO respectively.

As used herein the term cyano employed alone or in combination with other terms refers to a group of formula CN wherein the carbon and nitrogen atoms are bound together by a triple bond.

In general when a definition for a particular variable includes both hydrogen and non hydrogen halo alkyl aryl etc. possibilities the term substituent s other than hydrogen refers collectively to the non hydrogen possibilities for that particular variable.

The term substituent refers to a group substituted on e.g. an alkyl haloalkyl cycloalkyl heterocyclyl heterocycloalkenyl cycloalkenyl aryl or heteroaryl group at any atom of that group. In one aspect the substituent s on a group are independently any one single or any combination of two or more of the permissible atoms or groups of atoms delineated for that substituent. In another aspect a substituent may itself be substituted with any one of the above substituents.

Further as used herein the phrase optionally substituted means unsubstituted e.g. substituted with a H or substituted. As used herein the term substituted means that a hydrogen atom is removed and replaced by a substitutent. It is understood that substitution at a given atom is limited by valency.

Descriptors such as C Caryl that is optionally substituted with from 1 4 independently selected R and the like is intended to include both an unsubstituted C Caryl group and a C Caryl group that is substituted with from 1 4 independently selected R. The use of a substituent radical prefix names such as alkyl without the modifier optionally substituted or substituted is understood to mean that the particular substituent is unsubstituted. However the use of haloalkyl without the modifier optionally substituted or substituted is still understood to mean an alkyl group in which at least one hydrogen atom is replaced by halo.

Compounds were tested in vivo for dose responsive neurotrophic efficacy. The results are shown in Table 1.

In an effort to identify compounds that might stimulate the birth of new neurons or protect newborn neurons from cell death a library of 1 000 compounds was screened using an in vivo assay. In the initial screen compounds were randomly pooled into groups of ten and administered intracerebroventricularly at a constant rate over seven days into the left lateral ventricle of living mice via Alzet osmotic mini pumps. Compounds were administered at a concentration of 10 M for each molecule making a total solute concentration of 100 M . After seven days of infusion at a constant rate of 0.5 L hour a total of 84 L of volume will have left the pump 0.00084 Moles and entered the cerebrospinal fluid. The average volume of a brain from a 12 week old male C57 B6 mouse in our study is 500 mm. The maximal amount of drug was estimated that could potentially be present in the brain taking the extreme and unlikely scenario of 100 absorbance of the drug into brain tissue and 0 clearance throughout the seven day infusion period. Under these conditions at the end of one week of infusion each compound would be present at 1.7 Molar concentration. Since the actual amount of chemical compound in the brain is likely to be only a fraction of this predicted level it is reasonable to estimate that compounds were administered at mid to low nanomolar concentrations.

During compound infusion animals were intraperitoneally IP injected daily with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine BrdU as a means of scoring the birth and survival of proliferating neural precursor cells in the hippocampus. Because both social interaction and voluntary exercise are known to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis mice were housed individually without access to running wheels throughout the screening period. Following the week long period of compound administration animals were perfused and sacrificed. Dissected brain tissue was fixed embedded sectioned stained with antibodies to BrdU and evaluated by light microcopy as a means of quantifying neurogenesis and survival of newborn neural precursor cells localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus on the brain hemisphere contralateral to the side of mini pump cannulation. Every fifth section throughout the entire rostral caudal extent of the hippocampus was analyzed and the total number of BrdU cells was normalized against the measured volume of the dentate gyrus. Because both increased proliferation and survival of newborn neurons are important screening parameters the screen was conducted over seven days in order to cast a wide net to detect molecules that might augment either process. The choice of parameters for the screen was based on pulse chase experiments with a single injection of BrdU under identical conditions to those used in our screen which revealed that 40 of newborn cells in the dentate gyrus die within the first five days of their birth . Intracranial infusions of either fibroblast growth factor 2 FGF 2 or artificial cerebral spinal fluid aCSF vehicle via the same week long protocol were employed as positive and negative controls. There was no difference in the number of BrdU labeled cells in the dentate gyrus between mice subjected to surgical pump implantation and infusion with vehicle and mice having had no surgery . This confirmed the validity of the in vivo approach to assess the ability of intracerebroventricularly infused compounds to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in the contralateral hemisphere.

We considered it to be important that stimulation of neurogenesis triggered by any compound be localized to the exact region of the brain known to produce new neurons at an enhanced level in response to healthy activities such as wheel running access to an enriched environment or access to social interaction. For this reason attention was focused solely on compound pools that stimulated BrdU incorporation only in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Prominent nonspecific incorporation of BrdU in ectopic regions such as CA3 CA1 cortex or striatum was presumed to reflect pathological inflammation as proliferating cells incorporate BrdU in DNA synthesis or to indicate other forms of toxicity as cells also incorporate BrdU during DNA repair. Any compound pools yielding ectopic BrdU incorporation were eliminated from the screen. For an example see .

Each of the 100 pools was tested on two independent mice. As shown in ten of the 100 test pools were observed to enhance dentate gyrus specific neurogenesis to an extent roughly equivalent to FGF 2. Each pool that scored positive in the initial two test animals was subsequently re evaluated in two additional mice and all ten pools were found to exert their pro neurogenic effect with statistical significance . In order to identify single pro neurogenic compounds positive pools were broken down into their ten component molecules each of which was infused individually at two concentrations 10 M and 100 M in two mice per concentration. shows the results of break down assays on pool 7 wherein it was discovered that neurogenesis was selectively stimulated by one of the constituent chemicals of the pool compound 3 chemicals in the pool demonstrating no effect. We designate this molecule as Example 45 Compound. In breaking down the ten positive pools eight pools yielded a single pro neurogenic compound . To ensure that the pro proliferative or neuroprotective effect on neural stem cells was not an artifact of storage conditions in the UTSWMC chemical compound library re supplied compounds were verified to by 99 pure by mass spectrometry evaluated in 4 mice each at 10 M concentration and shown to retain either pro proliferative or neuroprotective properties in neural stem cells .

Pharmacokinetic analysis of Example 45 Compound in plasma and whole brain tissue was undertaken after single IV IP and oral gavage administrations. Example 45 Compound was noted to be orally bioavailable readily able to cross the blood brain barrier and endowed with a plasma terminal half life of 6.7 hours after IP delivery. These favorable pharmacological properties facilitated a dose response experiment wherein daily oral administration of Example 45 Compound to adult mice was monitored for both brain levels of the chemical and pro neurogenic efficacy . Maximal pro neurogenic efficacy was observed at oral doses of 5 mg kg and above and graded reductions in efficacy were observed at doses of 2.5 and 1 mg kg. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of the brain levels of Example 45 Compound in the dose ranges of 1 2.5 and 5 mg kg revealed corresponding compound concentrations of 213 nM 101 ng g brain tissue 1.13 M 534 ng g brain tissue and 1.35 M 640 ng g brain tissue five hours after dosing.

In order to further study Example 45 Compound an in vivo structure activity relationship SAR study was conducted using 37 chemical derivatives of the compound for pro neurogenic activity via direct administration into the brain of adult mice via Alzet minipumps. Compounds were administered for one week at 10 uM into 4 mice per compound along with daily IP injections of BrdU. Following compound administration animals were perfused sacrificed and subjected to sectioning staining and light microscopy in order to monitor hippocampal neurogenesis localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. Roughly 10 of the variant compounds retained pro neurogenic activity indistinguishable from the parent compound. An approximately equal number of compounds yielded slightly diminished activity yet the majority of variants were of significantly diminished activity . A variant of Example 45 Compound having a methoxy substitution on the aniline ring Example 62 Compound was re tested for pro neurogenic activity via direct administration into the brain of adult mice via Alzet minipumps. The compound was administered for one week at 10 M into 4 mice which were injected daily with BrdU. Following compound administration animals were perfused sacrificed and subjected to sectioning staining and light microscopy in order to monitor hippocampal neurogenesis localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. The methoxy derivative exhibited activity comparable to Example 45 Compound. Subsequently the and enantiomers of Example 62 Compound were prepared . The two enantiomers were evaluated in the in vivo neurogenesis assay. The enantiomer of Example 62 Compound retained potent pro neurogenic activity and the enantiomer displayed diminished activity .

The nature of the cells produced in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus was investigated when Example 45 Compound was administered as follows. Animals were exposed to oral administration of Example 45 Compound for 30 days. Brain tissue was then prepared for immunohistochemical staining with an antibody to doublecortin DCX a microtubule associated protein that serves as a marker of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by virtue of transient expression in newly formed neurons but not glial cells between the timing of their birth and final maturation Brown et al. 2003 . As shown in the relative abundance of doublecortin positive neurons increased dramatically as a function of exposure to prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound. Although this observation does not rule out the possibility that the compound might also enhance the formation of glial cells it clearly shows that Example 45 Compound enhanced the formation of cells destined to become neurons.

Example 45 Compound mediated neurogenesis was next investigated to see whether it was attributable to increased cell proliferation or protection of newborn cells from cell death during the time between their birth and eventual incorporation into the granular layer of the dentate gyrus. This was accomplished by comparing the ability of Example 45 Compound to enhance either short or long term increases in the incorporation of BrdU in the dentate gyrus . Animals exposed to orally delivered Example 45 Compound or vehicle for 30 days were administered a single pulse of BrdU via IP injection. Short term effects on neuron birth were monitored by sacrificing animals one hour post BrdU injection followed by fixation of the tissue sectioning and immunohistochemical detection of BrdU incorporation into cells localized in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. Example 45 Compound administration did not lead to an elevation in the level of BrdU positive cells relative to vehicle in this short term assay. At one day after BrdU administration both groups still showed no statistically significant differences in number of BrdU cells in the dentate gyrus. By contrast at the 5 day time point by which time 40 of newborn cells in our assay normally die animals that received Example 45 Compound showed a statistically significant 25 increase in BrdU cells compared to the vehicle only control group. This difference between groups progressed with time such that mice that received a daily oral dose of Example 45 Compound for 30 days starting 24 hours after the pulse treatment of BrdU exhibited a 5 fold increase in the abundance of BrdU positive cells in the dentate gyrus relative to vehicle only controls. Notably in this longer term trial BrdU positive cells were observed not only along the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus where new neurons are known to be born but also within the granular layer itself. We hypothesize that these cells represent mature neurons that have migrated into the granular layer completed the differentiation process and incorporated themselves into the dentate gyrus as properly wired neurons. Observations supportive of this interpretation will be presented in a subsequent section of this document. In summary these experiments give evidence that Example 45 Compound enhances the formation of neurons in the mature hippocampus and that its mode of action would appear to take place at some point subsequent to their birth.

Example 45 Compound Normalizes Apoptosis and Ameliorates Morphological and Electrophysiological Deficits in the Dentate Gyrus of NPAS3 Deficient Mice 

Mice lacking both copies of the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 NPAS3 suffer a profound impairment in adult neurogenesis Pieper et al. 2005 . By evaluating BrdU incorporation in a short term assay of neurogenesis by sacrificing animals 1 hours after BrdU pulse it was observed that NPAS3 deficient animals have no detectable deficit in the birth of neurons in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus . This is in contrast to our earlier observations of profoundly diminished BrdU labeling in the dentate gyrus of NPAS3 deficient animals when BrdU is administered for a longer period of time 12 days Pieper et al. 2005 . Knowing that the NPAS3 transcription factor is required for proper expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 FGFR1 in the hippocampus Pieper et al. 2005 it is possible that impediments in growth factor signaling might impair the trophic environment critical for the survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus. As an initial test of this hypothesis brain tissue prepared from NPAS3 deficient animals was compared with that of wild type littermates for the presence of cleaved caspase 3 CCSP3 positive cells in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. A statistically significant 2 fold increase in CCSP3 positive apoptotic cells was observed in the dentate gyrus of NPAS3 deficient animals . This enhanced rate of programmed cell death is likely to account at least in part for the nearly complete elimination of adult neurogenesis in mice lacking the NPAS3 transcription factor Pieper et al. 2005 .

In addition to this quantitative deficit in adult neurogenesis we have observed abnormalities in both the morphology and electrophysiology of granular neurons of the dentate gyrus of NPAS3 deficient animals. Relative to wild type animals Golgi Cox staining revealed severe attenuation in dendritic branching and spine density of dentate gyrus granular neurons of NPAS3 deficient animals . By contrast no genotype dependent differences in these measures were observed in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Equivalently specific deficits were observed by electrophysiologic recordings of NPAS3 deficient animals compared with wild type littermates . Whole field recordings of excitatory postsynaptic potentials fEPSP revealed significant deficits in NPAS3 deficient animals relative to wild type littermates. In the dentate gyrus stimulating and recording electrodes were positioned in the outer molecular layer which is innervated by axons of the perforant pathway originating from the entorhinal cortex. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus stimulation and recording electrodes were positioned in the stratum radiatum which is innervated by the Schaffer collateral axons of CA3 pyramidal cells. Stimulus intensity was increased in 5 A increments the slope of the decreasing part of field potentials was measured and fEPSP was quantified relative to the amplitude of the fiber volley which represents firing of action potentials in pre synaptic axons. This analysis revealed aberrant hyper excitability of synaptic transmission in npas3 mice both in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in the CA1 region .

Armed with these genotype and region specific deficits in both neuron morphology and electrophysiological activity we set out to test whether prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound might favorably repair either deficit in NPAS3 deficient animals. Before embarking on this effort we first confirmed that Example 45 Compound was capable of enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis in NPAS3 deficient mice by demonstrating that Example 45 Compound enhances both BrdU incorporation as well as expression of doublecortin in newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of npas3 mice . Knowing that formation of the dentate gyrus initiates in the late pre natal mouse embryo around embryonic day 14 Stanfield and Cowan 1988 we sought to expose animals to Example 45 Compound for as extended a period of time as possible in order to give the compound the best possible chance for exhibiting favorable effects. Following oral gavage of pregnant female mice 14 day embryos were recovered dissected and processed by acetonitrile water extraction so that Example 45 Compound levels could be measured in the embryonic brain. Daily administration of 20 mg kg of Example 45 Compound to pregnant females yielded appreciable levels of the compound in the brain tissue of developing embryos. It was similarly observed that oral administration of the compound to lactating females led to delivery of Example 45 Compound to the brain tissue of weanling pups. In both cases LC MS based quantitation of Example 45 Compound revealed levels of compound accumulation at or above the 1.35 M limit required to support adult neurogenesis . Finally it was observed that daily IP administration of Example 45 Compound to weaned pups at 20 mg kg was sufficient to yield brain levels of Example 45 Compound at or above the level required to enhance adult neurogenesis.

Female mice heterozygous at the NPAS3 locus were mated to heterozygous males. Two weeks post mating females were given a daily oral gavage of either 20 mg kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle only formula. Dosing was continued throughout the last trimester of pregnancy as well as the two week post natal period of lactation. Following weaning pups were given a daily IP dose of either 20 mg kg Example 45 Compound or vehicle control. At about 7 weeks of age mice were switched to oral gavage delivery of the same dose of Example 45 Compound. When mice were 3 months of age they were sacrificed and brain tissue was dissected and subjected to either Golgi Cox staining or electrophysiological recording. As shown in prolonged exposure to Example 45 Compound robustly repaired morphological deficits in the dendritic branching of granular neurons of the dentate gyms in NPAS3 deficient mice. Moreover as shown in the electrophysiological deficit in the dentate gyrus of NPAS3 deficient mice was also corrected following prolonged exposure of mice to Example 45 Compound. The corresponding electrophysiological deficit in CA1 region of the hippocampus however was not affected underscoring the specificity of Example 45 Compound to improving functioning of the dentate gyrus in this animal model.

It is also notable that relative to vehicle only controls administration of Example 45 Compound did not affect any aspect of the health of mothers embryos weanlings or young adult mice. Gross histology of brain tissue was normal in both compound and vehicle treated animals and there was no evidence of neuronal cell loss or degenerative changes cytoplasmic eosinophilia vacuolization or nuclear pyknosis . The only morphological change other than normalization of dendritic arborization of granular neurons of the dentate gyrus was a compound dependent increase in the thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus itself . The thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus is roughly 40 less in NPAS3 deficient animals than wild type littermates. Prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound through late embryonic development early post natal development and two months post weaning significantly corrected this deficit without affecting the thickness of other hippocampal layers in NPAS3 deficient mice .

Recognizing that the reduced thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in NPAS3 deficient animals could be attributed to elevated levels of apoptosis of newborn hippocampal neural precursor cells we examined the effect of Example 45 Compound treatment on apoptosis in the hippocampus of NPAS3 deficient animals through immunohistochemical staining of cleaved caspase 3 CCSP3 . As shown in 12 days of treatment with orally delivered Example 45 Compound 20 mg kg to adult NPAS3 deficient animals significantly reduced CCSP3 staining in the dentate gyms whereas vehicle treatment had not effect. We thereby propose that Example 45 Compound facilitated repair of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in NPAS3 deficient mice by ameliorating a genotype specific exacerbation of programmed cell death.

Apoptosis is implicated in numerous neurodegenerative disorders and we wondered if Example 45 Compound might protect mature neurons from programmed cell death. Cultured primary cortical neurons have been shown to undergo apoptosis following exposure to amyloid peptide Loo et al. 1993 . Accordingly we investigated whether Example 45 Compound might protect cultured neurons from this paradigm of cell death. Cortical neurons from embryonic day 18 rats were allowed to mature for 1 week exposed to 25 M A peptide fragment for 48 hours and then assayed for cell viability by light microscopic visualization as well as the cell titer blue viability assay Promega which utilizes the indicator dye resazurin to measure the metabolic activity of cultured cells. As shown in Example 45 Compound protected cultured primary cortical neurons from A mediated toxicity. Dose response testing revealed that Example 45 Compound did not lose maximal neuroprotective activity even when diluted to low nanomolar levels. Importantly when the and enantiomers of the methoxy derivative of Example 45 Compound Example 62 Compound were tested neuroprotective activity was observed with the same enantiomer of Example 62 Compound that also retained pro neurogenic activity in living mice while the enantiomer again displayed diminished activity

In order to investigate its cellular site of action example 62 compound was modified by attaching a coumarin moiety to the N phenyl ring according to established methods Alexander et al. 2006 yielding a fluorescent derivative designated FASDP fluorescent anisidine substituted derivative of Example 45 Compound . FASDP was confirmed to retain pro neurogenic activity in adult mice in our standard assay and cultured osteoblast cells were exposed to FASDP and visualized by fluorescence optics in a light microscope. As shown in FASDP labeled cells in a punctuate pattern that overlapped with mitochondria as visualized by Mitotracker dye. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the activity and molecular target of Example 45 Compound may reside within mitochondria.

Extensive evidence pioneered by the laboratory of Xiaodong Wang has shown that an intrinsic pathway leading to programmed cell death emanates from mitochondria Liu et al. 1996 Yang et al. 1997 . With the help of the Wang lab assays were established to test whether Example 45 Compound might protect mitochondria from calcium induced dissolution Distelmaier et al. 2008 . Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester TMRM is a cell permeant cationic red orange fluorescent dye that is readily sequestered by active mitochondria. When loaded with TMRM dye vehicle only treated cells released the dye within 15 minutes of exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187. By contrast dye release was prevented in cells exposed to as little as 10 ng of Example 45 Compound . As with in vivo neurogenesis assay as well as the in vitro protection from A mediated toxicity of cultured cortical neurons preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential in this assay was observed only with the enantiomer of Example 62 Compound .

A chemical compound sharing structural similarity to Example 45 Compound is 2 3 4 5 Tetrahydro 2 8 dimethyl 5 2 6 methyl 3 pyridyl ethyl 1H pyrido 4 3 b indole . An anti histamine trade named Dimebon was anecdotally noticed over the decades to ameliorate symptoms of dementia O Brien 2008 Burns and Jacoby 2008 . More recently an American biotechnology company designated Medivation initiated clinical trials to formally test whether Dimebon might improve the symptoms of patients suffering from Alzheimer s disease. The results of FDA sponsored phase 2 clinical trials in Alzheimer s disease were recently published reporting favorable response rates Doody et al. 2008 . Example 45 Compound and Dimebon were compared in three functional assays. The in vivo test for effects on hippocampal neurogenesis revealed activity for both compounds with Example 45 Compound exhibiting between 10 and 30 fold higher level of potency and a ceiling of efficacy roughly 40 higher than the anti histamine drug . Dimebon has previously been reported to protect cortical neurons from A mediated toxicity Bachurin et al. 2001 . As shown in Dimebon only afforded protection at doses of 3 M. Example 45 Compound did not lose neuroprotective activity even when diluted to low nanomolar levels. Dimebon has also been implicated in protecting mitochondria Bachurin et al. 2003 . We therefore compared Dimebon with Example 45 Compound in the calcium induced mitochondrial dissolution assay. Both compounds were observed to be active and it was again observed that the relative potency of Example 45 Compound was superior to Dimebon . Protection of mitochondrial membrane permeability was lost for Example 45 Compound between the 10 and 1 nM doses whereas that of Dimebon was lost between 10 and 1 M.

Example 45 Compound and Dimebon were tested for binding to the H1 histamine receptor. While Dimebon displayed high affinity for this receptor IC5010 M.

We turned to aged Fisher rats as a means of performing behavioral tests capable of assessing the potential benefits of Example 45 Compound on hippocampus dependent learning. It is well established that normal rodent aging is associated with attenuation of hippocampal neurogenesis Kuhn et al. 1996 Driscoll et al. 2006 . Reduced neurogenesis in aged rats is likely related to increased neuronal apoptosis in the aged rat brain Martin et al. 2002 Kim et al. 2010 . These changes have been hypothesized to contribute to cognitive decline as a function of terminal aging. We first evaluated whether Example 45 Compound would enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in aged rats as it does in adult mice. Rats were injected with a daily IP dose of either 10 mg kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle coinjected with a daily dose of BrdU and then sacrificed after 7 days for immunohistochemistry. As shown in compound treated animals revealed a 500 increase in BrdU labeling in the dentate gyrus relative to vehicle treated controls. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to doublecortin likewise revealed a robust compound specific enrichment in this marker of newborn neurons. Having observed proneurogenic efficacy of Example 45 Compound in this short term assay we then tested whether prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound might ameliorate age related decline in cognition by subjecting 18 month old rats to daily administration of either i 0 mg kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle only for 2 months. Animals of both groups were further subjected to weekly IP administration of BrdU 50 mg kg for later immunohistochemical measurements of hippocampal neurogenesis. As a control both Example 45 Compound and vehicle treated groups were confirmed to display equal ability to physically participate in the task and learn the task as shown by decreased latency times to find the hidden platform over the 5 day training period both before and after 2 months of treatment . Moreover neither swim speed nor locomotor activity varied with age or treatment paradigm. After 2 months of compound or vehicle administration cognitive ability was assessed blind to treatment group by removing the goal platform. Animals of the Example 45 Compound treated group retained a statistically significant improvement in ability to navigate to the region of the missing platform as evidenced by performance in the probe test. As shown in when the platform was removed from the maze rats treated with Example 45 Compound crossed the precise location previously containing the platform significantly more often than vehicle treated rats. Furthermore Example 45 Compound treated rats spent a higher percentage of time in the general goal area defined as the quadrant previously containing the platform than vehicle treated rats 35.5 2.2 for Example 45 Compound treated 28.1 2.6 for vehicle treated Student s t Test p

After behavioral testing animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemical detection of BrdU and CCSP3. As shown in the dentate gyrus of rats exposed to Example 45 Compound showed a 3 fold higher level of BrdU positive neurons than that of the vehicle group. Moreover Example 45 Compound treated animals showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of CCSP3 positive cells relative to vehicle controls . Unexpectedly administration of Example 45 Compound helped rats maintain stable body weight with aging in contrast to vehicle treated rats whose weight declined steadily with age . Example 45 Compound mediated effects on body weight were independent of food intake and treatment of aged rats with Example 45 Compound had no effect on postfasting blood glucose levels . It will be of interest to determine whether Example 45 Compound mediated preservation of body weight in aged rats operates via central or peripheral modes of action.

Knowing that P7C3 ameliorates the death of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus in living mice we wondered whether its function might relate to mitochondrial integrity. Assays were established to test whether P7C3 might protect cultured U2OS cells from calcium induced mitochondrial dissolution Distelmaier et al. 2008 . Tetramethylrhodamine methylester TMRM dye is sequestered by active mitochondria and when loaded with TMRM vehicle treated cells released the dye within 15 rain of exposure to the calcium ionophor A23187. By contrast dye release was fully prevented in cells exposed to as little as 10 nM of P7C3 . Compound loaown to be inactive in vivo were also inactive in this assay . Preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential in this assay was observed for the R enantiomer of one compound B but not the S enantiomer C . Finally protection of mitochondrial membrane permeability was observed at an enhanced level for a compound variant which also exhibited a high level of proneurogenic activity . Example 45 Compound but not an inactive compound was also capable of preserving mitochondrial integrity in cultured primary cortical neurons .

Recognizing that reduced thickness of the npas3 dentate gyrus granular layer could be attributed to increased apoptosis of proliferating neural precursor cells we examined the effect of Example 45 Compound treatment on apoptosis in the hippocampus of npas3 mice through immunohistochemical staining of CCSP3. After 12 days of orally delivered Example 45 Compound 20 mg kg to adult npas3 mice a statistically significant reduction in CCSP3 staining was observed in the dentate gyrus. We thereby propose that Example 45 Compound facilitates repair of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in npas3 mice by overcoming a genotype specific enhancement in apoptosis.

Similarly substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and selected from halogen OR OC O R NR R SR R CN NO COR CONR R C O R OC O NR R NR C O R NR CO2R NR C O NR R NR SONR R NH C NH2 NH NR C NH NH NH C NH NR S O R SOR SONR R NR SOR N CH Ph perfluoro C1 C4 alkoxy and perfluoro C1 C4 alkyl in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system and where R R and R are independently selected from hydrogen C1 C8 alkyl and heteroalkyl unsubstituted aryl and heteroaryl unsubstituted aryl C1 C4 alkyl and unsubstituted aryl oxy C1 C4 alkyl. When the aryl group is 1 2 3 4 tetrahydronaphthalene it may be substituted with a substituted or unsubstituted C3 C7 spirocycloalkyl group. The C3 C7 spirocycloalkyl group may be substituted in the same manner as defined herein for cycloalkyl . Typically an aryl or heteroaryl group will have from zero to three substituents with those groups having two or fewer substituents being preferred in the invention. In one embodiment of the invention an aryl or heteroaryl group will be unsubstituted or monosubstituted. In another embodiment an aryl or heteroaryl group will be unsubstituted.
