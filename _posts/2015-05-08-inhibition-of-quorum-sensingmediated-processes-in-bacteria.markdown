Quorum sensing is a process of bacterial cell cell communication that involves production and detection of secreted signaling molecules called autoinducers AI . Quorum sensing allows bacteria to collectively regulate gene expression and thereby function as multi cellular organisms. For example the bioluminescent Gram negative quorum sensing bacterium integrates information from three different diffusible autoinducers that together enable intra and inter species communication. The three autoinducers are AI 1 3 hydroxybutanoyl homoserine lactone AI 2 2S 4S 2 methyl 2 3 3 4 tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran borate and CAI 1 S 3 hydroxytridecan 4 one . These signals are detected by the sensor kinase proteins LuxN LuxQ and CqsS respectively Henke J. M. and Bassler B. L. 2004b . J Bacteriol 186 6902 6914 . At low cell density i.e. in the absence of autoinducers these sensor kinases autophosphorylate and transfer phosphate to the shared phospho transfer protein LuxU. LuxU transfers the phosphoryl group to the DNA binding response regulator LuxO which activates transcription of genes encoding five redundant small regulatory RNAs called the quorum regulatory RNAs Qrrs . The Qrrs destabilize the mRNA transcript encoding the master quorum sensing regulator LuxR. Therefore under low cell density conditions the bacteria do not display quorum sensing behaviors. In contrast at high cell density the three autoinducers accumulate and bind to their cognate receptors. These binding events switch the receptors to phosphatases resulting in dephosphorylation of LuxO and termination of Qrr production. The luxR transcript is stabilized leading to LuxR protein production . LuxR controls the genes in quorum sensing e.g. genes required for bioluminescence siderophore production type III secretion and metalloprotease production Fuqua C. Winans S. C. and Greenberg E.

AI 1 is an acyl homoserine lactone AHL type autoinducer and it is the strongest of the three signals and thus the major input controlling quorum sensing regulated behaviors. Typically AHL autoinducers are detected by cytoplasmic LuxR type transcriptional activators note these LuxR type proteins are unrelated to LuxR . is unusual because all three of its autoinducers including AI 1 are detected by membrane bound sensor kinase proteins in the case of AI 2 however an additional periplasmic binding protein LuxP is required in conjunction with the membrane bound two component protein LuxQ . AI 1 is also the defining member of a growing family of recognized AHL type autoinducers that interact with membrane bound sensor kinases like LuxN rather than with cytosolic LuxR type proteins Freeman J. A. et al. 2000 . Mol Microbiol 35 139 149 Jung K. et al. 2007 . J Bacteriol 189 2945 2948 Timmen M. et al. 2006 . J Biol Chem 281 24398 24404 . There are currently 11 LuxN homologs in the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI database but nothing is known about how AHLs interact with this important class of receptors .

Bacteria that use the AI 1 signaling factor associate with higher organisms i.e. plants and animals at some point during their life cycles. Some examples include and is an opportunistic pathogen in humans with cystic fibrosis. infects certain plants and results in soft rot disease. causes gastrointestinal disease in humans and reportedly produces an autoinducer. synthesizes antibiotics under autoinducer control that block fungus growth in the roots.

Quorum sensing takes place not only among luminous marine bacteria like but also among pathogenic bacteria where it regulates the production of virulence factors.

Additional features and advantages of the present invention will be better understood by reference to the drawings detailed description and examples that follow.

The novel strategies described herein are aimed at interfering with the detection of quorum sensing molecules known as autoinducers. Quorum sensing controls expression of traits essential for bacterial virulence. Quorum sensing plays a vital role in the pathogenicity of many bacteria because the ability to act as a coordinated group is essential for bacteria to successfully infect host organisms. Interference with either the production or the detection of autoinducer molecules can abolish bacterial communication and render bacteria non pathogenic. Thus the novel methods of the present invention which interfere with bacterial detection of autoinducer are important in controlling populations of bacteria.

The present invention identifies fifteen small molecules that disrupt detection of acyl homoserine lactone type autoinducer in Gram negative bacteria and thus inhibit quorum sensing mediated processes . These molecules antagonize membrane bound and cytoplasmic autoinducer receptors. As representative of these two groupings of Gram negative quorum sensing bacteria the molecules were demonstrated to act in the model bacterial species and Chromobacterium by detecting the quorum sensing mediated activities of bioluminescence and violacein production respectively. is representative of those bacteria that have membrane bound sensor receptor for the autoinducer. is representative of those bacteria that have cytoplasmic sensor receptor for the autoinducer .

It is known that inhibitors of quorum sensing function to shut down entire pathogenicity regulons. It has been previously shown that use of bioluminescence as a convenient readout activity is an accurate reporter of the inhibition of all other quorum sensing target genes e.g. virulence factor production biofilm genes type III secretion. Published research of Bassler and others in the field have demonstrated that convenient reporters such as bioluminescence gfp or violacein production are accurate representations of what is happening for all the genes in the regulon.

Nonetheless pathogenicity was studied in more detail in a model system using as a model of a host animal infected by pathogenic bacteria. was used as a model of pathogenic bacteria capable of quorum sensing mediated killing of the host. An antagonist molecule identified from a high throughput chemical library screen protected from quorum sensing mediated killing by .

It has previously been shown that the Type III secretion system TTS is a quorum sensing mediated activity. TTS systems are specialized secretion apparatuses used by many gram negative plant and animal pathogens to inject effector virulence factors directly into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells with which they are associated. Once inside the host cell these effector proteins perform a range of functions that contribute to the propagation of the bacteria. TTS systems have been identified in numerous gram negative bacterial pathogens including enteropathogenic and the marine bacteria and . In enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic quorum sensing activates TTS at high cell density in the presence of autoinducer . In contrast at high cell density quorum sensing represses TTS in the marine bacteria and . Henke J. M. and Bassler B. L. 2004a . J Bacteriol 186 3794 3805 .

Thus the small molecules of the present invention that have been shown to antagonize the LuxN receptor inhibit quorum sensing activity in at high cell density and make the bacterium avirulent because the bacterium needs to express TTS late in infection to result in virulence. In infection where TTS is required at low cell density adding the antagonist small molecule causes the bacteria to express virulence traits at high cell density. This will make the bacterium avirulent because the antagonist will cause the bacterium to express during late infection the traits TTS that are actually needed early in infection thus providing non optimal conditions for infection causing a growth disadvantage and wasting energy.

Thus in a further embodiment the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the small molecule compounds of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers adjuvants or vehicles. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be used to treat infections in a warm blooded animal caused by microorganisms possessing a quorum sensing mechanism which comprises administering to the animal a therapeutically effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition of this invention.

The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by any mode known in the art including for example oral nasal topical including buccal and sublingual or parenteral including subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous and intradermal administration. A skilled artisan can determine which form of administration is best and the therapeutic amount in a particular case for balancing the dose needed versus periodic delivery.

Oral administration can include solid dosage forms such as capsules tablets pills powders tinctures and granules. In such solid dosage forms the active compound is generally admixed with at least one inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as sucrose lactose or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise additional substances such as lubricating agents for example magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules tablets and pills the dosage forms can also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.

Infectious bacteria that use acyl homoserine lactone quorum sensing strategies to produce virulence include pathogens to humans animals and plants. Some pathogens infect marine life and thereafter cause disease in humans who eat or otherwise come into contact with the marine life.

Bacterial infection in humans is facilitated by certain conditions such as burns wounds implants or use of a catheter. is one species that may infect wounds. may contaminate shellfish and cause food poisoning. Individuals with cystic fibrosis CF are plagued by bacterial infection of the lungs. Of the several species of bacteria that infect the lungs is most problematic.

Such substrates include tubular sheet rod and articles of proper shape for use in a number of medical devices such as vascular grafts aortic grafts arterial venous or vascular tubing vascular stents dialysis membranes tubing or connectors blood oxygenator tubing or membranes surgical instruments ultrafiltration membranes intra aortic balloons stents blood bags catheters sutures soft or hard tissue prostheses synthetic prostheses prosthetic heart valves tissue adhesives cardiac pacemaker leads artificial organs endotracheal tubes lenses for the eye such as contact or intraocular lenses blood handling equipment apheresis equipment diagnostic and monitoring catheters and sensors biosensors dental devices drug delivery systems or bodily implants of any kind. For example arthroscopic surgery is routinely performed with use of medical devices that minimize the invasiveness of the procedure. Such devices include for example ultrathin microfiberoptic endoscopes that offer the laryngologist unique access to the limited spaces of the temporal bone and skull base. In another example a stent supplemented with a small molecule compound of the invention that deters bacterial infections resulting from the presence of the implanted stent can be constructed. Stents are used to maintain an open lumen in tissues including the tracheo bronchial system the biliary hepatic system the esophageal bowel system and the urinary tract system. U.S. Pat.

The sealant is useful for significantly diminishing or preventing blood or fluid loss from injured tissues organs or blood vessels while also providing a barrier to infection.

Another quorum sensing activity is biofilm formation. Biofilms are communities of bacterial cells adhered to surfaces. Biofilms are highly problematic in industrial processes such as clogging of cooling towers in manufacturing plants. The novel strategies of the present invention prevent or disrupt biofilms by interfering with quorum sensing.

In another embodiment the invention provides a method of removing a biofilm from a surface that comprises treating the surface with a compound of the invention.

In addition such a compound or composition can be included in a personal hygiene device such as a toothbrush tongue depressor or any other such device which comes in contact with a tissue.

Thus the invention includes introduction of one or more small molecules of the invention into an environment where it is desired to prevent bacteria from acting communally in an undesirable activity such as in production of biofilms or virulence. Introduction of the small molecules of this invention is also contemplated as treatment where undesirable bacterial communities are already established. The particular quantity of the small molecule for prevention or treatment is to be determined experimentally by methods known to those skilled in the art. An example provided herein for guidance involves prevention of virulent bacterial activity in the animal model

Quorum sensing a process of bacterial cell cell communication relies on production detection and response to autoinducer signaling molecules. LuxN a nine transmembrane domain protein from is the founding example of membrane bound receptors for acyl homoserine lactone AHL autoinducers. Previously nothing was known about signal recognition by membrane bound AHL receptors. Using mutagenesis and suppressor analyses the AHL binding domain of LuxN has now been characterized. To extract signaling parameters a strong LuxN antagonist was exploited one of the fifteen small molecule antagonists that were identified. Also identified as antagonists were phenoxyacetamides e.g. N cyclopentyl 2 4 2 phenylpropan 2 yl phenoxy acetamide and N sec butyl 2 4 2 phenylpropan 2 yl phenoxy acetamide.

From membrane topology analysis it would appear that LuxN is bound to the bacterial inner membrane by nine trans membrane TM spanning helices . From reporter protein fusion analyses it would appear that the N terminus of LuxN is on the periplasmic side of the bacterial inner membrane while the histidine kinase portion of LuxN resides in the cytosol Jung et al. 2007 . Therefore LuxN contains four periplasmic loops and four cytosolic loops connecting the nine transmembrane domain TM segments . By analogy to homologous membrane bound sensor kinases LuxN is believed to assemble into homodimers.

To locate the AI 1 binding domain of LuxN a genetic screen was performed to identify luxN mutants encoding proteins incapable of properly responding to AI 1 Example 1 . All of the identified amino acid mutations that affect AI 1 signaling cluster in TM helices near the periplasmic face or are located within periplasmic loops indicating that LuxN most likely binds AI 1 on the periplasmic side of the membrane . The results indicated that the LuxN AI 1 binding domain is composed of TM helices 4 5 6 and 7 as well as the intervening periplasmic loops 2 and 3.

The large number of mutations identified in this work that affect AI 1 binding suggest that LuxN makes multiple contacts with AI 1. Further supporting our conclusion that TM4 TM5 TM6 and TM7 and periplasmic loops 2 and 3 encode the AI 1 binding domain of wild type LuxN a LuxN homolog was recently discovered that lacks the first 80 amino acids which encode TM1 TM2 and periplasmic loop 1 indicating that this region of LuxN is dispensable for AI 1 binding and signaling and NCBI database . This truncated LuxN homolog retains all of the critical regions identified in our identified AI 1 binding domain indicating that this LuxN variant can still respond to an autoinducer molecule . Interestingly the most highly conserved domain in LuxN is centered at position P226 and contains a PPAL motif that is 100 conserved among all known LuxN homologs . Both proline residues of this motif were identified as critical for LuxN signaling by our random mutagenesis screen. Therefore we deduce that the PPAL motif is essential for LuxN signal transduction.

Sequence alignment comparison of LuxN with other LuxN homologs confirmed that the homologs have conserved binding pockets that accommodate an AHL type ligand and that likewise accommodate the small molecule compounds of this invention . These small molecules antagonize a broad spectrum of AHL type receptors.

A high throughput chemical screen was used to identify the set of small molecules that were specifically demonstrated to antagonize the LuxN AI 1 interaction in the model system of Example 4 . All of these LuxN antagonist molecules have ICvalues in the low micromolar range and based on competition assays and genetic evidence the most potent LuxN antagonist competes for the AI 1 binding site. These antagonists provided a molecular tool with which to further probe the AI 1 binding pocket and characterize the signaling properties of LuxN.

These are the first antagonist molecules that target an AHL membrane bound sensor kinase. Importantly the antagonists identified by this screen are not similar in structure to AI 1 see for example . Therefore it is unlikely that rational design experiments would have predicted these molecules as AHL antagonists. To explore whether the antagonists competed with AI 1 for binding to LuxN we performed an antagonist suppressor screen and identified LuxN I209F which is not antagonized by C450 0730 Example 6 . Importantly this mutation lies on the periplasmic side of TM 6 in the center of the proposed AI 1 binding domain consistent with the possibility that C450 0730 competes for the AI 1 binding site though the LuxN mutation I209F does not affect AI 1 signaling . The AI 1 dose response curves in the presence of different concentrations of C450 0730 for both wild type LuxN and LuxN F163A provided a good data collapse indicative of competitive inhibition . Combined these results led to the conclusion that the C450 0730 antagonist is competing for the AI 1 binding pocket of LuxN. Because the LuxN I209F mutation only affects the antagonistic ability of C450 0730 but does not interfere with AI 1 signaling we deduce that C450 0730 makes at least some contacts with LuxN that are distinct from those made by AI 1.

In order to answer the question whether mutations in LuxN could shift the free energy bias between receptor kinase and phosphatase states a model was devised shown schematically in . We propose that each LuxN can exist in any of four states kinase on or phosphatase off with ligand bound or unbound. Receptor activity is determined by the thermal equilibrium among these states characterized by the free energy difference between the on and off states of LuxN see Experimental Procedures . Within the model the measured output bioluminescence is the same unknown function off for all strains reflecting the fact that bioluminescence depends only on receptor activity which at equilibrium depends only on f. The model predicts that mutations can cause EC50 to increase or decrease depending on the sign of the shift in the free energy bias between kinase and phosphatase states. Indeed the model is nicely supported by the data collapse in where the bioluminescence for the LuxN F163A mutant collapses well with wild type assuming only a shift in . More generally we have found that the bioluminescence data for many of our LuxN mutants collapse well with the combined wild type and LuxN F163A data allowing us to deduce changed values and in some cases also changed binding affinities . This analysis supports a close functional analogy between LuxN and chemotaxis receptors and suggests the general relevance of two state free energy models for bacterial sensor kinases.

Little was known about how membrane bound kinase proteins like LuxN detect AHLs. Our mutagenesis strategy showing that LuxN most likely binds AI 1 on the periplasmic side of the membrane indicates that AI 1 is released from accumulates in the extracellular space and subsequently triggers the LuxN quorum sensing cascade. This mechanism is distinct from the previously characterized LuxR type AHL signaling mechanism. Typically LuxR type AHL receptors require significant intracellular AHL concentrations for folding. Thus at low cell densities the LuxR proteins do not fold properly and are degraded so quorum sensing does not occur. Degradation of the LuxR type proteins in the absence of the AHL signal is presumed to be a mechanism preventing premature activation of quorum sensing in canonical LuxR AHL systems. Apparently has evolved a distinct mechanism to circumvent short circuiting its quorum sensing pathway namely by compartmentalizing the cytosolic production of AI 1 in a location inaccessible to the periplasmic sensing domain of LuxN. This spatial uncoupling of AI 1 production from AI 1 binding allows to exclusively monitor extracellular levels of AI 1. It must be noted that has three quorum sensing circuits all of which have similar architectures. Thus all three systems have signal production spatially uncoupled from signal detection .

Furthermore through quantitative analysis it was revealed that unlike the paradigmatic two state chemotaxis receptors which spend roughly equal time in the active and inactive states for maximum sensitivity to ligand the quorum sensing receptor LuxN spends 96 of its time in the active kinase state and requires establishment of a threshold concentration of autoinducer to inactivate it. Remarkably although the chemotaxis and LuxN receptors are homologous they solve fundamentally different biological problems by operating in different regimes. Chemotaxis a system tuned for sensitivity allows instantaneous alterations in behavior in response to small fluctuations in signal concentration. Quorum sensing by contrast a system built to ignore small perturbations initiates a slow all or nothing commitment program only upon reaching a signal threshold. We suggest that the distinct design properties inherent in the quorum sensing and chemotaxis signaling systems have evolved to optimally solve very different biological problems.

The following examples set forth the general procedures involved in practicing the present invention. To the extent that specific materials are mentioned it is merely for purposes of illustration and is not intended to limit the invention. Unless otherwise specified general molecular biology procedures such as those set forth in Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 1989 hereinafter Sambrook et al. or Ausubel et al. eds Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons 1998 hereinafter Ausubel et al. were used.

The aim of this study was to determine how LuxN and AI 1 interact in order to understand how trans membrane receptors couple AHL signaling to changes in gene expression. However as is the case for most histidine sensor kinases the complex trans membrane topology of LuxN makes direct structural analysis extremely difficult. Therefore to pinpoint the AI 1 binding site in the periplasmic domain of LuxN directed mutagenesis of the 1 kb region of luxN encoding the membrane binding domain was performed using error prone PCR. The library of luxN mutants generated by this approach was cloned into a version of the luxN gene lacking this region to regenerate full length luxN. The mutant library was introduced into the double sensor mutant JMH625 luxN luxQ which has a bright phenotype because there is no flow of phosphate to LuxO . The CAI 1 CqsS system is intact in the strain used for this screen. Because saturating levels of CAI 1 are always present in these experiments CqsS exists as a phosphatase and thus does not contribute in funneling phosphate to LuxO. Thus it is reasonable that when a wild type copy of luxN is introduced into this strain in the presence of AI 1 it will remain bright because binding of AI 1 to LuxN induces phosphatase activity. However if a mutant luxN allele encoding a LuxN protein that is incapable of binding or responding to AI 1 is introduced it will confer a dark phenotype due to high levels of LuxN auto phosphorylation and phospho transfer to LuxO .

Approximately 30 000 luxN mutants were screened for those alleles causing a reduction in bioluminescence. Ten alleles were confirmed to produce dark phenotypes. These luxN genes were sequenced to identify the mutations Table 2 . Several candidates contained multiple mutations and these mutations were uncoupled by site directed mutagenesis to produce genes encoding LuxN proteins with single amino acid substitutions Table 2 . Interestingly in the case of LRS6 two of the uncoupled mutations independently caused dark phenotypes Table 2 . Further analyses were carried out on LuxN mutants containing only single amino acid changes.

The mutations conferring dark phenotypes cluster to the periplasmic region of TMs 4 5 6 and 7 and periplasmic loops 2 and 3 circles suggesting that the AI 1 binding site resides there. To explore this hypothesis further the 11 available LuxN homologs were compared and every 100 conserved amino acid was replaced as well as the other most highly conserved amino acids within this region with alanine and were screened as above. This analysis produced an additional 20 mutants defective in response to AI 1. Table 1 .

The LRS5 mutation which confers a dark phenotype is a single base pair deletion at position 634 causing a premature stop codon at amino acid residue 213 Table 2 . This mutation was unexpected because the premature stop codon would lead one to believe that the kinase domain of LuxN should not be synthesized making it unclear how this mutation could confer a dark phenotype. To investigate this a FLAG epitope tag was fused to the C terminus of this mutant LuxN and the protein was probed by western blot analysis. This analysis indicated that a truncated version of LuxN lacking approximately the first 220 amino acids is synthesized data not shown . It appears that an alternative ribosome binding site exists downstream of the LRS5 deletion enabling translation of a truncated form of LuxN. Because this truncation eliminates almost the entire proposed AI 1 binding domain from LuxN only the cytoplasmic kinase domain is produced which because it is unable to bind to AI 1 constitutively acts as a kinase causing a dark phenotype.

To characterize the signaling capabilities of the single amino acid substituted LuxN mutants a series of quantitative phenotypic analyses were carried out. First we measured bioluminescence in stationary phase cultures of strains carrying either wild type luxN or each luxN allele conferring a dark phenotype. The bioluminescence produced by the strain with wild type luxN was set at 100 . As negative controls two luxN mutants harboring wild type phenotypes LuxN L138A and LuxN E154Q which were randomly isolated from the screen were also included in the analysis and they produced the wild type level of bioluminescence . By contrast the LuxN mutants F151A I153F F155I L166R T214I F220A P226T and S232N exhibited at least an 80 reduction in bioluminescence relative to wild type . To confirm that the dark phenotypes did not stem from increased LuxN protein levels FLAG epitope tags were incorporated at the C terminus of a representative subset of the LuxN mutants shown in as well as wild type LuxN. Western blot showed that there were no differences in protein production data not shown .

We reasoned that the LuxN mutants conferring dark phenotypes must be acting as kinases at high cell density resulting in continued flow of phosphate through the quorum sensing circuit. This in turn should manifest itself in elevated qrr expression at high cell density . To test this idea quantitative real time PCR was performed and Qrr4 transcript levels were measured in each of the luxN mutant strains described above. As controls Qrr4 transcript levels were measured in the wild type and the bright control strains LuxN L138A and LuxN E154Q and we found that indeed in these three strains Qrr4 levels are low consistent with these LuxN proteins acting as phosphatases at high cell density . However the luxN mutants exhibiting dark phenotypes all have significantly increased Qrr4 transcript levels 10 to 30 fold higher than wild type . This result confirms that the decrease in bioluminescence observed in the dark LuxN mutants is the direct result of an alteration in signaling through the LuxN quorum sensing pathway.

Two possible mechanisms were considered underlying the dark LuxN phenotypes. First a particular mutation could abolish AI 1 binding. If so this type of mutation would cause LuxN to act as a kinase at high cell density in the presence of AI 1. Alternatively a mutation could allow AI 1 binding but disrupt the ability of LuxN to transduce the signal to the cytoplasm. We first determined which LuxN mutant proteins could bind AI 1 by measuring the AI 1 dose response of each LuxN missense mutant. For this strain HLS253 luxMN luxPQ luxS was used. HLS253 is constitutively bright because the luxN and luxPQ genes encoding the quorum sensing receptors have been deleted. Also HLS253 does not produce AI 1 or AI 2 due to the luxM and luxS deletions respectively. Introduction of a wild type copy of luxN into HLS253 confers a dark phenotype because in the absence of AI 1 LuxN acts as a constitutive kinase. However addition of exogenous AI 1 to HLS253 harboring a wild type copy of luxN induces bioluminescence. Introduction of a luxN mutant encoding a LuxN protein incapable of binding AI 1 or incapable of signaling the AI 1 binding event to the cytoplasm will confer a dark phenotype to HLS253. And such defects will cause the LuxN proteins to remain as kinases even in the presence of AI 1. By contrast if a particular LuxN mutant is introduced that is capable of binding AI 1 even with lower affinity than wild type LuxN these LuxN proteins will switch to phosphatase activity following the addition of sufficient AI 1 and bioluminescence will be induced.

To determine AI 1 ECvalues wild type LuxN and each LuxN mutant were assayed for response to AI 1 at concentrations ranging from 24 pM to 500 M. A subset of the dose response curves is shown in and the remainder of the ECdata is provided in Table 1. The ECfor wild type LuxN binding to AI 1 is 23 nM. The control mutants LuxN L138A and LuxN E154Q as expected have ECvalues of 30 nM and 55 nM respectively similar to wild type LuxN Table 1 . Many of the LuxN mutants have drastically increased ECvalues Table 1 . For example LuxN I153F F155A F162A T206A and S232A have ECvalues of 130 nM 580 nM 93 M 310 nM and 400 nM respectively . In five cases LuxN L166R F202A S205P P226T and E233A the mutants conferred a dark phenotype to even at 500 M AI 1 and therefore ECvalues were unable to be assigned. Nonetheless we successfully determined the AI 1 ECvalues for 25 of the 30 LuxN mutants that conferred a dark phenotype. We conclude that LuxN mutant proteins that produce measurable ECvalues albeit higher than wild type can bind AI 1 at least with some capacity.

To probe the LuxN AI 1 interaction further small molecules were identified that interfere with quorum sensing by disrupting the binding of AI 1 to LuxN. To do this a high throughput chemical screen was carried out using the chemicals collection of the Broad Institute Massachussetts USA which identified small molecules that specifically antagonize LuxN signaling in . The strain JMH624 luxPQ luxM which lacks the AI 2 receptor LuxPQ as well as the AI 1 synthase LuxM was used for the antagonist screen. JMH624 is dark because there is no AI 2 receptor and the lack of AI 1 causes LuxN to act as a kinase . However following exogenous addition of 20 nM AI 1 bioluminescence is induced because LuxN switches to phosphatase mode. Potential antagonist molecules were tested for the ability to reduce bioluminescence of JMH624 in the presence of 20 nM AI 1. To eliminate molecules causing general toxicity and those that interfere with luciferase or other downstream components of the quorum sensing bioluminescence pathway a second screen was carried out using a luxN luxS control strain JMH610JMH610 lacks the AI 1 receptor LuxN and the AI 2 synthase LuxS. In this case because of the lack of AI 2 LuxQ acts as a kinase and JMH610 is dark. However following exogenous addition of AI 2 bioluminescence is induced because LuxQ switches to phosphatase mode . Any molecule that reduced bioluminescence in both JMH610 in the presence of AI 2 and JMH624 in the presence of AI 1 was eliminated from further analysis. Approximately 35 000 low molecular weight compounds were screened for specific inhibition of bioluminescence through the LuxN quorum sensing pathway 45 molecules were selected for further analysis and a representative subset of these molecules with varying levels of antagonistic activity is shown in . For example molecule C450 0730 has an ICvalue of 2.7 M while a weaker antagonist 3578 0898 has an ICof 62.3 M. Interestingly the molecular cores of two of the strongest LuxN antagonists C450 0730 and C646 0078 are very similar . A larger subset of these molecules is shown in .

It was not initially known whether the potent LuxN antagonist C450 0730 was competing for the LuxN AI 1 binding site. To examine this AI 1 ECvalues were determined in the presence of 0 M 1 M and 10 M C450 0730. Our rational is that if C450 0730 competes with AI 1 for binding the AI 1 ECvalue should increase with increasing concentrations of C450 0730. Indeed this is the case as the AI 1 ECvalues are 23 nM 76 nM and 376 nM at 0 M 1 M and 10 M C450 0730 respectively . Indeed the AI 1 dose response curves at these three C450 0730 concentrations can be collapsed onto a single curve consistent with competitive inhibition and Experimental Procedures . The principal underlying the data collapse is that there is a fixed albeit initially unknown quantitative relation between measured bioluminescence and the free energy difference between the active and inactive configurations of LuxN Keymer et al. 2006 . Therefore all the dose response curves should reproduce this same relation i.e. the curves should collapse when bioluminescence is plotted versus free energy difference. However to plot the data this way it is necessary to know how to relate ligand concentrations to free energy differences which means that it is necessary to know the ligand dissociation constants Kfor both the active and inactive configurations of LuxN. In practice we iteratively improve our estimates for Kvalues by attempting to collapse the dose response curves and infer the true values from the best data collapse. This is a reliable procedure here since the dose response curves contain more data than the number of unknown Kvalues. A major benefit of collapsing the data in this way is that it allows us to deduce the state dependent Kvalues for LuxN from the in vivo data in the phosphatase off state K 1 nM and in the kinase on state K 500 nM.

We had reasoned that the dark phenotypes of our LuxN mutants could stem from i a defect in the ability to bind AI 1 ii a bias favoring the kinase state iii a defect in signaling or iv some combination of the above. The method of data collapse provides a powerful tool to distinguish among these possibilities. For example consider the case of the mutant LuxN F163A which has an AI 1 ECvalue 378 fold higher than that of wild type LuxN and for which dose response curves were obtained in the presence of 0 M 1 M and 10 M of the antagonist C450 0730. First we were able to collapse the three antagonist dose response curves using the identical Kas we used to collapse the wild type LuxN data indicating that LuxN F163A is not defective in its ability to bind AI 1 eliminating possibility i . Second the LuxN F163A data could all be collapsed onto the wild type LuxN antagonist curves simply by adjusting the free energy bias between the kinase on and phosphatase off states . This analysis allows us to conclude that LuxN F163A has an increased AI 1 ECvalue exclusively because it has an altered free energy bias that favors the kinase on state establishing that possibility ii accounts for the dark phenotype of this mutant. Similar analysis applied to our other dark mutants reveals examples of the different possibilities and allows us to deduce and quantify the origins of the dark phenotypes.

To better understand the mechanism of C450 0730 interaction with LuxN a suppressor screen was performed to identify LuxN mutants no longer antagonized by C450 0730. Using error prone PCR 2 000 mutants in the luxN N terminal region were generated and conjugated into the luxMN luxPQ luxS strain HLS253 and arrayed in 96 well micro titer plates. As mentioned HLS253 is constitutively bright due to the absence of the quorum sensing receptors LuxN and LuxPQ and both autoinducer synthases LuxM and LuxS. To verify our strategy a wild type luxN control plasmid was also conjugated into HLS253 which conferred a dark phenotype because wild type LuxN is a kinase in the absence of AI L Bioluminescence is restored to HLS253 containing wild type luxN by the exogenous addition of 100 nM AI 1. We found that 800 nM C450 0730 was required to inhibit bioluminescence of HLS253 carrying wild type luxN in the presence of 100 nM AI 1. The luxN mutant library was screened in the presence of 100 nM AI 1 and 800 nM C450 0730 for luxN alleles that enabled bioluminescence in HLS253. To eliminate luxN null mutants the luxN mutant library was also screened in HLS253 in the absence of both AI 1 and C450 0730. The luxN alleles that conferred a bright phenotype in the absence of AI 1 were not examined further. Five LuxN mutant strains LRS112 LRS311 LRS129 LRS147 and LRS1511 Table 2 displayed dark phenotypes in the absence of AI 1 and C450 0730 but were bright in the simultaneous presence of AI 1 and C450 0730 suggesting that these LuxN proteins were no longer antagonized by C450 0730. The luxN mutations were sequenced to identify the alleles Table 2 . Interestingly LuxN G271D was identified twice. From here forward this class of suppressor mutants is referred to as LuxN .

We speculated that the LuxN mutants could have increased AI 1 sensitivity or decreased C450 0730 binding ability. To distinguish between these two possibilities the LuxN AI 1 ECvalues were determined . As a reference the dark mutant LuxN F163A is also included in . The ECvalue of wild type LuxN is 23 nM while LuxN S184N is 11 nM LuxN I209F is 39 nM LuxN R245L is 4.8 nM and LuxN G271D is 3.7 nM Table 1 . Interestingly three of the four LuxN mutants LuxN S184N R245L and G271D show increased sensitivity to AI 1 suggesting that these alleles circumvent C450 0730 antagonism through increased AI 1 binding or signaling or via a bias to the phosphatase state of LuxN see Discussion . However LuxN I209F responded more like wild type to AI 1 as indicated by an AI 1 ECvalue of 39 nM Table 1 .

In the reciprocal experiment we determined the ability of C450 0730 to antagonize the LuxN mutants. C450 0730 ICvalues were measured by titrating C450 0730 from 0.64 nM to 50 M while keeping the AI 1 concentration constant at 10 nM. The C450 0730 concentration required to inhibit LuxN G271D R245L and S184N was similar to that required to inhibit wild type LuxN indicating that the observed resistance to C450 0730 was indeed due to increased sensitivity to AI 1. However a 5 fold higher concentration of C450 0730 was required to antagonize LuxN I209F. Therefore the LuxN I209F mutation appears to affect C450 0730 binding. Because 1209 is located within our proposed AI 1 binding site in triangle and because it also affects C450 0730 antagonistic activity we propose that C450 0730 could compete for the AI 1 binding site of LuxN. This conclusion is strongly supported by the good data collapse in which is based on competitive inhibition by C450 0730.

For chemotaxis receptors in adaptive methylation of specific cytoplasmic residues is known to additively bias receptors toward a kinase active state. By analogy we wondered whether some of our single residue mutations might bias LuxN toward kinase or phosphatase states in an additive manner. To determine whether the LuxN G271D R245L and S184N mutants which have lower than wild type AI 1 ECvalues are biased toward the phosphatase state these mutations were engineered into the LuxN F163A mutant to test if they could shift the high ECof LuxN F163A back toward a low EC. As a reminder the F163A LuxN mutation has an increased AI 1 ECvalue of 8.7 M as compared to 23 nM for wild type LuxN therefore it requires approximately 378 times more AI 1 to switch LuxN F163A into the phosphatase mode than the amount of AI 1 required to switch wild type LuxN. A double mutant LuxN F163A R245L a triple mutant LuxN F163A R245L S184N and a quadruple mutant LuxN F163A R245L S184N G271D of LuxN were tested for their ability to respond to AI 1 . The incorporation of each LuxN mutation into the context of the F163A mutation successively decreased the AI 1 ECvalue approximately 10 fold while the quadruple mutant had a constitutively bright phenotype Table 1 . From this analysis we inferred that the LuxN mutations are additive in their ability to bias LuxN toward the phosphatase mode.

LuxN is the founding member of an increasingly large family of membrane bound homoserine lactone autoinducer binding proteins. In this receptor family autoinducer binding information is transduced to a DNA binding protein by phosphorylation. There are two quorum sensing mechanisms for homoserine lactone autoinducer detection. First through membrane bound receptors homologous to s LuxN . Second by cytoplasmic LuxR type proteins such as CviR from in which binding of the homoserine lactone signal allows the LuxR type receptor protein to fold and bind DNA to alter transcription .

After having successfully screened for antagonists of LuxN the membrane bound homoserine lactone receptor we tested whether these same antagonists could antagonize a cytoplasmic LuxR type homoserine lactone receptor. We used CviR because inhibition results in loss of purple pigment production . Five of the LuxN antagonists greatly inhibited the cytoplasmic CviR receptor. These data show that these molecules work on both the outside and the inside of the bacterial cell.

Molecule 4606 4237 allows the CviR protein to fold and bind DNA exactly as does the endogenous homoserine lactone ligand. However the CviR 4606 4237 complex cannot activate transcription.

The luxN gene was amplified from wild type BB120 by PCR and cloned into vector pFED343 at the EcoRI and NcoI sites making pLS1001. Mutagenesis of the first 950 bases of luxN was performed using the error prone PCR kit Genemorph II EZclone Stratagene . Resulting mutations were cloned into vector pFED343. The luxN mutant library was conjugated into luxN luxPQ strain JMH625. Ex conjugates were selected on LM medium agar supplemented with Cm. Approximately 30 000 mutants were screened for reduced bioluminescence. Plasmids from dark mutants were isolated and backcrossed into V JMH625 to confirm phenotypes. The luxN genes were sequenced and all mutations were engineered independently using Quikchange site directed mutagenesis Stratagene . All single luxN mutant constructs were conjugated into JMH625 to verify the phenotypes.

To construct the luxMN luxPQ luxS mutant strain HLS253 the luxMN operon was deleted from strain FED119 Neiditch M. B. et al. 2006 . Cell 126 1095 1108 . Specifically cosmid pBB1754 carrying luxMN was modified by deleting DNA specifying the entire luxMN open reading frame. The resulting plasmid p1754 luxMN was introduced into FED119 and the deletion transferred to the chromosome to generate strain HLS253.

AI 1 dose response curves were generated in strain HLS253 containing a vector with wild type luxN or one of the luxN mutants. strains were grown overnight in LM medium containing Cm and diluted 1 10000 in AB medium plus Cm and 0.5 mM IPTG in triplicate in 96 well microtiter plates. AI 1 was added at either 100 M or 500 M and serial 4 fold dilutions were made to final AI 1 concentrations of 24 pM and 119 pM respectively. The cultures were allowed to grow to stationary phase at which time bioluminescence and optical density were measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision plate reader.

Wild type and luxN mutant strains were grown in LM medium in triplicate to an ODof 1.0 after which cell pellets were isolated and flash frozen using liquid nitrogen. Pellets were stored at 80 C. prior to RNA isolation. RNA was isolated and treated with DNase using the Ribo Pure Bacteria kit Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. . RNA was quantified and 1 g of RNA was converted to cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . Quantitative real time PCR analysis was performed with primers for qrr4 and hfq where hfq served as an internal control Tu and Bassler 2007 .

The strains JMH624 and JMH610 were grown overnight in AB medium and diluted 1 100 prior to the exogenous addition of either 20 nM AI 1 or 20 nM AI 2 respectively. The diluted cultures were dispensed into 384 well micro titer plates and the potential antagonist molecules were added to each well. Each micro titer plate was duplicated to eliminate variance. The 35 000 molecule library was supplied by the Broad Institute and the Initiative for Chemical Genetics Cambridge Mass. . Antagonist activity was measured as a function of bioluminescence on a PerkinElmer Envision plate reader.

The luxN mutant library was conjugated into strain HLS253 and selected on LM containing Cm. Colonies were inoculated into 96 well micro titer plates containing LM broth and Cm and grown at 30 C. with aeration to stationary phase. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20 and the library was stored at 80 C. Frozen stocks were partially thawed and used to inoculate duplicate 96 well micro titer plates containing AB medium with Cm and IPTG. To one plate 100 nM AI 1 and 800 nM antagonist C450 0730 was added while the duplicate control plate had neither AI 1 nor C450 0730 added. The plates were incubated at 30 C. with aeration until the cultures reached stationary phase at which time bioluminescence was measured and the two plates compared. Strains from wells that produced light in the AI 1 C450 0730 plates but did not produce light in the control plates no AI 1 no C450 0730 were analyzed further. The luxN mutant plasmids were sequenced to determine the mutations responsible for the observed phenotypes and the mutations were reengineered using Quikchange site directed mutagenesis Stratagene La Jolla Calif. .

In equilibrium the probability for a LuxN to be active as a kinase is determined by the free energy difference between its kinase on and phosphatase off states according to

To test for competitive binding of C450 0730 to LuxN we assume that bioluminescence is some unknown function of the fraction of LuxN proteins that are active as kinases i.e. bioluminescence is a function of . We therefore plot bioluminescence as a function of as given in Eq. 2 and search for the values of Kthat collapse all of our data onto a single curve. The results are shown in .

To quantitatively test whether LuxN mutations that shift AI 1 ECvalues can be attributed to changes in the bias and or the AI 1 binding affinities we attempted to collapse the AI 1 dose response curves for each mutant onto the wild type curve using and in some cases Kas fitting parameters. The collapse was satisfactory for many but not all cases as discussed in the text.
