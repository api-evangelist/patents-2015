This application is a continuation in part CIP of application Ser. No. 14 456 143 filed on Aug. 11 2014 with claiming foreign priority of TW103116325.

This application claims additional priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 a on Patent Application No. 104104173 filed in Taiwan R.O.C. on Feb. 6 2015. The prior applications are herewith incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to a cloud technology applied to a mobile communications device and more particularly to a message transmission system and method for a structure of a plurality of organizations.

Nowadays there are a great number of systems that use a cloud technology on a mobile communications device to provide message exchange for associations or enterprise organizations however the prior art still has lots of deficiencies making it impossible to meet operational demands of the associations or enterprise organizations for message exchange.

ROC Patent Application No. 092135402 entitled AUTHENTICATION AND MESSAGE ENCRYPTION METHOD FOR PUSH TECHNOLOGY discloses an authentication and message encryption method for a PUSH technology which uses an encrypted key technology for authentication and message encryption where a PUSH initiator a PUSH proxy gateway and a PUSH client jointly participate in generation of a session key that is the three separately contribute random numbers generated by the three for use as parameters for generating the session key. Moreover finally only the PUSH initiator and the PUSH client separately generate a same shared encryption decryption key but the PUSH proxy gateway cannot generate the encryption decryption key by itself so as to improve security of the key and reduce burden of the PUSH client for exponential operations. The technical problem actually solved by the first prior art is regardless of a GSM or GPRS its micro cellular systems do not have a mechanism ensuring that messages can be securely transmitted between a server and a user . . . when a private message is transmitted in a wireless network it is possible that network operators intercept private data of the user and this is undoubtedly a major threat to security and privacy of the user . . . see paragraph 0005 of the specification thereof . The technical effect produced by the first prior art is allow various components in application environments of the PUSH technology to be capable of performing two way authentication in pairs so as to improve information security .

ROC Patent Application No. 100131952 entitled METHOD FOR RECEIVING MESSAGE discloses a method for receiving a message which is applicable to an electronic device. The method includes receiving a message upon receipt of the message establishing a connection to a server according to a network address built in an electronic device obtaining a multimedia file from the server and downloading and playing the multimedia file. The technical problem actually solved by the second prior art is a short message presentation image is also very simple and only displays content of a short message and provides simple operation functions such as short message editing. For users who often contact others by using a short message text message in addition to the focus on a prompt function the user also thinks highly of a rich short message interface see paragraph 0002 of the specification thereof . The technical effect produced by the second prior art is download a multimedia file through a message .

ROC Patent Application No. 091117503 entitled CHANNEL SUBSCRIPTION AND PUSH SYSTEM AND METHOD discloses a channel subscription and push system and method. A user is connected to a WML server by means of a mobile communications device so as to subscribe to a channel. The WML server generates a subscription table and encodes the subscription table into SS DTD. An SQL server receives and stores the SS DTD and determines whether information about the channel is updated according to the SS DTD. If yes the SQL server sends an update message to a push server and the push server receives the update message and pushes the update message to the mobile communications device. The mobile communications device receives the update message and the user is connected to the WML server by means of the mobile communications device according to the update message so as to download latest information. The technical problem actually solved by the third prior art is 1. The user must make an active query to find whether previously subscribed information is updated resulting in that the user cannot know the latest information in real time. 2. Information received by the user is often not classified organized or managed so that it is quite a disorder for the user to read. 3. Generally even if a mobile communications device obtains the subscribed information without classification organization and management it is impossible to implement a function of simultaneously subscribing to multiple pieces of information for the user see the final paragraph in Background of the Invention of the specification thereof . The technical effect produced by the third prior art is once the information about the channel is updated a user can be notified by using a push technology so that the user can immediately learn the latest information. Moreover information about channels received by the user is classified organized and managed making it easy for the user to read .

ROC Patent Application No. 097100603 entitled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR CORRELATION OF MOBILE CHANNEL SUBSCRIPTION WITH DELIVERY CONTENT discloses a method and system for establishing a delivery content for channel subscription in a mobile network and the following steps are included establishing a subscription between a mobile device in the mobile network and a content provider and transferring a delivery content to a delivery server. The technical problem actually solved by the fourth prior art is . . . Other alternatives include SMS based push and broadcast or community broadcast. In a case of broadcast delivery cannot be customized to the needs of a particular user or the capabilities of a particular device. The systems therefore have no intelligence associated with them see paragraph 0005 of the specification thereof . The technical effect produced by the fourth prior art is provide a subscription model and topology in which subscription information and a delivery content are both transferred to a delivery server or a content provider .

ROC Patent Application No. 101115678 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ESTABLISHING APPLICATION FOR MOBILE COMPUTING DEVICE discloses a system and method for establishing an application for a mobile computing device which enables a user to access an operating platform having a user interface by using a browser for establishing an application for a mobile computing device including providing the user interface which includes a combination of multilayered data setup pages and is configured to enable the user to be capable of customize displaying content of the application for a mobile computing device through a click selection operation. The technical problem actually solved by the fifth prior art is a large amount of design and planning are required for make and complete an App from an idea and therefore for an ordinary user it is not an easy task to write an App see paragraph 0003 of the specification thereof . The technical effect produced by the fifth prior art is provide a convenient platform for establishing an application executable by a mobile computing device and a user can easily complete data structure definition and layout setting thereof of the application commonly known as an App for the mobile computing device only through a click selection .

In the sixth prior art that a software development manufacturer makes a customized message transmission system for a particular enterprise according to demands where the system is arranged in a self built equipment room of the enterprise or co location Internet Data Center and a dedicated application that is an App installed on a mobile communications device used by a member that is a person from the enterprise is also developed in a customized manner for access to a server of the message transmission system. In terms of a deployment mode the system in the sixth prior art is a private cloud deployment mode and when n enterprises is deployed with such a private cloud there must be n sets one set refers to a mainstream platform including all mobile communications devices of corresponding applications and n interfaces because server IPs of respective private clouds are different login interfaces thereof must be different . The technical problem actually solved by the sixth prior art is deployment of a private cloud mode may allow enterprises to fully control system information security issues and the dedicated application may avoid members to be interfered with by external persons the so called the dedicated application may avoid members to be interfered with by external persons means that the customized system must be accessed with the dedicated application and only members of the organization have authorities to use it while relatives and friends of the members cannot transmit messages to them with other applications. The technical effect produced by the sixth prior art is deploy a message transmission system in a private cloud mode and use a dedicated application . In terms of a software development manufacturer customized development and deployment of a message transmission system in a private cloud mode and application for an individual association or enterprise organization is quite time consuming laborious and costly and it is also difficult to upgrade software in the future.

In the seventh prior art that a mobile communications device and a push technology are used in a public cloud deployment mode to provide person to person message exchange services or message exchange services inside a single level organization for example Line developed by the South Korean company NHN s subsidiary in Japan Line Corporation and WeChat application and its back end systems developed by Tencent Inc in China. The biggest problem of the seventh prior art is that protection over privacy is not thorough enough. For example a Member A and a Member B who know each other join such a system at the same time it is assumed that they both join the same system Line or WeChat at the same time however for some reasons the Member A is reluctant to let the Member B know that he uses the same application and system so as to avoid being added to the friend list by the Member B . However the seventh prior art allows members in different organizations to search for a member in a database by using a mobile phone number or Email that is the Member B can easily find the Member A in the database of the system by using the mobile phone number or Email of the Member A . In addition the member account that is user ID number used in the seventh prior art is unique and no repetitive account exists even for members in different organizations and in different countries. The technical problem actually solved by the seventh prior art is message content transmitted by the conventional SMS is not diversified enough incapable of shortening the communication distance in a more vivid and lively manner . The technical effect produced by the seventh prior art is deploy a message transmission system in a public cloud mode provide person to person message exchange services or message exchange services inside a single level organization and make message images more vivid and lively .

The prior art in the foregoing does not solve problems such as associations or enterprise organizations require a flexible multi level structure a single cloud system is used to serve a large number of associations or enterprise organizations a single App and a single interface are used to access a single cloud system a single App and a single interface are used to access a hybrid cloud system and members in different organizations must be hidden from each other and mobile phone numbers or Emails of members cannot be found by others outside an organization and the technical means used and the technical effects produced are also irrelevant to a message transmission system having a structure of a plurality of organizations . Therefore it is indeed necessary to propose a mobile communications device cloud system suitable for associations and enterprise organizations to transmit messages and having a multi level structure to facilitate members under each association and enterprise organization use a single App and a single interface to directly access services.

In view of this the present invention proposes a message transmission system having a structure of a plurality of organizations and method which allow a member to establish a connection to a single interface by using a single App to access a single cloud message transmission system having a structure of a plurality of organizations.

The detailed features and advantages of the present invention are described below in detail through the following embodiments the content of the detailed description is sufficient for persons skilled in the art to understand the technical content of the present invention and to implement the present invention accordingly. Based on the content of the specification the claims and the drawings persons skilled in the art can easily understand the relevant objectives and advantages of the present invention.

In the message transmission system of the present invention a single member may join more than two organizations at the same time and own organization IDs corresponding to the organizations. For example a member joins a sports loving society a charity society and an enterprise at the same time therefore the member owns three different organization IDs to correspond to the organizations respectively. Once the member joins an organization and member information of the member the organization ID of the organization and the account and the password of the member is registered in the database of the present invention the member can enter a search system of the organization to find other members of the organization.

The server includes the following serving modules group a first network communication module a login authentication module an account management module an authority management module and a bulletin board module . The first network communication module is used for establishing a network connection of the TCP protocol including socket and Websocket connections the HTTP protocol or the HTTPS protocol to a second network communication module of the mobile communications device of the client. The login authentication module receives an organization ID an account and a password uploaded by a member by using the mobile communications device and then authenticates the organization ID the account and the password with the organization ID the account and the password corresponding to the member in the database . The account management module sets a level of the organization corresponding to the organization ID and addition change and deletion of the account of the member in the database according to the organization ID of the organization. The authority management module sets an authority of the level of the organization corresponding to the organization ID and authorities of respective member accounts according to the organization ID input when an administrator having a setting authority logs in and similarly the administrator must log in to the database using an organization ID of the administrator and an account and a password of the administrator. The bulletin board module receives an uploaded message and writes the message into the database so as to generate a message receiver list that is push IDs of selected members by performing a mapping work according to a receiver that is a selected member in an organization address book that is set by the message and the message of such a type is a message delivered to the staff of an organization from top to down or a level in the organization for example an announcement message in a company. Content of the message may include a text an image a video audio a file among other types and the so called receiver that is set may be a specific member a level of a specific organization a specific group list or all members in an organization the message receiver list includes push IDs instead of mobile phone numbers and one push ID corresponds to a receiving device that is the mobile communications device of one member. The server and the database are not limited to being deployed on a specific number of devices for example they both may be deployed on a same device or they both may be separately deployed on cluster structured devices.

In some embodiments referring to the serving modules group further include a VoIP Voice over Internet Protocol module which provides a voice call function using a communication protocol of the VoIP a video conference module which provides a video conference call function using a communication protocol e.g. SIP or H.323 a media module which provides a playing and controlling function for an audio or a video a report module which issues reads and manages a message for problem notice or warning notice a voting module which provides an electronic balloting and surveying function a member positioning module which provides a position feedback function for returning a geographic location information of the member a working plan module provides a to do lists or work assignment function a chat room module provides a real time chatting function for one to one chat room or many to many group chat room a news feed module which issues displays and manages news feed a file sharing module which provides a file sharing function supporting various file formats a keyword filtering module which provides setting warning or intercepting functions for a particular keyword an album module which provides an album function for auto integrating photographs in the news feed or the chat room an approval module which provides an approval function of a hierarchical form a watermarking module which adds a watermarking to a particular file according to the news feed of different user an official account module which provides the enterprise official accounts to issue official news etc. In an embodiment the serving modules enabled for the members to access in each organization are managed in parameters configuring manner. Different organization can have different parameters configurations for enabling a part of the serving modules or all of them to the members. That is the enabled serving module accessed by the members in each organization depends on an access module parameter configuration related to each organization in the cloud . The access module parameter configuration is stored in the server or the database . For example an Organization A is the highest level of paid enterprise and thus the parameters of the Organization A in the access module parameter configuration represent the members in the Organization A can access all serving modules. An Organization B is the second level of paid enterprise and thus the parameters of the Organization B in the access module parameter configuration represent the members in the Organization B can access a majority of serving modules. An Organization C is the free trial account and thus the parameters of the Organization C in the access module parameter configuration represent the members in the Organization C can only access the fundamental serving modules. The access module parameter configuration details and lists all enabled serving modules.

The push gateway generates a push notification according to the partial or complete content of the message and the push ID on the message receiver list and sends the push notification through an external push host for example MPNS GCM and APNS . The push notification includes a unique push notification number or at least being unique inside a searchable query range of recent data . The so called partial or complete content of the message of the push notification depends on the length of the content of the message. By using APNS as an example for description the allowable maximum length of the content payload of the message is 256 Bytes. When content of a message is less than 256 Bytes a push notification of the message includes complete content of the message when content of a message is more than 256 Bytes a push notification of the message only includes partial content of the message that is the part of first 256 Bytes .

The mobile communications device for example a smart phone or tablet computer on which an iOS Android or Windows Phone operating system runs executes an application also known as an App . The application includes a second network communication module a login module a data access module a message input module and a screen refreshing module . The second network communication module is used for establishing a network connection of the TCP protocol the HTTP protocol or the HTTPS protocol to the first network communication module of the server . The login module receives an organization ID an account and a password of a user that is a member and uploads the organization ID the account and the password to the server . The data access module triggers the second network communication module to establish the network connection TCP protocol HTTP protocol or HTTPS protocol to the first network communication module of the server upon receipt of the push notification and downloads the complete content of the message corresponding to the push notification number from the server . According to an embodiment of the present invention the network connection established by the second network communication module to the first network communication module uses the TCP protocol or the Websocket protocol which belongs to the TCP protocol but a handshake request sent by the client is in an HTTP form and the data access module in this embodiment directly downloads the message. According to another embodiment of the present invention the network connection established by the second network communication module to the first network communication module uses the HTTP protocol or the HTTPS protocol and the data access module in this embodiment downloads the message by using a polling technology. The message input module is used for inputting a message to be transmitted and setting at least one receiver a method for setting the receiver is selecting a specific member a level of a specific organization a specific group list or all members in the organization from an organization address book. The so called organization address book is edited by an administrator having an authority for example a MIS person while other members only can view or use but cannot edit the organization address book. The so called specific group list is also edited by an administrator having an authority for example a first level director of all units levels in an organization a second level director of all units levels in the organization a basic level person of all units levels in the organization . . . and the like. Receivers of such a type are originally distributed into all units levels and therefore it is necessary to manually make them into a specific group list for use. The screen refreshing module refreshes a screen of the mobile communications device according to the downloaded push notification or message and displays the up to date information on the screen.

It is described is foregoing that a same member may join many different organizations at the same time and own organization IDs of the organizations. It is assumed that a member has joined three different organizations and three accounts have all been authenticated one step in an account registration process for example authentication using an Email or authentication using a mobile phone number after the member logs in all notification messages of the three organizations can be received in the same application . If the member no longer wants to receive notification messages from one organization the member can turn off notifications from the organization in setting of the organization or directly logs out from the organization.

In an organization having a plurality of levels for example the Organization A and the Organization C each level has an administrator having a setting authority and in an enterprise organization the top level general administrator is a MIS person of the company while administrators at all levels are heads of units for example a business group manager department head section chief leader . . . and so on . The authority of the administrator is generally granted when a new organization and a new account of the administrator is added or may also be granted after a new account is added. The present invention uses a Namespace data structure technology to set organization IDs all data of organizations is completely independent from outside and even if accounts that is accounts of members under each organization use the same code for example employee numbers 0001 0002 0003 . . . and so on a conflict problem of identical accounts does not exist therefore it is more flexible when each organization sets account codes for members under the organization without needing to worry about the problem that the same account has been occupied by members in other organizations. In addition even if a number of different organizations use mobile phone numbers or Emails of members as accounts or filled in contact information interferences from an external person are avoided as long as in one organization mobile phone numbers or Emails of members under other organizations cannot be searched. Inside an organization all members in the organization can be searched by using mobile phone numbers Emails or keywords and search inside an organization belongs to the prior art which therefore is not repeated herein. Different organizations are separated by using organization IDs and namespace data structures so that an external person cannot search members inside the organizations which is another main technical feature of the present invention. In other words in the architecture of the present invention identification of each member is based on a combination of an organization identifier an organization identity organization ID and a member account a member identity member ID which is a double layer ID structure which is different from a single layer ID single account structure in the past. The prior art only uses a single layer ID structure for identification and therefore each ID must be unique. The present invention performs identification login authentication in a manner of double IDs of an organization ID and a member account the first layer ID has a search concealment function organizational independence and the second layer ID has an identification function inside an organization. Therefore member accounts of different members in different organizations may be same without conflicting with each other.

The deployment of the hybrid cloud mode has some customized operations that is split and arrangement of serving modules due to demands of enterprise customers but is different from the sixth prior art in that the client does not need to access the private cloud by using a conventional dedicated application and instead in the hybrid cloud mode of the present invention the private cloud is accessed by using the same application the reason for which has been stated above that is the login interface is still in the public cloud that is the login authentication module . In other words a service provider no longer needs to customize dedicated applications for different enterprise customers and serving all enterprise customers by using a single application can significantly save the time required to release an App simplify the process and save manual labor for example a stringent review process is required for release in AppStore of Apple . Such a mode of accessing a public cloud and a hybrid cloud by using a single interface and a single application that is an App is another main technical feature of the present invention.

In another embodiment before performing the redirection to the private cloud an authenticating step by using a digital certificate an electric certificate to check the identity of the private cloud and avoid a malicious fake server stealing data. In this embodiment when setting the private cloud i.e. registering the private cloud in the public cloud in the first place the administrator of the private cloud needs to input the stored path of the digital certificate in the private cloud that is issued by the certificate authority CA and then the certificate authentication center performs the verification of certification for the digital certificate. The digital certificate is applied from the CA and the verification of certification is performed by using API of the certificate authentication center both belong to the prior art and therefore are not explained herein. After the verification of certification has succeeded the IP address of the private cloud and the digital certificate thereof are recorded into the serving module location information. After the mobile communications device of a certain user performs the login authentication and before the redirection is performed to the private cloud the login authentication module of the public cloud performs login authentication based on the IP address and the digital certificate recorded in the serving module location information. In the embodiment the token technology is applied. During the token is valid e.g. within 24 hours after first performing the login authentication the token is used directly instead of the authenticating step.

Step S Execute an application of the present invention on the first mobile communications device. The first mobile communications device is a mobile communications device of the present invention for example a smart phone iPhone5S from Apple and it is assumed that a user of the first mobile communications device is a first member of an Organization A .

Step S The first mobile communications device establishes a network connection to the server of a public cloud . After the application is executed a second network communication module of the application establishes a network connection of the TCP protocol including socket and websocket connections the HTTP protocol or the HTTPS that is HTTP over SSL protocol to the first network communication module of the server of the public cloud .

Step S Upload an organization ID a first account and a first password for login authentication. The first member uses the application of the first mobile communications device to input the organization ID the first account and the first password where the organization ID represents the Organization A to which the first member belongs. Next the first mobile communications device uploads the organization ID the first account and the first password to the server of the public cloud and the login authentication module of the public cloud performs login authentication.

Step S Receive an instruction corresponding to a serving module and perform redirection according to the serving module location information. When the application of the first mobile communications device receives an instruction corresponding to a serving module the system performs redirection on the application of the first mobile communications device according to the serving module location information stored in the public cloud . For example the first member selects a bulletin board function the serving module corresponding to the selection instruction is a bulletin board module in the application in this case the system performs redirection on the application according to an IP address of the bulletin board module arranged in a private cloud recorded in the serving module location information and then the application directly accesses the bulletin board module of the server of the private cloud .

Step S Input a message to be announced and specify at least one receiver. The first member uses a message input module of the application of the first mobile communications device to input a message to be announced and specify at least one receiver to which the message is announced where a method for specifying the receiver is selecting a specific member a level of a specific organization a specific group list or information about all members of the organization from an organization address book. In this example it is assumed that a receiver selected by the first member from the organization address book includes a second member.

Step S Establish a network connection to the server and upload the message. When the network connection established by the second network communication module to the first network communication module in Step S uses the TCP protocol in this step the message can be directly uploaded to the bulletin board module . When the network connection established in Step S uses the HTTP protocol or the HTTPS protocol in this step the second network communication module first needs to reestablish a network connection of the HTTP protocol or the HTTPS protocol to the first network communication module and then upload the message to the bulletin board module .

Step S The server generates a message receiver list. The bulletin board module of the server generates a message receiver list according to the receiver that is set by the message where the message receiver list includes push IDs and the message receiver list at least includes one push ID.

Step S The server transmits partial or complete content of the message and the message receiver list to the push gateway .

Step S The push gateway generates a push notification. The push gateway generates the push notification according to the partial or complete content of the message and the push ID on the message receiver list.

Step S Send the push notification through the external push host where the push notification includes a unique push notification number and the external push host is for example MPNS GCM or APNS.

Step S The second mobile communications device receives the push notification. The second mobile communications device is the mobile communications device of the present invention for example a smart phone HTC One X and it is assumed that a user of the second mobile communications device is the second member of the Organization A .

Step S The second mobile communications device establishes a network connection to the server of the public cloud . After the application is executed the second network communication module of the application establishes a network connection of the TCP protocol the HTTP protocol or the HTTPS protocol to the first network communication module of the server of the public cloud .

Step S Upload an organization ID a second account and a second password for login authentication. The second member uses the application of the second mobile communications device to input an organization ID a second account and a second password where the organization ID represents the Organization A to which the second member belongs and then uploads the organization ID the second account and the second password to the server of the public cloud and the login authentication module of the public cloud performs login authentication.

Step S Receive an instruction corresponding to a serving module and perform redirection according to the serving module location information. When the application of the second mobile communications device receives an instruction corresponding to a serving module the system performs redirection on the application of the second mobile communications device according to the serving module location information stored in the public cloud .

Step S Establish the network connection to the server and download the complete content of the message. When the network connection established by the second network communication module to the first network communication module in Step S uses the TCP protocol in this step the complete content of the message corresponding to the push notification number can be directly downloaded. When the network connection established in Step S uses the HTTP protocol or the HTTPS protocol in this step the second network communication module needs to first reestablish a network connection of the HTTP protocol or HTTPS protocol to the first network communication module and then download the complete content of the message corresponding to the push notification number.
