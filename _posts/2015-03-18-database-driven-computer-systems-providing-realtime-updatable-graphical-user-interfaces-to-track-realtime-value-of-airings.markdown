In some embodiments an advertisement creative is designed to create a consumer response through such channels as phone website postal mail email SMS retail etc. In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention allows to track each response to its trigger creative allowing for the calculation of its real time value at a particular time point.

For example in some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to calculate a net margin per order for every airing after allowing for for example but not limited to the media cost product or service cost adjustments to gross revenue and or all variable operational costs related to the transaction which produced the order and or lead.

In some embodiments a unique airing can be recorded in a database as a record identifying a network or station day of week and local time. In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to for the initial order pledge or lead create a unique Master Transaction Record in a Tagging database including but not limiting to specific elements of the airing to which at least one order or lead has been attributed e.g. network station date day local time creative offer ID and a payment type e.g. single pay multi pay .

In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to account for cases when any or all of the elements that define a broadcast airing are missing by aggregating those airings into one record per day or per week as in a Per Inquiry PI program in which case that PI record represents multiple airings on a single Network and the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to calculate value on the Network level not airing level.

In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to track a life of a particular order or lead e.g. such as each Master Transaction Record by using sub records e.g. submaster records for each and all subsequent transactions relating to that order or lead. In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to track event sub records which can include but are not limited to the following 

For example in some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to continuously recalculate update the value of an airing utilizing a specifically programmed margin module which can draw upon various revenue and cost sources including but not limiting to media data call center data web data and or variable operational data to calculate the net margin resulting from the immediate or future revenue produced by a particular unique airing.

In some embodiments variable operational costs can include but are not limited to cost of goods fulfillment customer service freight out credit card authorization fee returns processing royalty and management fees.

In some embodiments as each of subsequent traceable events occurs for example the dollar value of each of the sub records is utilized by the inventive the margin module to recalculate the net margin of the airing. In some embodiments after an airing s value is determined the value of a network or station which has run multiple airings can be calculated over any period of time where a user selects utilizing a real time updatable graphical user interface a time frame reference to be an airing date not an order date. In some embodiments the net margin calculation at the broadcast airing level forms the foundation for rollups that include but not limited to by network or station daypart day type product offer creative and any combination of these.

In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to allow a user to access various views of this data including but not limited to the following 

In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to calculate an acquisition cost of a customer that was generated by an investment in a specific media and then forecasts the cumulative cash flow from that investment per customer stated in present value terms for a defined period of time based on historical performance of that media investment.

In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to determine the length of time it took to break even on the investment assuming it does taking into account the time value of money. In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to if the investment does not breakeven calculate what percent of the initial investment was recovered in a defined period of time.

In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to continuously calculate in real time the value for each media investment that a marketer makes within an advertising campaign for a product a service or both.

In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to continuously calculate in real time the value of airings via the Direct Response Television DRTV those investments are in individual broadcast airings such as a paid commercial program of 28 30 in length infomercial and or or a commercial message of between one and five minutes in which a marketer makes an offer to the viewer to purchase a product a package of products a service or both by calling a toll free number and or visiting a specific internet address e.g. URL URL encoded 3D barcode etc. . In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to receive data regarding every airing that is tracked for example but not limited to in terms of the TV network station it ran day time calls and orders and revenue it produced. In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to after allowing for the product cost adjustments to gross revenue and all variable operational costs related to the transaction which produced the customer order calculate in rela time a net margin per customer order is for every airing. In some embodiments this figure tells the marketer the amount invested in acquiring a customer through that specific airing of the commercial.

Each customer that has been attributed to coming onto a customer fulfillment database as a result of that specific airing is tagged as such e.g. Mary Smith s purchase of product X has been attributed to the airing of the infomercial for product X on Lifetime on Saturday Jan. 14 2013 at 7 00 AM. In some embodiments the combination of Network Day Time CNBC Saturday 6 00 AM is a key identifier of a specific airing. Many other customers first purchase has been attributed to this same exact airing. Subsequent purchases to the original one that are captured in the database in the month of the original purchase plus the following for example X months e.g. 1 5 12 24 etc. are used to calculate the retention rate and or the average order. In some embodiments the revenue from these subsequent purchases is netted out using a profit margin for each product to arrive at a net margin or contribution . In some embodiments since these subsequent purchases and associated revenue will be realized at a future point in time the time value of money needs to be considered in valuing future revenue.

In some embodiments the present value of future revenue may be calculated using a discount rate for the defined period of time. In some embodiments the exemplary formula for present value equals future value divided by 1 d n where d discount rate and n number of years assuming the discount rate is compounded annually. For example assuming a discount rate of 3 the 12 month contribution future value of 15 000 is divided by 1.03 to arrive at the present value of that contribution or 14 563.

Continuing with the above example in order to generate the 15 000 in future value from 200 acquired customers the company had to invest in acquiring those customers at a cost or negative contribution of 18 000 or 90 per customer. The net present value is equal to the present value of the future revenue less the initial value of the investment. In this example then the net present value of the 18 000 investment is equal to 14 563 less 18 000 or 3 437 or 17.18 per original customer. Continuing further with this example in the next six months another 3 600 is generated by the same 200 customers. The present value of that future revenue is equal to 3 600 1.031.5 or 3 444. In total the present value of the 12 month revenue plus the 6 month revenue equals 18 007 the same as the initial investment. In other words the net present value of the 18 000 original investment in one specific airing after 1.5 years is 7. The 7 is the payback on the investment and the payback period for that investment is said to be 18 months.

In some embodiments the above analysis is done on each individual airing for a specific product and offer in each broadcast month that the product is being advertised. After 12 months of subsequent purchases by the original group of customers that were attributed to a specific airing those results are rolled up or summarized at a network station level providing the user a comparative view of the long term value of the networks stations used in the specific product s campaign. The marketer can use this view to supplement his her evaluation of media buying decisions to either confirm the recommended action or to override a recommended action. For example if the media buyer recommends selling a specific airing or a group of airings on a network but the analytical tool shows that although this network produces an unacceptable initial contribution per order its future value is superior to other networks the user may choose to override that recommendation.

In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to perform airing level valuations based on by daypart by day type weekday vs. weekend by creative by offer by product and any combination of these and other variables carried on the master record data table in a tagging database.

In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to in addition to the mathematical calculations which ascribe a value to each network apply demographic psychographic and geographic data to the consumers that responded to the multiple offers run by multiple advertisers on a specific network station to build a network customer and or a responder profile based on actual buyers and responders that responded to an airing on that network rather than on viewer surveys.

In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention are configured to determine value based on a negotiated rate for a specific DRTV airing and or a negotiated payout per order generated usually by phone only. In some embodiments the inventive computer systems of the present invention account for a scenario when a third party may handle the media buying on the stations running the creative but usually only reports to the marketer the number of orders generated by that media in a day or week and the payment due for those orders based on the payout. That payment is essentially the media cost. In some embodiments since most of the time a marketer does not receive specific airing level data for PI media the aggregated cost orders and revenue for a period of time form the basis for the valuation of that investment in a similar fashion to rolling up airings that aired on the same network.

In some cases the advertiser that uses direct mail to acquire new customers does so by typically renting targeted mailing lists of direct marketers publishers and non profit organizations for the purpose of mailing printed advertising material that is coded to indicate the source of the name being mailed to generate a response. In some embodiments a response in the form of a purchase or a lead that may convert to a customer purchase is tracked to the original mailing list source either directly by the key code printed on the advertising material or by a match back algorithm.

In some embodiments similar to the DRTV example above the buying behavior of customers that are acquired through a specific mailing list is tracked over 12 24 months at which point the net present value of those subsequent purchases is combined with the net margin of the initial purchase and then divided by the original number of customers to provide a long term value to the investment in the mailing list.

Database may be any type of database including a database managed by a database management system DBMS . A DBMS is typically implemented as an engine that controls organization storage management and retrieval of data in a database. DBMSs frequently provide the ability to query backup and replicate enforce rules provide security do computation perform change and access logging and automate optimization. Examples of DBMSs include Oracle database IBM DB2 Adaptive Server Enterprise FileMaker Microsoft Access Microsoft SQL Server MySQL PostgreSQL and a NoSQL implementation. A DBMS typically includes a modeling language data structure database query language and transaction mechanism. The modeling language is used to define the schema of each database in the DBMS according to the database model which may include a hierarchical model network model relational model object model or some other applicable known or convenient organization. Data structures can include fields records files objects and any other applicable known or convenient structures for storing data. A DBMS may also include metadata about the data that is stored.

Software module may be a module that is configured to send process and receive information at server . Software module may provide another mechanism for sending and receiving data at server besides handling requests through web server functionalities.
