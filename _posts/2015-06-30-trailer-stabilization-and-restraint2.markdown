The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are described and illustrated below to encompass devices and methods utilized to stabilize and restrain parked freight trailers at a loading dock untethered to a tractor. Of course it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments discussed below are exemplary in nature and may be reconfigured without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. However for clarity and precision the exemplary embodiments as discussed below may include optional steps methods and features that one of ordinary skill should recognize as not being a requisite to fall within the scope of the present invention.

Referencing a first exemplary trailer restraint and stabilizing device includes a fifth wheel that is repositionably mounted to a compact frame . The fifth wheel is configured to engage the kingpin of a parked freight trailer presumably at a loading dock or other loading unloading facility. The compact frame of the device is also mounted to a pair of repositionable jacks and a repositionable tail hold where the device is configured to be repositioned using a pair of forks that are received within deployment tubes . In exemplary form the pair of forks may be associated with a forklift not shown or other repositionable vehicle that has vertically repositionable forks. As described herein in exemplary form a forklift will be described as the vehicle utilized to position the device with respect to the parked freight trailer . Those skilled in the art are familiar with the structure of a freight trailer the engagement between a fifth wheel and kingpin and the structure of a loading unloading facility including elevated mezzanines. Accordingly a detailed discussion of freight trailers kingpins fifth wheels loading unloading facilities and associated structures has been omitted in furtherance of brevity.

In this exemplary embodiment the device may be repositioned by a forklift or other repositionable vehicle. By way of example the device may initially be positioned at a stand by location of a loading unloading facility remote from the parked freight trailers . In order to reposition the device the forklift engages its forks with the deployment tubes . In exemplary form the forklift may align its forks with the deployment tubes so that the tapered end of the forks is received within corresponding funnel shaped receivers that are operative to direct the forks into corresponding deployment tubes. The funnel shaped receivers embody a hollow rectangular frustropyramidal shape that is mounted to an end of the deployment tubes . In this exemplary embodiment the smallest rectangular cross section of the funnel shaped receivers corresponds to the rectangular cross section of the hollow deployment tubes which is substantially constant along the longitudinal length of the deployment tubes. In this exemplary embodiment both the funnel shaped receivers and the deployment tubes are fabricated from metal such as steel rectangular tube for the deployment tubes and welded metal sheet stock for the funnel shaped receivers . It should also be noted that the deployment tubes need not be closed tubes . Rather the exemplary embodiment may make use of loops C shaped retainers or strapped loops to allow engagement and selective retention between the forks and the device . After positioning the forks within the deployment tubes the forklift may raise the forks to elevate the device off the ground. In this elevated position the device may be repositioned into engagement with a freight trailer .

In exemplary form the forklift may approach the front of a parked freight trailer which is supported by its rear axle s at a rearward portion and lowered landing gear not shown at a frontal portion. It is presumed that an area below the front of the freight trailer where the kingpin is located is unobstructed so as to allow the forklift to reposition the device to engage the kingpin . It should be noted however that engagement between the device and the kingpin is not necessary in order to restrain and or stabilize the parked freight trailer . By way of example when repositioning the device the height of the forks is adjusted to maintain suspension of the device above the ground while at the same time vertically aligning the fifth wheel with the kingpin so that movement of the forklift and correspondingly the forks toward the front of the freight trailer will cause the fifth wheel to correspondingly align engage and lock onto the kingpin.

In this exemplary embodiment the fifth wheel includes a substantially flat top plate lubricated to engage an underside surface of the freight trailer . In order to increase the likelihood that the kingpin is captured and locked into engagement with the fifth wheel an opening is formed into a distal portion of the top plate that is tapered on opposing sides. This tapering provides a relatively wide opening at the distal end that is many times the width of a kingpin but narrows gradually to reach a constant width section that is enclosed at a proximal end. The tapered shape of the fifth wheel opening is operative to funnel the kingpin into the constant width section where the kingpin is locked into engagement with the fifth wheel and device using a pair of locking jaws not shown . After the locking jaws are engaged the device is mounted to the kingpin so that proximal to distal movement of the fifth wheel with respect to the freight trailer is very limited it is simply the amount of travel provided for between the fifth wheel and kingpin . Moreover at this time the forks of the forklift are no longer needed to support the weight of the device above the ground given that the engagement between the fifth wheel and the kingpin allows the device to hang from the kingpin. Accordingly the forklift forks may be removed from the deployment tubes after the fifth wheel engages the kingpin by repositioning the forklift away from the front of the freight trailer and accordingly withdrawing the forks from the deployment tubes to discontinue engagement between the device and forklift when no power is utilized from the forklift. As will be discussed in more detail hereafter alternate exemplary embodiments provide for powered repositionable jacks and a powered repositionable tail hold that utilize power on board the forklift and accordingly provide for extended engagement between the forklift and the trailer stabilizing device until the jacks and tail hold are repositioned to a stabilized and restrained position.

In circumstances where the device includes manually repositionable jacks and a manually repositionable tail hold disengagement between the forklift and the device is optional before repositioning the jacks and tail hold from a storage position e.g. transportation position to a stabilized and restrained position e.g. deployment position . As used herein the terms storage position or transport position with respect to the jacks and tail hold refers to a position within an available a range of motion where the jacks and tail hold do not retard repositioning of the device . In contrast a stabilized or restrained position or a deployment position as used herein with respect to the jacks and tail hold refers to a position within an available range of motion where the jacks and or the tail hold retard repositioning of the device with respect to the freight trailer .

It is presumed that when the device is initially secured to the kingpin of the freight trailer that the jacks and tail hold occupy a storage position. In this exemplary embodiment the storage position may include the jacks being fully retracted within a range of motion ranging from the jacks being fully retracted and being fully extended. Similarly the storage position may include the tail hold being fully elevated within a range of motion ranging from the tail hold being fully elevated and being fully lowered. But after engagement between the kingpin and fifth wheel the jacks and tail hold may be repositioned to a stabilized and restrained position.

Repositioning the jacks to a stabilized and restrained position results in the jacks bearing at least a portion of the forward weight of the parked freight trailer . As part of accomplishing this weight bearing function the compact frame includes an upper cross member and a lower cross member that are mounted to and span between the jacks . In exemplary form the cross members comprise rectangular tubular steel that may be welded or coupled via fasteners e.g. nuts and bolts to the jacks .

Centered on top of the upper cross member and mounted thereto is a foot plate to which the fifth wheel is pivotally mounted by way of pivot pins concurrently extending through the fifth wheel and foot plate. In this exemplary embodiment the foot plate may be welded or coupled with fasteners e.g. nuts and bolts to the upper cross member . It should be noted that other coupling devices may be utilized in lieu of a fifth wheel in order to mount the device to the kingpin and allow the device to hang from the kingpin such as without limitation a kingpin lock.

Positioned beneath the foot plate and interposing the cross members is a vertical support that spans the vertical distance between the cross members. The vertical support may be welded or coupled with fasteners e.g. nuts and bolts and comprises rectangular tubular steel. This vertical support also interposes the deployment tubes which are mounted to the underside of the upper cross member .

In exemplary form the deployment tubes are welded to the upper cross member and are spaced apart in the widthwise direction approximately the width of the fifth wheel top plate . Moreover the deployment tubes are oriented parallel to one another and terminate distally at a distal edge of the upper cross member . The deployment tubes extend proximally a predetermined distance sufficient to terminate proximate a front plane of the freight trailer . Alternatively the deployment tubes may terminate prior to the front plane of the freight trailer or extend proximally beyond the front of the freight trailer. The predetermined distance should allow the forks to be received within the deployment tubes and provide for the forks to support the weight of the device and position the device sufficiently deep underneath the freight trailer for the fifth wheel to engage the trailer king pin .

In order to provide lateral support the compact frame includes left and right sway bars that interpose the deployment tubes and the jacks . In particular the sway bars may be welded to the deployment tubes and to the jacks just above the lower cross member . Exemplary sway bars may be fabricated from rectangular metal tubing. Given that the sway bars are not intended to be load bearing these bars may be fabricated from lighter weight structures that those of the cross members and vertical support .

In this exemplary embodiment repositioning the jacks to a stabilized or restrained position may be accomplished by manually repositioning a crank that is mechanically coupled to each jack. By way of example the crank includes a crank handle and a crank shaft that engages internal gears not shown inside the jack housings of the respective jacks . Rotation of the crank handle transfers this rotational motion to the crank shaft that transfers its rotational motion to the gears coupled to a screw in order to vertically extend a repositionable leg and ground pad with respect to a fixed position jack housing . Exemplary jacks for use with this embodiment include without limitation the Holland Mark V Series available from SAF HOLLAND USA Inc. Muskegon Mich. USA and the HD 2 Speed Tandem Landing Gear available from Cequent Performance Products Plymouth Mich. USA . It is presumed that the jacks would be located in the storage position prior to being repositioned to the stabilizing and restraining position however the jacks may be in other positions than in a load bearing position with the ground pad in contact with the ground. In any event the crank handle is rotated to reposition the leg and pad so that the pad contacts the ground. In particular the crank handle may be rotated until the jacks take on a load bearing position in order to supplement or assume the weight bearing function of the landing gear of the freight trailer . While the jacks are intended to take on a load bearing function it should be noted that the jacks may be repositioned to bear some or all of the forward weight of the freight trailer . In either circumstance the landing gear of the freight trailer may be optionally manipulated to reach the appropriate balance to the extent a shared weight bearing distribution between the landing gear and device is intended . In addition to repositioning the jacks to take on a load or weight bearing function the tail hold may also be repositioned.

In this exemplary embodiment the tail hold is manually repositioned to engage a permanent ground mount thereby providing restraint against forward movement of the freight trailer e.g. movement away from a loading dock . By way of example the tail hold comprises a lateral bar with or without a hook mounted to and extending between parallel arms . In exemplary form the lateral bar comprises cylindrical metal tubing that is received within corresponding oversized openings e.g. a circular triangular rectangular oblong oval etc. extending through the arms . The lateral ends of the bar have mounted thereto endcaps that prohibit lateral removal of the bar through the openings of the arms but continue to allow the bar vertical and proximal to distal play to better facilitate the bar being secured within one of the spaced apart cavities of the lock box . Each of the arms is mounted to a cylindrical rod that is operatively coupled to a handle where the rod engages bearings that are coupled to the frame . Repositioning the handle in a rotating motion is operative to correspondingly rotate the rod . Rotation of the rod causes the arms and bar to rotate along a predetermined arcuate path see operative to either move the bar farther away or closer to the ground mount i.e. raise or lower the bar .

The ground mount may comprise a lock box permanently mounted to the ground that includes a series of spaced apart cavities with at least one of the cavities receiving the bar in order to retain the bar within the cavity until it is removed via rotation of the handle and rod . In exemplary form the cavities are spaced apart in a predetermined fashion that corresponds to common freight trailer lengths 28 48 feet length freight trailers to accommodate for various kingpin setback lengths 12 24 30 and 36 inch setbacks from the front of the freight trailer . The perimeter of the ground mount may include four or more sides that may be mounted to one another in a frustropyramidal shape to provide inclined surfaces that allow for objects to contact and ride over the ground mount e.g. snow blades to ride thereover when plowing .

After engagement between the kingpin and fifth wheel the tail hold may be repositioned to a stabilized and restrained position. In exemplary form the tail hold occupies a storage position during the process of engagement between the kingpin and fifth wheel see . But after engagement between the kingpin and fifth wheel is complete the tail hold may be repositioned to a stabilized and restrained position where the tail hold is operative to retard forward movement of the trailer away from the loading dock see . In order to reposition the tail hold than handle is rotated in order to rotate the rod which in turn is operative to rotate the arms so the arms approach the ground mount . Continued rotation of the handle eventually brings the bar into contact with the ground mount preferably orienting the bar within one of the cavities . In circumstances where the bar does not precisely align with one of the cavities an operator may manually reposition the bar into the nearest cavity using the play between the bar and arms . Eventually the bar is aligned with one of the cavities and further rotation of the tail hold causes the bar to become seated at the bottom of a respective cavity see .

The ground mount may include a locking feature other than the shape of the cavity to retain the bar therein but if the shape of the cavities approximates the arcuate path taken by the bar when lowered there may not be an additional lock to retain the bar within the ground mount . In any event retention of the bar with respect to the ground mount is operative to restrict movement of the arms away from the ground mount. Because the arms are secured to the device which is secured to the freight trailer the result of retention of the bar within the ground mount is restraint of the freight trailer against forward movement i.e. movement of the freight trailer away from the loading dock .

It should be understood however that the jacks and tail hold may be repositioned to a stabilized and restrained position at the same time or sequentially in any order. Moreover in certain circumstances the jacks may be repositioned to stabilized and restrained position while the tail hold remains in a storage position while the kingpin and fifth wheel remain engaged. Conversely the tail hold may be repositioned to the stabilized and restrained position while the jacks remain in a storage position and while the kingpin and fifth wheel remain engaged.

After the jacks and or the tail hold is deployed to engage the ground the freight trailer may be loaded or unloaded. In order to inform personnel working within the loading dock that the trailer stabilizing device is properly in position to restrain and or support the freight trailer it is within the scope of the disclosure to mount one or more video cameras to the exterior of the loading dock that are communicatively coupled to one or more displays on the interior of the loading dock in order to provide visual feedback as to the position of the trailer stabilizing device.

After loading or unloading the process may be reversed to remove the trailer stabilizer from the parked freight trailer in order to allow coupling of the freight trailer to an over the road truck or a hustler truck. The process while not requiring any specific sequence of steps is preferably carried out to raise disengage the tail hold first followed by raising of the jacks followed by coupling the device to a portable vehicle in order to support the device and allow disengagement between the fifth wheel and kingpin which when completed allows the device to be removed from underneath the freight trailer. A more detailed exemplary process for utilizing the device follows.

Initially a transport vehicle e.g. a forklift engages the device and an operator of the transport vehicle ensures that the components of the device are in a transport position. In exemplary form the transport vehicle engages the device in order to allow the transport vehicle to carry the device. Presuming the device is positioned on the ground at a location remote from a freight trailer an outside dock worker operator of the transport vehicle may reposition a set of forks to be received within corresponding deployment tubes or other fork receiving structures. By way of example the forks are received deep enough within the deployment tubes so that by raising the forks vertically the device is correspondingly raised vertically. At a time prior to during or subsequent to reception of the forks within the deployment tubes the operator of the transport vehicle may reposition the jacks and the tail hold .

In exemplary form the jacks and tail hold may be manually automatically or semi automatically repositioned. Presuming the jacks are extended and the tail hold is pivoted toward the ground and the operator desires to raise the jacks to decrease the overall height of the device the operator may cause the jacks and tail hold to be raised. For example if the jacks and tail hold are manually repositionable the operator may manually reposition the crank handle to raise the jacks and handle to pivot the tail hold away from the ground. Alternatively the jacks and tail hold may be operatively coupled to a motor or fluid reservoir e.g. hydraulic jacks to allow the jacks and tail hold to be repositioned semi automatically using one or more controls allowing the operator to control the motor and or fluid flow to direct repositioning of the jacks and tail hold. An even further alternate configuration has the jacks and tail hold operatively coupled to a motor and or fluid reservoir e.g. hydraulic jacks and a controller associated with at least one of the device and the transport vehicle that brings about automatic repositioning of the jacks and tail hold when the device is initially coupled to the transport vehicle. In any event after the jacks and tail hold are to the extent necessary in the transport position the operator of the transport vehicle repositions the device into engagement with a parked freight trailer ready for stabilization and or restraint.

When repositioning the device in preparation for engagement with the parked freight trailer the transport vehicle operator orients the device so that the fifth wheel top plate is slightly lower than the bottom edge of the front of the parked freight trailer. This allows the device to be repositioned under a forward portion of the freight trailer so that the device couples to the parked freight trailer and optionally hangs therefrom. In order to hang from the freight trailer the device is repositioned so that the fifth wheel captures and couples to the kingpin . More specifically the kingpin is locked into engagement with the fifth wheel via a pair of locking jaws associated with the fifth wheel. After the locking jaws are engaged partially around the kingpin the device is mounted to the kingpin so that proximal to distal movement of the fifth wheel with respect to the freight trailer is very limited it is simply the amount of travel provided for between the fifth wheel and kingpin .

The jacks and or tail hold are repositioned from a transport position to a support and restraint position while the device hangs from the parked freight trailer and or is held in position by the transport vehicle. In exemplary form the jacks are extended and the tail hold is pivoted toward the ground. For example if the jacks and tail hold are manually repositionable the operator manually repositions the crank handle to lower the jacks and handle to pivot the tail hold toward the ground. Alternatively the jacks and tail hold may be operatively coupled to a motor or fluid reservoir e.g. hydraulic jacks to allow the jacks and tail hold to be repositioned semi automatically using one or more controls allowing the operator to control the motor and or fluid flow to direct repositioning of the jacks and tail hold. An even further alternate configuration has the jacks and tail hold operatively coupled to a motor and or fluid reservoir e.g. hydraulic jacks and a controller associated with at least one of the device and the transport vehicle that brings about automatic repositioning of the jacks and tail hold when the device is decoupled from the transport vehicle.

In any event the jacks and tail hold are repositioned so that the jacks assume at least partial weight bearing responsibility for the forward portion of the parked freight trailer whereas the tail hold is repositioned so that the bar engages the ground mount. More specifically the jacks are extended so that the ground pad of at least one jack contacts the ground and at least one of the jacks is operative to create a wedge between the ground and the underside of the freight trailer to assume a load bearing function. In exemplary form the jacks may be extended so that the entire load bearing function for the forward portion of the parked freight trailer is borne by the jacks. This entire load bearing function may coincide with the landing gear of the parked freight trailer being lifted off the ground. Though not necessary the operator may choose to raise the landing gear of the parked freight trailer as part of having the jacks assuming the entire load bearing function. In the context of the tail hold the tail hold is repositioned to lower the bar proximate the ground mount . By way of example the ground mount includes a number of slotted and angled grooves that is each sized to receive the bar . As the bar is lowered to contact the ground mount the play associated with the bar allows the bar to self orient itself or be manually re oriented to align with and be received within one of the grooves of the ground mount. Once the bar is received within one of the grooves and the device coupled to the parked freight trailer the tail hold ground mount engagement operates to retard significant motion of the parked freight trailer with respect to the ground mount and with respect to an adjacent loading dock . Before during or after deployment of the jacks and tail hold the transport vehicle may be disengaged from the device and utilized to position other devices under other parked freight trailers .

By way of example cargo should not be loaded onto or unloaded from the parked freight trailer without the device being correctly positioned underneath the parked freight trailer and a loading dock worker verifying the same. The individual openings of a loading dock typically coincide in size with the opening at the rear of the parked freight trailer . When the freight trailer is parked at a loading dock dock workers are unable to firsthand view the front of the parked freight trailer to ascertain the position and status of trailer stabilizing device . Consequently video cameras and monitors may be utilized in order to inform personnel working within a loading dock that the trailer stabilizing device is properly in position to restrain and or support the freight trailer . By way of example one or more video cameras positioned on the exterior of the loading dock are communicatively coupled to one or more displays on the interior of the loading dock. The cameras may generate constant visual data sporadic visual data and or regular interval visual data that is communicated to the one or more visual displays thereby providing visual feedback evidence to a loading dock worker as to the presence of a device underneath the parked freight trailer and the position of the device with respect to the trailer stabilizing device whether the device is in a restraint transportation and or stabilizing position . If the device is not yet positioned underneath a forward end of the parked freight trailer or is incorrectly positioned e.g. the jacks are not extended the tail hold has not engaged the ground mount the kingpin is not attached to the fifth wheel etc. the dock worker utilizes the visual feedback shown on the display s to conclude that cargo should not be loaded onto or unloaded from the parked freight trailer. Conversely the dock worker can utilize the visual feedback shown on the display s to discern that the device is correctly positioned underneath the parked freight trailer so that cargo can be loaded onto or unloaded from the parked freight trailer e.g. the jacks are extended the tail hold has engaged the ground mount the kingpin is attached to the fifth wheel etc. . Presuming the visual feedback indicates that the device is not correctly positioned underneath the parked freight trailer the dock worker signals an outside worker to correctly position the device . Upon visual feedback that the device is correctly positioned underneath the parked freight trailer the dock worker may authorize and participate in unloading cargo from or loading cargo onto the parked freight trailer.

Following completion of loading and or unloading of the parked freight trailer the dock worker signals an outside worker at the loading dock to remove the device in preparation for removal of the trailer from the loading dock. Upon receiving a communication to remove the device an outside dock worker operates a transport vehicle e.g. a forklift to engage the device and remove it from underneath the parked freight trailer . In exemplary form a set of forks associated with the transport vehicle are received within corresponding deployment tubes or other fork receiving structures. By way of example the forks are received deep enough within the deployment tubes so that the transport vehicle could bear the entire weight of the device upon disengagement between the device and parked freight trailer . At a time prior to during or subsequent to reception of the forks within the deployment tubes the operator of the transport vehicle may reposition the jacks and the tail hold .

In exemplary form the jacks and tail hold may be manually automatically or semi automatically repositioned. Presuming the jacks are extended and the tail hold is pivoted to engage the ground mount the operator raises the jacks and discontinues any engagement between the tail hold and ground mount . In certain circumstances the parked freight trailer may have moved forward slightly so that the tail hold cannot be freely moved out of engagement with the ground mount . In such a circumstance the transport vehicle may need to push against the parked freight trailer and or the device to relieve pressure upon the tail hold against the ground mount to allow the tail hold to be removed from the ground mount . For example if the jacks and tail hold are manually repositionable the operator may manually reposition the crank handle to raise the jacks and handle to pivot the tail hold away from the ground. Alternatively the jacks and tail hold may be operatively coupled to a motor or fluid reservoir e.g. hydraulic jacks to allow the jacks and tail hold to be repositioned semi automatically using one or more controls allowing the operator to control the motor and or fluid flow to direct repositioning of the jacks and tail hold. An even further alternate configuration has the jacks and tail hold operatively coupled to a motor and or fluid reservoir e.g. hydraulic jacks and a controller associated with at least one of the device and the transport vehicle that brings about automatic repositioning of the jacks and tail hold when the device is initially coupled to the transport vehicle.

In addition to repositioning the jacks and the tail hold the operator may cause repositioning of the fifth wheel with respect to the kingpin . In exemplary form the operator causes disengagement between the kingpin and fifth wheel by opening the pair of jaws of the fifth wheel that allow removal of the device from underneath the parked freight trailer . After disengagement between the fifth wheel and the kingpin presuming the jacks are no longer in a load bearing capacity and the tail hold is not engaged with the ground mount the operator may reposition the transport vehicle to remove the device from underneath the parked freight trailer by in exemplary form lowering the forks and repositioning the transport vehicle away from a front of the parked freight trailer.

It should be noted that a controller associated with at least one of the transport vehicle or the device may cause repositioning of the jacks and the tail hold into a transport position upon coupling the transport vehicle to the device or otherwise sending an signal to the controller to reposition the jacks and tail hold in a transport position.

After removing the device from underneath the parked freight trailer the trailer is available to be removed from the loading dock by a hustler truck or over the road truck. Also after removing the device from underneath the parked freight trailer the operator of the transport vehicle may reposition the device underneath a different parked freight trailer in order to restrain and or stabilize the parked freight trailer prior to cargo being unloaded from or loaded onto that trailer. The process for repositioning the device under a subsequent parked freight trailer would be consistent with the foregoing explanation with respect to the first parked freight trailer and accordingly will not be repeated in furtherance of brevity.

It should be noted that mounting and deploying the device to the parked freight trailer may occur without the outside dock worker ever repositioning the landing gear of the parked freight trailer. Similarly the dismounting and removal the device from underneath the parked freight trailer may occur without the outside dock worker ever repositioning the landing gear of the parked freight trailer.

As shown in it should be noted that in lieu of or in addition to the fifth wheel an alternate exemplary device may include a trailer clamp that comprises repositionable arms that extend laterally beyond the side edges of the parked freight trailer and include a repositionable coupling that allows the spacing of the repositionable arms to be changed. In this alternate exemplary embodiment the repositionable coupling may comprise without limitation a hydraulic cylinder a mechanical slide ratchet and a pulley and winch assembly for example. By initially setting the spacing such that the repositionable arms extend laterally outward of the side edges of the parked freight trailer and then directing the repositionable coupling to decrease this spacing the repositionable arms operate to sandwich the sides of the parked freight trailer and generate a sufficient clamping force to allow the device to hang from the parked freight trailer. While hanging from the parked freight trailer or being held in position by a transport vehicle the jacks may be deployed and raised upon loading unloading the parked freight trailer to a stabilizing position and the tail hold may be repositioned and raised upon loading unloading the parked freight trailer to a restraint position consistent with the foregoing disclosure for the first exemplary embodiment .

While the foregoing exemplary embodiments have been described as having manually repositionable jacks and a tail hold it is also within the scope of the disclosure to automate the movement of these devices between a storage transport position and a stabilized restrained position. By way of example the jacks may be electrically or hydraulically powered and in exemplary form receive this power from the portable vehicle used to reposition the stabilizing device . Moreover the tail hold may also be electrically or hydraulically repositioned also in exemplary form robbing power from the portable vehicle used to reposition the stabilizing device.

In the foregoing exemplary embodiments the stabilizing device has been described as being repositioned by a forklift. It should be understood that a forklift is one of many portable vehicles that may be used to reposition the device. For example the stabilizing device may be transported by a transport vehicle having a three point hitch such as a tractor or a transport vehicle having a loader quick coupler or quick hitch attachment. In these circumstances the deployment tubes may be replaced or reconfigured to engage the applicable connection of the transport vehicle. Moreover while the exemplary device has been described as being repositioned using forklift forks forks are not the sole structure one may use to reposition the exemplary stabilizing devices. As mentioned a three point hitch or quick coupler or quick attachment may be utilized to operatively couple the device to the transport vehicle. As a further alternative one may utilize a portable jack or other lifting mechanism as the transport vehicle to raise the stabilizing device into engagement with the kingpin of the parked freight trailer.
