The present invention relates to novel compounds and to the uses thereof for combatting or controlling parasitic weeds and for the regulation of certain plant properties and mycorrhizal fungi plant interaction.

In the recent past a new class of carotenoid derived compounds have been intensively studied and are commonly referred to as strigolactones. Strigolactones have been identified in the root exudates of plants and are known to stimulate seed germination of parasitic plants such as and which are amongst the main agricultural pest worldwide and to induce hyphal growth of arbuscular mycorhizal AM fungi that form symbiotic structures arbuscules with the majority of land plants. More recently strigolactones have been identified as plant hormones regulating branching and cambium growth.

As shown in FIG. 1 the common feature of the strigolactones is the combination of a tricyclic lactone comprising rings A B and C connected to a butenolide group D that also represents a lactone.

Rings A B and D may carry a variety of substituents and may underlie different modifications but all strigolactones share the common basic structure shown in FIG. 1.

The infection with and orobanchaceae is responsible for annual losses for farmers of billions of dollars all over the world. Around two third of the area for cereal crop production in Africa are infected with varieties. Alectra a member of the orobanchaceae affects dicotyledonous crops in large parts of Europe and North America and is responsible for significant yield losses.

As shown in FIG. 1 the tricyclic lactone comprising rings A B and C and the butenolide D are connected through an enol ether bridge. Due to this specific structure all natural strigolactones are very susceptible to nucleophilic attack hydrolysis and thus unstable in aqueous systems. Furthermore their solubility in aqueous systems is normally very low.

Furthermore the compounds in accordance with FIG. 1 comprise an enone structural element built by the double bond between rings C and D and the keto group in ring C. This substructure also has a detrimental influence on the stability and properties of the said compounds. This enone structure has hitherto been considered indispensible to achieve the desired activity.

In view of their great potential for the so called suicide germination of parasitic weeds this means the germination in the absence of a suitable host plant which will ultimately lead to the death of the parasitic plant thorough investigations have been undertaken to determine the minimum structural requirements necessary to maintain the desired germination stimulating activity.

Strigolactones have also been shown to play a role in establishing symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhiza AM a symbiotic structure formed by plants and soilborne fungi. AM allows plants to obtain water and nutrients from the soil through the hyphae of the fungi and in turn the plants provide the fungi with photosynthates. AM is considered very advantageous for crop yield and represent the most widespread symbiosis on earth. The establishment of AM requires extensive branching of the hyphae which is induced by root derived signals commonly referred to as branching factor BF . Strigolactones play a role in this process. The structural requirements for this desired activity are deemed to be very similar to those for the above mentioned suicide germination of the parasitic weeds.

Finally it has been shown that strigolactones fulfil the criteria of hormones i.e. they require a receptor mediating their response they are active at very low concentrations and they can be transported in the plant over some distance. Various investigations have shown that strigolactones are involved in root and lateral root growth and in photo morphogenesis. Further they control the growth of cambium indicating an important role in wood production.

A number of structural studies have been carried out to get a better understanding of the essential parts in the strigolactone molecule for achieving desired properties as referred to above. The replacement of the A ring by an aromatic ring leads to the active analogue commonly referred to as GR24. Analogues lacking the A ring GR7 or both the A and B ring GR5 still exhibit appreciable albeit lower activities.

In contrast omitting of the D ring or the ABC enol ether results in basically complete loss of the desired activity. An analogue consisting only of a D ring with an ethoxy group is also inactive. Based on these structure activity data it was concluded that an essential minimal requirement is the presence of the structural elements of the D ring connected with an enone unit via the mentioned enol ether. As mentioned above this unit however causes an inherent low stability of the active compounds in aqueous media combined with a low solubility. This makes their use in applications in the crop protection area difficult.

Zwanenburg et al J. Agrif. Food Chem. 1992 40 1222 1229 describes structural modifications of strigol analogues and analyzes the influence of the B and C rings on the bioactivity. FIG. 2 on page 1225 shows a modified strigol analogue which again comprises an enone substructure involving the carbon atom of the double bond between the butenolide structure and the remainder of the molecule which is detrimental for the stability of the compounds as mentioned hereinbefore .

Brooks et al. ACS Symposium Series 268 437 444 discloses compounds 30 a and 30 b which again have the undesired enone substructure.

Kondo et al. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 71 11 2781 2787 discloses imino analogues of strigolactones which share inter alia a common structural element of an enone structure as outlined above.

Johnsson et al. J. Chem.Soc. Perkin Trans. I No. 6 Jan. 1 1981 pages 1734 1743 describes procedures for the preparation of synthetis analogues of strigol which share the common structural feature of an enone substructure as described above.

In Sci. China Ser. C Life Sciences 2009 52 8 693 700 the authors describe strigolactone derivatives with rings C and D as shown in FIG. 1 and thus comprising the undesired enone substructure as outlined above.

Accordingly there was a need for strigolactone analogues or compounds having similar activity as the strigolactones described in the prior art while at the same time showing enhanced stability in aqueous media.

It was thus an object of the instant invention to provide novel compounds showing beneficial properties similar to those of strigolactones but having an improved stability in particular against nucleophilic attack hydrolysis.

It was a further object of the instant invention to provide beneficial uses for such new compounds in the regulation of certain plant properties.

These objects have been achieved with the novel compounds in accordance with claim . Preferred compounds are described in detail hereinafter and are claimed in dependent claims.

The novel compounds in accordance with the instant invention are represented by the general formula I

a hydrogen atom a halogen atom a nitro group a cyano group a formyloxy group a formylamino group or a carbamate group 

a substituent R wherein Rrepresents C C alkyl C Calkenyl C C alkinyl C C cycloalkyl or C C alkoxy in each of which the hydrogen atoms may be partly replaced by other groups or atoms 

a substituent OR wherein Rrepresents a hydrogen atom C C alkyl C C alkenyl C C alkinyl C C alkylcarbonyl C C alkylaminocarbonyl or C C alkoxycarbonyl in each of which the hydrogen atoms may be partly replaced by other groups or atoms

a substituent NRR wherein Rand R independently from each other represent a hydrogen atom C Calkyl C C alkylcarbonyl C C halogenoalkylcarbonyl phenyl or benzyl in each of which the hydrogen atoms may be partly replaced by other groups or atoms 

a substituent C O R wherein Rrepresents a hydrogen atom C C alkyl or C C alkyloxy in each of which the hydrogen atoms may be partly replaced by other groups or atoms NH2 NHRor NRR where the two substituents Rmay be the same or different NR OH 

a substituent S O n R wherein n is 0 1 or 2 and Rrepresents C C alkyl in which the hydrogen atoms may be partly replaced by other groups or atoms NH NHRor NRR where the two substituents Rmay be the same or different 

or a 4 5 6 or 7 membered heterocyclic ring comprising up to 4 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen oxygen or sulfur where in each of these rings the hydrogen atoms may be partly replaced by other groups or atoms 

C Calkyl C C alkenyl or C C alkinyl wherein the hydrogen atoms may be partly replaced by other groups or atoms 

a substituent Ras defined above or CH CH R wherein Rrepresents a hydrogen atom C C alkyl or a 4 5 6 or 7 membered saturated or unsaturated aromatic or non aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring or a fused ring system containing more than one of those rings or

Rand Rtogether form a 4 5 6 or 7 membered saturated or unsaturated aromatic or non aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring which may be fused to another saturated or unsaturated aromatic or non aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring with the proviso that the carbon atom carrying substituents Rand Ris not part of an enone structural element and

a hydrogen atom a halogen atom a nitro group a cyano group or C C alkyl C Calkenyl C C alkinyl or C C cycloalkyl.

The compounds of formula I depending on the number of double bonds may exist in different isomers and formula I is intended to cover all such isomers and to any mixtures thereof.

Due to the lack of the enone group such as represented by ring C the stability of the novel compounds of formula I against nucleophilic attack hydrolysis is improved compared to previously known strigolactones. Despite the lack of the enone substructure which has hitherto been considered indispensible for the desired activity of the strigol analogues the novel compounds in accordance with the present invention surpirsingly show the desired activity which is contrary to the expectations of the skilled person in view of the teaching of the prior art.

Preferred novel compounds in accordance with the present invention do not have the enol ether bridge between the butenolide D lactone and a ring C they do not contain a ring C at all but still retain the desired activity to a significant degree. Thus they lack the structural element which has hitherto been considered indispensible for the germination stimulating activity and other desired properties. This was not to be expected based on prior knowledge.

According to a first preferred embodiment Rand Rare both hydrogen and Ris a substituent R even more preferred Ris a Cto C alkyl group in particular a C Calkyl group and most preferred a methyl group.

According to a further preferred embodiment Re represents a substituent CH CH R in which Rrepresents a 4 to 7 membered saturated or unsaturated aromatic or non aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring or a fused ring system containing more than one of those rings. More preferably Ris a five or six membered carbocyclic ring which may be saturated or unsaturated even more preferably Ris a cyclohexenyl ring. The ring Rmay be substituted by various substituents and preferably by a hydroxyl group or C C alkyl C C alkoxy or acetyl groups.

Still in another preferred embodiment Re represents a C Calkyl or a C C alkenylene group optionally substituted with a hydroxyl group or a carbonyl group or a cycloalkyl group which itself might be substituted by e.g. one or more alkyl groups.

A particularly preferred group of compounds is represented by the following formulae wherein the cyclohexenyl or the phenyl ring may optionally be substituted by further methyl or hydroxyl groups.

The novel compounds of formula I can in principle be obtained by a coupling of the butenolide lactone D structure with the remaining part of the molecule via an enol ether bridge.

The synthesis of butenolides has been described in the literature extensively so that further details are not necessary here. By way of example reference is made to Tetrahedron 2005 61 9896 S. Ma and F. Yu relating to the synthesis of methylene unsaturated lactones by Pd catalyzed cyclization of 3 4 alkadienoic acids and C. Fu S. MA Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2005 3942ff relating to the iodolactonisation of ethyl 2 3 allenoates with Iodine in aqueous MeCN.

The novel compounds of formula I may also be obtained by biochemical synthesis in vitro using heterologously expressed CCD7 CCD8 and DWARF27 enzymes or in vivo by expressing the genes coding for CCD7 CCD8 and DWARF 27 enzymes in a production host. Respective methods are known as such to the skilled man and need not be further explained here. Microorganisms and moss may be mentioned as production hosts.

In the context of the studies leading to the present invention it was additionally found that the combined activities of the carotinoid cleavage dioxygenases CCD7 and CCD8 lead to an unexpected product see Example 1 .

The further study of the reaction mechanism revealed 9 cis carotenoids e.g. 9 cis carotene as precursors that are cleaved by CCD7 enzymes at the 9 10 double bond leading to 9 cis apo 10 carotenals e.g. 9 cis apo 10 carotenal. Incubation of CCD8 enzymes with 9 cis apo 10 carotenal or combined CCD7 CCD8 assays with 9 cis carotene lead to the compound with the structure IA

This product of combined CCD7 CCD8 activity and the identification of 9 cis carotene as substrate give rise to the assumption that the biosynthetic pathway leading to 5 deoxystrigol which is proposed to be the precursor of all strigolactones might be simpler than initially supposed.

In the course of the mechanistic studies it was also found by the inventors that the protein DWARF 27 which is known to be involved in the pathway to strigolactones in rice is the isomerase required to produce the precursor 9 cis carotene from all trans carotene and thus a further aspect of the invention relates to the use of DWARF 27 for isomerising all trans carotenes e.g. for producing 9 cis carotene and other 9 cis carotenes from their corresponding all trans isomers.

As already referred to above the compounds of formula I and in particular the compound obtained through the CCD7 CCD8 activity show properties and behaviour like strigolactones but without the need of having an enone structure coupled to a butenolide which as mentioned leads to an inherent instability against nucleophilic attack.

Different strategies e.g. sanitation and hand weeding crop rotation improving soil fertility soil treatment by fumigation and solarization biological control the use of selective herbicides the use of herbicide resistant maize chemicals inhibiting attachment Strigaway BASF SE and suicidal germination and breeding for resistance have been employed to control root parasites. In general these control strategies target either pre attachment or post attachment life cycle stages of parasitic plants. Since root parasites affect host development immediately after attachment and cause important damage prior to parasite emergence control strategies which target pre attachment stages of the host parasite interaction are preferred. Being the first critical step in the interaction makes germination an important target for improved control measures. One advantage of this approach is that the inducing molecules are common to both and spp. Indeed several control strategies based on the germination stimulants have already been developed.

The compounds in accordance with the instant invention can be used as synthetic analogues to induce the germination of the seeds of the parasitic weeds. If these compounds are applied in the absence of a suitable host plant for the weed the seeds will germinate and the parasitic weed will finally die due to the lack of a suitable host. For example the compounds in accordance with the instant invention may be used in the seed treatment of seeds of non hosts of the parasitic weeds which may be used prior to planting the desired crop. Alternatively one could think of using compounds in accordance with the instant invention together with a known herbicide for the parasitic weeds for the treatment of seeds of the utility crops prior to transferring such seeds to the soil. If the crop itself is resistant against the herbicide the compounds in accordance with the instant invention would trigger the germination of the parasitic weeds which would then be killed by the herbicide without negatively affecting the crop plant. All these different possibilities are included in the term germination trap and same should be interpreted accordingly.

The compounds in accordance with the instant invention are also useful to regulate respectively to enhance the hyphal growth of symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi which is a highly desirable symbiosis as same increases crop yields. This has in particular been observed in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi like e.g.

A third beneficial usability of the compounds in accordance with the instant invention is the regulation respectively enhancement of cambium growth which is very important in wood production.

The compounds in accordance with the instant invention are also useful for the regulation of branching tillering and root development of plants.

The aerial plant architecture of aboveground shoots is determined by the pattern of shoot branching. The first step in shoot branching is the generation of axillary buds. Their development is mainly regulated by genetics but plants are able to modify their behaviour in response to environmental changes. The compounds in accordance with the instant invention are useful to control the shoot branching of crops in a desired manner by applying these compounds to the crop in question.

Tiller is a stem produced at the base of grass plants and tillering refers to the production of such tillers which process is strongly influenced by the soil status. Tillering in rice L. is an important agronomic trait for grain production and also a model system for the study of branching in monocotyledonous plants. Rice tiller is a specialized grain bearing branch that is formed on the unelongated basal internode and grows independently of the mother stem culm by means of its own adventitious roots. The compounds of the instant invention can be used to regulate tillering in rice thus increasing yields.

Furthermore it has been found that compositions comprising at least one compound of formula I and at least one insecticide and or fungicide known in the art show surprisingly increased efficiency for combating or controlling pests or fungi in particular fungi detrimentally affecting plants. Processes for the treatment of fungi within or attached to the human body or within animals to the extent same would constitute a therapeutic treatment of humans or animals are excluded.

These compositions may provide a synergistic effect which allows the reduction of the amount of chemicals spread and a reduction of the treatment costs.

When used herein the term synergistic effect means an efficacy of a new combination of more than one compound exceeding the efficacy calculated in accordance with the formula of Colby Weeds 1967 15 pages 20 22 . This formula reads 100

in which E represents the expected efficiency degree of inhibition of disease or pest for the combination of two compounds at defined doses x is the percentage of inhibition observed for the pest or disease by the first compound of the combination at a defined dose and y is the respective efficiency for the second compound of the combination. When the observed efficiency is higher than the expected efficiency according to this formula this constitutes a synergistic effect.

The compositions containing at least one compound of formula I in accordance with the instant invention and at least one insecticide or fungicide known in the art show such improvement compared to the single compounds in plant growth vigor or yield of plants or crops or insecticidal or fungicidal effect.

The weight ratio of the compounds in accordance with the instant invention to the known insecticides or fungicides may cover a broad range of from 0.5 1 to 1 10 preferably of from 1 10to 1 10 and more preferably of from 1 10to 1 10 i.e. the content of the known insecticide or fungicide is usually much higher than the concentration of the compounds in accordance with the instant invention.

Suitable insecticides are known to the skilled man and have been described in the literature. They are generally classified in accordance with their mode of action to the extent same is known as acetylcholione receptor agonists or antagonists acetylcholinesterase inhibitors sodium channel modulators or sodium channel blockers GABA gated chloride channel antagonists ecdysone agonists disruptors chloride channel activators semicarbazones juvenile hormone mimetics acetylcholine receptor modulators neirostoxin analogues inhibitors of lipid biosynthesis decouplers of oxidative phosphorylation electron transport inhibitors site I site II and site III carboxamides inhibitors of ATP ase inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors of chitine biosynthesis microbial disruptors of the intestinal membrane or ryanodin receptor antagonists. Furthermore so called biologicals hormones or pheromones are known to the skilled man and there are also insecticides which are commercially used the mode of action however is not yet fully clarified.

In vitro incubation of CCD8 enzymes with 9 cis apo 10 carotenal resulted in a novel compound exhibiting an absorption maximum at around 268 nm the starting material has an absorption maximum at appr. 447 nm which was further analyzed after purification through two different HPLC separation systems. Combined assays with a combination of CCD7 and CCD8 enzymes and using 9 cis carotene as substrate led to the same novel compound.

A Waters system equipped with a photodiode array detector model 996 was used to purify the PsCCD7 PsCCD8 product. The purification step was performed using a YMC Pack C30 reversed phase column 250 4.6 mm i.d. 5 m YMC Europe Schermbeck Germany with the solvent systems B methanol water tert butylmethyl ether 60 20 2 v v v and A methanol tert butylmethyl ether 50 50 v v . The column was developed at a flow rate of 1 ml min with a gradient from 100 B to 80 B within 15 min then to 0 B within 0.5 min and finally to 0 B and a flow rate of 2 m min within 0.5 min maintaining the final conditions for another 14 min. The collected fractions were dried using a rotary evaporator and resolved in methanol. The second purification step was performed using a MN Nucleosil 100 C18 reversed phase column 250 4 mm i.d. 10 m Macherey Nagel Duren Germany with the solvent systems B methanol water 20 80 v v and A methanol. The column was developed for 8 min with solvent B at a flow rate of 1 ml min followed by a linear gradient from 100 B to 100 A within 1 min maintaining the final conditions for another 10 min.For structure determination of the novel compound various NMR techniques were applied.

350 g of the purified novel compound were dissolved in CDCIand subjected to 1D H 1D H H NOE and three different 2D NMR techniques 2D H H COSY 2D H C heteronuclear single quantum coherence and 2D H C heteronuclear multiple bond spectrometry . The 1D NOE experiment was used to detect spatial proximity among protons. The 2D H H COSY experiment was applied for unraveling the homo nuclear coupling network and for assigning the corresponding H signals to the individual protons. Taking advantage of the 2D H C heteronuclear single quantum coherence HSQC experiment dedicated for detecting one bond J spin spin interactions and its ability to differentiate among different carbon types CH CH CH these H signals were correlated with the C signals of directly bound carbons. The 2D H C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation HMBC experiment which detects long range couplings between protons and carbons connected through two or three bonds J served to assign the signals of quaternary carbons and to independently prove the assignments of the proton bearing carbons. The analysis of the results allowed the unequivocal assignment of the structure of formula IA to the novel compound. These results were confirmed through high resolution mass spectrometry yielding the composition CHOand through UV spectroscopy indicating a maximum of three conjugated double bonds.

OsDWARF27 an enzyme in rice was expressed in fusion with thioredoxin and in vitro assays were performed with all trans carotene using crude lysate of transformed cells. HPLC analysis revealed the conversion of the substrate into its 9 cis isomer confirmed by comparison with an authentic standard. In addition combined incubation of DWARF27 CCD7 and CCD8 with all trans carotene led to the novel compound of formula IA as obtained in Example 1 while controls performed with DWARF27 or with CCD7 and CCD8 did not show the formation of this compound.

This result confirmed the enzymatic function of DWARF27 which was hitherto unclear namely as an isomerase for all trans carotenes to the respective cis carotenes in particular to form 9 cis carotene from all trans carotene.

Pre conditioning of seeds was carried out in a first step to see the effect of germination stimulants. For this purpose clean seeds were surface sterilized with 2 sodium hypochlorite in sterile water containing 0.4 of Tween 20. About 50 to 100 sterilized seeds were spread on 9 mm diameter glass fibre filter paper discs. Twelve of these discs were placed in a 9 cm diameter Petri dish on sterilized Whatman filter paper moistened with 3.0 ml sterilized water. After sealing with parafilm the Petri dishes were placed in darkness in an incubator at 30 C. After 10 days of incubation the discs with preconditioned seeds were supposed to be ready to test germination stimulant. Surplus moisture was evaporated from each petri dish in laminar flow cabinet. The dry discs were then placed in another Petri dish six per Petri dish containing a filter paper ring outer diameter 9 cm inner diameter 8 cm moistened with 0.9 ml water. Various concentration of the compound of formula IA were applied 50 l per disc to triplicate discs. GR24 a synthetic strigolactone analogue was applied as positive control. Subsequently the seeds were incubated in darkness at 30 C. for another 48 hours and germination seeds with radicle protruding through the seed coat scored with the help of a binocular microscope.

The compound of formula IA as obtained in Example in concentrations of from 0.03 to 330 M resulted in germination of the seeds in the range of from 2 to 62 which is an activity in this regard of the same order of magnitude as the known synthetic strigolactone analogue GR 24 which yielded a germination activity of appr. 50 at a concentration of 3.3 M under the same conditions.

Rice seeds were surface sterilized with 2 sodium hypochlorite. The seeds were allowed to germinate in a Petri dish on a moistened filter paper. In the meanwhile bottom of 1.5 ml eppendorf tube was cut and filled with 0.6 phyto agar. One pre germinated seed was planted in the center of the tube on solid phytoagar and this tube was fitted in the cap of 10 ml plastic tube. The 10 ml tube was filled with modified Hoagland nutrient solution. After two weeks of planting the compound of formula IA 2 M was added through nutrient solution to half of the tubes of each rice cultivars mutants and the remaining half were kept as control. The nutrient solution with or without the compound of formula IA was supplied daily. Number of tillers per plant was counted at 24 hours interval up to 12 days of carlactone application.

In addition to its activity in inducing seed germination of parasitic plants the compound of formula IA also exerted the function of strigolactone in regulating tillering of rice. Treatment with this compound led to a reduction of tiller number of the ccd8 rice mutant d10 comparable to that shown by the strigolactone analogue GR24.

The results of the foregoing examples show that the novel compounds in accordance with the instant invention can replace strigolactones in a number of interesting applications.
