title: Systems, apparatus, and methods for generating prediction sets based on a known set of features
abstract: An individual having a plurality of first features and a second characteristic is identified. A plurality of second features associated with a second characteristic is determined. For each first feature among the plurality of first features, a respective probability distribution indicating, for each respective second feature, a probability that a person having the respective second feature has the first feature, is determined, thereby generating a plurality of probability distributions. A probabilistic classifier is used to combine the plurality of probability distributions, thereby generating a merged probability distribution. A Monte Carlo method is used to generate a prediction set based on the merged probability distribution, the prediction set including a plurality of prediction values for the second characteristic of the individual, each respective prediction value being associated with one of the plurality of second features. The prediction set is stored in a memory. The probabilistic classifier may include a Na√Øve-Bayes method. Prediction sets may be generated for each of a plurality of individuals, and used to predict a feature associated with a group. For example, an advertisement may be selected and displayed based on the predicted feature.

This specification relates generally to systems apparatus and methods for predicting data and more particularly to systems apparatus and methods for generating prediction sets for a characteristic based on a known set of features.

Social media has become a big part of the Internet. Many social media companies exist that allow users to post and share information to their network of friends. Companies and brands constantly search for opportunities to use such data to increase brand value. Monetizing on that data however can be troublesome and burdensome because of the vast amount of data that need to be sifted through. One challenge faced by brands is that many attributes of an audience such as gender ethnicity age etc. that is talking about a brand or topic on social media are hidden by the author because of privacy concerns.

For marketers and advertisers analyzing demographic information concerning a target audience can provide valuable information. Knowledge of the demographics of a crowd of people at a venue such as a stadium can be very helpful in selecting appropriate advertisements to display to the crowd. Knowledge of the demographics of people reacting to a marketing campaign on social media can be helpful in market research. In other fields as well obtaining accurate insight into individuals behavior of economic activity etc. can provide useful information. Many companies and organizations frequently generate predictions for such unknown variables based on one or more known variables. However in many instances obtaining accurate predictions for a desired item of information can be difficult. In many existing systems simplistic assumptions are made to generate a prediction often producing inaccurate results.

Further embodiments features and advantages as well as the structure and operation of the various embodiments are described in detail below with reference to accompanying drawings.

A user may operate a user interface on user device to create engagement content on server . User device may be coupled to server over network . Server includes curation system which may be used to provide information to user device . Engagement application may be implemented on or implemented with one or more computing devices such as user device .

In one embodiment the functionality of engagement application and or curation system may be provided through a browser on computing devices such as user device . Curation system on server may host the service and serve it to device and any other computing devices. Any combination of implementations may provide through a browser the functionality represented by the example implementations of systems and shown in and in the screenshots and flowchart of . Any stages shown in flowchart of that involve displaying content may be considered to provide the content for display in a browser.

Browser may be any commonly used browser including any multi threaded or multi process browser. In one embodiment the functionality of engagement application can be provided through browser . The functionality of any of the components or flowcharts shown in the figures may be provided through the browser executed on device server or any other computing device. The web pages or application provided through the browser may be served from server device or any other computing device. Different windows or views may be shown through browser .

In one embodiment users can monitor social media data and create visualizations around the data. A visualization is a packaged set of resources that can be loaded into a web page. Each visualization contains definitions for structure style and functionality. The visualizations are data driven and can implement multiple data sources. They also expose configurable settings. Structure The structure of the visualization is defined using HTML. Rather than defining an entire page the HTML only defines a fragment of HTML that will be injected into an existing page. Style The style of the components is defined using the Less language. The Less is then compiled to CSS against the visualization settings and a built in library of Less Mixins and Less Variables. Functionality The functionality of the visualization is defined using JavaScript and is used by the client s browser to instantiate the visualization. Settings Settings for the visualization can be broken into two categories style and functionality. Style settings are converted into Less variables and injected into style defined for the visualization.

Functionality settings are converted into a JavaScript object and injected into the JavaScript controller. All settings not otherwise designated are injected into the JavaScript controller as a JavaScript object. These settings are used to allow the users to configure the functionality of the visualization. Data Sources Data sources define what data the visualization will consume. The data source definitions are injected into the JavaScript controller optionally along with the actual data. If the data is not included in the initial load it can be loaded asynchronously. Loader Part of embedding a visualization into a page is including a small client side loading script. The client side loading script finds all embeds on the page and sends one batch load request to the server. The server then dynamically builds a script to send back to the client. The script contains the initialization functions for each of the visualizations. Once the script is sent back to the client it initializes all of the visualizations and tracks them through the lifetime of the page. It also defines an API for interacting with the visualizations.

The JavaScript controller can reside on the server visualization loader which can all reside on the server and or the curation system . In one embodiment the visualizations can be for the advertisements associated with the social media data as described further below. The data sources can reside on server . In one embodiment the server visualization loader is the server . The visualization instance manager can reside on user device . In one embodiment the visualization instance manager is the engagement application . In another embodiment the visualization instance manager is on the user device along with the engagement application .

In one embodiment from a dashboard a user can select to create a new visual. They then select a category and a specific template. The user gives the visual a title and selects a feed to use as a default data source. The feed is a social media conversation as described in further detail below. The user can edit the settings related to the visualization. The visualization is then embedded into a webpage.

The edit page a user can use to edit the settings provides color picker controls calendar picker controls file upload controls and other custom controls as well as validation on input and a much better user experience. It is not possible to enter invalid configuration through this page but it is also more restrictive to the values that can be entered. Additional settings can be added to instances latter by the end user through the advanced edit screen but those additional setting would not be available to edit through the normal edit page.

Using points users can rank social media content . One way users can rank content is by measuring its influence. Curation system ranks the influence of social media content by using its own proprietary algorithm The algorithm ranks the influence of social media content as content is inserted onto the database by providing a point score.

Points measure influence within the context of a social media conversation. With Points the influence of both who is speaking and what is being said can be measured. Points measures the influence of authors as well as the influence of the content shared on social media itself.

In one embodiment the point system can use different factors to generate points for each content resource. There are four factors that can be used the origination of the content resource the content of the content resource whether its images text or video the number of subscribers followers and friends of the author of the content resource or the individual s that rebroadcast reused the content resource and the rating of the content resource likes favorites comments retweets reply s shares etc. . A like is an indication by a user that they prefer or they like a content resource. A favorite is when a user saves a content resource as a resource that they want to keep as a favorite. Each content resource can include comments by other users. A retweet is when a content resource is broadcast again by a different user. A share is when a user shares a content resource with one or more other individuals. Each of these likes favorites comments retweets replys shares etc can be counted for each content resource. Curation system can combine these factors and these counts in a number of ways to determine the score for example adding them or multiplying them.

In one embodiment a weight can be assigned to different factors as well for example a weight of 3 may be added for a content resource that is liked versus a content resource that is not. Curation system can apply the weight to each resource s count for example in determining the point score.

Curation system can keep track of all the relevant data within a conversation and utilizes the data to estimate the attention given to any author or piece of content.

The algorithm updates the Points score for social media content at predefined intervals to constantly serve the most real time Points score as shown in . displays one piece of content . The points score shown is ZPoints . In this example the Points are called ZPoints but can be called by any name. The Points scores are updated in real time to reflect the potentially rapid additions changes etc. to social media conversations. Items authors and feeds influence are accumulated over time to show cumulative totals of influence for each item author or feed.

In one embodiment social media content can be curated. In a curation queue in curation system users can view content and determine an action to take on that content. The curation queue provides its users with the ability change the status of social media content or content resources with status such as Pending Approved Rejected Spam Q A. Users can tag each content piece or content resource. Tagging is the ability to take social media content and append additional metadata. Tagging is done in order to classify and organize social media content so that the system can serve up the most applicable social media content alongside the appropriate advertisements. Tagged social media content can then be created. The tagged social media content can be matched with ad content by an ad manager . A content display can be generated with the tagged social media content and the ad content .

The process to manually tag can be summarized in four steps. The user identifies content to be tagged in the curation queue. The user clicks the tag it button associated with the item. Engagement system can prompt the user to type in a keyword in a free form text field. Engagement system appends that keyword metadata to the social media content resource and save the tag in the Tag It Library. Curation system can store the keyword metadata appended to the social media content resource.

Intelligent image tagging is a feature to auto tag image based social media content. The process to intelligent image tagging can be summarized in four steps. Curation system automatically identifies an image within the social media content resource to be tagged in the curation queue. Curation system leverages image recognition services internally or via third party API to processes and recommend tags.

Curation system can include an image recognition service that can identify objects in images logos Places Faces Products Text . The objects can be sent to a service to be identified. For example a third party service that can identify objects in images. In another embodiment a database can be would be used as a service that would match database object which would be pre tagged with metadata. These database objects would then be compared against image objects. If a match is made then the tags from the database objects are copied onto the image object.

The service then provides us additional information in the form of tags metadata for the objects through the API back to curation system .

Curation system can access a Tag It Library to retrieve any existing and applicable tags or creates a new tag to append as metadata to the specific social media item image . A user can override or adjust the tag that was automatically associated with the image for verification and accuracy.

In one embodiment in the manual tagging process a user is able to click on a Tag It button in the curation queue as well as being able to create tags and use existing tags and attach one or more tags to social media content. A use can click on a Done button in order to save the selected tag s . As shown in the example the tag can then appear alongside the actions in the Tag column Food as shown in the tag of

By saving the selected tag the social media content can appear under the Tagged Items Queue as shown in . If a user needs to remove a tag from an item they can do so from the Tagged Items Queue by clicking the x alongside the content. Once a tag is added to social media content it is instantly available for use by curation system .

In one embodiment curation system provides the ability to create content displays or they may be called Social Mashups which are a combination of various data curated tagged social media content text and images ranked by points and advertisements uploaded through the curation system or integrated through 3party ad engines .

Curation system allows users to bring together relevant and influential data based on points scores social media content from multiple platforms and conversations by selecting 1. A layout to display social media content alongside relevant ads 2. social content types trends clouds streaming social content and streaming Social pictures 3. ad content and 4. conversation source which are feeds.

A feed is a social media conversation defined by designated search terms i.e. keywords hash tags and handles. The feed includes social media data that is curated.

Trend clouds are visual depictions of frequently used words in social media conversations. Streaming social content relates to scrolling text displaying the curated and tagged text. Streaming social pictures are revolving photos displaying the curated and tagged images. Again all influential social media content would be ranked and selected to be used with points.

A content display combines various data curated tagged social media content text and images ranked by points and advertisements uploaded through content curation system or integrated through 3party ad engines .

In one embodiment to build a content display a user can select a layout that includes advertisements. A content display is shown in . A user can configure the content display within the selected layout as shown in .

Advertisements can be configured through the ad content by defining an ad campaign and associating a tag to an ad campaign. A user can define the ad campaign and associate one or more tags to each ad campaign.

A user is able create a new ad campaign and to associate the campaign with a tag previously established through the curation queue. Users can also create a brand new tag within this step. A new ad is shown in . Users can also leverage a Tag It library which saves previously saved tags.

In one embodiment a user can connect a feed for example Collected Ranked and Approved social media content within the Curation Queue for the ad content. The user can associate any of the previously created feeds with the ad campaign. This can establish the social media content to be synchronized.

In one embodiment a user creates an ad campaign including a campaign name tags URLs and an image. Then the user can configure an ad content area in the content display or layout and in the content display the user can select one or more tags and a feed to associate with the ad content area of the content display. Therefore once data from a feed either an image or text is shown in the data portion of the content display and the tags is associated with tags if the tags match the tags that the user selected for their ads when they created the ads the ads are then shown in the ad content area next to the content.

In one embodiment when a user configures a part of the layout for an advertisement the user can select one or more tags and a feed to associate with the section of the layout.

In one embodiment social media content can be configured to sync to ad content. First the user selects social media content. The user must select either streaming social pictures or the streaming social content to sync with their ads. Then the user selects a feed. For example a user can pick a feed for the photo content as shown in .

In a second step the social media widget responds to the communication. It queries approved social media items from the Tag It Library for batches of a predetermined number of one or more tagged items. For example the predetermined number can be 4. If the system finds more than a predetermined number of tagged social media items for a specific campaign for example if the predetermined number is 4 and it found 6 items the system grabs the necessary number of items for the rotation and recycled amongst Tagged Social Media items. It receives the tagged items from the Tag It Library. It displays items for designated batch on the content display or Social Mashup as is described in the figure. Once all social media items have been displayed for an ad campaign the Social Media Widget notifies the Ad Widget to query for the next Ad Campaign hence starting the process again.

In one embodiment if the system does not find any tagged items the system will retrieve a predetermined number of untagged social media items from the approved queue to display. If the system finds less than a predetermined number of tagged items i.e. a set of 3 the system will retrieve the remaining social media items in this case from the approved queue in order to complete its batch while an ad campaign is displayed.

At stage social media data is filtered for content resources that match one or more search terms. A user can generate one or more filters by using search terms. The search terms can be used to search social media data such as the data on Facebook Instagram and Twitter. The terms are compared to each piece of data on these platforms and if the terms match or are responsive to the content the content is pulled from these platforms. In one embodiment a hashtag or any other symbol can be used a part of the search terms.

At stage a feed is generated based on the filtering wherein the feed includes the content resources that match the search terms. The user can generate multiple feeds based on different search terms. A single feed can also include multiple search terms. Once a feed is generated which includes one or more search terms it can be continuously updated to include any new content resources that match or are responsive to the search terms in the feed.

At stage a content resource tag with is associated each content resource the content resource tag describing the content resource. The tag can be associated with the content resource in a number of ways as describe above. The user can manually tag each content resource based on the text or the images in the content resource. The user can select one or more tags to use to tag the content resource. In one embodiment the content resources can be automatically tagged using text recognition and or image recognition.

In one embodiment the curation system and or engagement system can be used for creating and visualizations. It provides a way for both non technical users and developers to customize visualizations. Visualizations created within the system can be embedded in any web page. It also provides a novel way of loading the visualizations to minimize the amount of data that must be transferred.

The engagement system may be a server visualization loader. The server visualization loader can include a visualization controller and generated visualization style. The visualization controller can be JavaScript and get as input visualization data sources and visualization structure which can be html. The generated visualization style can be CSS and can receive the visualization settings the visualization style and the global less library.

Every visual has an underlying template. The template defines a default HTML CSS JS implementation. It also has a set of settings that can be configured including colors text and images. The templates are grouped into categories for organizational purposes. A template can also have themes. Each theme provides one or more of HTML CSS JS. These implementations will override the template implementation when that theme is selected. Template settings provide a definition for all of the configuration options available for a given template. These definitions include type of setting default value and validation requirements. An instance is a concrete implementation of a template. An instance can also define one or more of HTML CSS JS. If any of these are defined on the instance the will overwrite what is defined on the theme or template. The instance also contains a set of setting values. This set contains values for the definitions found in the template settings as well as custom settings defined for that specific instance. Data sources define what data is going to be available for the instance. Data sources can be searches within Zoomph analytical data or external API s.

In one embodiment the curation system or engagement system can perform a process that includes filtering social media data for content resources that match one or more search terms. The social media data can be a part of a social media feed. The process can further include providing the content resources to a user interface of a client device. The process can further include receiving a selection of one or more of the content resources. The process can further include receiving a selection to create a new visual based on data received creating a visualization instance and providing the visualization instance to be displayed on the user interface. The visualizations template can be selected by the user to be displayed. The visualizations can be displayed on a number of different user interfaces. The process in which the visualizations are built is described further below.

In one embodiment the curation system or engagement system can perform a process that includes filtering social media data for content resources that match one or more search terms receiving visualization settings at a server visualization loader identifying visualization data sources creating a visualization controller from the visualization data sources visualization structure and visualization settings providing to a visualization instance manager the visualization controller and generated visualization style and creating with the visualization instance manager a visualization instance based on the visualization controller and generated visualization style.

In another embodiment the curation system or engagement system can perform a process that includes electing all elements on a webpage by a client loader that have a first attribute and make a request to a server loader for a visualization manager including the value of all of the attributes. for each of the visual identifications sent with the request look up the html less js settings and data sources by a server loader running at the server loader each of a number of styles through a style generator with the associated settings building by the server loader the client instance manager and injecting the generated styles with the controllers Appending the styles for each of the loaded instances into a head of the webpage by the client instance manager Wait for the page to finish loading its own elements at the client instance manager Expose an API for interacting with instances at the client instance manger and Construct each of the Visual Instances using the controller at the client instance manager.

In another embodiment the curation system or engagement system can perform a process that includes filtering social media data for content resources providing the content resources to a user interface receiving a selection to create a new visual based on the content resources creating a visualization instance based on settings associated with the new visual and providing the visualization instance to be displayed on the user interface.

In another embodiment the curation system or engagement system can perform a process that includes identifying social media data for content resources based on preferences receiving a selection to create a new visual for the content resources identifying advertisements associated with the content resources creating a visualization instance for the advertisements or the content resources based on settings associated with the new visual providing the visualization instance to be displayed on the user interface. A user can select to create a visual for the advertisements in addition to the social media content resources.

In one embodiment there is an advanced edit screen for the visualizations. From here a user can edit the raw value of the settings they saw in the other screens edit the data sources ties in with the precompute backend and edit the structure style functionality.

Every visual that a user can create is tied to a Template. A template provides a default structure style functionality. Templates can have one or more Themes. Each theme can override one or more of the structure style functionality. After a new visual is created through the process I outlined in the previous document one or more of the structure style functionality can be overridden through the Advanced Edit screen seen below.

Settings that start with an will be used to override the less variables that are in the first few lines of the CSS pane.

The first step of the visualization loader is to retrieve all of the information relating to each visual from the database. This data includes the id structure html style less functionality controller js controller settings style settings less variable and data sources.

Data sources correlate to data endpoints within the back end. These could return searches in Zoomph data analytical information or hooks into external API s. Zoomph searches and analytical information are implemented using the pre compute backend.

In one implementation the visualization manager does the following in order 1 Load any additional external resources required by the visualization instances 2 Inject the styles for each of the instances into the client page s head 3 Wait for the page to finish loading 4 Run the constructor for each of the visualization instances.

In another implementation there will be an API for each visual instance so that external JavaScript on the page can interact with individual instances.

In many fields generating an accurate prediction for an unknown variable based on one or more known variables can provide valuable information. For example predicting demographic information for 30 000 people in a stadium based on limited information concerning the individuals in the crowd can be very helpful in selecting appropriate advertisements to be displayed on display screens including jumbotron television screens for example located in the stadium. In another example knowledge of the demographics of people reacting to a marketing campaign on social media can be helpful in market research. However in many instances obtaining accurate information can be difficult. Some existing systems generate a prediction for an unknown characteristic by using simple predictive formulas. For example many systems use a majority based predictive method to assign characteristics to individuals in a group. For example such a system might use the fact that 72 of people having the first name Taylor are female although 28 of people having the first name Taylor are male and assign Female to any individual in the group having the first name Taylor. Clearly for any particular individual named Taylor there is a significant probability that such a system will produce an incorrect result.

Accordingly there is a need for systems and methods capable of producing more accurate predictions of demographic information for individuals in a target audience.
