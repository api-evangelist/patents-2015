The present invention is directed to the use of selected pyrazolopyrimidine compounds having Mer tyrosine kinase MerTK inhibitory activity as anti infective agents immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory agents anti cancer agents including against MerTK tumors and ITD and TKD mutant forms of Acute Myeloid Leukemia AML and as adjunctive agents in combination with chemotherapeutic radiation or other standard of care for neoplasms.

MerTK is a member of a receptor tyrosine kinase RTK family known as TAM which also includes AXL and TYRO3. Each member of the TAM family contains an extracellular domain a transmembrane domain and a conserved intracellular kinase domain. MerTK was first discovered in the laboratory of H. Shelton Earp at the University of North Carolina in 1994 Graham et al. Cloning and mRNA expression analysis of a novel human proto oncogene c mer. 5 647 657 1994 . The TAM family members undergo ligand induced homodimerization followed by catalytic tyrosine kinase activation and intracellular signaling. Cross phosphorylation has also been demonstrated within this RTK family suggesting heterodimerization can occur also. These RTKs are widely expressed in many epithelial tissues and in cells of the immune nervous and reproductive systems. MerTK was given its name by the Earp laboratory because it was found to be expressed in monocytes and in tissues of epithelial and reproductive tissue.

As described in more detail below ligand bound MerTK can complex with phosphatidyl serine and it binds apoptotic cells which triggers ingestion and suppresses inflammatory cytokines. It is aberrantly expressed in certain cancers for example acute leukemia ALL and AML and some solid tumors for example melanoma breast cancer colon cancer non small cell lung carcinoma glioblastoma and others .

The MerTK ligands include growth arrest specific 6 protein GAS6 Chen et al 1997 14 2033 2039 protein S tubby and tubby like protein 1 TULP1 and galectin 3. Several of these ligands are present in serum and expressed locally in a number of tissues. These ligands bind to the extracellular domain of MerTK resulting in tyrosine kinase activation.

Since the discovery of MerTK in the Earp laboratory in 1994 there has been a growing body of literature and patents that suggest the possibility of MerTK as a druggable target for a number of indications.

TAM receptor tyrosine kinases have been investigated for their involvement in certain infectious diseases. Shimojima et al. reported the involvement of members of the Tyro3 receptor tyrosine kinase family Axl Dkt and MerTK in the cell entry of filoviruses Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus and concluded that each Tyro3 family member is likely a cell entry factor in the infection Tyro3 Family mediated Cell Entry of Ebola and Marburg Viruses October 2006 p. 10109 10116 .

U.S. Pat. No. 8 415 361 to Lemke et al. claiming priority to a Nov. 9 2007 provisional application assigned to The Salk Institute for Biological Studies describes the use of TAM receptor inhibitors as antimicrobials. In particular the 361 patent reports that inhibition of the TAM pathway in virally infected macrophages from TAM triple knock out mice leads to reduced levels of infection with a variety of pseudotyped viruses with either filoviral retroviral or rhabdoviral glycoproteins. Brindley et al. reported that in a bioinformatics based screen for cellular genes that enhance Zaire ebolavirus ZEBOV transduction AXL mRNA expression strongly correlated with ZEBOV infection Tyrosine kinase receptor Axl enhances entry of Zaire ebolavirus without direct interactions with the viral glycoprotein 415 2011 83 84 .

Morizono et al published that Gas6 mediates binding of the virus to target cells by bridging virion envelope phosphatidyl serine to Axl on the target cells. Replication of vaccinia virus which was previously reported to use apoptotic mimicry to enter cells is enhanced by Gas6 and Morizono asserts that these results reveal an alternative molecular mechanism of viral entry that can broaden host range and enhance infectivity of enveloped viruses The Soluble Serum Protein Gas6 Bridges Virion Envelope Phosphatidylserine to the TAM Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Axl to mediate Viral Entry 9 286 298 2011 . In 2014 Morizono and Chen reported that virus binding by viral envelope phosphatidyl serine is a viral entry mechanism generalized to a number of families of viruses Morizono and Chen Role of Phosphatidyl Receptors in Enveloped Virus Infection Vol 88 8 4275 4290 Jan. 29 2014 .

WO2013 124324 filed by Amara et al. priority date Feb. 21 2012 and assigned to Institut National De La Sante et De La Recherche Medicale reports that Dengue virus is mediated by the interaction between phosphatidylserine at the surface of the Dengue viral envelope and TAM receptors present at the surface of the host cell and that such interaction can be blocked thereby inhibiting entry of Dengue into host cells. They also report that the interaction between phosphatidyl serine and TAM receptors is used by other flaviviruses such as Yellow Fever West Nile and perhaps Chikungunya. Amara focuses on antisense siRNA and antibody approaches.

Similarly Bhattacharayya et al. reports that several human viruses for example Ebola Dengue and HIV externalize PtdSer on their capsid during budding and use phosphatidylserine to bind to and activate TAM RTKs in the presence of TAM ligands allowing entry of the virus into cells and furthermore activation of MerTK in macrophages in response to viral particles expressing PtdSer stimulates an anti inflammatory cytokine profile as if apoptotic material was being ingested thereby inhibiting the anti viral immune response. Bhattacharayya et al observe that TAM receptors are engaged by viruses to attenuate type 1 interferon signaling Enveloped viruses disable innate immune responses in dendritic cells by direct activation of TAM receptors 14 136 147 2013 .

MerTK is ectopically expressed or overexpressed in a number of hematologic and epithelial malignant cells. Expression of MerTK and GAS6 correlates with poor prognosis and or chemoresistance in these tumor types. The mechanisms by which increased MerTK signaling in tumor cells contributes to tumor malignancy however remain unclear.

In January 2012 Liu J et al. published a comparison of the activity of forty four pyrazolopyrimidine compounds against MerTK Axl and Tyro3 kinases. One of these compounds UNC569 was tested for inhibition of MerTK autophosphorylation in human B ALL cells Discovery of Novel Small Molecule Mer Kinase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. 2012 Feb. 9 3 2 129 134 . In May 2013 Schlegel et al. published results on the pyrazolopyrimidine compound UNC1062 which reduced activation of MERTK mediated downstream signaling induced apoptosis in culture reduced colony formation in soft agar and inhibited invasion of melanoma cells MER receptor tyrosine kinase is a therapeutic target in melanoma. 2013 May 123 5 2257 67 .

In December 2013 Zhang W. et al. also published a comparison of the activity of forty six 5 arylpyrimidine based compounds for treatment of tumors Pseudo cyclization through intramolecular hydrogen bond enables discovery of pyridine substituted pyrimidines as new Mer kinase inhibitors. . vol. 56 9683 9692 2013 . These pyrimidine compounds were identified using a pseudo ring replacement strategy based on the previously identified pyrazolopyrimidine MerTK inhibitor UNC569.

In July 2013 Liu J et al. published the first evidence of anti tumor activity mediated by a member of this novel class of inhibitors. Specifically the pyrazolopyrimidine compound UNC1062 inhibited MerTK phosphorylation and colony formation in soft agar UNC1062 a new and potent Mer inhibitor. 2013 July 65 83 93 . In November 2013 Christoph S. et al. published effects of a pyrazolopyrimidine UNC569 in ALL and ATRT atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors ATRT UNC569 a novel small molecule Mer inhibitor with efficacy against acute lymphoblastic leukemia in vitro and in vivo. 2013 November 12 11 2367 77 . The MerTK inhibitors UNC569 and UNC1062 have the following structures 

An important observation was made in 2013 that MerTK knock out mice are less susceptible to tumor growth than normal mice. MerTK is normally expressed in myeloid lineage cells where it acts to suppress pro inflammatory cytokines following ingestion of apoptotic material. It was found that MerTK leukocytes exhibit lower tumor cell induced expression of wound healing cytokines IL 10 and GAS6 and enhanced expression of acute inflammatory cytokines IL 12 and IL 6 . Further intratumoral CD8 lymphocytes are increased. The loss of MerTK in the tumor microenvironment in Mer mice slowed the establishment growth and metastasis of mammary tumors and melanomas in immune competent syngeneic mice. Cook R. S. et al. MerTK inhibition in tumor leukocytes decreases tumor growth and metastasis 123 3231 3242 2013 .

Linger et al. have also presented data demonstrating increased MerTK expression in E2A PBX11 and other cytogenetic subgroups of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia B ALL and that MerTK inhibition may attenuate prosurvival and proliferation signaling Linger et al. Mer receptor tyrosine kinase is a therapeutic target in pre B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia vol. 122 9 1599 1609 2013. Lee Sherick et al. Efficacy of a Mer and Flt3 tyrosine kinase small molecule inhibitor UNC1666 in acute myeloid leukemia Advance Publications 2015 Feb. 10 2015 have reported that UNC 1666 a pyrrolopyrimidine decreases oncogenic signaling and myeloid survival in AML.

TAM Tyro3 Axl Mer receptor tyrosine kinases have also been investigated for their involvement in platelet aggregation. In 2004 Chen et al from the Johnson Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development published that MerTK presumably through activation by its ligand Gas6 participates in the regulation of platelet function in vitro and platelet dependent thrombosis in vivo. Chen et al Arterioscler. Thromv. Vase. Biol. 1118 1123 June 2004. Chen reported that PtdSer on aggregating platelets activates MerTK helping to stabilize clot formation. MerTK knockout mice have decreased platelet aggregation while maintaining normal bleeding times and coagulation parameters. Consequently these mice appear to be protected from thrombosis without concomitant increased spontaneous bleeding see also Angelillo Scherrer A et al. Role of Gas6 receptors in platelet signaling during thrombus stabilization and implications for antithrombotic therapy. J. Clin. Invest. 2005 115 2 237 246 .

In 2007 Sather et al. reported that membrane bound MerTK is cleaved in the extracellular domain via a metalloproteinase to produce a soluble MerTK that decreased platelet aggregation in vitro and prevented fatal collagen epinephrine induced thromboembolism. A soluble form of the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase inhibits macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells and platelet aggregation Vol 109 3 1026 1033 .

Paolino et al. have reported on the treatment of wild type NK cells with a newly developed small molecule TAM kinase inhibitor LDC1267 that conferred therapeutic potential and efficiently enhancing anti metastatic NK cell activity in vivo. Oral or intraperitoneal administration using this TAM inhibitor markedly reduced murine mammary cancer and melanoma metastases dependent on NK cells. See Paolino M. et al. The E3 ligase Cbl b and TAM receptors regulate cancer metastasis via natural killer cells Nature vol. 507 508 512 2014. LDC1267 is a highly selective TAM kinase inhibitor with ICof 

Bernsmeier et al. have noted that characteristics of decompensated cirrhosis and acute on chronic liver failure ACLF include susceptibility to infection immune paresis and monocyte dysfunction. The authors found that the number of monocytes and macrophages that expressed MerTK was greatly increased in circulation livers and lymph nodes of patients with ACLF. They found that addition of a substituted pyrazolopyrimidine UNC569 see WO 2011 146313 filed by Wang et al. and assigned to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill page 25 restored production of inflammatory cytokines.

A further embodiment of the invention is a compound of Formula I and II as described herein in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Compounds are described using standard nomenclature. Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

The compounds in any of the Formulas described herein include enantiomers mixtures of enantiomers diastereomers tautomers racemates and other isomers such as rotamers as if each is specifically described.

The terms a and an do not denote a limitation of quantity but rather denote the presence of at least one of the referenced item. The term or means and or . Recitation of ranges of values are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range unless otherwise indicated herein and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. The endpoints of all ranges are included within the range and independently combinable. All methods described herein can be performed in a suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of examples or exemplary language e.g. such as is intended merely to better illustrate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention unless otherwise claimed.

In one embodiment the present invention includes compounds of Formula I II III or IV and the use of compounds with at least one desired isotopic substitution of an atom at an amount above the natural abundance of the isotope i.e. enriched. Isotopes are atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers i.e. the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons.

Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorous fluorine and chlorine such as H H C C C N F P P S Cl I respectively. The invention includes various isotopically labeled compounds as defined herein for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H C and C are present. Such isotopically labelled compounds are useful in metabolic studies with C reaction kinetic studies with for example H or H detection or imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography PET or single photon emission computed tomography SPECT including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular an F labeled compound may be particularly desirable for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

By way of general example and without limitation isotopes of hydrogen for example deuterium H and tritium H may be used anywhere in described structures. Alternatively or in addition isotopes of carbon e.g. C and C may be used. A typical isotopic substitution is deuterium for hydrogen at one or more locations on the molecule to improve the performance of the drug for example the pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics biodistribution half life stability AUC Tmax Cmax etc. For example the deuterium can be bound to carbon in a location of bond breakage during metabolism an deuterium kinetic isotope effect or next to or near the site of bond breakage a deuterium kinetic isotope effect .

Isotopic substitutions for example deuterium substitutions can be partial or complete. Partial deuterium substitution means that at least one hydrogen is substituted with deuterium. In certain embodiments the isotope is 90 95 or 99 or more enriched in an isotope at any location of interest. In one embodiments deuterium is 90 95 or 99 enriched at a desired location. Unless otherwise stated the enrichment at any point is above natural abundance and enough to alter a detectable property of the drug in a human.

In one embodiment the substitution of a hydrogen atom for a deuterium atom occurs within an R group when at least one of the variables within the R group is hydrogen e.g. H or D or alkyl e.g. CD . For example when any of R groups are or contain for example through substitution methyl or ethyl the alkyl residue is typically deuterated e.g. CD CHCDor CDCD. In certain other embodiments when any of the above mentioned R groups are hydrogen the hydrogen may be isotopically enriched as deuterium i.e. H .

A dash that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example C O NHis attached through carbon of the keto C O group.

Examples of antibiotics include but are not limited to cefotaxime Claforan ofloxacin Floxin norfloxacin Noroxin or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole Bactrim Septra .

It has also been discovered that the compounds described herein can be used as immunomodulatory agents that reverse the MerTK induced suppression of proinflammatory cytokines such as wound healing cytokines IL 10 and GAS6 and enhance the expression of acute inflammatory cytokines IL 12 and IL 6 . In this way the pyrazolopyrimidine compounds can re normalize or re program the host microenvironment in the diseased tissue area to attack the diseased cells. This immunostimulatory activity can be used therapeutically to treat a host with a tumor cancer or other neoplasm or alternatively to treat a host with an infection for example a viral or bacterial infection.

Taking advantage of the immunostimulatory activity of the compounds described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition salt isotopic analog or prodrug thereof may be used for the treatment of a MERTK negative tumor or cancer. In one embodiment the cancer is a MERTK negative breast cancer.

Therefore as part of the invention one or more of the compounds disclosed herein can be used as adjunctive therapy for its immunostimulatory effect as a means to increase the efficacy of the antineoplastic standard of care therapies such as chemotherapeutic compounds or radiation.

In another aspect of the invention one or more of the compounds disclosed herein can be used as adjunctive therapy for its immunostimulatory effect as a means to increase the efficacy of the antiviral or antibacterial standard of care therapies.

For example a compound of Formula I II III or IV or another compound as described herein is administered to a host in an immunomodulatory effective amount to inhibit Mer tyrosine kinase activity in the host s tumor associated macrophage to suppress tumor immunity. In one embodiment the dosage of the Mer TKI administered as an immunomodulatory agent to stimulate innate anti tumor immunity is lower than a dosage of a Mer TKI administered to a host as a direct anti cancer agent. In one embodiment the Mer TKI is administered at a dosage which exhibits immunomodulatory but not direct cytotoxic effect.

In one embodiment the cancer is a MERTK negative cancer. In one embodiment the MerTK inhibitory compound administered is UNC2207A.

Without wanting to be bound by any particular theory it is believed that the administration of a chemotherapeutic agent results in the apoptosis of tumor cells exposing antigenic tumor proteins. The host s innate immune system is thus stimulated to recognize the antigenic apoptotic components from the tumor cells after chemotherapy or ionizing radiation and mount an immune response. In one embodiment the administration of a chemotherapeutic agent or ionizing radiation before with or subsequently followed by the administration of a Mer TKI is carried out using the normal standard of care chemotherapeutic protocol. In another embodiment the standard of care protocol of the chemotherapeutic is changed in a manner that causes less toxicity to the host due to the adjunctive or synergistic activity of the Mer TKI.

In one embodiment a method for the treatment of a tumor is provided that includes administering an effective amount of a Mer TKI to inhibit TK signaling in a tumor associated macrophage without inhibiting the survival signal in the tumor itself. In this way the Mer TKI can be used to ramp up the immune response to the tumor by inhibiting macrophage tumorogenic tolerance during normal tumor chemotherapeutic agent. The immunomodulatory dosage of the Mer TKI can be given prior to with or after chemotherapeutic therapy and can be used simultaneously with or intermittently with the chemotherapeutic therapy. In one embodiment less chemotherapeutic therapy is needed than the normal standard of care defined for that chemotherapeutic agent due to the increased efficacy of the immune response in the surrounding tumor microenvironment.

In one embodiment the dose used to induce an immunomodulatory effect in a host is between about 0.5 mg and about 150 mg. In one embodiment the dose is about 1 mg about 2 mg about 3 mg about 4 mg about 5 mg about 10 mg about 12 mg about 15 mg about 20 mg about 25 mg about 30 mg about 35 mg about 40 mg about 45 mg about 50 mg about 55 mg about 60 mg about 65 mg about 70 mg about 75 mg about 80 mg about 85 mg about 90 mg about 95 mg about 100 mg about 110 mg about 125 mg about 140 mg or about 150 mg.

Active compounds as described herein used in a dosage for direct effect on the diseased cell can be used in combination with one or more immunotherapy agents for additive or synergistic efficacy against solid tumors. In one embodiment a tumor associated macrophage MerTK inhibiting amount of a Mer TKI is used in combination or alternation with the immunomodulatory agent. In another embodiment a host tumor survival signal inhibiting antiviral or antibacterial amount of a Mer TKI is used in combination or alternation with the immunomodulatory agent.

Immunomodulators are small molecules or biologic agents that treat a disease by inducing enhancing or suppressing the host s immune system. In the present application one or more immunomodulators are selected that induce or enhance the host s immune system. Some immunomodulators boost the host s immune system and others help train the host s immune system to better attack tumor cells. Other immunomodulators target proteins that help cancer grow.

Three general categories of immunotherapies are antibodies cancer vaccines and non specific immunotherapies. Antibodies are typically administered as monoclonals although that is not required. Naked monoclonal antibodies work by attaching to antigens on tumor cells. Some antibodies can act as a marker for the body s immune system to destroy the tumor cells. Others block signaling agents for tumor cells. Antibodies can generally be used to bind to any signaling or metabolic agent that directly or indirectly facilitates tumor growth. Examples are alemtuzumab Campath which binds to CD52 antigen and trastuzumab Herceptin which binds to the HER2 protein.

In another embodiment an antibody can be used that is conjugated to another moiety that increases it delivery or efficacy. For example the antibody can be connected to a cytotoxic drug or a radiolabel. Conjugated antibodies are sometimes referred to as tagged labeled or loaded . Radiolabeled antibodies have small radioactive particles attached to them. Examples are Zevalin which is an antibody against CD20 used to treat lymphoma. Chemolabeled antibodies are antibodies that have cytotoxic agents attached to them. Examples are Adcetris which targets CD30 and Kadcyla which targets HER2. Ontak while not an antibody is similar in that it is interleukin 2 attached to a toxin from diphtheria.

Another category of immunotherapy that can be used in the present invention is a cancer vaccine. Most cancer vaccines are prepared from tumor cells parts of tumor cells or pure antigens. The vaccine can be used with an adjuvant to help boost the immune response. An example is Provenge which is the first cancer vaccine approved by the US FDA. The vaccine can for example be a dendritic cell vaccine or a vector based vaccine

Nonspecific tumor immunotherapies and adjuvants include compounds that stimulate the immune system to do a better job at attacking the tumor cells. Such immunotherapies include cytokines interleukins interferons primarily but can be also or . Specific agents include granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF IL 12 IL 7 IL 21 drugs that target CTLA 4 such as Yervoy which is Ipilimumab and drugs that target PD 1 or PDL 1 such as for example nivolumab BMS pembrolizumab Merck pidilizumab CureTech Teva AMP 244 Amplimmune GSK BMS 936559 BMS and MEDI4736 Roche Genentech .

Other drugs that boost the immune system are thalidomide lenalidomide pomalidomide the Bacille Calmette Gurin bacteria and Imiquimod. Additional therapeutic agents that can be used in combination with the MerTK inhibitor include bispecific antibodies chimeric antigen receptor CAR T cell therapy and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.

UNC1062 a novel orally bioavailable and potent MERTK selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI was evaluated in preclinical models of melanoma both alone and in combination with vemurafenib a mutant B RAF TKI . B RAF wildtype HMCB and B RAF mutant G361 cell lines were treated with UNC TKI or vehicle. Downstream signaling was evaluated by immunoblotting and induction of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry in cells stained with YO PRO 1 iodide and propidium iodide. Alternatively cells were seeded in media containing UNC1062 or vehicle and colony formation was determined. Treatment with MRX6313induced apoptosis and reduced colony growth in both B RAF wild type and B RAF mutant cell lines with concentrations as low as 300 nM resulting in an almost complete block in colony formation. In addition MerTK inhibition reduced activation of downstream pro survival signaling pathways known to play roles in melanoma including ERK AKT and STAT6. Importantly combined treatment with UNC1062 and vemurafenib completely abrogated these signaling pathways in a BRAF mutant cell line and increased apoptosis relative to the single agents consistent with the idea that MerTK inhibition may provide additional therapeutic advantage when combined with vemurafenib in patients with B RAF mutant melanomas. Taken together these studies validate UNC TKI as a potential treatment for both B RAF wild type and B RAF mutant melanomas and provide data supporting continued development of UNC1062 for treatment of melanoma.

In this example the activity of a MerTK inhibitor is examined on tumor growth in autochthonous murine tumor models. Mer TKI is assessed in immune competent genetically engineered murine models GEMMs . Activity is tested in RAS driven INK4a Arf null melanoma GEMM TRIA mice. The efficacy of 15 chemotherapeutic and or targeted regimens in a large 220 cohort of TRIA mice has previously been tested Clinical Cancer Research 18 5290 2012 . The overall response is 10 partial responses and stable disease . There are no complete responses. A combination of MEK AZD 6244 and PI3K mTOR BEZ235 inhibitors are the most active previous regimen responses seen in 9 18 mice 50 with 0 CRs with moderate toxicity.

In this study the interaction between a novel MerTK selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI and AZD 4547 an FGFR TKI in NSCLC cell lines is studied. Colo699 MerTK FGFR and H226 MerTK FGFR NSCLC cells are cultured for 14 days in soft agar in the presence of Mer TKI and or AZD 4547 alone or in combination and colonies are stained and counted. Changes in the activity of downstream signaling pathways including PI3K AKT MEK ERK and STAT proteins are evaluated by immunoblotting.

In this example preclinical testing of Mer TKIs as a potential therapy for MERTK expressing ALL is disclosed. Mer TKI inhibition of phosphorylation activation of MerTK is tested in 697 B ALL cells. Mer TKIs are tested in several mouse models including an orthotopic B ALL xenograft model of minimal residual disease and a similar model of existent disease in which leukemia is established for 14 days prior to initiation of treatment. In both models tumor burden is measured by bioluminescent imaging.

The effects of Mer TKI treatment on activation of MerTK and related members of the TAM family of kinases Axl and Tyro3 and effects on downstream proliferative and pro survival signaling pathways are analyzed by immunoblot. In addition Mer TKI mediated anti tumor activity is determined in a panel of NSCLC cell lines using soft agar and clonogenic assays. Cells are stained with YoPro 1 iodide and propidium iodide dyes and induction of apoptosis is determined using flow cytometry. Finally a subcutaneous murine xenograft model is employed to determine therapeutic effects in vivo.

FLT 3 and Mer tyrosine kinases have been previously identified as potential targets in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia AML . Expression of FLT 3 internal tandem duplication ITD occurs in 30 40 of AML patient samples and MerTK overexpression has been detected in 80 100 . In this example a novel small molecule inhibitor is tested for activity against both of these kinases and the growth inhibition or apoptosis of cell lines and patient myeloblasts is examined. In these studies the effects of treatment with MER TKI are analyzed in FLT3 ITD positive Molm 13 and MV4 11 and MERTK positive Kasumi 1 and U937 AML cell lines and in primary AML patient samples with variable expression of FLT3 ITD and MerTK. AML cell lines are also stained with Yo Pro 1 iodide and propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine induction of apoptosis in response to treatment with Mer TKI. Primary patient samples that are MerTK and or FLT3 ITD positive are analyzed in similar assays.

To further investigate the utility of MerTK inhibition in the tumor microenvironment as a therapeutic strategy the efficacy of a Mer TKI is evaluated in immunocompetent C57Bl 6 mice implanted orthotopically with PyVmT mammary gland tumor cells. These PyVmT tumors cells do not express MerTK AXL or TYRO3.
