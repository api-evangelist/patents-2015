title: Fantasy sports integration with video content
abstract: Fantasy sports information may be integrated with video content of games or sporting events. An example technique includes determining one or more athletes on a roster of a fantasy sports team of a user, receiving video content of a game or sporting event, and identifying at least one athlete of interest that is on the roster of the fantasy sports team of the user depicted in the video content of the game or sporting event. The video content may then be displayed along with a visual indicator associated with the at least one athlete of interest to indicate that the athlete of interest is on the roster of the fantasy sports team of the user. The visual indicator may comprise a name, symbol, logo or other identifier of an entity, such as a sponsor of the game or sporting event.

No. 14 285 607 filed May 22 2014 now U.S. Pat. No. 9 056 253 which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 862 089 filed on Aug. 5 2013 and to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 826 485 filed on May 22 2013 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Fantasy sports have become increasingly popular. This is particularly true of fantasy football based on the National Football League NFL but is also true of other sports. When creating fantasy teams participants today typically go to a fantasy sports website or application create an account and then specify a league that they wish to join frequently organized by their friends. Depending on the sport there may be an opportunity for participants to select or draft athletes at the beginning of a fantasy season. Thereafter participants may select the athletes from their roster that they want to play on a given day week while benching other athletes. As actual games are being played in different cities and times across the country or world fantasy sports participants watch their scores fluctuate relative to an opponent as their athletes do well or poorly in their actual games. Fantasy sports participants may also watch one or more of the actual games often flipping back and forth between various actual games in which the athletes on their fantasy teams are participating. In fantasy football the week may conclude with Monday Night Football after which the winners and losers of that week s play are known.

As discussed above existing fantasy sports outlets e.g. websites and or applications offer very limited ways in which participants can participate in and consume the fantasy sports experience. This application describes techniques and systems for providing a complete fantasy sports experience.

In one aspect the application describes a content rich fantasy sports experience in which users are able to consume content e.g. video audio images articles etc. associated with the athletes teams and leagues associated with their fantasy teams. For instance a user may be presented with a stream of video clips or segments associated with the user s fantasy sports team s . The stream of video segments may be composed of segments showing plays or other events that resulted in points for the user s fantasy team points for an opposing fantasy team points for one or more other participants in the user s fantasy league or otherwise affected a fantasy score of one or more athletes or teams. The stream of video segments may additionally or alternatively include segments corresponding to athletes teams leagues sports cheerleaders or other topics of interest to the user. The topics of interest may have been explicitly designated by the user and or may have been implicitly inferred based on one or more criteria. In some examples the video segments may be augmented by statistics commentary e.g. by analysts or other users images graphics articles or the like that are made available to the user e.g. via links in the video segments overlays on the video segments etc. . In some examples the stream of video segments may be continuously updated and served such that there is always a content stream available for the user to consume. The particular segments and the order of their presentation may be unique for each user.

The application also describes various other features that enhance the functionality ease of use customizability interactivity and numerous other aspects of the complete fantasy sports experience. Fantasy sports users already have a relatively high level of engagement with the existing limited fantasy sports offerings spending a considerable amount of time and energy researching athletes managing their fantasy teams and viewing score updates. However existing fantasy sports offerings fail to integrate video with user s fantasy sports teams. Rather existing offerings provide a primarily text based interface for viewing fantasy sports scores and information. The techniques described herein provide numerous enhancements that in some examples provide fantasy sports scores along with clips and other rich content tailored to the user s fantasy sports team s and other interests. For instance in some examples a user s fantasy sports points may be provided in association with one or more clips depicting plays or other events that resulted in awarding of the fantasy sports points to the user. Moreover in some examples the techniques described herein may provide users with content customized to them based on things that interest them such as athletes and other topics related to their fantasy sports teams. The custom content may comprise content from multiple different sources and may include segments from simultaneously occurring and or overlapping content. As such techniques described herein may provide users with a more efficient way of viewing content of interest to them. Additionally the techniques described herein may allow users to watch clips from multiple different sources and regions via one point of access. These enhancements have the potential to greatly increase the enjoyment of users and their fantasy sports experience.

Also while many of the examples are described in the context of providing a complete fantasy sports experience many of the aspects described herein are not limited to the fantasy sports context and have other applicability. For example while the stream of video segments is described as being related in some way to the user s participation in fantasy sports in other examples the stream of video segments may additionally or alternatively include segments that relate to other activities with which the user is associated or interested. For instance some or all of the stream of video segments may relate to a video game that the user plays a club or organization that the user belongs to a movie or television show that the user likes contacts and social acquaintances of the user etc. As other examples the application describes interleaving of commercials or advertisements into the fantasy sports content stream. However the techniques described herein relating to commercials or advertisements are also applicable to other contexts and are not limited to use with the fantasy sports content stream.

These and numerous other examples are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying figures.

In the illustrated example the interleaver service communicates with the content sources data sources ad sources and client devices over one or more wireless or wired networks or a combination thereof. By way of example and not limitation the networks may comprise over the air broadcast networks e.g. broadcast radio and television cable networks e.g. cable television and or internet networks telephone networks e.g. wired and cellular satellite networks e.g. satellite television networks local area networks e.g. Ethernet wifi etc. fiber optic networks or any other network capable of transmitting the content data ads and or custom content . The network s may be a collection of individual networks interconnected with each other and functioning as a single large network e.g. the Internet or an intranet . Further the individual networks may be wireless or wired networks or a combination thereof. In some instances e.g. receipt of certain content feeds the communication may be one way while in other instances communication between the interleaver service and the content sources data sources ad sources and or client devices may be two way.

In the context of fantasy sports the content may comprise audio and or video A V feeds of televised sporting events such as football games baseball games basketball games auto races soccer matches hockey games or the like. The content may be live or delayed and may be obtained from a plurality of games or other events which are being played simultaneously. The content may include actual game play instant replays sideline interviews discussion by commentators or hosts and other information. The data may include fantasy sports information such as fantasy leagues in which a user participates rosters of athletes on the user s fantasy team or the like. The advertisements may comprise advertisements included in the televised sporting events by a national or regional broadcaster of the sporting events advertisements from an ad agency or marketing firm internet advertisements or the like. The interleaver service receives the content data and advertisements as inputs processes this information as described in detail below and outputs customized content as clips or streams of clips of the sporting events to each of the client devices .

While the interleaver service content sources data sources and ad sources are shown as separate entities disposed at separate locations in other embodiments any or all of these components may be combined or integrated in whole or in part. For example the interleaver service may include an integral content source e.g. source of original content data source e.g. fantasy sports platform and or ad source e.g. ads for the interleaver service or a related business . In other examples a single source may provide content data and or ads.

The content may arrive at the interleaver service as AN feeds already segmented into clips. Alternatively the content may be segmented at the interleaver service . In the example shown a plurality of content streams e.g. Content A Content B . . . Content X are segmented into a plurality of segments e.g. segments A A A . . . A . . . B B . . . B . . . X X X . . . etc. . In the fantasy sports context each segment may include for example a play or down in football a pitch and associated play if any in baseball a shot or basket in basketball a lead change in auto racing a corner kick in soccer etc. In some instances several plays e.g. a football goal line defense a baseball strikeout or at bat a basketball possession including multiple shots on basket an auto racing lap etc. may be grouped into one segment.

The content may arrive at the interleaver service having metadata annotation or tagging that provides information about each clip. Alternatively the content may be annotated or tagged at the interleaver service . The tags or annotations may include for example information about the subject matter shown in each clip e.g. an athlete or athletes shown in the clip or that performed an action for which fantasy points are assigned or decremented a description of the events of the clip such as a touchdown in football a description of a game to which the clip corresponds a location depicted in the clip etc. . The tags or annotations may be used by the interleaver service to determine specific athletes teams or other subjects depicted in each individual clip. In some examples the clips e.g. A . . . X etc. may additionally or alternatively be tagged with fantasy information e.g. fantasy points attributable to a depicted event .

In the fantasy sports context the data may include fantasy information related to subscribers fantasy teams leagues rosters and the like. The data may be obtained from websites e.g. Yahoo ESPN CBS FOX the NFL RealTime etc. that host fantasy sports leagues. The data may also include league information such as the names of teams in a user s league the user s team roster other teams rosters the names of athletes that are fielded being played the names of athletes that are benched not played but held in reserve . The data may include win loss records of fantasy teams league standings a user s favorite real life teams favorite athletes and other information.

By parsing the fantasy information or other data corresponding to each user subscriber the interleaver service may determine subjects of interest to the subscriber. In some examples the interleaver service may determine that athletes on a user s fantasy roster s or rosters of opponents in the user s fantasy leagues would be of interest to the user. The interleaver service may then identify individual clips of incoming content having tags that match the subjects of interest to the user. The interleaver service may then output the clips of interest to the client device of the user as the feed of custom content . The clips of interest may be transmitted to the client device individually or may be combined with one or more other clips for transmission to the client device .

In some examples the interleaver service may also insert one or more ads at various locations in the custom content such as between clips in the middle of clips simultaneously with clips overlaid on top of clips or the like. The ads may include ads considered complementary or of interest to each particular user based upon the data corresponding to the particular user. The ads may be audio video and or still image ads. In the case of audio and or video ads the ads may be of varying length. In some examples the length of an ad inserted may depend on how long it has been since a previous ad was presented.

In the context of a fantasy football example the custom content may include clips e.g. audio video of football plays relevant to the user s fantasy football team e.g. touchdowns interceptions field goals etc. the user s opponent s fantasy team the user s favorite real life team the user s favorite athletes etc. interspersed with selected advertisements audio video and or still images . In some examples the ads may be relatively short ads e.g. of about 5 seconds to about 30 seconds inserted every few clips. In some instances one or more of the ads may be related to one another e.g. a sequence of related ads . Due to their short length users are less likely to stop watching because the content will resume very shortly. Additionally because the ads may be tailored to the user s interests the ads themselves may be of more interest to the user as well. Thus in some examples within a relatively short period of time e.g. 30 minutes a user may be presented with a number of relevant clips e.g. about 20 90 clips interspersed with a number of ads e.g. 10 30 ads .

In the illustrated example the memory includes a content manager which processes the incoming content from the content sources . The incoming content may comprise content from multiple concurrently airing broadcasts of sporting events for example. The content manager may include a segmenting module configured to segment the incoming content e.g. to break the content into short clips of individual plays or groups of plays . In some instance incoming content may already be segmented in which case the segmenting module may further segment the content or the content may not need to be segmented by the interleaver service . The content manager may also include a tagging module to tag the incoming content e.g. to identify one or more athletes teams locations events etc. depicted in each segment . The incoming content may be tagged prior to during or after the segmenting process. The tagging module may tag untagged segments add tags to previously tagged segments e.g. segments that were received with existing tags or replace previous tags with new tags. Once the incoming content is segmented and tagged by the content manager or otherwise the tagged content segments may be stored in a content store in the memory or another location accessible to the interleaver service . Segments and or segmenting information may be saved in the content store as separate files or combined in data structures or may be saved as metadata to the original incoming content.

The memory also includes a subscription manager which manages subscriptions of one or more users of the interleaver service . The subscription manager includes a profile manager and a weighting module . The profile manager may be configured to create and maintain a subscriber profile for each user. The subscriber profiles may include user information e.g. contact information demographic information etc. fantasy sports information e.g. information about fantasy sports athletes team s league s or account s of the user and or other information e.g. favorite real athletes or teams social network information etc. . The subscriber profiles may also include subscriptions to one or more topics of interest to the user. The topics of interest may have been explicitly identified by the user or may be inferred based on the user information the fantasy sports information or the other information. Each of the subscriptions to the topics of interest may be assigned a weight by the weighting module . The weight indicates a relative importance or interest level of the various topics of interest to the user. The weightings may be explicitly set by the user may be set according to a default weighting and or may be inferred based on the user information the fantasy sports information a history of user action or the like. The subscriber profiles may be stored in a subscription store in the memory or another location accessible to the interleaver service .

An interleaver module stored in the memory is responsible for identifying tagged segments to serve and or include in the custom content provided to the various users. The interleaver module includes a content selection module an ad insertion module . The content selection module identifies tagged segments that match subscriptions in subscriber profiles prioritizes the segments based on user preferences or weights in the subscriber profiles and generates a custom content stream for the user. The ad selection module identifies ads relevant to the respective subscriber profiles and inserts them into the custom content stream at appropriate locations.

The interleaver module also includes a packaging module that formats the segments of the custom content stream and prepares them for transmission to client devices. For instance the packaging module may break segments into multiple packets and or insert multiple segments and or ads into a packet or package. The segments are then placed into a queue for transmission to the particular user. In the illustrated example the interleaver module administers content queues e.g. queue queue . . . queue N corresponding to each user of the interleaver service. Thus the queue for each user may contain tagged segments and ads packaged for transmission to a client device of the respective user as a custom content stream. In other examples rather than storing individual copies of segments and ads in the queues for each user the queue for each user may simply include a pointer or other reference to a common centralized copy of each segment or ad. The tagged segments and ads remain in the respective user s queue or in a centralized store to which the pointer or reference in the queue is directed until they are transmitted to the user s client device. Before they are transmitted to the client devices an order of content segments and ads may be reordered based on various priorities and user preferences e.g. relevance to the user vs. freshness of the segments . A serving module of the interleaver service is configured to transmit packets in an order indicated in each queue to the respective client device via one or more network connections e.g. wired or wireless connections etc. . The serving module may serve packets to the client devices as the packets become available i.e. are packaged and placed in the queue and or to maintain a predetermined clip buffer at each client device.

The memory also includes a buffer that includes one or more content segments and ads of the custom content stream. The content segments and ads are placed in the buffer when they are received via one or more network connections from the interleaver service . The content segments and ads remain in the buffer until they are played or otherwise consumed by the interleaver client application until they are deleted or until they are replaced by other content and or ads e.g. content and or ads that are more relevant and or fresher .

In the example of the content selection module identifies one or more tagged content segments as being relevant to a user of client device based on information in the user s subscriber profile . The ad insertion module then inserts one or more ads that are tailored to the user based on the user s subscriber profile. The tagged content segments and ads are then formatted by the packaging module and placed in queue corresponding to the user of client device . Then the serving module transmits one or more segments and or ads from the queue to the buffer of the client device . In the illustrated example the serving module transmits segments Xand Cand ad ADto the client device . The segments and ads may be pushed to the client device on a schedule determined by the interleaver service or they may be transmitted in response to a request from the client device . In some examples the segments and ads may be transmitted responsive to the buffer of the client device falling below a threshold fullness i.e. having less than a threshold number of segments or ads or less than a threshold length of custom content .

The segments Xand Cand ad ADmay then be played back by the interleaver client application in the order they were received in an order specified by the user in a priority order determined by the interleaver client application or the interleaver service or in any other suitable order.

While the modules are described herein as being software and or firmware executable by one or more processors in other embodiments any or all of the modules or functional blocks may be implemented in whole or in part by hardware e.g. as an application specific integrated circuit or ASIC a specialized processing unit a field programmable gate array or FPGA etc. to execute the described functions.

The memory of the interleaver service and or the memory of the client devices may comprise computer readable media and may take the form of volatile memory such as random access memory RAM and or non volatile memory such as read only memory ROM or flash RAM. Computer readable media includes volatile and non volatile removable and non removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions data structures program modules or other data for execution by one or more processors or circuits of a computing device. Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to phase change memory PRAM static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM other types of random access memory RAM read only memory ROM electrically erasable programmable read only memory EEPROM flash memory or other memory technology compact disk read only memory CD ROM digital versatile disks DVD or other optical storage magnetic cassettes magnetic tape magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other non transitory medium that can be used to store information for access by a computing device. As defined herein computer readable media does not include transitory media such as modulated data signals or carrier waves.

As shown in the segmenting module receives content from one or more content sources . In some cases content may come from a content source with predefined frames tracks chapters scenes or other segments as in the case of content A in . In that case the interleaver service may segment the content according to the predefined segments. Alternatively the segmenting module may create new segments which may include multiple of the predefined segments may include a portion of a predefined segment may span multiple predefined segments or may replace the predefined segments. In other cases as in the case of content B content may be received in a lengthy and or ongoing feed.

At block the segmenting module determines whether the content needs to be segmented. If the content is received in an un segmented fashion e.g. a large content file or a continuous stream or feed of content or if additional segmentation is necessary or desired e.g. if the predefined segments are to large or do not align with content of interest to the user at block the segmenting module may segment the content into one or more segments such as segments A or B. Additional details of segmentation are provided with reference to .

At block the tagging module may obtain one or more tags for each segment. While in this example the tagging is shown as being performed after segmentation in various examples the tagging may be performed prior to concurrently with and or after the segmenting. The tags may be obtained by extracting the tags from the content of the segments themselves or by receiving human input tags as described in further detail with reference to . Regardless of how the tags are obtained at block the tagging module may apply the tag s to the content segments A and or B. Once tagged the tagged content segments may be output to and stored in the content store .

Moreover content may be segmented in multiple different ways. For instance the portion of the content represented by frames A Ahas been segmented into three segments Seg. Seg. and Seg. that generally align with the predefined frames and has also been segmented into one larger segment Seg. that generally spans all three of the predefined frames. In the context of fantasy football Seg. Seg. and Seg. may generally correspond to three individual plays while Seg. may generally correspond to a sequence or series of plays e.g. a goal line stand or a series of downs or a single play with one or more instant replays celebrations etc. Alternatively Seg. may correspond to a reception while Seg. may correspond to the pass that resulted in the reception and Seg. corresponds to a touchdown by the receiver that caught the pass in Seg. . In that case Seg. may be considered a short version of the reception showing just the catch while Seg. may be considered a long version of the reception showing the series of events leading up to and following the reception. By segmenting content in multiple different ways the interleaver service may serve different versions to different users e.g. send the short version to users with slower connection speeds and or more limited data packages and send the larger version to users with faster connection speeds and or larger or unlimited data plans send short or long version based on user preferences send short or long version depending on which is more relevant to the user etc. .

Alternatively the interleaver service may send the long version of the content along with metadata designating both short and long segmentation and the interleaver client application on the client device may determine whether to play the short version or the long version based on one or more factors e.g. user preference relevance freshness amount of content in the buffer amount of content in the user s content queue at the interleaver service or the like . In one specific example the interleaver client application may determine to play the short version if the buffer is full e.g. over a threshold content size or number of clips otherwise play the long version. While in the foregoing examples two alternate segmentations i.e. long and short are described in other examples the content could include three or more segmentations.

While in the example of the series of frames constituting Seg. are contiguous and consecutive in other examples the segments may be composed of multiple non contiguous and or non consecutive frames or other portions of the content. Moreover segments may be composed of portions of multiple different content streams e.g. Seg. from may be combined with Seg. from to result in a new composite segment .

Regardless of the form of the incoming content and or the segmenting approach employed not all of incoming content is necessarily kept as a segment and or some segments may be discarded. Further in instances where the segments comprise metadata appended to or referencing the original content not all portions of the original content need be designated as a segment. In either case the result is that some portions of the original content e.g. huddles credits commercials etc. may be not segmented or may be segmented and then discarded.

The video includes recorded and or digitized video of the sporting event. The video may be raw unedited video e.g. a feed from one of multiple cameras filming the sporting event or it may be edited video e.g. a final or semi final version of video ready for consumption by consumers . While content includes a single feed of video i.e. images from a single camera or source in other examples video content may comprise multiple video feeds e.g. simultaneous video feeds from multiple cameras filming the same sporting event . As shown in the video includes one or more salient video segments and one or more non salient video segments . The salient video segments correspond to portions of the video that depict an event of interest while the non salient segments correspond to portions of the video that depict events of low interest. Generally the salient video segments depict subjects e.g. people places or things and or occurrences e.g. actions or events that are or are likely to be of interest to one or more users of the interleaver service . In the fantasy sports context salient video segments may include for example portions of the video that depict events for which statistics are maintained by an athletic governing body e.g. rushing yards in football strikeouts in baseball three point baskets in basketball etc. portions of video that depict events resulting in fantasy points being awarded or decremented. In some fantasy sports examples salient video segments may additionally or alternatively include portions of the video showing context of the sporting event or surroundings e.g. stadium cheerleaders sidelines halftime shows announcers analysts fights crashes in auto racing etc. . Non salient video segments generally relate to portions of the video of little or no interest to users. In the fantasy sports context non salient video segments may include for example portions of the video showing periods of inaction e.g. rain delays huddles timeouts etc. or errors or mistakes e.g. inadvertently recorded video showing the ground or the inside of the lens cap for instance blurred or obscured images scrambled or blank video feeds etc. . In some examples non salient video segments may include advertisements contained in the original video. However in other instances advertisements in the original content may be considered salient video segments .

The audio comprises an audio recording e.g. digital audio data corresponding to the video . The audio may comprise audio recorded by a microphone associated with a camera that recorded the video audio recorded by one or more announcer microphones audio from a studio announcer analyst or other audio. The audio may be recorded contemporaneously with the video i.e. live relative to the video or at a different time prior to or after the video. The audio may include one or more salient audio segments and one or more non salient audio segments . In some cases the salient and non salient audio segments may be temporally aligned with the salient and non salient video segments respectively. However in other cases such as that shown in the salient audio segments may be temporally offset from the salient video segments . This may be the case when for example a play unfolds and the announcer s description or analysis of the play does not begin until the play is in progress or complete. In that case the portion of the salient audio segment i.e. the announcer commentary or analysis may be delayed relative to the salient video segment i.e. the video depicting the play . In some instances the length of the salient audio segments may be of the substantially a same duration as the corresponding salient video segments . However in many cases the length of a salient audio segment will be different than that of the corresponding salient video segment. For instance often a salient video segment e.g. play occurs quickly and is of short duration while the salient audio segment is delayed and or more lengthy e.g. in the case of announcer description of the play followed by analyst discussion or explanation . In other instances the salient video segment may be longer than the corresponding salient audio segment. Further in some instances there may be no salient audio segment corresponding to a salient video segment e.g. when there is no announcer mention of a particular play or other event or vice versa e.g. when an announcer or analyst comments on an athlete or other topic that is not present in the video content .

The content in also includes metadata . Metadata take many forms including closed captioning data annotations textual audio video etc. bookmarks e.g. showing points of interest partitions e.g. frame or track boundaries editing data supplementary information e.g. index or table of contents scene or chapter designators credits etc. . In the illustrated example metadata includes closed captioning data comprising a textual representation of the audio . In this example the content was received with the metadata but in other examples the interleaver service may process the incoming content as it is received in near real time to add the metadata. Regardless of where the metadata is generated it may be generated manually e.g. entered by a transcriptionist automatically e.g. using a voice recognition speech to text program or semi automatically e.g. using a voice recognition speech to text program to generate a preliminary data which is then edited by one or more human administrators . The metadata may or may not be aligned temporally with the video and or audio . The metadata may include salient metadata and non salient metadata which may or may not correspond to salient and non salient audio and or video segments. In the example of since the metadata represents closed captioning data the metadata generally corresponds to the audio segments though may not align temporally with the corresponding audio segments .

In some examples all parts of the content e.g. audio video textual content images etc. may be segmented at a same time and or in a same segmenting operation. For instance the content may be divided into multiple parts based on time segments of a recording such that each segment is composed of whatever audio video text or other content is included within the particular time range of the segment. In other examples the various parts of the content may be separated and segmented separately. That is the audio may be separated from the other portions of content and the audio may be segmented using one or more audio segmenting techniques. Similarly the video and other portions of the content may each be segmented individually. Thereafter one or more salient audio video and or other segments may be aligned and recombined so as to provide segments having salient audio video and other content that are temporally aligned. For example as mentioned above salient video segment begins at a time in the content prior to salient audio segment which in turn begins prior to the corresponding salient metadata . In some examples the salient video segment salient audio segment and salient metadata may be aligned temporally. Aligning the various salient segments temporally may include aligning them to begin at a same time to end at a same time and or to be centered around a same midpoint in time.

In some examples the various salient segments may be of different lengths e.g. the salient audio segment may be longer than the salient video segment or vice versa . In some instances these differences in length may be acceptable or even desirable. However in other instances it may be desirable that the various salient segments that are to be combined be of the same or substantially the same length. In such cases a longer segment may be trimmed to match a length of a shorter segment a shorter segment may be supplemented with additional content or ads to reach the length of a longer segment or one or more of the segments may be sped up or slowed down to match the length of the other segment s .

In still other examples one or more portions of the original content may be omitted from the finished segments. For instance the original audio of the content may be omitted from the segments. In that case the finished segments may be free of audio entirely may be replaced by alternative audio e.g. an audio account of what is shown in the video commentary on what is shown in the video or the like .

The tag extraction module in this example includes a video extraction module an audio extraction module and a metadata extraction module . The tag extraction module may use any or all of these modules to automatically extract or discern subject matter depicted or described in the content.

The video extraction module may include one or more algorithms to perform facial recognition to identify faces of people depicted in video of the content. Facial recognition approaches employed by the video extraction module may include geometric approaches photometric approaches or other facial recognition approaches. By way of example and not limitation several specific facial recognition algorithms that may be used separately or in combination include the Principal Component Analysis using eigenfaces Linear Discriminate Analysis Elastic Bunch Graph Matching using the Fisherface algorithm the Hidden Markov model the Multilinear Subspace Learning using tensor representation and or the neuronal motivated dynamic link matching. In some examples the facial recognition may be performed with reference to a database of images e.g. images of athletes of one or more sports . Once a person is identified using facial recognition the segment may be tagged with the name position or other information about the identified person.

Additionally alternatively video extraction module may identify one or more images or other objects in the content. The object recognition may be performed based at least in part on the shape color and or contrast of objects in the video content. For instance the video extraction module may be able to identify objects such as sporting equipment e.g. a helmet a ball shoes a racket etc. structures e.g. buildings goals or goal posts baskets shot clock home plate etc. visible symbols or markings e.g. yard lines side lines base lines starting lines finish lines track turns etc. . In some examples the video extraction module may perform object recognition by analyzing the video content identifying one or more salient objects in one or more frames of the video and then comparing the salient object s to a database of known objects or object types. If the salient object s match known objects or object types the segment may be tagged as containing the known object or object type. Numerous machine vision techniques are available to perform object recognition depending on the object to be recognized.

Additionally alternatively video extraction module may perform optical character recognition OCR to identify one or more characters in images of printed computer generated or handwritten text e.g. signs names or numbers on jerseys scores time clocks tickers announcements etc. . The text thus recognized may be output as tags of the segment.

Furthermore in addition to extracting data directly from the content itself the tag extraction module may further use the extracted information as a query to search one or more other databases of information e.g. roster information statistics schedule information etc. . In some instances this additional information may be used to help disambiguate between multiple possible identifications. For instance the facial recognition algorithm may indicate that a video clip depicts one of multiple possible candidates but may not be able to definitively determine which person is actually depicted. An object recognition algorithm may also be used and may determine e.g. based on the uniform colors that the person belongs to a particular team. By querying a roster database the tag extraction module may determine that only one of the possible candidates plays for the particular team and in this way may determine the identify of the particular person.

In one specific example related to football the video extraction module may use object recognition to identify a ball carrier by recognizing the ball based on the color brown and or shape and may then determine an identity of the ball carrier using facial recognition by comparing the video content to a database of images of football players and or by using OCR to recognize a name or number on the player s jersey. The segment may then be tagged with a variety of tags such as the identity of the ball carrier the particular sport e.g. football a position of the ball carrier e.g. running back quarterback etc. a team for which the ball carrier plays any other athletes shown in the segment or the like. In other examples other information may be recognized in the segment and or included as a tag of the segment.

The audio extraction module may perform speech to text conversion on the audio content to determine one or more words that are being spoken in the audio content. The output of the speech to text conversion comprises text some or all of which may be used to tag the audio content or temporally aligned video content. In some examples the audio extraction module may select less than all of the output of the speech to text conversion for use as tags such as names e.g. athletes names team names announcer names etc. events for which statistics are kept and or fantasy potions are awarded e.g. touchdown homerun tackle goal score basket etc. locations etc.

Additionally or alternatively the audio extraction module may perform voice signature recognition sound recognition and or pattern recognition to identify a source of the respective voice sound and or pattern. For example the audio extraction module may compare a portion of audio content to a database of audio content such as a database of known voice samples e.g. of known athletes coaches announcers etc. or other known sounds common to various sporting events e.g. crowd noise field noise crack of a bat shot clock buzzer motor noises etc. . Prior to performing the comparison the audio extraction module may perform some pre processing to identify particular classes of audio e.g. speech motor noise etc. to isolate or enhance certain sounds or the like. In some examples the audio extraction module may analyze the video content identify one or more salient portions of the audio and then compare the salient portion of the audio to the database of known voice samples or other known sounds. If the salient audio matches known voices or sounds the segment may be tagged as containing the known voice or sound. Numerous audio processing techniques are available to perform voice signature sound and or pattern recognition.

The metadata extraction module may extract data metadata such as closed captioning information structure of the content such as audio and or video format compression resolution source information e.g. a broadcasting company website or other source of the content data information property right information e.g. copyright license information etc. annotations predefined segments e.g. frames chapters etc. or the like. The metadata extraction module may additionally or alternatively include subject matter recognition capabilities to determine or infer subject matter e.g. people places things events actions etc. included in content from the metadata. For instance if content includes closed captioning or other metadata including names of two athletes the metadata extraction module may query one or more other databases to determine which teams those two athletes are on when those two teams play each other the positions of the athletes or the like. From this the metadata extraction module may infer that the segment corresponds to a segment from a particular game between the two teams and that the two athletes are featured in the segment. Depending on the respective positions of the two athletes the metadata extraction module may also be able to infer something about the nature of the event depicted in the segment. For instance if one of the athletes is a kicker the metadata extraction module may infer that the play involved a kick. The information obtained by the metadata extraction module may be used alone or together with information obtained by the video and or audio extraction modules to tag the various segments with terms relevant to the segments.

The human input tag module provides one or more inputs from which the tagging module may receive human input tags. In the illustrated example the inputs include event inputs from sporting event personnel such as referees umpires replay officials statistics keepers or other personnel associated with a sporting event. These inputs may be in the form of speech text or other information and may include inputs captured or received at the time the content was recorded e.g. by officials microphones or stat keepers entries during the sporting event or after the fact e.g. during an instant replay booth review review of the film after the game .

The inputs may additionally or alternatively include fantasy inputs from one or more statisticians analysts or fantasy sports company personnel. The inputs from the fantasy inputs may include terms or descriptions associated with or describing the subjects and or events depicted in one or more segments. Additionally or alternatively the fantasy inputs may include a number of fantasy points awarded or decremented based on events depicted in the segment s .

The inputs may additionally or alternatively include user inputs from one or more users of the interleaver service one or more fantasy sports services e.g. Yahoo ESPN etc. a crowd sourcing service such as Amazon s mechanical turk that solicits tags for one or more segments in exchange for compensation e.g. money goods services discounts etc. . In the case of users of the interleaver service the segment may be served to one or more users as part of their custom content. The users may then annotate the segment post comments regarding the segment message one or more of their contacts regarding the segment or the like. These annotations comments and or messages may be analyzed to identify additional tags associated with the segment. In this way tags for segments may be updated and refined over time to improve the accuracy and completeness of the tags for each segment. In the case of users of a crowd sourcing platform such as Amazon s mechanical turk the segments may be posted on the crowd sourcing platform where the users may view the segments and input one or more tags associated with each segment. Users may be compensated based on for example the number of segments they tag the number of tags they assign to each segment the timeliness of the tags i.e. how soon they tags are applied after the segments are posted or the like.

In still other examples a crowd sourcing approach could be implemented directly through the interleaver service . In that case user may receive compensation e.g. money or credits to their account for tagging segments. In some examples if a user opts to participate as a crowd source worker to help tag segments the user may receive untagged segments as part of the user s custom content stream. The user may adjust a number or frequency of untagged segments that the user receives to tag via one or more interfaces of the interleaver service. In other examples the interleaver service may serve a separate segment tagging interface presenting multiple segments available to be tagged by the user.

In some cases the inputs may comprise raw inputs speech text points etc. that are then converted into individual tags to be applied to the segments. In other instances however the inputs may comprise individual terms or other tags in a form suitable to be applied to a particular segment or other portion of content.

As shown in the tagged segment comprises the salient video segment aligned with the salient audio segment and salient metadata . In some examples the tagged segment may include one or more statistics relevant to the segment and one or more tags relevant to the segment. For instance in the illustrated example the statistics include an indication of a result of a last play e.g. an 8 yard rushing touchdown by Marshawn Lynch and one or more game total statistics e.g. 152 rushing yards 32 receiving yards 2 touchdowns for an athlete featured in the segment.

In the illustrated example the tags include an athlete shown in the segment e.g. Marshawn Lynch a team for which the athlete plays e.g. Seahawks a location of a game that the segment depicts or a location of the team for which the athlete plays e.g. Seattle a conference e.g. NFC to which the team belongs one or more actions or events depicted in the segment e.g. Rushing Touchdown a quantity associated with an action e.g. 8 yards as applied to rushing a position played by the athlete e.g. running back a date on which the content or segment was generated and or on which the athletic event was played a time at which the content or segment was generated and or at which the athletic event was played a source from which the content came e.g. ESPN and an opposing team whether or not depicted in the segment e.g. vs. Chargers . Of course the tags depicted in are merely examples and numerous additional or alternative tags may be used depending on the subject matter depicted in the segments and when how the segments are to be provided to individual users.

The tags may include tags provided with the incoming content tags generated automatically e.g. by the tag extraction module tags generated manually e.g. by the human input tag module and or tags generated semi automatically using both of the tag extraction module and the human input tag module . In some examples the stats may be generated from the tags or may be obtained from another source. For instance the stats may be obtained from a website or web service such as Gametracker by Yahoo Corporation. In some examples the stats may be configured to be presented to the user along with the segment on a display of the user s client device while the tags may be used to determine what content is to be served to the user s client device but is not configured to be presented to the user along with the segment. That is the stats are intended for viewing or other consumption by the user while the tags may form a basis upon which segments are identified and prioritized for transmission and or consumption by individual users.

In some examples each tag may include a score indicative of relevance of the tag to a segment specificity of the tag to the segment e.g. is the tag a general term such as running back that may be applicable to a large number of segments or a more specific term such as a specific athlete s name historical importance of the tag to users e.g. how has this tag been ranked in the past as applied to other segments number of times the tag was associated with this segment e.g. if the segment has been tagged by multiple manual and or automatic sources etc. In the illustrated example higher scores are better i.e. more relevant more specific more important more frequent etc. than lower scores. For instance in the tag Marshawn Lynch has a tag score of 3 because it is very relevant corresponding to an athlete depicted in the segment and very specific corresponding to an individual athlete as opposed to a class of athletes . Conversely the term running back has a tag score of 1 because it is more general and is of less historical importance to users.

In some examples the tags may include a fantasy score tag which may be usable to designate a number of fantasy points attributable to one or more events depicted or described in the segment. If included the fantasy score tag may be populated with an absolute number of points attributable to one or more events in the clip e.g. 6 points or may serve as a place holder to receive to receive a score specific to a particular user based on the fantasy sports platform s in which the user participates. For instance the score may be inserted at the time of tagging when the segment is transmitted to a user s client device when the segment is added to a queue for transmission to the user s client device etc. Additionally the fantasy score may be calculated and populated directly by the interleaver service or may be scraped from the one or more fantasy sports platforms that the user participates in e.g. by the interleaver service or the interleaver client application .

The tag scores may be used in combination with user preferences or weights in determining which segments to serve to a particular user and when. By way of example and not limitation if client device s buffer is relatively full only segments with high tag scores may be served.

While in this and other examples the statistics and or tags are shown as being assigned to and stored with the segments in the content store in advance in other instances the tags may be assigned and or appended to the segments at other times such as when the segments are placed in the content queues or when they are transmitted to the client devices . This may be the case when for example there is a reason to tag a segment differently for different users e.g. the segment is relevant to different users for different reasons different users are entitled to different fantasy points for the segment etc. . In still other examples some tags e.g. tags describing subjects or events in the segment may be stored in association with the segments in the content store while other tags e.g. fantasy points attributable to one or more events in the segments may be appended to the segments when the segments are placed in a content queue for a specific user or when the segment is transmitted to the client device of the specific user.

The subscriber profile of each user includes subscriber information about the user such as name contact information e.g. email address phone number physical address etc. demographic information e.g. gender age etc. socioeconomic data e.g. marital status income level family members etc. and the like. The subscriber information may be provided by the user such as at the time of account creation during installation or set up of the interleaver client application or during use of the interleaver service e.g. based on click stream activity based on user responses to questions or prompts based on user interaction with presented content or ads or based on annotations comments or messages the user provides etc. . Additionally or alternatively at least a portion of the subscriber information may be derived or inferred by the interleaver system based on for example a type or types of client device s the user uses to access the interleaver service an internet protocol address of the device s the user uses to access the interleaver service times of day at which the user accesses the interleaver service or other contextual information.

In some examples subscriber profile may also include payment information such as credit card numbers bank accounts payment accounts e.g. PayPal Square Wallet Google Wallet etc. Bitcoin or other payment instruments or modes. The payment information may be used for example to allow users to pay for access to the interleaver service to pay for access to certain content provided by the interleaver service e.g. proprietary content of one or more content sources to pay for in app purchases or any other financial transactions related to the interleaver service . The payment information may additionally or alternatively allow users to receive payment from the interleaver service and or other users of the interleaver service For instance user s may be able to earn money or other compensation for tagging segments via a crowd sourcing platform for providing annotations or comments on segments and or for providing content to the interleaver service for distribution to other users. The amount of compensation earned by the users may be based at least in part on the quantity and or quality of the tags annotations or comments and or content provided by the user.

In some examples the interleaver service includes a complete fantasy sports platform including infrastructure to support creation and operation of fantasy sports leagues and teams in which users can participate. That is users can join one or more fantasy sports leagues and or teams administered by the interleaver service. Additionally or alternatively the interleaver service may work in conjunction with one or more other accounts of the user such as other fantasy sports accounts social networks gaming accounts or the like. In that case the interleaver service may provide custom content related to and or based at least in part upon the other accounts of the user. However the interleaver service may not provide the underlying functionality of the other accounts. In the fantasy sports context the interleaver service may serve custom content including segments depicting events related to one or more of the user s fantasy sports accounts. For instance the interleaver service may present segments depicting athletes on one or more of the user s fantasy sports rosters athletes on an opponent s fantasy sports roster athletes on a roster of other members of the user s fantasy league s events resulting in fantasy points being awarded or decremented to the user or the like. In other contexts the interleaver service may serve the user one or more segments including information from or based at least in part on the one or more other accounts. For instance the interleaver service may present segments depicting subject matter e.g. video audio images text etc. from the one or social networking accounts e.g. Facebook Twitter Instagram etc. one or more gaming accounts e.g. a sports book account a gambling account a game etc. a media account e.g. Youtube Netflix Hulu etc. or other accounts of the user.

The subscriber profile also includes account credentials for the interleaver service the user facing portion of the interleaver service is named Clip Engine in this example . The account credentials may additionally or alternatively include account credentials for one or more other accounts of the user. In the illustrated example the account credentials include credentials for fantasy sports services other than Clip Engine of which the user is a member ACME Fantasy Sports in this example . In other examples the user may have accounts with other fantasy sports services in which case account credentials for those other accounts may be included as well. In this example the account credentials further include credentials for social media accounts of the user Facebook and Twitter in this example a gaming account of the user SportsBets.com in this example and potentially other accounts not shown . The account credentials for each account may comprise any credentials needed to log in to or otherwise access the account or service. By way of example and not limitation the account credentials for each account may comprise a login name email address password pin digital certificate watermark hash biometric information e.g. finger print retinal scan facial recognition voice recognition etc. or the like.

By including the account credentials of the one or more other accounts the interleaver service is able to access the other accounts to obtain information usable to among other things provide the user with the custom content. For instance the interleaver service may access other fantasy sports accounts to obtain information about the user s fantasy league s team s roster s fantasy points and or rules of how fantasy points are awarded identify which fantasy athletes are active and which are benched and the like. In other examples the interleaver service may access other social media accounts to identify social media contacts of the user determine topics of interest to the user and or the user s social connections and in some instances to obtain content e.g. photos videos etc. from the social media accounts. In still other examples the interleaver service may access one or more gaming accounts of the user to determine outcomes e.g. sporting events elections etc. on which the user has placed bets people against whom the user has bet games the user has played etc. In some examples the interleaver service may access the one or more other accounts by calling an application programming interface API of the service to which the account belongs. The interleaver service may use information obtained by accessing the other accounts and or other information to determine which content segments in which the user is likely to be most interested and therefore which segments to include in the user s custom content stream. The interleaver service may additionally or alternatively use this information to identify ads to serve to the user an order in which to serve the content segments and or ads or for other purposes.

For instance the subscriber profile may include subscription information defining various topics of interest to the user based on the information obtained from the accounts. The subscription information is shown in tabular form for ease of explanation but in other examples may be stored and or presented in any form. In the illustrated example the subscription information includes an entry for each account or sub account thereof for which account credentials are provided. Entries may also be included for other items such as topics of interest websites or services that don t require an account or credentials or any other item that is usable to identify topics that may be of interest to the user.

In the illustrated example the entries include four entries corresponding to sub accounts of the ACME Fantasy Sports account namely ACME Fantasy Auto Racing ACME Fantasy Baseball ACME Fantasy Basketball ACME Fantasy Football and ACME Fantasy Soccer . The entries also include entries for social media accounts namely Facebook Twitter Vine and YouTube and a gaming account namely SportsBets.com . The entries also include an entry for a topic of interest to the user namely Sports and several other sites or services that do not require an account to access namely Vegas Odds and Gaming Calendar .

For each of the entries the subscriber profile includes one or more subscriptions about which the user desires to receive content segments. For instance the entry entitled ACME Fantasy Auto Racing includes subscriptions to Drivers on my fantasy roster s Driver s on opponent s fantasy roster s and Drivers on other teams in my league s . As another example the social media entry for Facebook includes subscriptions to Facebook contacts. As yet another example the entry for the topic Sports includes subscriptions to Favorite Teams and Favorite Athletes. In some examples the subscriptions may be predefined by the respective services to which the entries correspond. In some examples the user may select the particular subscriptions he or she desires for each service e.g. using one of the interfaces described below for managing content . In some examples one or more default subscriptions may be set for a service which may be modified by the user. In still other examples the interleaver service may set one or more subscriptions based on information in the user s subscriber profile the user s content viewing history e.g. which segments did the user request which segments did the user watch skip or replay etc. . The subscriptions may be static meaning that they remain constant over time or they may be dynamic meaning that they are temporal in nature and change over time or based on one or more other factors . An example of a dynamic subscription is the subscription to Drivers on my fantasy roster s which may change as the user updates his or her roster s . Another example of a dynamic subscription is the subscription to Drivers on my opponent s fantasy roster s because the user s opponent will change from week to week race to race or the like.

For each subscription the interleaver service may determine one or more tags that are relevant to the subscription. For instance the first subscription in the illustrated example is for Drivers on my fantasy roster s . The interleaver service may determine e.g. by querying the user s ACME Fantasy Sports account the drivers on the user s fantasy roster. In the illustrated example the user has Dale Earnhardt Jr. among other drivers on his or her roster. Thus Dale Earnhardt Jr. may be added as a tag to the user s subscriber profile potentially along with one or more other related tags such as Dale Dale Jr. Earnhardt Jr. No. 88 etc. Similarly the interleaver service may determine tags relevant to the other subscriptions of the user s subscriber profile . Example tags for each subscription are given in the column of tags . In some examples these tags are the terms that the interleaver service uses to match to tags of content segments to identify segments that are relevant to or would otherwise be of interest to the particular user.

As discussed above certain subscriptions are dynamic meaning that they change over time or in response to events. In some examples the tags associated with a dynamic subscription may change over time. For instance a user s fantasy opponent typically changes periodically e.g. daily weekly etc. . In that case the particular tags associated with the subscription Athletes on my opponent s fantasy roster may change periodically to match the user s changing opponents.

In some examples the tags may be assigned weights . In the example of the weights are assigned to each category of tags. That is in the illustrated example all tags associated with a particular subscription are assigned a same weight. For instance all tags associated with Athletes on my active fantasy roster s are assigned a weight of 5 while all tags associated with Athletes on my bench are assigned a weight of 2. However in other examples each individual tag may be assigned its own weight regardless of the subscription that the tag is associated with.

The weights may be automatically assigned by the interleaver service may be default settings may be manually set by the user as described further below and or may be inferred by the interleaver service . For example some or all of the weights may be inferred based on other settings made by the user the user s interaction with the interleaver service segments the user has requested segments that the user has skipped etc.

As discussed above certain subscriptions are dynamic meaning that they change over time or in response to events. In some examples the weight associated with a dynamic subscription may change over time. For instance a weight of a tag associated with a betting service may change depending on a dollar value of a user s bet placed with the service. In that case if a user places a relatively small bet e.g. below a preset or user specific threshold amount the weight may be relatively low e.g. a weight of 2 or 3 whereas if the user places a larger bet e.g. greater than or equal to the present or user specific threshold then the weight may be higher e.g. 4 or 5 . In some examples the weight may be proportional to the size of a bet the number of bets placed with the betting service or any number of other factors. As another example of a weight changing over time a weight of tags associated with a particular fantasy sports subscription e.g. football baseball soccer etc. may be higher when the particular sport is currently in season than when it is out of season. For instance a weight associated with a fantasy football subscription may be higher during football season than during the offseason.

The weights are one factor that may be used to prioritize the segments that are provided to the user in the user s custom content stream. For instance the interleaver service may prioritize segments with tags that the user s subscriber profile ranks higher over segments with tags that the user s subscriber profile ranks lower. However other factors may also contribute to the selection of segments for presentation to the user such as freshness of the segments variety of segments number of available segments that have not yet been viewed by the user etc.

In the example shown a clip is playing on the screen showing an athlete performing action that earned fantasy points for the user s fantasy team. The athlete may be highlighted or indicated by a halo shading or other feature. A headline may be used to show a description of the clip which may be based on a perspective of the user s fantasy team. Thus the headline Marshawn Lynch 8 yard rushing touchdown alerts the user to the reason that fantasy points were awarded. The number of fantasy points earned by the user s fantasy team in the clip may be indicated by a message which in the example shown is located in the upper right corner of the clip.

The user may swipe with a finger across the clip as it plays or concludes to move forward to a later clip or backward to an earlier clip. A clip in mid play may be stopped and earlier or later clips invoked. The earlier and later clips may be located in a buffer accessed by the user interface or may be downloaded from the interleaver or other location such as servers or the cloud. Skip forward and skip backward controls allow a user to move to clips in either end of a buffer queue or other content source.

Rating indicators allow the user to rate the clip favorably or unfavorably. Such ratings may provide input to an algorithm e.g. artificial intelligence that govern which clips are provided to the user and to the user s queue. A Why am I seeing this clip link allows the user to request information about why the clip is being provided. Possible reasons include that the clip involves fantasy points for the user s fantasy team an opponent s fantasy team a possible draft prospect available to the user a favorite athlete of the user etc.

A comment box is adapted to provide selection indicators such as View Comments or Add Comment. In the example shown Add Comment is selected allowing the user to provide a comment available to a fantasy opponent others in the user s fantasy league others in the user s contacts or to the general public that may view the clip to which the comment was applied. The comments may be text audio audio video or may include an attached file. Additionally selection of the View Comments selector allows users to view comments left specifically to them by other users or to view comments left by others for general consumption.

A client clip queue provides a view of clips that are available for viewing on the client device. The clips may be available locally in a buffer or available remotely for download. The clip queue shows three clips and additional clips may be available if the user swipes up or down. The clips are labeled in an order i.e. Next clip and 2clip etc. Tabs on each clip may be utilized by a user to rearrange an order of the clips in the queue . An X or other tool may receive user input to remove a specific clip from the queue. The clip queue may provide links to one or more clips in response to a user query or in response to action of athletes in real life games that have relevance to a user s fantasy team and or other interests of the user.

A search box allows a user to type a query including one or more search terms such as an athlete s name a type of play e.g. touchdown homerun etc. key word tag fantasy point type or other factors. The query may be searched by a search engine that is located on the client and searches content already downloaded or known to the client. Alternatively the query may be searched by a search engine that is located remotely such as on the interleaver . The search may return results that are not located on the client and which may be downloaded to the client. The results of the search may be ordered according to relevance and or recentness or other factors. In some examples the user indicates factors used to order the search results.

A number of tools may be provided by the user interface . In the example of a half speed or slow tool allows a user to slow the playback of a clip. A replay tool allows the user to replay an entire clip such as a clip currently in playback mode. A rewind tool allows the user to play video of a clip in reverse direction. A pause tool allows the user to stop play of a clip. A fast forward tool allows the user to play a clip in fast motion e.g. to play the clip at double speed . A full screen tool allows the user to play a clip using the full screen of a device. Frequency the playback may orient the clip to play in landscape mode which more nearly approximates broadcast and cable TV.

In the example shown the user may select This Week s Games to show fantasy games to be played in the current week which may be based on real life games also played in the current week . In the example of the user may swipe This Week s Games left or right to reveal prior or future games respectively. The week s games e.g. This Week s Games may be divided to show In Progress Games and Scheduled Games . In the example shown In Progress Games may include several fantasy games in which the user is involved including one or more games from each of one or more sports including car racing e.g. Shock Racing Brickyard baseball The Shredders vs. Green Guys and football Dragons vs. Lightning . Later in the week the user will be involved in the fantasy basketball game involving the fantasy teams Sasquatch and Yeti. If the user scrolls down e.g. with a swipe of a finger on the user interface it may be revealed that scheduled games also include fantasy games based on other sports such as soccer which may be similarly shown by the user interface. Any of the This Week s Games e.g. Dragons vs. Lightning may be selected and expanded to view a detailed scoring report such as seen in the example of .

The user interface may provide a League Play icon which may reconfigure the user interface to show a plurality of fantasy leagues if applicable in which the user is active and allows the user to view scores of other fantasy games in the user s fantasy league s . Thus the user may be active in one or more fantasy football baseball car racing basketball soccer or other sports leagues which would be displayed in response to League Play icon . By selecting one of the leagues displayed the user interface may display one or more of past games in progress games and scheduled games. By selecting of the games displayed the overall score and details of the scoring of individual athletes may be displayed.

The user interface may provide a manage rosters icon which may reconfigure the user interface to show a plurality of fantasy teams if applicable of which the user is the owner. Thus the user may be the owner of one or more fantasy football baseball car racing basketball soccer or other sports teams which would be displayed in response to Manage Rosters icon .

The Manage Rosters icon may allow a user to manage rosters of one or more fantasy teams of which the user is the owner and to thereby add or remove athletes from the user s fantasy roster s field athletes bench athletes trade athletes and to otherwise manage the user s fantasy team s . The roster or list of athletes of a fantasy team may be maintained by a provider of the user interface or another website. Thus while the website ClipEngine shown at the top of the user interface may provide portions of the user interface other websites may provide a user interface invoke by the Manage Rosters icon that allows the user to manage one or more fantasy teams. Thus the user may have teams hosted by one or more websites which may be accessed by icon .

A Refresh icon may be configured to refresh any displayed information such as rosters of athletes scores of athletes scores of fantasy or real teams etc. Alternatively such information may be updated or refreshed automatically by the user interface .

In the example shown in the user has selected the football game between the Dragons and the Lightning. As a result the display has expanded to show the fielded athletes. The user may click on a link to reveal benched athletes i.e. athletes on the user s team but not fielded for play and eligible to earn points for the user. In the example shown a projected score column shows a projected and or predicted score for each athlete in column. The athletes may be associated with positions e.g. quarterback pitcher driver etc. . An actual score column shows an actual number of fantasy points that each athlete has scored at this point in play.

The projected score may be displayed for each of the athletes before and or during actual play of the real life game s . The score may be based at least in part on past or expected performance of each athlete in list . Before real life play begins the projected scores for each athlete may be totaled to result in an original projected score or projected score of the user s fantasy team. In the example shown the Dragons have an original projected score of 208 points. Similarly the Lightning have an original projected score of 217. Accordingly based on a projection by one or more experts or statisticians indicates that the projected or predicted end game score of the Dragons vs. Lightning fantasy football game will be 208 to 217.

In some examples an athlete s name the athlete s actual score or other area may be a clickable link allowing a user request and view the sequence of plays e.g. as a list or as sequential video clips that resulted in the point total. Thus a user may review the plays that resulted in fantasy point scores for the user s or other fantasy team.

After real life play begins a current actual score of fantasy points is shown for each athlete resulting in a current actual team score of fantasy points for the user s fantasy team. Thus as real life play develops athletes will score fantasy points that are tabulated at column and totaled in the summation . Similarly current actual scores for athletes on a fantasy team of the user s opponent are displayed. In the example shown the listing of the listing of the football game also shows the current actual score of the fantasy football game.

As real life play develops athletes score fantasy points as a result of their efforts in their respective games. Accordingly the listing of actual athlete fantasy point scores may be updated as play develops. Also as some athletes have above and below average games the originally projected score listing may become a poor estimate for their actual fantasy points scored. Accordingly the projected athlete fantasy point score column may be updated in real time as play develops. Thus while projected fantasy point scores for each athlete may have appeared reasonable prior to play as real life games unfold the projection of fantasy point scores may change.

Updating the projected total of fantasy points for each athlete and for each team aids in allowing team owners to assess if they are winning or losing a fantasy game. In an example if one fantasy team owner has more athletes playing in early Sunday NFL games that team may appear to be wining while the opposing team having more athletes scheduled to play in later games is actually in a better position.

Accordingly each minute that passes during regulation time wherein an athlete does not score a fantasy point makes it more likely that the athlete s final fantasy point score will be similar to a current fantasy point total. In contrast the more fantasy points that a athlete scores early in the game may make it more likely that a final score will be high. An athlete s fantasy point score may be four times the athlete s score at the end of the first quarter twice the halftime total and one and a third the total at the end of three quarters of play. Any of these estimates which in some examples may be updated with greater granularity e.g. on a minute by minute basis may prove to be more accurate than an estimate that does not take into consideration play during the game.

In one specific example before real life play started the athlete Payton Manning was projected to score 45 fantasy points. However the projected fantasy point score for Payton Manning was reduced as the game was played and it appeared unlikely he would score 45 fantasy points. Ultimately the projection was reduced to 40 points as the game drew to a close because Manning s point total was 40 points at that time.

In another specific example the wide receiver Moss was originally projected to receive 17 fantasy points but has already scored 22 points in an on going game. Accordingly the revised projected score for Moss is 31 fantasy points. This figure is more accurate in view of the points already scored.

In another specific example the running back Thompson was originally projected to receive 15 fantasy points. However failure to score fantasy points in earlier parts of the actual game have resulted in a reduction of his projected fantasy point score to 10.

In another specific example the game involving tight end Gonzalez has not yet begun and his fantasy point projection remains unchanged.

In another specific example the wide or tight end Holmes was projected to score 14 fantasy points and his score of 11 fantasy points during a portion of his game may result in reaffirmation of the original 14 point estimate.

Thus as real life games are played the projected totals of each athlete s fantasy point score may be changed in a manner that considers fantasy points scored in the game and time remaining in the game.

Once a game is final an athlete s projected fantasy score may be struck though or removed and replaced with the athlete s actual fantasy score in the game thereby increasing the accuracy of the current projected fantasy score for the user s fantasy team.

The Message Opponent field allows the user to send a message to an opponent including text audio images video and or an attached file. Thus the Message Opponent field may be used for two way text audio audio video communication with opponents in a particular game or the user s league.

The interleaver service or other central office and or website may supplement existing fantasy sports outlets e.g. Yahoo or ESPN etc. or may include an integrated fantasy sports platform that may provide known fantasy information to users in addition to providing the innovations described herein. The user interface may provide the user with a means to access the integrated fantasy sports platform as well as a means to access other fantasy sports platforms available to users. Accordingly users can participate in multiple fantasy sports platforms either using present technology or augmented by the techniques described herein.

In the example shown a Manage Content tab has been selected by a user thereby invoking the user interface from among a plurality of other user interfaces each of which may be associated with tabs or other user interface tools. A search box is displayed which allows the user to search for the user s fantasy teams leagues favorite athletes content of interest etc.

A fantasy sports block may be displayed. The fantasy sports block may indicate a plurality of fantasy sports platforms e.g. Yahoo ESPN etc. that host fantasy sports competitions leagues teams etc. In the example shown ACME Fantasy Sports is such a host. ACME Fantasy Sports may host the user s fantasy auto racing team Shock Racing as well as the user s fantasy baseball team The Shredders and others of the user s fantasy teams in sports including basketball football two teams etc. The user may add more fantasy accounts to thereby add more fantasy teams. Adding a fantasy account may involve providing the user interface with a fantasy sports provider a user name and password to an account. Using this information the interleaver service or other server or provider may access the account and copy or scrap the information within the account. Such information including league information team name athletes etc. may be used to provide the user with appropriate clips that correspond with the user s fantasy team. By adding all of the user s fantasy sports accounts with different providers and or by indicating the user s fantasy team s the user provides the user interface with information that assists the interleaver to provide the user with custom content appropriate to the user. The block may show only the fantasy sports in which the user is participating or which users commonly participate and other fantasy sports and or other providers may be added to block such as by operation of the search box . Thus the user may have or want to add account or team information to one or more of the other fantasy sports platforms such as CBS Fantasy Sports ESPN Fantasy Sports etc.

Custom content may be provided to the user based not only on the user s fantasy team s but on other topics of interest to the user. Such content may be provided as desired such as between clips that include fantasy point information of interest to the user. Topics block in the user interface shows example or representative categories of information that the user may want to select. In the example shown the user has selected the Seattle Seahawks and athlete Payton Manner. Thus Topics block allows the user to select content from among a very broad range of topics. In the example of user interface the user may select content from such diverse topics a entertainment e.g. popular culture events e.g. news sports and others. Thus in the example of the user may receive a wide range of custom content which may include video clips and other information associated with a number of fantasy teams as well as video clips and other information related to the Seattle Seahawks Payton Manning etc. Video clips and other content such as cheerleaders and commentators may also be selected.

Cheerleaders and commentators may provide video clips which may be invoked upon a fantasy event e.g. a touchdown by a particular team or may be invoked due to lack of fantasy sport clips during a particular period of time. Commentators e.g. color commentators may be individuals from the athletic community or other communities such as comedy show business etc. If the user is less interested in fantasy sports than the content provided by such commentators the user may select a number of commentators using the user interface .

A social media block may allow the user to communicate with others and to share information and or clips related to fantasy sports or other content such as content received from the interleaver .

A gaming block may allow users to communicate with gaming websites and to obtain video clips that are related to wagers made on those sites of through other venues e.g. private parties or local bookmakers . The user may games the user is wagering on e.g. My Bets and may enter other information at Odds events and more options. Thus while a user associated with fantasy sports may want to see video clips related to athletes on the user s fantasy team a user that is alternatively or additionally involved in gaming may want to see video clips related to games on which the user has wagered. Thus the user may see clips that impact the scores of games on which bets were placed which may be interleaved with fantasy team related clips.

In some examples the user interface may also allow a user to select content sources or providers e.g. ESPN NFL Network Comcast Cable Direct TV HBO etc. from which they want to or are entitled to receive content i.e. sources from which the custom content may be assembled . In some examples certain content sources may be free content sources available to all users while other content sources may be premium content sources that are available for an additional fee. In some instances a user may be entitled to premium content based upon one or more separate subscriptions to the respective premium content source.

The Rank user interface allows a user to rank categories of content to thereby assist the interleaver in prioritizing custom content to be transmitted to the user. The arrangement of the content types from higher priority top of the list to lower priority bottom of the list indicates a priority of the user for the content sent by the interleaver service or other server or central office. In the example shown an Organize content in order of preference block is configured to allow the user to manually arrange a plurality of content types. Thus the grip on the left side of each content type such as My active fantasy athletes can be used to move a content type up or down on the priority list.

A number of representative examples of content types are shown. The first content type My active fantasy athletes corresponds to the fielded athletes i.e. athletes not sitting on the fantasy team bench . Thus the user s highest priority may be the fielded athletes of the user s fantasy team. A second content type My benched fantasy athletes may be a second priority. Alternatively the user may want to elevate Current opponent s fantasy athletes to the second position. The content type Athletes on other teams in my fantasy league s allows the user to view clips of athletes that are probably of very high caliber and which are of general interest. The user may also want to manually position Cheerleaders and Analyst commentary as desired. These content types may include video clips that do not directly relate to the scoring of fantasy points. However the cheerleader celebration may follow a play that resulted in fantasy points and the analyst commentary may describe that play. The content type My social connections may govern the priority of content that is provided by people or organizations to which the user is connected such as by Twitter Facebook or other social services. The user may want to elevate the importance of the content type My favorite athletes even though these athletes may be on other user s fantasy teams. Thus the user may enjoy video clips of favorite athletes even though their exploits do not result in fantasy point gains. Similarly the user may enjoy highlight video clips of the user s favorite real life teams even when they have not fantasy point relevance. The content types shown are representative and other content sources may be added substituted or utilized or provided by the user the user s league the interleaver service or other entity.

A block labeled Organize the following in order of importance allows the user to apply a second hierarchy of inputs to the prioritization of content sent to the user. A number of representative example inputs are shown. In some examples Relevance to my content preferences allows the user to balance what is important to the user e.g. as discussed with respect to block with other factors such as the second factor Overall popularity among users. Thus the user may balance the incoming content to include content that may be important to the user s friends. The user may rank Freshness higher or lower depending on preferences. For example a clip showing an important play may be several hours old when the user begins to view the user interface . Whether such a clip is provided to the user may be based at least in part on how highly the Freshness factor is rated and also on a number of alternative clips available. The Trending now factor is another opportunity for the user to determine if the user wants to see more of what is important to the user s fantasy and favorite teams or if the user wants to branch out and see content of interest to others. Similarly the factor Relevance to my social connections allows the user to adjust how much time is to be spent watching what is important to others.

A block may display a plurality of vertical bars of different height. The height of each bar represents a priority assigned by the user of a labeled content type relative to other labeled content types. The user may adjust the height of each bar such as by tapping on it pulling it or otherwise manipulating it such as with manual or keypad input. The tallest bar having the highest priority assigned by the user represents My Athletes. Accordingly content related to athletes on the user s fantasy team is given the highest priority when forming the custom content e.g. for the user. Thus if there is an excess of content available or an issue of what content to send first content related to athletes on the user s fantasy team is given priority.

Secondary priority is given to content related to My Bench i.e. the athletes on the bench of the user s fantasy team. Priority may also be given to Comments which may include content generated by others such as those in the user s fantasy league or may include color commentary from pundits with discussion of athletes in video clips for which fantasy points were awarded points. Alternatively the pundits may have comments that are related to interests of the user which may or may not be related to video clips for which fantasy points were awarded.

Other topics may be displayed such as Other League which allows a user with two fantasy teams in two fantasy leagues to assign priority to content related to the second team. Favorite Topics allows the user to assign a priority to topics of interest vs. the priority given to other topic expressly listed. Opponent Athletes allows the user to assign a relative priority to content related to athletes on a fantasy team of an opponent e.g. someone within the user s fantasy league .

 Social Media allows the user to assign a priority to content generated by social media. For example friends and owners of other fantasy teams may communicate with each other using postings to social media. Such postings may be used to generate content that becomes interwoven into the custom content of the user. While some users may feel that such comments distract from video clips of athletes other users may participate in fantasy sports simply as a tool to more frequently interact with their friends and may give higher priority to this content source.

 Wagered Teams provides the user with the opportunity to increase the content related to certain games teams or athletes on whom the user has made bets. Thus the user may utilize the interleaver to generate custom content related to the user s gambling.

An Add more content link allows the user to add more content types into the content bar graph. By clicking the link the user may be presented with a popup interface which allows the user to select one or more content types e.g. by check boxes or other user interface technique . In on example by selecting Add more content link the user can add equalizer columns for additional content sources or topics and may specify a preference rating number of bars for each column.

If the user adds a number of additional content types the field may become crowded. The Group Ungroup content link allows the user to set preferences for groups of related content e.g. Favorite Athletes Favorite Teams and Favorite Plays may all be grouped together as Favorite Topics . Alternatively the user could ungroup the Favorite Topics to provide separate preference ratings for each of Favorite Athletes Favorite Teams Favorite Plays or any other favorite topics.

A Relevance vs. Freshness slider or device allows the user to move a slider or other user interface device to provide a relative priority between older but otherwise more relevant content vs. fresher but less relevant content. This helps the interleaver service decide between sending the user a video clip of a favorite athlete on a favorite team scoring a touchdown earlier in time e.g. before the user activated the user s device or a less favorite athlete who just scored a touchdown.

A target may include two or more topics which may be labeled outside the target. In the example of four topics are shown Fantasy Sports Analyst Commentary Social Media and Cheerleaders. By moving the crosshairs to different locations within the target the relative contributions of the four topics in the custom content stream e.g. may be controlled by the user. Thus the user may want to emphasize Fantasy Sports and associated video clips related to the user s fantasy sports team s . The user may also want to emphasize Analyst Commentary. The user may want to replace one of the topics with a different topic and may do so by techniques such as press and hold the topic to be removed and selection of a new topic in a drop down menu that results. Accordingly the user may exercise control over the content and nature of the custom content stream sent to the user.

The gray numbers close to the crosshairs may show minutes or hours of each desired content type. Alternatively the gray numbers may show relative percentages which may total up to 100 of the custom content stream that is related to each of the four topics. If the total of the relative percentages does not total 100 then other types of content may be provided by the interleaver service .

At block characteristic s of the received content are determined The characteristics may include a content source e.g. a television network radio station cable company satellite television company website service or other content provider a type of content e.g. audio video images text metadata or other characteristics of the content e.g. format compression resolution . The characteristic s of the received content may at least partially dictate how the content will be processed by the interleaver service e.g. the type of video audio image or other processing to be applied .

At block the content may be reviewed to identify salient events such as portions of content that depict or describe events resulting in fantasy points desirable commentary cheerleaders colorful fans etc. In examples where the content includes multiple types of content e.g. audio video images text and or metadata the different types of content may have different salient portions. For instance some salient video content may not have corresponding audio content and vice versa. Further in many cases salient audio portions may not align with salient video portions closed captioning or other metadata.

At block a segmenting technique may be selected for the content based at least in part on characteristics of the content. In some examples automated segmentation may be performed. Such segmentation may recognize e.g. by operation of software the starting and ending points of a play or other segment of content. Such a system may recognize a hike in football the ball coming into play in basketball or soccer a pitch in baseball a player entering a field of view a speaker starting to speak or mentioning a particular athlete by name an athlete s name included in closed captioning text etc. In some examples multiple segmenting techniques may be applied in parallel or sequentially.

At block the content may be segmented into multiple salient and or non salient segments. For instance received content corresponding to a television broadcast of a sporting event may be segmented into multiple salient segments corresponding to portions of the content that are likely to be interesting to users of the interleaver service and multiple non salient segments that are unlikely to be interesting to users of the interleaver service. In some examples salient segments may comprise segments depicting or describing events that result in awarding or decrementing of fantasy points. In some examples salient segments may comprise segments depicting or describing events for which statistics are maintained by a governing body e.g. the National Football League Major League Baseball the National Basketball Association National Association of Stock Car Racing National Collegiate Athletic Association etc. . In some examples salient segments may include segments depicting and or describing individual plays collections of plays analysis commentary cheerleaders halftime shows colorful fans etc. In some examples non salient segments may comprise content that is of little or no interest to users of the interleaver service such as for example portions of the video showing periods of inaction e.g. rain delays huddles timeouts etc. or errors or mistakes e.g. inadvertently recorded video showing the ground or the inside of the lens cap for instance blurred or obscured images scrambled or blank video feeds etc. . In some examples non salient video segments may include advertisements contained in the received content. However in other instances advertisements in the received content may be considered salient video segments.

A variety of different techniques may be used separately or in combination to segment the content at block . In some examples the content may be segmented based on the audio video and or metadata of the received content. In the illustrated example at block audio of the content may be separated from video of the content and or metadata of the content. That is for content having audio and video the audio track may be stripped from and or processed separately from the video content. For content having audio video and metadata the audio and metadata may be stripped form and or processed separately from the video. At block a video portion of the content may be segmented using one or more video based segmenting techniques such as facial recognition image or object recognition text recognition or optical character recognition or the like. At block an audio portion of the content may be segmented using one or more audio based segmenting techniques such as voice recognition voice to text conversion voice signature recognition sound recognition or pattern recognition. At block audio and or video portions of content may be segmented using metadata based segmenting techniques such as by analyzing metadata including closed captioning describing breaks in video or describing subject matter of video.

In some example the segmenting may be performed at least in part by one or more human editors. In that case the human editors may be personnel of the interleaver service personnel of the content sources crowd source workers and or users of the interleaver service.

Once the audio video and or metadata are segmented the interleaver service may at block align trim supplement and or adjust a speed of one or more audio segments and or video segments and at block may append one or more audio segments to each video segment. For instance in some examples an audio segment may be aligned temporally to begin at a same time as a video segment to end at a same time as the video segment to be centered with respect to the video segment or the like. In some examples an audio segment may be trimmed e.g. by removing a beginning portion an ending portion and or one or more intermediate portions to be substantially a same length as a video segment or vice versa. In some examples an audio segment may be supplemented with additional audio content e.g. a voice over commentary analysis etc. to arrive at an audio segment having substantially a same length as a video segment or vice versa. In some examples an audio segment may be sped up or slowed down so as to be substantially a same length as a video segment or vice versa.

In other examples the content may be segmented without separating the audio video and or metadata portions. That is audio video and metadata of the received content may be segmented concurrently with the content intact. In that case the received content may be segmented based on any one or a combination of the segmenting techniques described for audio video and or metadata.

Referring back to at block the non salient segments may be discarded ignored or tagged as being non salient. At block the salient segments may be tagged and stored in memory of or accessible to the interleaver service e.g. stored as tagged segments in the content store .

At block the interleaver service may compare the tagged segments to one or more subscriber profiles corresponding to users of the interleaver service to determine subscriber profiles to which the various tagged segments are relevant. In some examples the subscriber profiles include data from the one or more data sources including among other things fantasy sports information for the respective users of the interleaver service. The interleaver service may then serve the segments to one or more client devices of the users of the respective subscriber profiles to which the segments were determined to be relevant e.g. based on the fantasy sports information or other information contained in the subscriber profile of each user . In this way each user receives a custom content feed that includes segments that are relevant to the particular user e.g. custom content related to the user s fantasy sports teams leagues .

At block one or more tags may be identified for each content segment and the content segments may be tagged with the one or more tags. In some examples the tagging may be performed by a tagging module of the interleaver service e.g. tagging module . However in other examples the tagging may be performed by other services internal or external to the interleaver service. For instance in some examples content may be received from an external content source in an already segmented and or tagged form. In either case the identification of the tags for each segment may be performed by at block extracting one or more tags from the content segment itself and or by at block receiving one or more human input tags. By way of example and not limitation extracting tags from the content segments may be performed automatically or semi automatically and may include analyzing audio video and or metadata of the content to recognize subject matter e.g. people places things events and or actions depicted in the video and or described in the audio and or metadata. In some examples tag extraction techniques may include video extraction techniques such as facial recognition e.g. to identify athletes coaches announcers officials or other people from a database of known people image or object recognition e.g. to identify objects or object types from a database of known objects and or text recognition e.g. optical character recognition to identify and determine the meaning of text in the content. The tag extraction techniques may additionally or alternatively include audio extraction techniques such as speech to text conversion to identify and determine a meaning of voice content voice signature recognition to identify individuals by comparison to a database of known voice samples and or sound or pattern recognition to identify sounds or sound types by comparison to a database of known sounds or patterns. The tag extraction techniques may additionally or alternatively include metadata extraction techniques such as analysis of closed captioning data to identify subject matter e.g. people places things events actions etc. described in the content a source of the content a format of the content e.g. file format resolution compression etc. or the like.

Human input tags may be received from for example personnel at or associated with the sporting event or other subject matter of the content personnel associated with one or more fantasy sports websites or platforms e.g. fantasy sports platforms offering fantasy sports experiences based on one or more sporting events of the received content and or one or more individual users e.g. crowd source workers and or users of the interleaver service .

In some examples at block a tag score may be calculated and assigned to some or all of the tags. In some examples the tag score may be assigned to each tag regardless of the segments to which it is applied i.e. the tag scores may be segment agnostic . In other examples the tag scores for each tag may be dependent upon the segments to which the tag is applied i.e. the tag scores may be segment specific . In that case a tag may have one tag score as applied to a first segment and may have a second different tag score as applied to a second different segment.

At block one or more tags may be associated with each segment to identify the subject matter depicted or described in the respective segment. In some examples associating the tags with segments may comprise modifying the files corresponding to the content segments to include the tag information. In other examples associating the tags with segments may comprise creating a separate tag file or index including the tag information along with pointers to the corresponding content segments and or locations of the content segments in memory. In either case once the tags have been associated the segments may be stored in memory accessible to the interleaver service e.g. they may be stored as tagged segments in content store .

At the interleaver service may compare the tags with one or more subscriber profiles to identify tags that are relevant to the subscriber profile s . In some examples the comparison may be initiated by the interleaver service e.g. periodically or upon receipt of one or more new content segments or may be initiated in response to receipt of a request from a client device of a user e.g. a client device . At block based at least in part on the comparison the interleaver service may identify one or more subscribe profiles to which one or more content segments are applicable or vice versa .

At block the interleaver service or other service may determine that a subscriber profile to which a content segment is applicable is entitled to fantasy points for one or more events depicted or described in the content segment. Additionally at block the interleaver service may determine a number of fantasy points the user is entitled to for the events depicted in the segment. In the illustrated example this fantasy point determinations of operations and are described as being made after the segment is determined to be applicable to the subscriber profile. This approach may be advantageous when different users of the interleaver service participate in fantasy sports leagues provided by websites or services other than the interleaver service since in that case different users may be entitled to different fantasy points for the same segment e.g. because different fantasy sites platforms apply different scoring metrics and or fantasy commissioners may set different scoring metrics for each league . In some implementations the indication of fantasy points and or the number of fantasy points may be calculated by the interleaver service while in other implementations the indication and number of fantasy points may be obtained from another fantasy sports website or service e.g. by querying or scraping the other fantasy sports website . The indication that the segment is entitled to fantasy points and or the fantasy point total to which the user is entitled for the events depicted in the segment may be associated with the segment when the segment is placed in the user s queue to be transmitted to a client device of the user.

In other examples fantasy point information may be assigned to each segment without regard to which subscriber profiles it may be applicable to. In that case the fact that a segment depicts an event resulting in fantasy points and or a fantasy point total attributable to the segment may be associated with the segment e.g. as one or more tags . This approach may be particularly advantageous when the fantasy points are determined and or assigned by the interleaver service e.g. if the interleaver service administers the fantasy sports league team .

At the interleaver service may transmit or otherwise cause the content segment s to be served to client device s of the user. The interleaver service may at block additionally transmit or otherwise cause a notification to be sent to the client device s of the user indicating that the user is entitled to fantasy points and or a number of fantasy points awarded to the user for an event depicted or described in the content segment. In this way the user is provided with a custom content feed comprising content segments that are relevant to the user e.g. based upon information about the user s fantasy sports accounts stored in the user s subscriber profile .

At block the interleaver service e.g. via profile manager may access one or more fantasy sports accounts or other accounts of the user. In some examples accessing the one or more accounts of the user may comprise at block receiving and using a login credential to access the account s and or at block calling one or more application programming interfaces APIs to access the account s .

At block the interleaver service may obtain fantasy sports information e.g. fantasy league information fantasy team information fantasy roster information etc. or other information e.g. social network information gaming information etc. from the account s . In some implementations it may be necessary to access the account s of the user to obtain the fantasy sports information or other information. However in other examples it may be possible to obtain some or all of the information without the need to access the user s account.

At block the interleaver service may generate a subscriber profile e.g. subscriber profile for the user. In some examples the subscriber profile may include the account information of the one or more other services of which the user is a member. In some examples generating the subscriber profile may include at block defining one or more subscriptions to topics of interest to a user e.g. athletes teams etc. associated with the fantasy sports account s of the user. In some examples generating the subscriber profile may additionally or alternatively include at block defining one or more subscriptions to other topics of interest to the user e.g. favorite athletes favorite teams favorite announcers favorite cheerleaders home location etc. . The interleaver service e.g. via profile manager may then determine tags relevant to the subscriptions. The tags may correspond to for example specific people e.g. athletes announcers cheerleaders etc. places e.g. cities stadiums etc. and or things e.g. teams cars etc. corresponding to the subscriptions defined in blocks and .

Generating the subscriber profile may additionally include at block defining one or more preferences associated with the interleaver service. The preferences may include for example the types and amounts of different types of content that the user wishes to receive in his or her custom content stream. Thus the preferences may indicate relative priorities of certain types of content. In some examples the preferences may include weights associated with the subscriptions or to individual tags associated with the subscriptions . The weights may be determined and or assigned by for example weighting module responsive to preferences provided by the user explicitly e.g. using the preferences tab in the UIs shown in or implicitly e.g. by prior user actions other memberships frequency of reference to particular content of interest frequency of comment on various content of interest etc. .

At block the interleaver service e.g. subscription manager may store the subscriber profile in memory of or accessible to the interleaver service e.g. subscription store .

At block the interleaver service may determine one or more content segments e.g. one or more tagged content segments in the content store that are applicable to the user s subscriber profile based at least in part on the subscriptions and associated tags described by the subscribe profile. In some examples the interleaver service may additionally take into account the weights and other user preferences defined in the subscriber profile when determining content segments that are applicable to the user s subscriber profile.

At block the interleaver service may determine whether the user is entitled to fantasy points for an event depicted and or described in the one or more determined content segments and if so how many. The fantasy point determination may be made based on calculations of the interleaver service and or based information obtained from one or more other fantasy sports services.

At block the interleaver service may transmit or otherwise cause the one or more content segments to be transmitted to a client device e.g. client device of the user along with a notification and or number of fantasy points to which the user is entitled for events depicted in the content segment s . In this way the interleaver service provides streams of content customized for each user based at least in part on their respective fantasy sports information.

In the context of the example of the interleaver service may use the user s username and password and log into the user s account on one or more fantasy sports platform websites. Having accessed the user s account the interleaver may determine the identities of athletes on the user s fantasy team s and athletes on other teams of interest to the user. Any content related to such athletes would be of interest to the user particularly when the content included video and or audio depictions of the athletes performing in a manner that resulted in fantasy points for the user the user s opponents the user s friends etc.

At block a subscriber profile of the user may be accessed to thereby access one or more topics of interest to the user. In the context of the example of the interleaver service may access the user s subscriber profile which may be located at a data source . Table of illustrates example content of a subscriber profile . The user profile may include information including athlete identification roster information of all of the user s teams and opponents. The subscriber profile may include a large amount of additional data such as the user s favorite athletes favorite teams favorite types of plays favorite sports etc. The user profile may also have marketing information which may assist the user to obtain more relevant commercial messaging. All of this information may be used to identify topics of interest such as particular video content and or clips when they become available.

At block content segments relevant to the topics of interest to the user may be identified. In the context of the examples of the interleaver service may process information including tagged video segments and athlete rosters of each user s fantasy team and league and from such processing determine which tagged video segments are relevant to each user. In some examples the interleaver identifies content segments that are relevant to each user because the identified content segments depict athletes on the user s fantasy team s performing in a manner that awards the user s fantasy team with fantasy points.

At block content segment s are matched to a user and the user s subscriber profile based. The matching may be based on a correlation between the tag s or annotations associated with or part of each content segment and topics to which the subscriber profiles have subscription. In an example a content segment may have tags or annotations indicating that certain athlete s were in a particular content segment and what they accomplished. Additionally the tags may indicate that the performance s resulted in positive or negative fantasy points. The user s subscriber profile may indicate that the user is probably interested in the content of the content segment for one or more reasons. For example the user s fantasy team may include one or more athletes depicted in the content segment or the content segment may depict one or more of the user s favorite athletes and or teams. Accordingly the interleaver performs a matching process by which one or more or each content segment is matched or not matched to one or more users. Such matching may indicate that it is appropriate depending on priority to send the content segment to the user.

At block content segment s may be prioritized based at least in part on relevance to the topics of interest to the user. In particular video clips depicting athletes performances resulting in fantasy points may be prioritized according to importance to the user. In some examples athletes on the user s fantasy team and favorite athletes of the user may be given higher priority while athletes unknown to the user and or not on the user s fantasy team s may be given lower priority. The prioritization may be based on explicit and or implicit preferences of the user. In some examples the interleaver service may apply an algorithm to determine the strength of a match between a content segment and a user s subscriber profile. Explicit preferences may include the user s identified fantasy team roster the user s identified favorite athletes real life teams etc. Implicit preferences may also be used but may be given lower priority. If the user is known to live in the Northwest an implicit preference for athletes playing for the Seattle Seahawks may be assumed. In other examples the user s age may be used to prioritize various content segments produced by various color commentators. The prioritization process may consider factors such as how well the content segment matches the user s subscriber profile how many content segments are currently in the user s segment queue how rapidly the user is consuming content whether the priority of content segments in the user s segment queue is high or low and other factors.

At block one or more content segments may be added to a queue to be served to the client device. The content segments may be added in an order indicated by the priority established at block . The content segments themselves may be placed in the queue or links to the content segments may be put in the queue. If links are put in the queue the user may click the received link to download the actual content segment.

At block fantasy point info may be appended to content segment s in the segment queue. In some examples athletes accomplishments may be associated with content segments before actual fantasy point information becomes available. Thus the content may be segmented and annotated to recognize different athletes performances before an exact fantasy point award associated with a particular user s league and or fantasy sports platform is known. However in many instances such fantasy point information may be obtained from the fantasy sports platform website such as by logging in with the user s username and password or by other means. Once obtained the fantasy point information may be appended or otherwise associated with a content segment. In some examples fantasy point info may be appended by adding a tag to segment s to be displayed by the client device or embedding in the segment e.g. text or audio added to the content of the segment . Fantasy point info may include a notification that the user is entitled to fantasy points for an event depicted in the content segment and or a number of fantasy points to which the user is entitled for the event depicted in the content segment. If the exact fantasy point total is not known when the content segment is added to the segment queue it may be added with it becomes available.

At block a request to reorder the segment queue may be received. In some examples the interleaver service may receive the request which may have been sent by the client device of the user. The user may have seen an indication of a preferred content segment that was not first the segment queue and therefore requested the reordering. At block the content segments in the content queue may be reordered. The reordering may be performed by the interleaver service .

At block one or more ads may be interleaved between content segments. In the context of the example of the ads AD ADand ADhave been added to the custom content . Thus the custom content may be a mixture of at least content segments and ads.

At block content segments s ads and or data including a notification and or number of fantasy points may be served to client device s . In some examples the interleaver service may cause or perform the serving.

At block an estimated score of a fantasy game may be sent or caused to be sent e.g. by a server to a user interface e.g. operable on a client device . The estimated score may be based at least in part on previous performance of at least some athletes participating in the fantasy sports game.

At block a fraction of a performance e.g. one quarter or one half of a game by an athlete may be extrapolated to replace an estimated score of the athlete. At block the fraction used may be updated e.g. from one quarter to two and then three quarters periodically or occasionally as the game involving the athlete progresses.

At block estimated fantasy point scores may be iteratively replaced based in part on actual fantasy point scores for each athlete and or for a fantasy team. Such iterative replacements refine an estimated fantasy point game score of each athlete and collectively the fantasy team. In some examples each time an athlete scores a fantasy point spends a period of time without scoring a fantasy point or ends participation in a real life game the fantasy points earned by the athlete may be used in another iteration of an estimate of the score of the athlete and a fantasy game. Thus as each time an athlete s actual fantasy point score becomes known that score may be used to make a user s fantasy team prediction more accurate.

At block estimated scores of athletes used to calculate the estimated score of a fantasy team may be iteratively or repeatedly replaced as actual scores of the athletes become available and or each time an athlete ends participation in the fantasy game.

At block a final score of the fantasy sports game is sent upon conclusion of participation of all athletes of the fantasy sports game.

At block an estimated score for a fantasy game may be sent to a user interface. In the context of the example of the interleaver may send the estimated score within custom content to a client device .

At block the estimated score of the fantasy game is transitioned into a real score of the fantasy game. The transitioning may be based on increasingly better estimates of a number of fantasy points that will be scored by each of a plurality of athletes on a user s fantasy team.

At block an estimated score of an athlete may be updated based at least in part on a number of fantasy points scored by an athlete or a failure of the athlete to score fantasy points within a portion of a game involving the athlete. At block the estimated score of the fantasy game may be updated based in part on the updated estimated score of the athlete.

At block an estimated score of an athlete may be updated based on at least one fantasy point earned by the athlete. At block the estimated score of the fantasy game may be updated based at least in part on the updated estimated score of the athlete.

At block the estimated score of the fantasy game may be changed as the fantasy game progresses as indicated by results of a plurality of athletes in a plurality of real games.

At block a final score of the fantasy sports game may be sent to a client and or user interface upon conclusion of participation of all athletes of the fantasy sports game.

At block an estimated score of a fantasy game may be sent to a client device and or displayed on a user interface.

At block a listing of teams in a fantasy league within which the fantasy game was played may be sent to a client device and or displayed on a user interface.

At block an updated score which may be based on performance of one or more athletes may be display for each of one or more of the teams in the listing.

At block a plurality of updates to the estimated score may be displayed as athletes perform in a plurality of real life games.

At block estimated score information may be replaced with actual score information as the actual fantasy score information becomes available.

At block a final score of the fantasy sports game may be sent to a client device and or displayed on a user interface upon conclusion of participation of all athletes of the fantasy sports game.

The following paragraphs describe example techniques of integrating fantasy information with video content. As discussed above many people today watch sporting events not only to root for a particular team to win but also to root for individual players that are on their fantasy rosters. For example an individual user may be a Seattle Seahawks fan. The user may also participate in one or more fantasy sports leagues and may have athletes from multiple different actual teams on his or her fantasy sports rosters. Thus the user may have interest in watching the Seahawks games but may also have interest in watching games in which his or her fantasy athletes participate. In some instances the user may watch a game and be rooting for the Seahawks his or her favorite actual team in this example while at the same time rooting for athletes on the opposing team that are on his or her fantasy roster to play well.

When watching a game or sporting event it is often difficult to identify individual players that are on the field at any given time particularly athletes that range around the filed and or do not line up in the same location very time. This application describes techniques for displaying a visual indicator identifying athletes that are on a fantasy roster of the user. The visual indicator may be presented at or proximate to a location on the display at which the athlete of interest is presented on the display and may track the motion of the athlete of interest such that when the athlete of interest moves on the display the visual indicator moves with the athlete of interest. By way of example and not limitation the visual indicator may comprise a halo e.g. proximate the head waist or feet of an athlete silhouette shadow arrow text helmet graphic shoe graphic uniform graphic and or any other visual indicator associated with the athlete of interest and usable to distinguish the athlete s of interest from other athletes depicted in the video content.

In some embodiments visual indicators may be presented for all athletes on the user s fantasy roster. In that case if a user has athletes from two different actual teams on his her fantasy roster and the two actual teams play each other athletes from both teams that are on the user s fantasy roster may include visual indications. In some embodiments visual indicators may additionally or alternatively be presented for all athletes on a fantasy roster of the user s current opponent i.e. the fantasy team that the user s fantasy team is up against . In some embodiments visual indicators may additionally or alternatively be presented for all athletes in a fantasy league in which the user participates. Visual indicators of athletes on a fantasy roster of the user s team may be the same or different than visual indicators of athletes on a roster of an opponent s or other league member s fantasy teams e.g. different colors hues intensities shapes text or other graphics may be used to denote athletes on different users rosters . Furthermore visual indicators for athletes that are currently inactive or benched on the user s fantasy roster may be shown differently or not shown at all than athletes that are active i.e. not on the bench on the user s fantasy roster. Employing such visual indicators allows users to more easily identify the fantasy players on their roster s .

In some examples the visual indicator may be interactive. When the user selects the visual indicator a graphical user interface may be presented e.g. as an overlay or pop up . The graphical user interface may be stationary on the screen or may be linked to the visual indicator such that the graphical user interface moves in conjunction with the visual indicator. In some instances the graphical user interface may comprise biographical information statistics news fantasy points in the game projected fantasy points season total fantasy points or the like. Such informational graphical user interfaces may allow a user to more quickly and easily obtain information about the athletes on their fantasy roster s . In some instances the graphical user interface may display a fantasy roster or a link to such roster of the user which includes the athlete with which the visual indicator is associated. This may provide a more efficient way for the user to manage his or her fantasy roster.

Additionally or alternatively the graphical user interface may comprise one or more controls to control presentation of the video content. By way of example and not limitation the controls may include a camera angle control usable to select an alternate camera view of the events depicted in the video content a zoom control usable to zoom in or out on the athlete associated with the visual indicator a center control usable to center the view on the athlete associated with the visual indicator a replay control to replay a portion of the video content e.g. the last 5 seconds 10 seconds 30 seconds etc. in regular or slow motion a skip control to skip to a previous portion or subsequent in the case of pre recorded video content of the video content depicting a play or event for which the athlete of interest was awarded or decremented fantasy points or otherwise control the playback of the video content. Such controls may allow the user to view video content of athletes on his or her fantasy roster s in ways never before possible. Such additional viewing options may improve the user s understanding of how his or her fantasy athletes are performing which in turn allows the user to better manage his or her fantasy team s .

It can also be difficult for a user desiring to monitor his or her fantasy athletes to keep track of when various athletes on his or her fantasy roster s are playing. Moreover even if a user knows which games his fantasy athletes are playing in and what time those games are the user still needs to know what channel the games are being broadcast on. And even then the user has no way of knowing when the athletes on his fantasy roster are actually on the field during a game. Thus users can spend considerable time locating the games his fantasy athletes are participating in and watching portions of games during which his or her fantasy athletes are not even participating. This application describes techniques to tune channels or stream content based on the fantasy sports roster s of the user. For instance this application describes tuning to video content of games and sporting events that are currently depicting athletes on one or more of the user s fantasy rosters. In some examples a system e.g. game console smart TV computer tablet web service etc. may automatically tune to or access or prompt the user to games or sporting events that depict athletes on one or more of the user s fantasy rosters. Such tuning techniques make it much simpler for a user to watch video content in which his fantasy athletes are currently participating without the need to look up which team his athletes are on what opponent they are playing what time the games are what channel the games are on etc.

There are many ways in which athletes can be identified in video content some examples of which are described above in relation to the interleaver service. By way of example and not limitation athlete s may be identified in video content based on image facial recognition optical character recognition OCR or text recognition of uniform names and or numbers visible or invisible watermarks or quick response QR codes or other machine readable codes which may be applied to athletes uniforms and or helmets or visible or invisible watermark or QR code or other machine readable code added to the video content as an annotation automatically or by a human user.

In some examples athletes may be identified in video content based on human identification of the athlete e.g. by touching pointing gesturing selecting etc. . In some examples the human may additionally designate the athlete s route or motion on the display. In other examples once the human identifies the athlete the system may track the identified athlete using computerized object tracking techniques. The human identification may be implemented by crowdsourcing e.g. mechanical Turk leveraging inputs by other users etc. analysts officials etc. prior to viewing of the game by a user. In some examples these techniques may be applied in real time as the game or sporting event progresses. In other examples the techniques may be implanted when the game or sporting event is being viewed with a tape delay e.g. a slight delay of about 3 seconds to about 60 seconds . The techniques also apply to watching previously recorded video content.

The foregoing techniques may be applied in substantially real time by a computing device of the company or network recording broadcasting or streaming the game by a computing device located at the location of the user viewing the game and or by an intermediate computing device e.g. web service that annotates or supplements the video content with identification of the athletes and their routes or motion in the video content. In some examples portions of the techniques may be performed by computing devices locally at the user s site while portions are performed remotely. For instance video content of a game or sporting event may be annotated substantially contemporaneously with recording of the game content using the computer based and or human techniques described above. The annotation may include for example identification of one or more athletes and their routes or motion in the video content. The annotated video content may then be transmitted to a client device of the user e.g. computer game console set top box smart television tablet etc. or an intermediary service which may determine athletes of interest to the particular user e.g. based on one or more fantasy teams or leagues in which the user participates and may then cause a visual indicator for each of the athletes of interest to the particular user to be presented on a display. Additionally in some instances an intermediate web service located between the source of the content and the user s client device may further process or supplement the video content to include supplemental information such as fantasy sports scores route information play information formation information historical statistics of the athlete or team or the like.

As discussed above video content may be customized to visually indicate a user s fantasy athletes that are depicted in the video content. In some examples the customization of the video content for the user may be performed at a content source e.g. broadcaster distributor cable provider or the like . In other examples the video content may be customized at a client device of the user e.g. computer tablet game console smart TV etc. . In other examples the video content may be customized by an intermediary service such as the interleaver service described above a fantasy sports provider or other web service. In still other examples the content customization may be performed by two or more of a content source an intermediary service and or a client device of the user.

The content source outputs the annotated content. In the illustrated example the content source may output multiple annotated content streams annotated content feeds J corresponding to the video capture devices J . However in other examples the content source may output a single content stream corresponding to one of the video capture devices J . In that case the content source may switch the single content stream among the various content streams of the video capture devices J or the content source may combine or concatenate the various content streams from the video capture devices J into a single composite annotated video stream.

Some or all of the annotated content feeds J are transmitted via a network to one or more client devices mobile device game console . . . K laptop computer where K is any integer greater than or equal to 1. The client devices may comprise any of the client devices described herein and are not limited to the specific examples illustrated. In the illustrated example the same content feeds are transmitted to all of the client devices. That is the annotated content feeds J in this example are not customized for users of the respective client devices . In other examples different content feeds may be transmitted to each of the various client devices . That is the content source may output customized content streams for each client device K each custom content stream annotated to visually indicate the fantasy athletes on rosters of users of the respective client devices .

Referring back to the example of client device receives annotated content feeds J . The client device may have fantasy information about one or more fantasy leagues in which the user of the client device participates stored in memory thereof. Additionally or alternatively the client device may query a remote fantasy sports service to obtain fantasy information including data regarding one or more fantasy leagues in which the user participates. Based on the fantasy information the client device may determine athletes on a roster of a fantasy sports team of a user. Using this information the client device may identify at least one athlete of interest that is on the roster of the fantasy sports team of the user and is depicted in the video content of the game or sporting event. The client device may then output custom content to a display . In the illustrated example the client device and the display are separate. However in other examples the display may be integral with the client device e.g. in the case of a tablet laptop computer or smart TV . The custom content may include the video content of the game or sporting event as well as visual indicators of one or more athletes and other objects and people. Thus the client device causes presentation of the video content of the game or sporting event on the display and a visual indicator associated with at least one athlete of interest to indicate that the athlete of interest is on the roster of the fantasy sports team of the user.

The techniques described with respect to may be initiated in a variety of ways. In one example a user may turn on the client device and tune to a game or sporting event e.g. turn to a channel that on which the game or sporting event is being shown . The client device cause presentation of a graphical interface which shows one or more fantasy leagues in which the user participates. The graphical interface may be presented on a same display on which the user is watching the game or sporting event e.g. a television or other first display or may be presented on a different display e.g. a tablet mobile device or other second display . The user may select a particular league from among the one or more leagues. In some examples the selection of the particular league may be automatic by the system e.g. a default or inferred selection . The system may then determine athletes on the user s team in the particular league and may determine whether any of the athletes on the user s fantasy team in the particular league are participating in the game or sporting event in progress. In other examples selection of a particular league may be omitted entirely and the system may determine whether any of athletes on any of the user s fantasy teams are participating in the game or sporting event in progress. Such athletes may be referred to as athletes of interest. The system may then present on the display a visual indicator for each of the athletes of interest. Each visual indicator may comprise at least one of a halo silhouette shadow arrow text helmet graphic shoe graphic uniform graphic or other indicator associated with the respective athlete of interest. Each visual indicator may be presented at or proximate to a location on the display at which the respective athlete of interest is presented on the display and may track the motion of the athlete of interest such that when the athlete of interest moves on the display the visual indicator moves with the athlete of interest.

As discussed above there are many ways in which athletes can be identified in video content including both computerized and human based techniques. Various computer based techniques for identifying people and objects in video content and annotating the video content are described in the previous sections. is an example user interface that illustrates an example human based annotation technique. One or more human annotators designate one or more athletes or other people or objects in the video content in substantially real time as the game or sporting event progresses. The athlete s may be identified by the annotator s touching a touch screen at locations corresponding to each of the athletes pointing to locations of the athletes on the screen using a mouse or touch pad gesturing to an area of a screen at which the athletes are located or otherwise designating the athletes using some form of user input. Once an athlete is designated the annotator may add some identifying indicia such as a name number jersey number or unique serial number machine readable code or the like. The identifying indicia may be input using a keyboard or other text based input device voice input dragging and dropping the indicia from a list or roster of athletes or the like. In some examples the annotator may additionally designate the athlete s route or motion on the display. In other examples once the human identifies the athlete the system may track the identified athlete using computerized object tracking techniques.

In the example of an annotator has designated two athletes Andrew Luck 45 and Sean Spence 22 by touching the location of each of the athletes on a touch screen display . While or after touching the location of each of the athletes the annotator identifies each athlete using voice input by speaking their respective names and jersey numbers. In other examples other information may be included in the annotations such as position team etc. The annotator then designates a route that each athlete moves in the video content by tracing their movements on the screen Route and Route respectively . This annotation information e.g. identifiers and route information may then be appended to or transmitted separately from the video content to the one or more client devices directly or via one or more intermediary services. The annotation information may be used by the client device s and or intermediary services to identify athletes of interest to each respective user. As discussed above this sort of human based identification may be implemented by crowdsourcing e.g. mechanical Turk leveraging inputs by other users etc. analysts officials etc. prior to viewing of the game by a user.

As shown in the second frame B the visual indicators have moved in accordance with the athletes with which they are associated. That is visual indicators and move to track the respective positions of the athletes to which they are associated. The third frame C shows a still further progression of the video content in which the visual indicators are again moved to track the locations of their respective athletes. Also in the third frame C a graphical user interface is presented in association with the triangular visual indicator . In some examples the graphical user interface may be presented in response to selection of the triangular visual indicator by the user e.g. by touching a touch screen or any of the other input modes described herein . In other examples the graphical user interface may be presented in response to the athlete associated with such indicator having possession of the ball or in response to one or more other triggering event. The graphical user interface in this example includes fantasy statistics number of points in this game and projected points for the game for the player Andrew Luck in this example associated with the visual indicator and a number of controls usable to control playback of the video content. Specifically in the illustrated example the controls include a center control a skip control a roster control and a view control.

The center control is usable to center the displayed video on the athlete associated with the visual indicator. Doing so may result in zooming in on the athlete of interest and cropping a remainder of the video content.

The skip control is usable to skip to another previous or subsequent location in the video content depicting an event in which the athlete associated with the visual indicator was awarded or decremented fantasy points.

The roster control is selectable to open a fantasy roster interface by which the user can make updates or manage his or her fantasy roster. The roster interface may open in the graphical user interface or as a new window or popup on the display.

The view control may be used to select an alternate camera view of the events depicted in the video content. For instance in the case that a content source transmits multiple video content feeds e.g. as in the case of content feeds J in the view control may allow a user to switch between the multiple content feeds to see different camera angles or views of the events depicted in the video content.

At a computing device determines athletes on a roster of a fantasy sports team of a user. In some examples the computing device may comprise a client device such as client device which is located locally at a same location as a display on which the user views the video content. In that case the client device may make the determination based on fantasy roster information stored in memory of the client device or by querying a remote fantasy sports service provider with which the user has an account via a network such as the Internet. Examples of such fantasy sports service providers include without limitation Yahoo Fantasy Sports NFL Fantasy Sports CBS Fantasy Sports Fox Fantasy Sports ESPN Fantasy sports Real Time Fantasy Sports or any other fantasy sports service provider. In other examples the determination may be made by a content source or intermediary device or service that is located at a site remote from the display on which the user views the video content.

At the computing device tunes to video content of a game or sporting event that depicts one or more athletes on one or more fantasy rosters of the user. Tuning to video content in this context includes tuning to an over the air television broadcast tuning to a cable channel tuning to a satellite channel accessing the video content over the Internet or other network or the like. In some examples the video content comprises live video content of a game or sporting event. In other examples the video content may be tape delayed pre recorded or the like. While in this example the computing device tunes to video content that depicts athletes on a fantasy roster of the user the computing device may additionally or alternatively tune to channels that depict other subjects of interest to the user e.g. athletes on a roster of a current fantasy opponent athletes on rosters of other league members favorite athletes of the user etc. . At the computing device receives the video content of the game or sporting event.

At the computing device determined whether one or more athletes of interest to the user are currently depicted in the video content. For example the computing device may determine whether any of the user s fantasy players are currently on the field of play. If not the computing device may return to to tune to other video content that depicts athletes on a fantasy roster of the user. Thus the computing device may actively monitory available video content to tune to content that is currently depicting one or more athletes on a fantasy roster of the user. In this way the user is readily able to view plays involving his or her fantasy athletes without the need to flip back and forth between channels. This helps to ensure that the user does not miss plays involving his or her fantasy players. Also the techniques described herein greatly minimize the amount of time and effort required for a user to watch video content depicting his or her fantasy players.

If at the computing device determines that the video content depicts one or more athletes of interest to the user e.g. on a fantasy roster of the user the computing device may at cause presentation of the video content on a display. The display may be integral with the computing device e.g. in the case of a tablet computer or smart TV or may be separate from the computing device e.g. in the case of a personal computer or game console .

At the computing device may cause presentation on the display of a visual indicator associated with at least one athlete of interest. The visual indicator may highlight or otherwise identify the athlete of interest and indicate that the athlete of interest is on a roster of the fantasy sports team of the user. In this way the user may more easily identify his or her fantasy players in the video content and will be better able to follow their play in the game or sporting event. In some examples the visual indicator may be caused to be presented at or proximate to a location on the display at which the at least one athlete of interest is presented on the display. Additionally in some examples the visual indicator may track the motion of the at least one athlete of interest such that when the at least one athlete of interest moves on the display the visual indicator moves with the at least one athlete of interest. The visual indicator may take many different forms. By way of example and not limitation each visual indicator may comprise a halo silhouette shadow arrow text helmet graphic shoe graphic uniform graphic symbol icon glow outline shape or other indicator usable to designate an athlete of interest. The visual indicators may comprise application of a color hue and or intensity to a portion of the video content to designate the athletes of interest. For instance in one specific example of a visual indicator a helmet and or uniform of an athlete may be made to appear a different color hue and or intensity in order to stand out.

In addition to calling attention to athletes of interest the visual indicators may be interactive. Thus at the computing device may receive an input or selection of a visual indicator by the user. Selection of the visual indicator may cause one or more different operations. For instance as shown at block selection of the visual indicator may cause display of a fantasy roster of the user that includes the athlete of interest with which the visual indicator is associated. In that case the roster may be overlaid on top of the video content as a pop up window or graphic or the roster may replace the video content on the display. In another example shown at block selection of the visual indicator may cause presentation of a control interface usable to control playback of the video content. Graphical user interface is an example of such a control interface. By way of example and not limitation the control interface may include a camera angle control usable to select an alternate camera view of the events depicted in the video content a zoom control usable to zoom in or out on the athlete associated with the visual indicator a center control usable to center the view on the athlete associated with the visual indicator a replay control to replay a portion of the video content e.g. the last 5 seconds 10 seconds 30 seconds etc. in regular or slow motion a skip control to skip to a previous portion or subsequent in the case of pre recorded video content of the video content depicting a play or event for which the athlete of interest was awarded or decremented fantasy points or otherwise control the playback of the video content. Such controls may allow the user to view video content of athletes on his or her fantasy roster s in ways never before possible. Such additional viewing options may improve the user s understanding of how his or her fantasy athletes are performing which in turn allows the user to better manage his or her fantasy team s .

At the computing device may receive selection of a control of the control interface and at may modify the playback of the video content according to the received selection of the control.

While the method is described as being performed by a single computing device in other examples the method may be performed by multiple different computing devices e.g. a client device a content source and or an intermediary service .

At the computing device may cause presentation of the video content of the game or sporting event on a display of the client device e.g. by reproducing the video content captured by the camera of the client device . At the client device may cause presentation on the display of the client device of a visual indicator associated with at least one athlete of interest. The visual indicator may augment the video content displayed on the display of the other device to clearly identify athletes that are on a fantasy roster of the user. As in the preceding section the visual indicator may be presented at or proximate to a location on the display at which the athlete of interest is presented on the display and may track the motion of the athlete of interest such that when the athlete of interest moves on the display the visual indicator moves with the athlete of interest. The visual indicator may take the form of any of the visual indicators described in any of the preceding sections.

Using the techniques described in this section the user may simply point a camera of his or her client device at a television or other display screen presenting conventional video content and the client device may output augmented video content on a display of the client device that includes visual indicators to clearly designate the user s fantasy athletes. This makes it much easier for the user to keep track of the plays and movements of his or her fantasy athletes. Moreover the user may interact with the visual indicators in order to view information about the athlete associated with the visual indicator and or to cause display of a fantasy roster of the user that includes the athlete associated with the visual indicator. These techniques provide the user with greater access to information and provide the user with simpler access to manage fantasy rosters directly from within the video content viewing experience.

The method includes at receiving video content from one or more cameras depicting a game or sporting event. Each camera may record a separate video feed of the game or sporting event from a different angle or vantage point. At a computing device of the content source may determine one or more athletes on a roster of a fantasy team of a user. In some examples the determination of athletes on the user s fantasy roster may be performed at by querying a fantasy sports service provider with which the user has an account and receiving a response from the fantasy sports provider indicating athletes on the roster of the user s fantasy sports team. In other examples at the computing device of the content source may prompt the user to enter athletes on his or her fantasy sports rosters and may receive user input by text voice selection and or gesture indicating the athletes on the user s fantasy roster. In some examples the prompt may be presented on a client device of the user and the input may be received via the user s client device and transmitted to the computing device of the content source.

At the computing device of the content source may identify at least one athlete of interest that is on the roster of the fantasy sports team of the user and is depicted in at least one video feed of the video content of the game or sporting event. At the computing device of the content source may annotate the video content of the game or sporting event to include a visual indicator of the at least one athlete of interest. The video content may be annotated automatically using any of the computerized techniques described herein manually using any of the human based techniques described herein or using a combination of computerized and manual techniques. In some examples at annotating the video content may include modifying the video content such that the visual indicator will be displayed at or proximate a location on a display at which the athlete of interest will be displayed on the display. Additionally or alternatively the annotation may configure the visual indicator to track a motion of the athlete of interest such that the visual indicator will move with the athlete of interest.

At the computing device of the content source may provide the annotated video content to a client device of the user e.g. by transmitting the annotated video content to the client device via a network such as the Internet for presentation on a display at the user s location.

In some implementations a single video feed may be provided by a network covering a particular sporting event e.g. a football game . That feed may be segmented the segmentations annotated with athlete performance and or fantasy point information and the segmentations may be transmitted to particular users based on an interleaver that considers fantasy information of each user.

In other implementations a plurality of video feeds from a plurality of cameras may be provided by a network or other entity. The plurality of video feeds may include the output of a number of cameras that the network has available. Accordingly a game broadcast by a network may include video selected from each of the number of cameras as the network switched between cameras. However video from unselected cameras may include substantial content. This content may actually be valuable to show performances by athletes for which fantasy points may be awarded. Accordingly video segments from several cameras may be concatenated together to fully illustrate an athletic performance of an athlete for which fantasy points may be awarded. Such concatenated segments may be sent to users that have an interest in the fantasy points or athletic performance shown.

In one example a plurality of cameras at a sporting event may provide a plurality of different video feeds and may show different players or locations. In the example of a football game several of the cameras may provide different views as athlete s deliver performance s sufficient for the award of fantasy points. Content from the plurality of cameras may be segmented. Each segment may show all or part of a play and may focus on one or more athletes or aspects of play. Segments from among the plurality of segments may be concatenated to provide a comprehensive account of a performance by an athlete sufficient for award of fantasy points. The views may include different camera angles camera speeds and or different accompanying audio tracks. The concatenated segments may be transmitted to selected users. Users may be selected based in part on a user s fantasy team fantasy league or opposing fantasy team.

On the field of play one or more athletes may perform in a manner consistent with the award of fantasy points. The fantasy points may be awarded by a fantasy sports platform the interleaver service or other entity. In the example of an athlete is shown in a sequence of positions A B and C. In each position the athlete may be visible to a plurality of camera. However in different locations on the field of play different video camera may be better suited to provide content to users. For example at location A cameras and may provide preferred views while at location B camera provides a preferred view. A broadcast network may or may not use a camera which best shows any particular athlete in part because they may be more concerned with an overall best view.

Each video camera provides a video feed as output. In the example shown a plurality of video feeds is shown. Each of the video feeds may be used by a broadcast network frequently or infrequently during the course of a televised broadcast. However unless a split picture is provided by the network only one video feed is used at a time. Accordingly a considerable unused content is potentially available.

The concatenating module is configured to concatenate different segments from among the plurality of segments and to thereby create concatenated segments . Accordingly a plurality of different and or complementary views e.g. segments of the plurality of feeds of an athlete s performance may be concatenated together. Some of the views may have been obtained from each of several different cameras a single camera at several different times or some combination of these. Thus the concatenating module inputs segments obtained from a plurality of feeds and outputs concatenated segments .

At block content may be segmented into a plurality of segments. The content may include a plurality of feeds associated with a plurality of video cameras. The video camera may show different views of a same sporting event.

At block segments may be concatenated to form a comprehensive account of an athlete s performance The segments may be from among the plurality of segments and may show a performance by an athlete sufficient for award of fantasy points.

At block the concatenated segments may be transmitted to particular users based at least in part on the athlete being on fantasy teams of interest to those particular users.

A method of providing data to clients may be performed under control of one or more processors configured with executable instructions. The content may be segmented into a plurality of segments. The segments may depict performance s related to awards of fantasy points. The content may include a plurality of feeds associated with a plurality of video cameras that show different views of a same sporting event. Once segmented some of the plurality of segments may be concatenated. The concatenated segments show a performance by an athlete sufficient for award of fantasy points. This may includes a pass a catch a tackle or other performance. The concatenated segments may be transmitted to particular users based at least in part on the athlete being on fantasy teams of interest to the particular users. The segmenting the may be based at least in part on a play clock or a game clock. The segmenting the content may be based at least in part on recognition of a player formation such as players lined up on the line of scrimmage a pitcher holding the baseball on the mound basketball players gathered for a jump ball etc. The segmenting may associate an audio portion of a first segment with a second segment. For example the audio of a less helpful video segment may be moved to a more helpful or illustrative video segment. The concatenating may include concatenating segments recorded at least partially at the same time. That is various video cameras may be recording relevant information at the same time and such content may be segmented and concatenated. The concatenating of the segments may include concatenating segments from at least two of the plurality of video cameras. The concatenating may included include or combine a slow motion version of one of the plurality of segments to other segments. The concatenating may link two segments from among the plurality of segments wherein an intervening period of time separates the creation or filming of the concatenated segments.

A system may be used to segment concatenate and transmit a compound or concatenated segment to a plurality of users based at least in part on an athletic performance sufficient to award fantasy points and fantasy teams leagues opponents etc. of the users. A content manager in the system may segment content into a plurality of segments wherein the content comprises a plurality of feeds associated with a plurality of cameras. The content manager may also concatenate segments from among the plurality of segments that show a performance of an athlete sufficient for award of fantasy points and that show a plurality of different camera angles of the performance. The system may include a serving module to transmit the concatenated segments to particular users based at least in part on fantasy team associations of the particular users. The system may recognizes a number of the fantasy team associations of the particular users such as fantasy team rosters fantasy sport leagues or fantasy team opponents. The system may include a content manager to segment the content based at least in part on input received from an operator. In an example the operator would consider where to start and end segments made from the content of different video cameras. The content manager may segments the content based at least in part on automated techniques that show game play sufficient to award fantasy points. For example the automated techniques may recognize changes in the scoreboard the play clock referee signals and other events to indicate a starting point and an ending point for various content segments. The content manager may sequentially order the concatenated segments with a segment used by broadcast TV first. The segment used in broadcast TV may have an audio track that provides a preferred description of the events and may be used to put subsequent segments in context. The content selection module may concatenate segments of different length duration in time and or camera angle. The content manager may concatenate segments to depict additional performances of the athlete sufficient for award of the fantasy points. Thus after a currently performance is shown other past performances may be shown. Such a grouping of present and past performances may provide users with more information regarding an athlete. Similarly the content manager may create a concatenated segment for each of a plurality of performances of a plurality of athletes each performance sufficient for award of fantasy points.

A further method may provide data to clients and may be performed under control of one or more processors configured with executable instructions. In an example each of a plurality of feeds associated with a plurality of video cameras may be segmented. The segments may be selected to show different views of a performance by an athlete sufficient for award of fantasy points. The segments may be concatenated from among segments that show the performance from a plurality of camera angles. The concatenated segments may be transmitted to particular users based at least in part on the athlete being on particular fantasy teams or in particular fantasy leagues. The segmenting of each of the plurality of feeds may include segmenting portions of the plurality of feeds based at least in part on a particular play in a football game. The segmenting each of the plurality of feeds may include segmenting the feeds to highlight the performance of the athlete and to show different views of the sporting event that overlap in time. The concatenating of segments may include concatenating segments used by replay officials. Generally content from any camera at the sporting event may be segmented concatenated with other segments to form a concatenated segment that may be transmitted to users. The users to which the content is transmitted may be selected based on fantasy points fantasy teams fantasy leagues and or fantasy opponents.

A plurality of cameras at a sporting event may provide a plurality of different video feeds and may show different players or locations. In the example of a football game several of the cameras may provide different views as athlete s deliver performance s sufficient for the award of fantasy points. Content from the plurality of cameras may be segmented. Each segment may show all or part of a play and may focus on one or more athletes or aspects of play. Segments from among the plurality of segments may be concatenated to provide a comprehensive account of a performance by an athlete sufficient for award of fantasy points. The views may include different camera angles camera speeds and or different accompanying audio tracks. The concatenated segments may be transmitted to selected users. Users may be selected based in part on a user s fantasy team fantasy league or opposing fantasy team.

The client device e.g. client device or or a service or device remote from the display e.g. interleaver service content source or data source fantasy sports service etc. determines athletes on a roster of a fantasy sports team of the user. In some examples the athletes on the roster of the fantasy sports team of the user may be determined by querying one or more fantasy sports services with which the user has an account e.g. Yahoo Fantasy Sports ESPN Fantasy Sports Fox Fantasy Sports Draft Kings Fan Duel etc. to obtain the user s fantasy roster information from the respective fantasy sports service s . This may be accomplished by for example logging in to the fantasy sports service with the user s login credentials e.g. user name and password login credentials of another user in the user s fantasy league an application programming interface API of the fantasy sports service or the like. In other examples the user may input or otherwise provide the list of athletes on the fantasy sports team s of the user. In still other examples the user may identify one or more athletes of interest that are not on a roster of the user s fantasy sports team s .

The client device may then identify at least one athlete that is depicted in the video content of the game or sporting event and is of interest to the user. An athlete may be of interest to the user because the athlete is on a roster of a fantasy sports team of the user is on a roster of a fantasy sports team of an opponent or other member of a fantasy sports league in which the user participates or because the user has indicated that the athlete is of interest e.g. a favorite player for example.

The client device may cause presentation of the video content of the game or sporting event on the display. Along with the video content of the game or sporting event the client device may cause presentation on the display of visual indicators associated with the one or more athletes of interest to indicate that the athletes of interest are currently being depicted on the display. The visual indicator may indicate why the athlete is of interest to the user e.g. that the athlete is on a roster of a fantasy sports team of the user is on a roster of a fantasy sports team of an opponent or other member of a fantasy sports league in which the user participates or because the user has indicated that the athlete is of interest etc. . In some examples the visual indicators are caused to be presented at or proximate to locations on the display at which the respective athletes of interest are presented on the display. In some examples each visual indicators may track the motion or location of the respective athlete of interest on the display screen such that as the athlete of interest moves so does the visual indicator. The visual indicators may be constant e.g. a constant shape size color etc. or may be dynamic or variable e.g. changing in size shape color intensity etc. over time. In one example a visual indicator may appear to rotate or spin as it tracks the motion of the athlete of interest.

In some examples the visual indicator comprises an identifier of an entity such as a company or organization. For example the identifier may comprise a logo symbol or text of the entity. In some examples the identifier of the entity may comprise a name symbol or logo or text identifying a company sponsoring the game or sporting event which is being presented a fantasy sports provider with which the user has an account or another company. The client device or other computing device may select a particular visual indicator e.g. logo symbol text name etc. to present as the visual indicator based at least in part on one or more preferences interests or actions of the user. For example if the user has explicitly or implicitly expressed interest in a topic the visual indicator may be chosen based at least in part on the topic. By way of example and not limitation if the user has expressed an interest in purchasing a truck e.g. by searching for the term truck or for a specific truck or type of truck using a search engine by clicking on a link or advertisement for a truck by watching a video about trucks or tagged with the term truck by writing a post about trucks on a social networking site or micro blogging site or the like the visual indicator may be selected to be a company that sells trucks. In another example if the user has previously ordered an item e.g. pizza the visual indicator may be associated with a pizza company e.g. Zippy s pizza . In some examples different visual indicators may be used to represent different athletes of interest. For instance in a first athlete of interest is designated with a first visual indicator Zippy and a second athlete of interest is designated with a second visual indicator Acme . In some examples the visual indicators may be of competitors e.g. companies that sell similar or competing products . In other examples multiple instances of a same visual indicator may be used to designate multiple different athletes of interest. The visual indicators may be sent to the client device by a content provider e.g. content sources or fantasy sports provider e.g. fantasy sports service ad provider e.g. ad source or other service e.g. interleaver . In some examples the visual indicator may be designated by or appended to the video content itself e.g. as metadata appended to the video content .

In some examples the visual indicators may be interactive. That is by touching e.g. using a touch screen saying the name of e.g. using voice input looking at e.g. using eye tracking input gesturing e.g. using a gesture input camera or otherwise selecting a visual indicator a user may invoke some action. For instance in response to receiving an input selecting the visual indicator associated with an athlete of interest the computing device may cause presentation of an updated projected fantasy score for the athlete of interest. The updated projected fantasy score may be based at least in part on a portion of the game or sporting event remaining The updated projected fantasy score may be computed as described with respect to . illustrates an example in which a user has selected the Zippy visual indicator and in response to selection of the visual indicator additional information about the athlete of interest is presented. In the example shown in the athlete of interest is Andrew Luck and the additional information includes an indication of a last play for which Andrew Luck was awarded fantasy points six points and a link to view the last play a current total fantasy points to this point in the game 20 points an original projected number of fantasy points 30 points which is struck through and an updated projected fantasy point total 42 points based at least in part on a portion of the game remaining

In another example in response to receiving an input selecting the visual indicator associated with an athlete of interest the computing device may cause presentation of an advertisement for or coupon redeemable at an entity such as a company sponsoring the game or sporting event a fantasy sports provider a maker of the client device or another entity. and illustrate such examples. As shown in responsive to selection of the Zippy visual indicator the client device causes presentation of the name of the athlete of interest as well as a coupon for 50 off a pizza at Zippy s pizza. The user is invited to click on the coupon to place an order for Zippy s pizza using the coupon . illustrates an example in which responsive to selecting the Acme visual indicator an ad for an Acme product the Acme Model S vehicle is caused to be presented to the user. In this example the ad is overlaid on the video content as a popup or window. However in other examples the ad may be presented in other ways. For instance the Acme visual indicator may transform into an image of the Acme Model S which may be used to designate the athlete of interest.

In another example in response to receiving an input selecting the visual indicator associated with an athlete of interest the computing device may cause presentation of an ad. illustrates an example in which an ad for the Acme Model S is presented to the user. The ad includes an embedded video clip and an invitation to the user to view the video clip. In this example the user is enticed to view the video by an offer to increase their potential winnings in a daily fantasy sports contest in which they are a participant. Specifically in this example the user is participating in a daily fantasy sports contest with a company called Daily Fantasy Pro. The winner of the daily fantasy sports contest wins a cash award or pot. If the user watches the video of the Acme Model S Acme has offered to increase the value of the pot. The increase may be an absolute dollar value e.g. 5 or a multiplier of an already existing pot e.g. double the pot . Thus if the user clicks on the ad the value of the pot will be increased. In some examples the increase in the value of the pot is applicable only if the user wins the contest not if another player wins the contest.

In yet another example in response to receiving an input selecting the visual indicator associated with an athlete of interest the client device may cause presentation of a trivia question. In some examples the trivia question may relate to the athlete of interest. illustrates such an example. As shown in responsive to the user selecting the Acme visual indicator the client device causes presentation of a trivia question regarding the athlete of interest associated with the visual indicator namely Sean Spence in this example. The trivia question in this example is a multiple choice question having three potential answers. The user may select from among the potential answers. As shown the user has selected the third potential answer. The client device receives a response to the trivia question. Throughout the game or sporting event the user s answers to multiple trivia questions may be captured and the results may be provided to a fantasy sports provider or other service e.g. interleaver service . Similarly other members of the user s fantasy sports league may be presented with trivia questions regarding their athletes of interest. The answers of all the players may be tabulated and the users scores may be provided. Thus in addition to the underlying fantasy sports matchups users may also compete in a trivia game with the other players in their fantasy sports league s . In some examples the trivia scores may be entirely separate from and may not impact the outcome of the fantasy sports contests. However in other examples the trivia scores may be added to aggregated with averaged with or may otherwise impact the outcome of the fantasy sports contests. This adds another level of competition to the fantasy sports leagues. The trivia scores may be presented on a league home page or schedule. Additionally or alternatively the trivia scores may be served to players as clips e.g. by the interleaver .

An audio generator may be located within or in communication with the interleaver module the data sources and or elsewhere. The audio generator may generate a plurality of custom audio soundtracks for all or part of some or all of the copies of each of a plurality of video clips. Accordingly audio for use with a particular clip may be customized according to the fantasy information and or fantasy points associated with a specific user and or client device. The audio may be further customized based on the user to which the clip is sent. Thus a plurality of users may receive the same or similar video e.g. because their teams which may be in different leagues have overlapping athletes on their rosters . However the audio may be customized for each user s particular fantasy point fantasy team and or fantasy league situation.

In one example the client device may play video showing athletes particularly athletes earning fantasy points. The video may include some or all of the audio originally associated with the clip by the data sources e.g. network commentators and crowd noise . However it may also include custom audio created by the audio generator. The custom audio may provide fantasy point information specific to each user of each copy of each video clip. Continuing the example a video clip may include some of the original audio used in a televised or internet broadcast of a game e.g. NFL NBA MLB etc. and some custom audio from the audio generator. The custom audio may report fantasy point information reference the user s team name reference the opponent s team name or other information that is relevant to the user but which may not be relevant to other users. The custom audio may replace original audio over a portion of the video clip or may be used while repeating all or part of the video clip or may be otherwise used.

While the audio generator may be used to report fantasy point information to a user such fantasy information may also be reported by annotations to the video e.g. annotations in . For example an inset box a header a footer and or other text may be used to convey fantasy point information. In one example the user may select how the user would like fantasy point information to be conveyed by configuring the operation of a user interface. The user may select to have one or both of audio and text report fantasy point information.

Referring to the example of an audio track for each video segment may comprise the audio track of the content obtained from the content source s . In one example a television and or sports network may provide audio video content to the interleaver service . The audio portion of such audio video content i.e. original audio may be utilized as all or part of the custom content sent to client device s . However such audio received as part of the content may not include fantasy point information available in the data . Accordingly custom audio may be generated for at least some of the custom content . In one example custom audio is utilized with original audio with at least some video clips sent to clients . The custom audio may report fantasy point information e.g. regarding an associated video clip fantasy team score information and or fantasy league standings.

Referring to the example of a plurality of video clips may be segmented from at least one content stream such as a sporting event. Thus content feeds from each of several live football soccer baseball or other games may be segmented into segments or plays. At least some of the segmented video clips may be annotated or associated with linked to or otherwise associated with fantasy point information. The annotations may be attached to video clip data of each clip or may be associated with the video clip by means of data pointers a database or other data structure. While all or part of the audio originally created with the video may be retained portions of at least some of the plurality of video clips may be associated with customized audio. The customized audio may report fantasy point information describe the performance of various athletes and or provide other information to an owner of a fantasy sport team.

In the example of different users may receive different mixes of the plurality of video clips. Moreover at least some video clips received by some user s may have a custom soundtrack based at least in part on the fantasy point information annotated and or associated with each clip. Different users in different leagues having a same athlete on their fantasy teams may receive the same or similar custom audio. However the audio may be customized to each particular user based at least in part on the particular user s fantasy team s favorite athletes of the particular user key or best known athletes fantasy team s of the user s opponent s etc. A user may watch a video clip with audio sound track announcing the user s name as fantasy team owner the name of that user s fantasy team a description of the exploits of a particular athlete and a particular fantasy point value awarded by that user s league for the athlete s performance. Another user e.g. in another league may or may not see the same clip either because of the same athlete or a different athlete in the same clip. The custom audio heard by that user may differ in that the audio may mention that user s different team name and perhaps different fantasy points awarded by that user s league and or fantasy sports platform e.g. Yahoo or other provider .

An audio generator AG provides fantasy point information play by play calls and or other information. In one example the AG play calls most all of the plays having fantasy point significance to teams within a league. The AG refers to at least some of the teams in the league their athletes and or fantasy points associated with video clips. The user may select a preferred voice for the customized audio. The AG may describe performances by one or more athletes and discuss fantasy points associated with the performances. The AG may refer to total fantasy points and or projected fantasy points for a fantasy team and an opponent of the fantasy team. That is the AG may talk about which team has more points and or which team is ahead. The AG may refer to playoff hopes and or league standings of one or more fantasy teams. The AG may be mixed with network supplied audio each of which is used over portions of the video clip. The AG may just talk over all or part of the clip to deliver the fantasy point information and then the entire clip may be played with the network supplied audio. Thus the user may see all part of the action as described by the AG and then all part of the action as described by network audio. The AG may mix generic audio intended for a plurality of users e.g. descriptions of athletes with custom words or phrases like team names exact fantasy points awarded by different leagues etc. . The AG may overlay some or all of the video clip. Just like the announcer at a Spokane Indians game or on Spokane radio is biased in favor of the home team the AG may be biased in favor of the user s fantasy team the Gears of Warriors are really showing their superiority on the field now particularly with that last run by . . . . Alternatively and particularly for party mode the AG may be neutral like professional network announcers.

A server may provide video clips and an audio generator audio track that may cover some or all of any video clip. The AG may discuss fantasy point information athlete s performances fantasy game scores etc. The AG creates a custom audio cover for the video clips that is different for different clients.

The server may allow entertainers to upload their audio cover of individual clips. The user may select an entertainer by selecting an entertainer for one clip or by setting a hierarchy of entertainers etc. The AG may allow selection between outrageous extreme announcing and professional conventional announcing. This may be on a slider allowing younger users to select an announcer that is more popular to them and others to do the same. The user may assign a fight song to be played when certain fantasy points are scored or fantasy point information is present. E.g. a favorite song may play when the user scores more than X value points when the user is ahead in the game etc. as selected by a UI. A server may provide video clips and an audio generator audio track that may cover some or all of any video clip. The AG may discuss fantasy point information athlete s performances fantasy game scores etc. The AG creates a custom audio cover for the video clips using fantasy point information. The server provides a user interface to the client so that the user may select preferred announcers for the soundtrack.

The content is segmented into video clips which may include short periods of play within the game. In the context of an example related to fantasy football a video clip may show one play or down several plays e.g. a goal line stand by the defense or other segment of a game. In the context of baseball the video clip may show one pitch and any resulting play base running or one up by a batter. In the context of car racing the video clip may show a lead change a pit stop or other action.

Each video clip may be annotated or scored by assigning fantasy points to one or more athletes e.g. the quarterback or groups of athletes e.g. the defense within the clip. The annotation process may or may not involve attachment of metadata to the video clip. The fantasy point information may be associated with the clip e.g. by a database or attached to the clip.

The annotation process may involve assignment of different fantasy point values to the performance of athletes based on factors including a provider of the fantasy sports host or website used by the user s league particular point characteristics of the user s leagues e.g. as set by the league s commissioner or other factors. Thus the fantasy points assigned to any particular athlete for any particular play may vary among different users in different leagues using different fantasy sports website hosts etc.

The assignment of fantasy points may be performed in a manual or automated manner. In an example of manual assignment of fantasy points a reviewer watches the clip and assigns fantasy points based on the observation. The result may be both subjective and objective particularly if the exact yardages of a gain are not immediately known.

Alternatively fantasy points for one or more video clips may be obtained from different fantasy sport league team hosts such as Yahoo Sports etc. in an automated manner. Thus the exact number of fantasy points that each league based on that leagues rules etc. and or each fantasy sports host assigns to an athlete in a particular clip may be obtained scraped from servers of that league. Accordingly a slightly different number of fantasy points may be attached to an athlete s performance depending on the fantasy sports host the fantasy league and other factors. Such points may be obtained from a fantasy sports user s account e.g. by use of the user s login and password through an account of a fellow league member of the user or by other means.

Appropriate video clips particularly those in which one or more athletes was assigned a fantasy point may be sent i.e. pushed by servers e.g. the interleaver to appropriate clients i.e. the client devices of users . In some examples each clip is sent to the devices of those users having an interest in one or more of the athletes depicted in the clip. The user s interest may be that an athlete depicted in the clip may be on a roster of fantasy team s of the user the athlete may even if not on the user s fantasy team be a favorite of the user the athlete may be on an opponent s fantasy team or on the fantasy team within the user s league. The athlete may play for a real life favorite team of the user. The athlete may have performed a favorite play e.g. touchdown or homerun of the user. The servers may also send video clips to clients according to other reasons such as required by settings or rules which may have been established by the server or client.

Depending on time available at the client to play the video clips which are pushed or sent by the server the client may require either shorter or longer versions of the clips or follow up information related to one or more clips. For example if the client is currently scoring many fantasy points and currently receiving many video clips shorter versions of the video clips perhaps lacking commentator or announcer discussion may be sent. However if the client is currently scoring fewer fantasy points and receiving fewer video clips than the client has time to play longer video clips may be sent. Such longer clips may include more instant replays perhaps in slow motion color commentator annotations or more such additions longer coverage of the extra point after a touchdown etc.

CLIENT IN PULL MODE. Techniques for configuring and operating a sports network client are described herein. In some examples a client may be associated with a fantasy team comprising a plurality of athletes. The client may request clips associated with portions of a plurality of audio video feeds each feed associated with a game e.g. a football game . Some of the requested clips may be associated with athletes on fantasy teams of interest to the client. The client may display one or more of the requested clips after receipt. The client may also display fantasy point information in a play related and or cumulative manner.

A fantasy sport e.g. football application may provide an estimated score at or prior to the beginning of a fantasy game. Fantasy football applications may also provide a running total of the fantasy points earned by different fantasy teams. However this running total is problematic when compared to other fantasy team s running totals because some fantasy teams have more athletes in either earlier or later games. Accordingly while one fantasy team may have more points the other fantasy team is in a better position since it has many athletes who have not even begun to play.

The innovation uses the full projected score only for the athletes who have not yet played. The projected score may be used in part for athletes whose game is in progress. However as real life play progresses the projected score may be supplemented or altered by use of actual rather than estimated fantasy scores for the athletes who are playing or have played. Thus as real life games progress substitution of actual fantasy point information for estimated fantasy point information becomes a progressively better estimate of the actual fantasy game score.

In some examples an estimated score of a fantasy game may be sent e.g. from a server to a user interface e.g. operable on a client for reference before the fantasy game. Since real life play has not yet started an estimate of a user s fantasy team score may be made in part by reference to past performance of each athlete fielded by a fantasy team. As real life play is performed the fantasy points that will be earned by each athlete on a user s team are more easily estimated. For example after one or two quarters of play of a real life game each athlete s fantasy points could be multiplied by four or two respectively as an estimate of the entire game s fantasy points. Alternatively at halftime the before game estimate could be reduced by half and added to the athlete s current fantasy point total as a revised estimate. Accordingly a variety of algorithms could be used to provide increasingly better fantasy point estimates for each athlete and the user s entire fantasy team as that athlete s play progresses in the real life game. Accordingly the user interface at the client could be caused to update an estimate each athlete s fantasy points and or the user s fantasy team points as real life games progress. And further this progressively better estimate could be used to compare to the user s fantasy league opponent as play progresses.

An example method comprising under control of one or more processors configured with executable instructions sending an estimated score of a fantasy game to a user interface iteratively replacing estimated scores of athletes used to calculate the estimated score based in part on actual scores of the athletes thereby creating a refinement of the estimated score sending the refinement of the estimated score for display on the user interface and sending a final score of the fantasy sports game upon conclusion of participation of all athletes of the fantasy sports game.

The method of any preceding example additionally comprising calculating the estimated score of the fantasy game for use at least before the fantasy game begins wherein the estimated score is based at least in part on previous performance of at least some athletes participating in the fantasy sports game.

The method of any preceding example additionally comprising performing another iteration each time an athlete ends participation in the fantasy game.

The method of any preceding example wherein iteratively replacing estimated scores of athletes comprises extrapolating a fraction of a performance of an athlete to replace an estimated score of the athlete and updating the fraction used periodically as a game involving the athlete progresses.

The method of any preceding example wherein the calculating is performed on either a client or a server and the user interface is operable on the client.

The method of any preceding example wherein the estimated score the refinement of the estimated score or the final score may be altered to reflect utilization of benched athletes according to alternative scenarios.

The one or more computer readable media of any preceding example wherein display of the plurality of updates comprises replacing estimated score information with actual score information as the actual scores become available.

TRANSITION SCORE ESTIMATE. Techniques for fantasy sport score reporting are described herein. An example fantasy football team may include a number of athletes that play for a number of professional teams in a football league. Performance of the athletes in their real life games earns each athlete points which aid the fantasy teams with which they are associated. In a game between the two fantasy teams an initial estimated score is provided based at least in part on information on athletes on each team. As real life games are played by the real life athletes how well certain athletes performed and therefore portions of the estimated score become known. As the information becomes known the estimated score is refined. Ultimately the estimated score is completely replaced with an actual score.

Some users may watch and control operation of downloaded clips and other content on devices including a TV laptop tablet or cell phone etc. using a client user interface UI . The UI may enable functionality including moving athletes from bench to game trading athletes with other teams or acquiring free agents. The UI may provide fantasy point information estimated score information transition score information individual athlete estimated point information transition point information and or final fantasy point information. The UI may display video clips related to fantasy point information. For example a video clip of a completed pass of a strikeout may be displayed. The UI may allow the user to alter an order of the queued video clips in the video buffer. In some examples the UI may show that a touchdown is present in the buffer and may allow the client may move it to a higher priority. In other examples the UI may provide information about clips in the buffer such as by annotations e.g. touchdown interception short gain etc. . The UI may allow the client to page through icons links or other representations of available clips previously seen and or unseen in the buffer. The UI may allow the client to replay clips. The UI may allow the client to pause a clip or switch to a different clip. The UI may allow the client to filter plays e.g. for point importance . The user interface may allow the client to order and or request plays in the buffer e.g. by chronology or importance . The UI may allow the client to rewind freeze frame zoom in etc. The UI may allow the client to enter pull mode or to perform pull mode functions and to make general or specific requests for content. The requested content may include video clips such as specific clips clips having some characteristic such a certain fantasy point score characteristic . The UI may allow a request for other content e.g. requests for specific color commentators types of commercials plays by particular team s cheerleaders cheering cheerleader interviews end zone dances etc . Some clients may be in multiple fantasy leagues and may use the UI to switch back and forth between teams leagues and or sports.

Another class of video clips may include video clips related to favorite athletes of the user even if those athletes are not on the user s fantasy team. Another class of video clips may include video clips related to one or more favorite real life teams of the user. Another class of video clips may include video clips related to athletes that are not on a team in the user s fantasy league and are therefore available for draft. Another class of video clips may include video clips related to certain types of plays e.g. touchdowns or homeruns or that have greater than a threshold fantasy point value e.g. game highlights . Other classes of video clips are easily understood or envisioned. The UI allows the user to prioritize such classes to obtain video clips of greater interest to the user.

The user interface of any preceding example wherein the user interface further comprises a selector to prioritize classes of video clips that the user would like to have displayed on the screen.

The user interface of any preceding example wherein the user interface further comprises a device to allow a plurality of users to indicate group utilization of the screen wherein the screen displays video clips having fantasy point information to each of the plurality of users during operation.

In some examples some users are more interested in the athletics associated with fantasy point information while other users may be more interested in watching color commentators. Thus the UI may allow the user to vary or balance the relative or total amount of time spent displaying different classes of content on the screen. In a particular example the UI allows the user to select such as by operation of a slide bar between greater emphasis and time spent watching A video clips related to the athletics that resulted in fantasy point award or B video clips or or related to color commentators.

The user interface of any preceding example wherein the user interface further comprises a selector to vary a relative amount of time spent displaying classes of content on the screen wherein the classes include video clips of athletic that resulted in fantasy point award and video clips of color commentators.

In some examples users may have preferences for particular color commentators whether the color commentators are individuals e.g. a sportscaster a comedian a cheerleader etc. or groups e.g. a musical band etc. In a particular example the UI allows the user to select and or prioritize between different color commentators. Accordingly when color commentary is available from a plurality of color commentators the UI will prioritize that content so that preferred color commentary is displayed to the user.

The user interface of any preceding example wherein the user interface further comprises a device to allow the user to prioritize color commentators and to thereby indicate a preference for content that is displayed on the screen.

In some examples the user may want to send a second user content such as a video clip to which fantasy points have been awarded a video clip by a color commentator etc. In a particular example the user enters a user name or similar of another user and indicates the content to be sent. The content may be sent by the user or by servers of the second user. Optionally the second user may be required to accept the content. The second user may see a notification of the content s arrival and may be able to view an indication of the content in the second user s buffer or queue.

In a particular example a second user may want to see a specific athletic play or a specific color commentator that was displayed to a first user. Accordingly the second user may learn of new favorite athletes color commentators and or other content providers. In a further example the second user may provide information to the UI of the second user identify the first user and thereby identify and or access content sent to the first user. In a particular example the second user may provide an email address of the first user to the UI of the second user. The UI may provide the second user with a look at the past and present queue of the first user and the second user may select content that the second user may desire.

The user interface of any preceding example wherein the user interface further comprises a device to allow a second user to enter an identification of a first user a device to allow the second user to select content based at least in part on content previously displayed to the first user.

In some examples a user may want to look at a queue or buffer of available content and select a preferred video clip first. In some examples the video clips may have already been downloaded by the client device. In other examples the video clips may be available for download. In either example the user may indicate such as by entry to the UI which video clip and or what content the user wants to see next. In a variation the user may also want to look into the queue or buffer of a cooperating friend and select content that is available to the friend. The content available for download may depend on a number of factors such as A which of the user s fantasy athletes have scored fantasy points due to their play in real life games B what video clips of what color commentators have been triggered by different fantasy points awards C what video clips the user has asked for or shown interest in D video clips related to the user s real life favorite teams E and other video clips and content.

Each client may receive a combination of video clips and commercial video clips. In some examples a commercial may be sent by servers and may be located in a buffer by the client. The user interface UI may describe the commercial to the user and may allow the user to swap it for a different commercial. The commercial may work its way to the first spot in the buffer and then be displayed. In some examples the client may be able to pay or otherwise provide value and avoid the commercial. The commercials may be sent by the server at off times when fewer clips e.g. clips with fantasy points associated with the user s fantasy team for which the client has interest are available. In some examples commercials may be repositioned from an original reception order. At any given time during a commercial particularly upon arrival of an important play i.e. video clip the commercial may be abruptly stopped commercial interrupt and the video clip started. The abrupt stop to the commercial may coincide with an audio and or video logo. An algorithm may be used to determine a value of an event that can interrupt a commercial.

The method of any preceding example additionally comprising collecting user input indicating how fantasy point information should be used to prioritize the plurality of video clips and selecting the video clip base in part on the collected user input.

In some examples aspects of the pull mode for client and or server discussed above may be combined with aspects of the client s user interface UI . In some examples the video clips pushed to a client may not provide a continuous video feed. In such an example the pushed video clips may be based on fantasy sports points. The scoring of fantasy points may not result in sufficient video clips to fill the time a user is will to a lot to watching the client device. The client may therefore ask for more content such as additional video clips. The video clips may include replays of prior shown video clips highlights of various games that may not involve fantasy points relevant to the user video clips related to athletes that the user is scouting for possible draft to the user s fantasy team etc. In other examples when the client s buffer is empty or low servers may provide suggestions e.g. suggestions sent to the client s UI of video clips for the user watch. The UI may also allow pull mode type requests e.g. requests for clips not directly related to the user s fantasy team from the clients. The user may request video clips from one or more of the user s favorite teams favorite athletes etc. and may watch a stream of such clips optionally interleaved with fantasy point related clips. The server may respond to requests from the clients and their UI s with many options for video clips and or other content. In an example if there are 32 NFL teams there could be 100 touchdowns on a typical Sunday and clients could request download of clips so that the user could watch them all perhaps interleaved with commercial messages . The user and or client could request such video clips at any time during the week not just Sunday .

In some examples a user may want to have bet e.g. gaming or good natured bet between friends placed on one or more games e.g. football baseball etc. . The user may want see key plays clips segments portions etc. of the one or more games. The one or more games may be played at least partly at the same time. Clips from the game s may be identified based at least in part on 1 a threshold level of benefit to a team in one of the games 2 a change in the likelihood of a final score of one of the games 3 a change in the odds of a team winning one of the games 4 a change in the odds of any factor on which the user has placed a wager or 5 a change of concern or interest to a party to a wager on the game or contest. For example a gain of yardage in football a hit or strikeout in baseball a lead change in NASCAR etc. may result in identification of a clip. Once identified the clip is transmitted to appropriate clients from among a plurality of clients.

In some instances video feed s may be received at server s the video feed s may be segmented into clips the clips may be annotated with metadata and or other distinguishing identification and appropriate clips may be sent to each client. A user associated with a client may have an interest e.g. gaming gambling or personal favorite team etc. in one or more of the athletes contestants teams games or contests. If so clips associated with those interest s may be transmitted to that client. The annotations may indicate clips that are of particular interest to users who have wagered on an event and may be used to flag clips for transmission to appropriate users.

In some examples bandwidth may be a problem for some clients. Their data plans may be overwhelmed if they use a mobile client without Wi Fi. However if two or more users are near to each other and have Bluetooth or other RF system e.g. near field communication then if one of them downloads a video clip and perhaps associated color commentary commercial etc. the video clip s may be transmitted by RF Bluetooth to the other friend s . An algorithm could be utilized to decide which friend downloads a clip needed by two or more friends. In some examples the downloading could be alternated between clients the download could be performed by a client that has successfully has logged into Wi Fi or the download could be performed according to which client needs the clip first etc. RF and or Bluetooth friend circles could be formed and the video clips could be more economically downloaded and advantageously shared among the friends.

An example method comprising under control of one or more processors configured with executable instructions receiving information indicating that a group of users is utilizing a single client creating a plurality of video clips from content associating fantasy point information with each video clip selecting video clips that have fantasy point information of interest to at least one user from among the group of users and transmitting the video clip to the single client.

In some examples the actual game announcers of a content provider e.g. television network could be used for the audio of one or more clips. Alternatively clip commentators CCs could provide an audio track to the video clip s and or could provide an accompanying video clip. The users of fantasy sports clients could subscribe one or more CCs who could add color commentary to the clips sent to the user. There might be CCs who would specialize in one team e.g. Green Bay or would specialize in several of their favorite or disliked athletes. Transmission of a CC clip to subscribing clients might be triggered by a fantasy point event such as an award of fantasy points to an athlete s and or a team. The transmission could be sent to all subscribing clients perhaps based in part on conflict resolution with other CCs. The client user interface might allow the user to select from among the thousands of CCs and each CC would try to develop a following. Conflicts between CCs might be resolved by the user interface. A conflict could be caused when a single event e.g. an award of fantasy points to an owned athlete and a favorite team result from a single play. The user interface may allow the creation of a hierarchy of CCs or could provide questions such as Would the user rather listen to the CC specializing in Green Bay or the CC specializing in some athlete who plays for GB Because real life games may overlap one CC can t cover everything in a live mode. However prerecorded CC audio e.g. overlay on the video clips or audio video e.g. accompany video clip s may be made by CC. Such content may be transmitted to clients such as if indicated by the user of the client on the user interface. In some examples thousands of people e.g. attentions seekers cheerleaders sports experts etc. could provide either audio overlays and or accompanying video to clips e.g. based on characteristics of the clip . CCs could pre record clips to be shown along with before during and or after clips in the event of a touchdown by a certain athlete or team a fumble an interception etc.

In some examples a server provides video clips to the clients. Each video clip may that include one or more plays e.g. touchdowns home runs goals etc. of real athletic games. Each clip may include fantasy point information e.g. athlete s in the clip were awarded fantasy points . Each clip may be sent to clients who have an interest in the clip based on a roster of their fantasy team or an opponent s fantasy team. The clip may be sent to other clients based on those clients interest in the real life team athlete play type e.g. touchdown etc. In addition to the clips as part of the clips or attached to the clips etc. the server s may send clips to one or more clients that include professional or amateur color commentators CC . The CC clips may be audio and or audio video clips. Audio CC clips may be played while a video clip of athletes or other content is played. A user with a client device may request clips from preferred CCs in certain circumstances. The user may indicate by operation of a user interface UI of the client device that whenever a certain athlete is awarded fantasy points that the associated clip should be sent to the client along with a particular color commentator e.g. color commentator i.e. CC . To continue the example the user may also request clip s by CC to be sent along with clips of another athlete and clip s by CC whenever a certain type of play is made or a certain team scores etc. Accordingly the user may have a list of CCs to which the user subscribes. Thus event s e.g. events that are marked by award of fantasy points scores by favorite teams etc. may trigger transmission by the server s to a client of one or more CC clips. The CC clips may be interleaved with clips sent to a client based on fantasy point information etc.

An example method of providing video clips from a server to a client comprising storing in a memory communicatively coupled to a processor computer executable instructions for performing the method executing the instructions on the processor according to the instructions being executed segmenting content into video clips associating fantasy point information with one or more of the video clips selecting a client based at least in part on the fantasy point information selecting a color commentator clip depicting a color commentator based on an association between the color commentator depicted in the color commentator clip and fantasy points assigned to a video clip and a preference indicated by the selected client for the color commentator providing the video clip to the selected client and providing the selected color commentator clip to the selected client.

During certain periods of time e.g. overnight non game days during an off season etc. there may be limited amounts new content segments available that match a user s subscriber profile. During such periods the interleaver may provide the user with reruns of previously served segments favorite segments previously unviewed segments from past fantasy sports games segments viewed by social contacts of the user or various other content segments. The content segments served in such periods may be based at least in part on the user s subscriber profile.

In some examples aspects of the pull mode for client and or server discussed above may combined with aspects of the client s user interface UI . In some examples the video clips pushed to a client may not provide a continuous video feed. In such an example the pushed video clips may be based on fantasy sports points. The scoring of fantasy points may not result in sufficient video clips to fill the time a user wants to allot to watching the client device. The client may therefore ask for more content such as additional video clips. The video clips may include replays of prior shown video clips highlights of various games that may not involve fantasy points relevant to the user video clips related to athletes that the user is scouting for possible draft to the user s fantasy team etc. In other examples when the client s buffer is empty or low servers may provide suggestions e.g. suggestions sent to the client s UI of video clips for the user watch. The UI may also allow pull mode type requests e.g. requests for clips not directly related to the user s fantasy team from the clients. The user may request video clips from one or more of the user s favorite teams favorite athletes etc. and may watch a stream of such clips optionally interleaved with fantasy point related clips. The server may respond to requests from the clients and their UI s with many options for video clips and or other content. In an example if there are 32 NFL teams there could be 100 touchdowns on a typical Sunday and clients could request download of clips so that the user could watch them all perhaps interleaved with commercial messages . The user and or client could request such video clips at any time during the week not just Sunday .
