This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62 143 758 entitled Viewer Traffic Visualization Platform and filed Apr. 6 2015 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present specification generally relates to technology for visualizing viewer traffic such as but not limited to the viewer traffic of a given show relative to other competing show s and or content provider s .

Audience measurement systems such as the audience measurement system provided by Nielsen are capable of measuring TV viewing behavior by capturing data from national and local meters installed in the homes of a segment of the population and analyzing that data to determine how many people are watching the various shows that are on air. Other solutions measure viewer habits on other platforms such as web browsers mobile apps over the top OTT apps etc.

However these audience measurement systems in many aspects lack the ability to provide convenient virtual tools for analyzing visualizing and navigating the data being collected. Rather the systems often merely provide raw data describing user behavior that is difficult to process for essential information about a show or merely provide standard statistics such as a show s demographic reach gross reach cumulative reach television rating point TVR etc. which often do not provide insights into the actual content of a given show or the reasons viewers are not watching the show.

In addition with the advent of the Internet viewers are increasingly consuming video content online using a variety of different viewing platforms such as smart phones web enabled TVs tablets laptops etc. instead of using traditional broadcasting platforms such watching over the air television broadcasts. Existing audience measurement systems are unable to monitor all of these different platforms for a number of reasons including that they do not have access to those platforms or the back end systems providing content to those platforms they are unable to keep up with the current rate of innovation and the diversification of viewing options they only specialize in or focus on a certain segment e.g. browser based video app based video satellite TV cable TV over the air OTA TV etc. etc.

As a result content producers are unable to effectively monitor the performance of their content across the different viewing platforms that are currently available and in many cases have to guess the reasons why a given show is under or over performing. Furthermore content producers are unable to conveniently visualize essential information about a given show using existing solutions such as how many viewers are abandoning a show at various different points of the show the specific reasons viewers are abandoning a show e.g. is it because of reasons external to the show the episode itself or the entire series certain people on the show etc. how a given show stacks up to other shows at different points of time of the show etc.

As depicted in and further in the computing system may include a visualization module an aggregation module a traffic module and a server depending on the configuration. For instance as shown in a client device may include the visualization module and the analytics server may include the aggregation module the traffic module and the server although other configurations are also possible and contemplated such as where the aggregation module and or the traffic module or various components and or functions thereof are incorporated into the client device the visualization module and or the analytics server .

The visualization module includes computer logic executable to provide for user interaction receive user input present information to the user via a display such as the display and send data to and receive data from the other entities of the system via the network . In some implementations the visualization module may generate and present user interfaces such as the user interactable graphical interface e.g. as shown in and or e.g. as shown in based at least in part on information received from the server via the network as discussed further elsewhere herein.

In some implementations the visualization module includes a web browser and or code operable therein a customized native or client side application e.g. a dedicated mobile app and or code operating therein a combination of the foregoing etc.

The aggregation module includes computer logic executable by the processor s to aggregate measurement data including for example audience and commercial occurrence data from various information sources such as computing devices and or non transitory storage media e.g. databases servers etc. configured to receive and satisfy data requests. The information sources from which the aggregation module aggregates data depicted in as audience measurement systems . . . may be associated with information measurement service providers e.g. Nielsen Kantar Rentrak comScore Ooyala Brightcove etc. channel network content providers e.g. NBC ABC Discovery ESPN etc. online video providers e.g. Hulu YouTube etc. and or other content providers online audio providers e.g. Spotify etc.

The aggregation module is coupled to the data store to store retrieve and or manipulate data stored therein and may be coupled to the traffic module the server the visualization module and or other components of the system to exchange information therewith. For example the aggregation module may store retrieve and or manipulate the measurement data aggregated by it in the data store and or may provide the data aggregated and or processed by it to the traffic module and or the server e.g. preemptively or responsive to a function or procedure call etc. .

The measurement data may be stored in a data store and include viewer related information about shows accessible from any applicable viewing platform. A show means audio or audiovisual content viewable by a user. The show may be pre recorded or live. The show may be professional or amateur in nature. In some implementations the show may be broadcast OTA via satellite cable radio the Internet during a particular time slot may be broadcasted on demand or recorded e.g. on a digital video recorder etc. Example platforms include but are not limited to online video e.g. desktop tablet phone set top boxes smart television etc. OTA cable satellite etc. viewing platforms.

The measurement data may include network impressions and or commercial occurrence data in some implementations. In addition to its plain and ordinary meaning a network impression or impression means any instance of a user consuming a show e.g. viewing listening playing back streaming etc. video data . In some instances the number of impressions may correspond to the number of devices tuned to show. For example a number of impressions may include a number of terminals e.g. television sets being tuned to a particular show at a particular time interval. In another example an impression may be the number of clients streaming an online show e.g. video data audio data etc. playing at a particular time interval of that online show.

The term interval in some contexts herein refers to a discrete time increment over which data e.g. a show performance summary may be collected analyzed displayed etc. In other contexts the term interval also refers to a time period selected by a user in a user interactable graphical interface e.g. etc. . In regard to the latter definition it should be understood that while the time period selected by a user may be the same as an increment over which data is collected analyzed and or displayed it may alternatively be a larger time period consisting of a plurality of such time increments. In some implementations the time period reflected by the user selection may be set by user preference interaction with the interface or as a feature programmed into the visualization module .

The following table A collectively illustrates N rows of an example instance of measurement data for the show NBC Nightly News that has been aggregated by the aggregation module and processed stored formatted and or output by the traffic module . It should be understood that other variations formats data types etc. of data are also possible and contemplated.

The following table B collectively illustrates N rows of another example instance of example measurement data that that has been aggregated by the aggregation module and processed stored formatted and or output by the traffic module although other and or different data may additionally and or alternatively be included in table A and or B. For instance it should be understood that data associated with shows with different dates and times could be used shows that air in different time slots and or in the same timeslots may be included shows streamed via the Internet may be included and or that other variations formats data types etc. of data are also possible. For instance any of the type of data from Table A may be included depending on the data being visualized such as that depicted in .

The traffic module includes computer logic executable by the processor s to process the measurement data and generate store and or provide performance summaries including show traffic statistics. A show performance summary also referred to herein simply as performance summary means data reflecting the performance of a show such as the number of impressions by viewers viewer traffic inbound to the show viewer traffic outbound from the show commercial occurrence data ratings viewer demographic data show details type timing duration genre network subject matter etc. and so forth. While the users of the platform are described as viewers in some contexts it should be understood that the term viewer includes any type of audience member such as a viewer a listener etc. In some implementations a show performance summary may reflect the show specifically and or in some cases the timeslot associated with the show.

By way of example and not limitation the traffic module may program the processor s to perform one or more of the following operations generate and or format a show performance summary generate a comparison of viewer traffic between the selected show or timeslot and competing shows and or timeslots over duration of a selected show or timeslot calculate a percentage of total viewer loss at certain time intervals over duration of a selected show and or timeslot determine a total number of viewers for each time interval over a duration of a selected show and or timeslot determine a viewer gain percentage of each inbound source at each time interval over a duration of a selected show and or timeslot determine a viewer loss percentage of each outbound source at each time interval over a duration of a selected show and or timeslot and for a selected show and or timeslot rank inbound sources based on respective viewer gains and outbound sources based on respective viewer losses.

In some implementations the traffic module when executed may determine analysis information based on a variety of factors in order to ascertain the reasons why a certain data metric such as the current loss rate differs from historical and or average values of that data metric. For example in some instances the traffic module may determine that the loss rate at a particular time interval exceeded two standard deviations. The traffic module may then evaluate which of the factors e.g. as shown in one or both of the tables above differ from their historical and or average values beyond a pre determined dynamic or static threshold. For example the traffic module may determine that at a time interval a large quantity of viewers left the first show and that at that moment the President s State of the Union was being broadcast on a different television network. Upon identifying one or more factors for a given data point the traffic module may include data describing the factor s in the show performance summary and the visualization module e.g. the loss chart module may present a graphical interface element e.g. a visual indicator or overlay associated with the data point that textually and or graphically describes the factor s attributing to the variance in data from a normal or average threshold. It should be understood that this analysis information and process is provided as an example and that other methods and information are possible and contemplated herein.

The traffic module is coupled to the data store to store retrieve and or manipulate data stored therein and may be coupled to the aggregation module the server the visualization module and or other components of the system to exchange information therewith. For example the traffic module may store retrieve and or manipulate the aggregated measurement data the performance summaries and or any other suitable data in the data store and or may provide the any of the foregoing data to the server e.g. preemptively responsive to a procedure call etc. and or any other component of the system .

The server includes computer logic executable by the processor s to receive process and or respond to content requests. The server may include an HTTP S server a REST representational state transfer service or other suitable server type. The server may receive content requests e.g. product search requests HTTP S requests from client devices cooperate with the traffic module and or the aggregation module to determine the content retrieve and incorporate data from the data store format the content and provide the content to the client devices . A non limiting example of the content provided by the server includes performance summaries as discussed elsewhere herein.

In some instances the server may format the content e.g. a performance summary using a certain format and provide the content to a corresponding visualization module for processing and or rendering to the user for display. For instance the content may include structured data and the server may format it using XML JSON etc. although other suitable data formats are also contemplated. The visualization module may generate graphical data based on the structured data as discussed elsewhere herein.

In further examples the content generated by the server may include other markup e.g. HTML etc. style sheets e.g. CSS XSL etc. graphics and or scripts e.g. JavaScript ActionScript etc. and the client device may interpret the content and render an interactive Web User Interface WUI e.g. in some instances the dynamic user interactable graphical interface for display on the display although it should be understood that other suitable formats and or configurations are also possible and contemplated. Using the user interfaces presented by the client device a user can input commands selecting various user actions. For example using these interfaces users can manipulate interactive graphical elements such as the elements of the dynamic user interactable graphical interfaces discussed elsewhere herein drill down on various aspects of the displayed visuals and data access further content e.g. corresponding webpages and or other content such as local and online files etc. .

The server may be coupled to the data store to store retrieve and or manipulate data stored therein and may be coupled to the traffic module and or the aggregation module to facilitate its operations.

The interface includes a number of static and dynamic elements configured to efficiently present compare and allow interaction with information from a show performance summary. As shown the interface may include a first show identifier a traffic chart a traffic loss chart a graphical traffic meter a source comparison chart a applicable time region a slider including a handle a time range region and a time selector as well as various other data display filtering and interaction tools. The different states of the interface depicted in are respectively labeled . . .

In the interface the traffic chart the traffic loss chart the graphical traffic meter the source comparison chart and or other content regions are dynamically interconnected by the visualization module and configured by it to be synchronously updated based on user interaction with the interface and or data being received. For instance input received from an input device causes the visualization module to synchronously update all applicable elements of the interface to reflect the statistics that correspond to that input.

In some implementations a user can interact with the interface using a draggable user interface element that is used to select a discrete time interval within the interface such as the slider . In an example by dragging the slider through a range of times a user may select a discrete time interval which in turn causes the visualization module to synchronously update applicable graphical and or textual data displayed by the different content regions of the interface such as and or . For example the show performance summary may include various data such as the reach outflow average audience etc. statistics e.g. see Tables A and B as described elsewhere herein.

In the depicted implementation the slider includes a virtual handle that may be used by the user to select and drag the slider . For example the virtual handle may be draggable within the dynamic user interactable graphical interface by the user to isolate the viewer traffic associated with a certain discrete time interval from among the discrete time intervals of the viewer traffic. More particularly a user may using an input device select the discrete time interval by dragging the handle to a certain position within the traffic loss chart making a selection e.g. clicking tapping etc. at a certain location within the traffic chart or the traffic loss chart by interacting with the applicable time display or performing other suitable actions.

Other time selections mechanisms are also possible and contemplated. For instance the selected time interval may be indicated textually and or graphically may be selected using a drop down menu a dynamic slider that automatically follows the user s pointer device point sensitive content regions e.g. and and can be clicked or tapped using the input device to automatically set the discrete time interval by selecting a time depicted in the time range region a voice command indicates the interval a hand gesture captured by a camera of the user s computer and processed by the visualization module etc. In further implementations instead of selecting a specific point in time the slider and or handle could be configured to select a time segment time subrange e.g. over which values may be summed or averaged .

In the depicted implementation the time range region reflects the time range of the performance data being displayed in the interface and the current time selector is a user interface element selectable by the user to scroll through select the data to display in the content regions and or .

The user may interact with the time range region using the input device to select e.g. by dragging the times scrolling pinching entering a value or range of values entering a time range or interval resolution etc. the time range to display on the interface e.g. limit the displayed data to . In some implementations the interface may additionally or alternatively include the current time selector which when selected by a user updates the range of times depicted in as well as the corresponding data in the other elements and or of the interface . The current time selector allows the user to scroll back in time to view earlier performance data as well as scroll to the current time to expose a live e.g. realtime near realtime view.

For instance in these or other implementations the visualization module may automatically scroll or refresh the content region based on real time performance data being automatically received for the shows e.g. streamed to by the visualization module to automatically reflect the most current statistics. Additionally although illustrate synchronous updating of various elements of the interface based on the selection of a time interval synchronous updating may also be performed based on the various other filter and input selections as described elsewhere herein.

The traffic chart displays a total number of impressions over a range of discrete time intervals. As shown in the traffic chart includes a traffic chart legend and a chart region . The traffic chart legend includes indicators for a first show one or more competing shows . . . and commercials although other configurations are possible. The chart region includes visual representations of traffic rates . . . . The traffic rates . . . correspond to the first show and competing show s . . . and may be visually differentiated using different visually distinguishable graphing elements e.g. line types colors etc. .

The commercial indicator indicates the occurrence of commercials over the depicted time frame. The commercial indicator is linked to the commercial overlays in the chart region . The commercial overlays correspond to commercial occurrence data and are overlaid with visual representations of traffic rates . . . . The commercial overlays may be interactable and upon being interacted with e.g. selected the traffic chart module may display a region including content describing that particular commercial occurrence e.g. identity duration sponsor an audio or audiovisual preview of the commercial via an embedded player e.g. see etc. associated with the commercial . The user may also toggle the commercial overlays on and off by selecting the commercial indicator .

The traffic rates . . . reflect the total number of impressions for the corresponding shows. As shown in the figures each traffic rate may be displayed in a graphical format e.g. in a bar pie line bubble or other chart where traffic rates for a first show and competing shows are visually compared. The visual depiction of the various traffic rates may be linked to the indication of that particular show e.g. or . . . in the traffic chart legend . For example the traffic rate may be linked to show indicator which may be selected by the user to change which show is displayed highlight show specific data and or dynamically update various corresponding elements and to reflect data pertaining to that specific show. For example hovering over the show indicator may instantly highlight the traffic rate and or update one or more other elements of the interface to reflect data for that specific show e.g. toggling the show corresponding to the show indicator to be the first show as discussed elsewhere herein according to some implementations .

In some implementations the traffic chart module generates updates the traffic chart in response to a signal from the interface module which indicates the range of times e.g. as selected in the time range region and the selected time interval e.g. corresponding to the position of the slider along the time range region . The traffic chart module accesses the performance summary data for each of the first show and the one or more selected shows and generates the visual representations of the traffic rates . . . and an impressions metric using the performance summary as indexed by time intervals. For example the data in Table A illustrates a specific program NBC Nightly News and statistics about the specific program including the average audience indexed over a range of time intervals which is input into the traffic chart module to generate the elements of the traffic chart .

Similarly depending on the configuration the traffic chart module or the interface module may access the commercial occurrence data indexed by time interval in the show performance summary e.g. as indicated in the columns labeled commercial time promo time non program time etc. in Table A . For example the traffic chart module may process the commercial occurrence data from the show performance summary and generate graphical overlays and overlay them in the traffic chart with the time segment s during which commercials occurred.

In some implementations the visualization module may be configured to display supplemental information for a show automatically or responsive to a user selection such as a discrete time interval selection or a selection of a show. More particularly the visualization module components thereof may be configured to display relevant supplemental data for any of the data depicted in regions etc. For example upon hovering over certain data e.g. outliers dips percentages inbound or outbound network meter etc. the visualization module components thereof may display additional details relevant to that data.

By way of further example as a discrete time interval is selected using the slider the traffic chart module may dynamically update an impressions metric to reflect the total number of impressions at that time interval. This is advantageous as it allows a user to easily determine the traffic rate at the time interval for the first show. In another further example responsive to user interaction using an input device e.g. a hovering over or selecting a given traffic rate . . . the traffic chart module causes the interface to dynamically display details about the show corresponding to that selection e.g. the episode time and date of first airing actors in show demographics associated with show show rating information a media clip of the show at a selected time interval etc. in a corresponding graphical region e.g. an overlay popup window content region etc. and so forth.

The traffic loss chart displays information pertaining to the traffic loss over the time range which like the traffic chart is comprised of a multiplicity of discrete time intervals. As shown more particularly in the traffic loss chart displays the percentage of viewer traffic associated with the first show that is being lost at any given point in within the selected time range. The loss rate is shown as having a possible range from 0 to some percentage above 0 although it should be understood that other variations are also possible such as where the polarity of the data is switched.

The traffic loss chart may also include a visual representation of the average loss and one or more standard deviations and from the average. The average loss may be defined as any relevant value such as an average e.g. mean median mode etc. loss for a first show or for a first network over a specific time period e.g. weeks months years etc. . Alternatively the average loss may be defined as an average over competing shows or networks. In some implementations the definition of the average may be user definable by the user selecting the graphical element in the traffic loss chart legend corresponding to the average loss .

In some implementations the loss chart module generates updates the traffic chart in response to receiving a signal from the interface module which indicates the range of times e.g. as selected in the time range region and the selected time interval e.g. corresponding to the position of the slider along the time range region . The loss chart module accesses the performance summary data and generates the graphical representation of the loss rate average loss standard deviations emphasized markers impressions lost metric and or the time interval metric using the performance summary as indexed by time intervals. For instance the data in Tables A and or B illustrate statistics about shows including total outflow average outflow and standard deviations of outflows indexed over a range of time intervals for a plurality of shows which data is input into the loss chart module to generate the elements of the traffic chart . For example the loss chart module may retrieve receive the total outflow e.g. the loss rate over a range of times and display it graphically in the traffic loss chart .

Similarly depending on the configuration the loss chart module or the interface module may access the commercial occurrence data indexed by time interval in the show performance summary e.g. as indicated in the columns labeled commercial time promo time non program time etc. in Table A . For example the loss chart module may process the commercial occurrence data from the show performance summary and generate graphical overlay s and overlay them in the traffic loss chart with the time segments that which include the commercial occurrences.

The loss chart module and or the traffic module may determine one or more standard deviations from the average loss and generate and display a visual representation of the standard deviations. For example as displayed in a first and a second standard deviation and from the average are displayed in the traffic loss chart .

In some implementations the loss chart module may determine if and at which time intervals the loss rate exceeds a threshold. In some instances the threshold corresponds to a quantity e.g. percentage greater than two standard deviations from the average . When it is determined that the loss rate exceeds the threshold the loss chart module may present the point at which the loss rate exceeds the threshold in such a way as to draw emphasis to the point. For example that point may be displayed with an emphasized marker e.g. a flashing red circle etc. around a point on a graph of the loss rate . Additionally the emphasized marker may be selectable e.g. clickable tappable etc. causing the loss chart module to display a content region including analysis information to the user. This analysis information may include one or more predictions e.g. ordered from most likely to less likely explaining why the data for that particular data point point in time exceeded the threshold as determined by the traffic module .

In some implementations the traffic loss chart may include a traffic loss chart legend . Although other values may be present in the traffic loss chart legend as depicted in the interface the legend may include representations corresponding to the percent of loss e.g. the loss rate the average loss and one or more standard deviations and . In a similar manner to the traffic chart legend as discussed above the individual sections and or elements within the sections of the traffic loss chart legend may be color and or pattern coded and may be interactable to affect which of the elements of the traffic loss chart are highlighted or displayed. For instance they can be used to filter the values and factors contributing to the traffic loss chart and so forth.

In some implementations the traffic loss chart may additionally or alternatively include other elements such as a total impressions lost metric and a time interval metric . The total impressions lost metric may reflect the percent of total traffic e.g. a percentage or a total value lost over a time period e.g. 15 minutes an hour etc. before surrounding or after a reference time such as a current time or the selected time interval . The time interval metric is a representation of a viewer loss percentage at a selected discrete time interval e.g. position C of slider in .

The graphical traffic meter is configured to visually comparatively display an instantaneous e.g. at a time interval real time etc. inbound viewer rate and an outbound viewer rate corresponding to a selected time interval e.g. position D of slider . As shown in the traffic meter may include an inbound funnel portion and an outbound funnel portion each corresponding in size to the number e.g. as a ratio of inbound and outbound viewers. Additionally in some implementations the traffic meter may include a comparative portion e.g. donut chart element which visually graphically displays the ratio of inbound viewers to outbound viewers using visually distinguishable segments e.g. colored segments textured segments etc. . In some instances two visually distinguishable segments are present in the comparative portion as shown such that each segment corresponds to and is connected with the inbound funnel portion and outbound funnel portion respectively.

In some implementations the meter module generates the graphical traffic meter in response to a signal from the interface module which indicates a selected time interval e.g. corresponding to the position of the slider along the time range region . The meter module determines the configuration e.g. size color orientation of the inbound funnel portion the outbound funnel portion and the comparative portion using the performance summary at a selected time interval. For example the meter module may retrieve receive the total inbound traffic and the total inbound traffic e.g. as a ratio illustrated by the average audience change or the reach change in Table A or as values represented by the various switch in and out flow values for each source as illustrated in Table A for a selected time interval which it uses to calculate and generate the configuration of the traffic meter and its component elements.

The source comparison chart visually comparatively displays inbound sources and outbound sources for a selected time interval. The source comparison chart may include an inbound source list and an outbound source list . Each of the lists and may include a percentage representing the percentage of the total inbound or outbound traffic represented by each source. In some implementations as in the depicted implementation the inbound source list is connected to the inbound funnel portion and the outbound source list is connected to the outbound funnel portion . This configuration of the graphical traffic meter and source comparison chart where each of and as well as and are visually linked is particularly beneficial because it allows a user to quickly ascertain whether the total number of impressions is increasing or decreasing at any given moment as well as the ratios of sources responsible for that change.

As with the traffic meter in some implementations the meter module generates the source comparison chart in response to a signal from the interface module which indicates a selected time interval. The meter module determines the inbound source list by retrieving receiving the switch in rates and networks e.g. shows for each of the sources from the show performance summary e.g. as illustrated in the switch in 1 2 3 etc. sets of columns in Table A for the selected time interval. Similarly the meter module determines the outbound source list by retrieving receiving the switch out rates and networks e.g. as illustrated in the switch out 1 2 3 etc. sets of columns in Table A .

The organization of the components and of the visualization module as described is particularly beneficial as it allows the visualization module to rapidly e.g. nearly instantaneously process a large quantity of information such as is provided in the tables above while providing the information in a format which is easily digestible for a human using a user device as particularly illustrated in .

The progression of the dynamic synchronous changes to the interface shown in based on the respective positions A F of the slider are now described. More particularly the interfaces in display performance data for a first show e.g. the Today Show and one or more competing shows over the certain timeframe e.g. 7 9 AM across certain discrete time intervals selected by the user. For instance displays the slider at position A in interface corresponding to a selected interval at 7 00 AM which is when the first show began. At position A traffic rate for the first show increased more than competing shows as shown in traffic chart and as such traffic loss is decreasing as shown in loss chart . Further as shown in the inbound source list at position A 95.7 of the inbound traffic was from viewers that just turned on their TVs with the remainder of viewers coming from competing content providers.

The interface may additionally or alternatively include various other tools for filtering interaction and display of the show performance summary. For example as shown in the interface may include interface tools e.g. to change settings make calculations and request help etc. and filtering tools . The filtering tools may perform the same or additional functions as those described above in reference to interactions with other elements of the interface . For example the filtering tools may include a calendar which allows a user to select a date or date range over which to view show performance summary data. In another example the filtering tools may include a time which allows a user to select a range of times a start time an end time a time of day e.g. primetime etc.

The filtering tools may include a show or network filter such as the show menu discussed above. Selection of this filter may allow a user to specify a first show or network and or one or more competing shows or networks. In some instances the show or network filter includes a display reflecting the selected first show or network that is the show or network to which other shows or networks are compared and for which the show performance summary is generated.

The filtering tools may include a demographics filter which allows a user to select one or more specific demographics for which data is displayed. For example demographics that may be used for filtering may include age gender geographic location household income viewing patterns habits or history etc. depending on availability of demographic data linked to the data inputs in the performance summary.

The shows depicted in the interface may be selected using a show menu e.g. not shown and an input device . The step of selecting the shows may occur in an interface depicted prior to the presentation of the interface or may occur concurrently with or after the display of that interface. For example the user may select using the input device an element in the header region of the interface such as the show identifier element or the traffic chart legend or elements thereof and responsive thereto show a graphical selection menu that includes a plurality of shows may be displayed. In some instances the shows included in that region may be shows associated with certain content providers shows the user has set as preferences or is authorized to select from the popular shows of the day based on traffic etc. The user may input using the input device which show is the target show the first show e.g. and the comparison shows e.g. . . . . Upon making the selection the visualization module may request the relevant performance data and generate refresh the interface with the corresponding data.

In further implementations the user may change using the input device which show is the target show by highlighting the show of interest e.g. by selecting it in the traffic chart legend or the chart region . For instance the user may select using the input device the first show indicator or one of the competing show indicators . . . to change that show to the first show or target show and the visualization module may synchronously update each of the elements and to reflect the selected show s performance and in some instances a comparison of the performance of the show to that of the other shows.

Although the describe the comparison of a first show and one or more contemporaneous competing shows it should be understood that the techniques of the present disclosure are also applicable to non contemporaneous shows. In some implementations the traffic module may process a show performance summary for a first show and one or more non contemporaneous shows by matching features such as the time line of the shows commercial occurrences etc. For example the traffic module may match the beginning and ending times of shows such that the visualization module displays the shows as though they were contemporaneous although perhaps some data may be mismatched or artificially adjusted such as the visual overlays corresponding to commercial occurrence data for each show .

Examples of non contemporaneous shows which may be compared using the techniques described herein include similar types of shows occurring at different times OTA on demand online streaming and or recorded shows the same show or series e.g. as in a television series on previous occasions a different show or series on the same network e.g. at a different time day or season and so forth.

The interface includes a number of static and dynamic elements configured to efficiently present compare and allow for user interaction. As shown the interface may include a first show identifier a traffic chart a traffic loss chart a slider a time range region a media preview region also called show preview region as well as and various other data display filtering and interaction tools. The generation and updating of the interface occurs using the same or similar techniques as described in reference to the interface . Similarly a user can interact with the interface using a draggable user interface element that is used to select a discrete time interval within the interface such as the slider to select a time interval.

The traffic chart includes a visual representation of the traffic rate an impressions metric one or more commercial overlays and a show selector . The elements and are generated and reflect the same or similar type of data as within the elements and respectively. Similarly the show selector displays one or more currently selected shows e.g. indications of a first show and or one or more competing shows and allows a user to select the shows in order to display traffic data in the traffic chart for the selected shows. For example the interface module receives user input indicating a selected time interval and or a show selected in the show selector . The interface module signals the traffic chart module to generate the traffic chart which it does in the same or similar way as is described in detail in reference to .

As with the traffic loss chart the traffic loss chart displays information pertaining to the traffic loss over the time range which is comprised of a multiplicity of discrete time intervals. The traffic loss chart may include visual representations of an average loss rate a loss rate deviation an emphasized marker a time interval metric one or more commercial overlays a first source loss rate a total loss rate and or and an outbound source selector . The elements and correspond to the elements and described above.

The first source loss rate includes a graphical representation of the total e.g. as a percentage traffic loss due to a first source which representation may be toggled on or off using the outbound source selector . Similarly the total loss rate includes a graphical representation corresponding to the total traffic lost at each time interval similar to the loss rate . However in some implementations the total loss rate may represent only the traffic loss due to the sources selected in the outbound source selector . The outbound source selector allows a user to toggle which sources are represented in graphical representations in the traffic loss chart . For example the interface module receives user input indicating a selected time interval and or sources selected in the outbound source selector . The interface module signals the loss chart module to generate the traffic loss chart which it does in the same or similar way as is described in detail in reference to .

As with the time range region the time range region reflects the time range of the performance data being displayed in the interface however the time range region may also include a loss rate mirror . As shown the loss rate mirror is overlaid over the time range region to display an easily viewable representation of a loss rate e.g. the loss rate .

The media preview region provides a preview of a media object of the show. The media object is a digital object such as a graphics video and or audio file of the show and is streamable or downloadable from the media server . The preview of the show media object may be a digital preview associated with the selected time interval such as but not limited to a media clip associated with the selected time interval e.g. a clip of limited duration showing the before during and after the media e.g. video frame corresponding to the selected time interval an animated image e.g. a GIF showing the same the media object data with a position set to the selected time interval etc. e.g. using a seek int time function of an API of the media module .

In some implementations the media module includes media player embedded in the media preview region . For example the media preview region may include an embedded video player in an iframe object or other container backing the interface . The media player interacts with an information source e.g. local cache the media server etc. to retrieve the media object to be displayed and or interacted with. In some implementations metadata of a video clip of the show may be included in the data store indexed by the time interval and used to display a video clip or frames of the video clip corresponding to the selected time interval. It should be understood that other implementations are possible and contemplated by the techniques described herein.

In some implementations the media object is encoded using various formats and or audio and video codecs. In some instances the media object may be encapsulated into a container. The image formats audio and video codecs container formats etc. may be open or proprietary and may include any type. Example image formats may include but are not limited to GIF JPEG EXR PNG TIFF etc. example audio and video codecs and formats may include but are not limited to ACC MP3 Vorbis etc. and example video codecs and formats may include but are not limited to MPEG 4 H.264 Theora VP8 etc. The container file may package the media object and or a data stream associated therewith in any known format including but not limited to FLV WebM ASF ISMA etc. It should be understood that in some instances the images of the media object or the media object itself be transcoded and or converted to another image based format.

In some instances the media module receives a media object e.g. audio video stream static image audio from the media server responsive to sending a media request to the media server . In some instances the media request is triggered upon page load and the media object or a portion thereof is downloaded and cached buffered in the memory for instant retrieval so that any lag is imperceptible to the user . In other instances the media request is a preview request triggered upon the user interaction with the data displayed in the dynamic user interactable graphical interface e.g. hovering over a data point using an input device selecting a certain data point time increment using an input device etc. . The preview request includes a corresponding time increment matching the user selected time interval and responsive to receiving and processing the request the media server retrieves and provides the media object e.g. frame s image media stream positioned to the selected point in time etc. to the media module which may buffer and or display it in the media preview region .

In implementations where the media object is a video the media preview region displays the media object corresponding to a selected time interval. The media preview region may in some cases include media player controls such as a stop play pause rewind and fast forward button to control playback of the media object. For example in some implementations the user may select to play a video clip of a show which is displayed in the media preview region .

In some implementations as the media object is played the media module continuously updates the position of the media preview region to correspond to the relevant time increment. For instance in the media preview region may incrementally be repositioned horizontally across the time range region in the interface such that the media preview region remains adjacent to the corresponding time and show performance summary data e.g. the traffic rate the loss rate deviation etc. .

In other example implementations the media module may automatically reposition the media preview region based on input received from the input device . For example the input may reflect that the user is dragging the media preview region across the interface e.g. by selecting and dragging the region or the slider and the media module may refresh the media preview region with the media object portion thereof that corresponds to the position of the media preview region within the interface. In further examples the media module may reposition the media preview region to follow a pointer controlled by the user and may refresh the content being displayed by the media preview region accordingly. Other variations are also possible and contemplated.

The traffic chart module may process the show performance summary which may include information such as viewer traffic comparison data and commercial occurrence data that is received from server or local storage and generate and or update a traffic chart based on the processed data and or the user interaction s e.g. time selected using handle .

The meter module may process ranked inbound and outbound sources from the performance summary to determine top inbound and outbound sources for a certain interval of a selected show or timeslot and generate and or update a source comparison chart comparing total viewer gain vs. loss rates and listing top inbound and outbound sources based on the processed data and or the user interaction s e.g. time selected using handle as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein.

The loss chart module may process viewer loss data from the performance summary received from the server and or local data storage and generate and or update an interactive traffic loss chart indicating viewer loss percentages over the duration of show or timeslot based on the processed data and or the user interaction s e.g. time selected using slider as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein.

The media module programs the processor s to retrieve process and display media objects based on user interaction with the dynamic user interactable graphical interface as discussed elsewhere herein. The media module is capable of detecting input events e.g. page loading user input e.g. user selection of time interval default time interval selection realtime position of media etc. and generating and positioning the show preview region updating the position of the show preview region and or updating the media object being displayed thereby etc.

The visualization module may overlay e.g. in cooperation with the foregoing modules commercial data segments indicating locations of commercial breaks during showing airing playback etc. on any of the graphical images generated by the traffic chart module and or the loss chart module as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein.

The visualization module may communicate via the network with the server to provide request and or receive information such as the performance summaries discussed elsewhere herein. The visualization module may use any suitable networking or other communication protocol to interact with the other components of the system such as those discussed elsewhere herein.

The network may include any number of networks and or network types. For example the network may include but is not limited to one or more local area networks LANs wide area networks WANs e.g. the Internet virtual private networks VPNs wireless wide area network WWANs WiMAX networks personal area networks PANs e.g. Bluetooth communication networks various combinations thereof etc. These private and or public networks may have any number of configurations and or topologies and data may be transmitted via the networks using a variety of different communication protocols including for example various Internet layer transport layer or application layer protocols. For example data may be transmitted via the networks using TCP IP UDP TCP HTTP HTTPS DASH RTSP RTP RTCP VOIP FTP WS WAP SMS MMS XMS IMAP SMTP POP WebDAV or other known protocols.

The analytics server and the audience measurement systems include computer hardware and software having data processing storing and communication capabilities as discussed elsewhere herein. For example the components and or may include one or more hardware servers server arrays storage devices and or systems etc. In some implementations the components and or may include one or more virtual servers which operate in a host server environment. As depicted the analytics server may include an aggregation module a traffic module and a server as discussed elsewhere herein.

In some implementations the media server transmits media streams e.g. audio and or video to one or more client devices and or the analytics server . The media streams may be live feeds or may be previously recorded stored as media objects in a data store and transmitted to the one or more client devices or the analytics server on demand via delayed broadcast etc. In some implementations the media is streamed from the media server via the network e.g. as illustrated by signal line .

In some implementations the media server may be configured to provide a series of images frames thumbnails etc. corresponding to the selected time interval as described in more detail in reference to . In some instances the media object is indexed by time frame or another suitable measure so it or the corresponding portion thereof can be immediately be retrieved upon request by the media server and or media module .

It should be understood that the system illustrated in is representative of an example system and that a variety of different system environments and configurations are contemplated and are within the scope of the present disclosure. For instance various acts and or functionality may be moved from a server to a client or vice versa data may be consolidated into a single data store or further segmented into additional data stores and some implementations may include additional or fewer computing devices services and or networks and may implement various functionality client or server side. Further various entities of the system may be integrated into a single computing device or system or divided into additional computing devices or systems etc.

In some implementations the user interactable graphical interface is generated responsive to receiving a user input. For instance the interface module receives the input from a user device requesting the interface or an update thereof in response to which the interface module signals the data handler to request a show performance summary from the analytics server . The server may communicate the request to the traffic module which generates the show performance summary based on information gathered by the aggregation module e.g. in advance in response to information contained in the request from the data handler etc. from at least one source such as the audience measurement system . In some instances the traffic module via the server transmits the show performance summary to the data handler . The data handler may store the show performance summary in non transitory memory and or provide it to other component s of the visualization module . The various components of visualization module may receive retrieve the show performance summary and process it to generate and or dynamically update various content included in dynamic user interactable graphical interface as discussed in further detail elsewhere herein. In further implementations the data handler may retrieve the show performance data from a local cache.

At the interface module receives user input from a user input device selecting a time interval of a first show and one or more competing shows and at the visualization module updates the dynamic user interactable graphical interface with a comparison of viewer traffic between the first show and one or more competing shows for the selected time interval. For instance in some implementations in response to receiving the input the interface module signals the traffic chart module to receive retrieve a show performance summary. The show performance summary may include information indexed by time interval such the network time program and average audience data provided in the corresponding columns of Table A above. For example the traffic chart module processes the traffic reach average audience as indexed by time interval of each of the first show and the one or more competing shows to produce a traffic chart such as the traffic chart or discussed elsewhere herein.

In some implementations the components of the visualization module synchronously update a plurality of elements of the interface using the performance summary such that a user may be able to drag a slider e.g. using the handle over a range of times thereby selecting various time intervals and causing the interface module to synchronously update one or more elements of the interface for those time intervals e.g. the interfaces and or .

At the meter module generates a traffic meter that visually comparatively displays one or more inbound viewer rates and one or more outbound viewer rates corresponding to a time interval selected by a user using a virtual handle e.g. the handle and at the meter module may generate a source comparison chart in association with the graphical traffic meter visually comparatively displaying the ranked list of inbound sources and ranked list of outbound sources for the selected time interval. In some instances the meter module processes the performance summary to determine inbound and outbound sources rank the inbound and outbound sources and or determine what percentage of the total inbound or outbound traffic corresponds to each source. In other instances the traffic module performs these operations while the meter module receives retrieves e.g. via the data handler the lists of sources and determines the appropriate size shape content and placement of the inbound sources list the outbound sources list and the traffic meter . For example the source comparison chart may include an inbound sources list and an outbound sources list placed at opposing sides of the traffic meter such that it appears as though those sources are feeding or being fed by the meter such as is displayed in .

At the traffic chart module generates a traffic chart visually comparatively displaying a traffic rate of at least one of a first show and one or more competing shows using the average total number of viewers for each show. As described elsewhere herein the traffic chart module processes the show performance summary e.g. as provided by the analytics server to generate and or update the traffic chart .

At the loss chart module generates a traffic loss chart using total viewer loss percentages of a first show. In some implementations the loss chart module may process the show performance summary and or access additional information stored on the data store to determine and generate the elements of the traffic loss chart as described in reference to . For example the loss chart module in conjunction with the traffic module may determine a loss rate an average loss and one or more standard deviations and at a plurality of time intervals which the loss chart module uses to generate a traffic loss chart .

At the visualization module generates visual overlays corresponding to commercials and including visual indicators comparing viewer traffic between shows at discreet time intervals. For example the visualization module may overlay visual overlays corresponding to commercial occurrence data over one or more of the traffic chart and the traffic loss chart as depicted in .

In some implementations the method may be performed at page load as real time show performance summary data is received from the server and or as user interactions with the dynamic user interactable graphical interface are received and processed. For example a selection received from a user e.g. via an input device is detected by the interface module which in turn notifies the various components of the visualization module e.g. traffic chart module the meter module the loss chart module regarding the selection. The traffic chart module the meter module the interface module and or the loss chart module then process relevant data corresponding to the selection and update corresponding content regions e.g. the traffic chart the traffic loss chart and the graphical traffic meter the ranked list of inbound sources the ranked list of outbound sources etc. as shown in the traffic chart the traffic loss chart the media preview region etc. as shown in etc. with data specifically associated with the input selection.

At the traffic module may determine one or more inbound viewer rates and one or more outbound viewer rates for each discrete time interval of at least first show and one or more competing shows using raw viewer traffic statistics such as the input or output of the aggregation module . At the traffic module may determine viewer loss percentage for each discrete time interval using raw viewer traffic statistics. At the traffic module may determine a ranked list of inbound sources for each different time interval of at least a first show from measurement data including a number or percentage of inbound viewers associated with each inbound source at time interval to which the ranked list corresponds. At the traffic module may determine a ranked list of outbound sources for each different time interval of at least the first show from measurement data based on a number or percentage of outbound viewers associated with each outbound source at time interval to which the list corresponds. At the traffic module may generate a show performance summary based on one or more of an inbound viewer rate an outbound viewer rate a viewer loss percentage a ranked list of inbound sources and or a ranked list of outbound sources.

In response to one or more of the determinations performed in steps the interface module updates one or more of the elements of the interface or . In some implementations as indicated in the updating steps occur synchronously thereby providing a fluid user experience where the user can easily analyze the performance of a first show and one or more competing shows at various time intervals and or using various filters. For example the traffic chart module may update a traffic chart with information corresponding to the user input at . At the loss chart module may update a traffic loss chart with information corresponding the user input. At the meter module updates a graphical traffic meter to comparatively display an inbound viewer rate and outbound viewer rate corresponding to the user input. At the meter module updates a source comparison chart viewer loss percentage inbound ranked list and or outbound ranked list based on the user input. At the media module may update the media preview region to include a media object corresponding to the selected time interval. For example the components of the visualization module may access the applicable data e.g. as indexed by time interval in the data store which the components use to calculate and generate each element of at least the traffic chart the traffic loss chart the graphical traffic meter and the source comparison chart as described in more detail elsewhere herein.

In the above description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However it should be understood that the technology described herein can be practiced without these specific details. Further various systems devices and structures are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the description. For instance various implementations are described as having particular hardware software and user interfaces. However the present disclosure applies to any type of computing device that can receive data and commands and to any peripheral devices providing services.

In some instances various implementations may be presented herein in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent set of operations leading to a desired result. The operations are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be borne in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion it is appreciated that throughout this disclosure discussions utilizing terms such as processing computing calculating determining displaying or the like refer to the action and methods of a computer system that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.

A data processing system suitable for storing and or executing program code e.g. computer logic such as software logic hardware logic etc. such as the computing system and or devices discussed herein may include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory ies elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code bulk storage and cache memories that provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution. Input or I O devices can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I O controllers. The data processing system may include an apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer.

The foregoing description has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the specification to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. It is intended that the scope of the disclosure be limited not by this detailed description but rather by the claims of this application. As will be understood by those familiar with the art the specification may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. Likewise the particular naming and division of the modules routines features attributes methodologies and other aspects may not be mandatory or significant and the mechanisms that implement the specification or its features may have different names divisions and or formats.

Furthermore the modules routines features attributes methodologies and other aspects of the disclosure can be implemented as software hardware firmware or any combination of the foregoing. The technology can also take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer usable or computer readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. Wherever a component an example of which is a module or engine of the specification is implemented as software the component can be implemented as a standalone program as part of a larger program as a plurality of separate programs as a statically or dynamically linked library as a kernel loadable module as firmware as resident software as microcode as a device driver and or in every and any other way known now or in the future. Additionally the disclosure is in no way limited to implementation in any specific programming language or for any specific operating system or environment. Accordingly the disclosure is intended to be illustrative but not limiting of the scope of the subject matter set forth in the following claims.
