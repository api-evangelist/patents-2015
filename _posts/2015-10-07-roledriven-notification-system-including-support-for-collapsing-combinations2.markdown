The present disclosure relates to computer systems and software and more particularly to techniques for facilitating and automating the provision of services in a cloud environment.

Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources e.g. networks servers storage applications and services . The services provided or accessed through the cloud or network are referred to as cloud services. There is a lot of processing that needs to be performed by a cloud service provider to make cloud services available to a subscribing customer. Due to its complexity much of this processing is still done manually. For example provisioning resources for providing such cloud services can be a very labor intensive process.

This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used in isolation to determine the scope of the claimed subject matter. The subject matter should be understood by reference to appropriate portions of the entire specification of this patent any or all drawings and each claim.

One embodiment of the invention relates to a method of implementing role driven notification. The method includes storing by a cloud infrastructure system including computing devices notification templates. Each of the notification templates is associated with a role. The method further includes determining that a user is associated with a first role and a second role determining that the first role is associated with a first notification template and the second role is associated with a second notification template. Further the method includes combining the first template and the second template to generate a third template based on the third template generating a notification. The method then sends the notification to the user.

The method further includes combining of the first notification template and the second notification template by removing any of the notification information from the first notification template of the second notification template that is redundant. Further the third notification template comprises the least amount of notification information necessary from the first and second notification templates and roles are arranged in a roles hierarchy.

The notification templates are arranged in a template hierarchy which maps to the roles hierarchy and the method includes determining a location of the user in the role hierarchy and the notification hierarchy based on the location collapsing each child notification templates below the location in the hierarchy into a single collapsed template and based on the single collapsed template generating a collapsed notification wherein the collapsed notification includes the fewest number of notifications location within the role hierarchy.

The roles in the hierarchy of roles overlap restrictions are associated with one or more of the roles which restricts one or more of the notification information from being included in the notification the templates are pre registered and the combining occurs before runtime and the notification information for each of the notification templates are stored in XML and the association of a role with a notification template is stored in metadata.

In a further embodiment a cloud infrastructure system for implementing role driven notification is described. The system includes a processor and a storage device including sets of instructions stored thereon. When executed by the processor the instructions cause the processor to store notification templates. Each of the notification templates is associated with a role. The instructions further cause the processor to determine that a user is associated with a first role and a second role determine that the first role is associated with a first notification template and the second role is associated with a second notification template combine the first template and the second template to generate a third template and based on the third template generate a notification. The notification includes notification information from the first template and the second template. Then the processor sends the notification to the user.

In various embodiments cloud infrastructure system may be adapted to automatically provision manage and track a customer s subscription to services offered by cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment as depicted in the components in cloud infrastructure system include an Identity Management IDM module a services module a Tenant Automation System TAS module a Service Deployment Infrastructure SDI module an Enterprise Manager EM module one or more front end web interfaces such as a store user interface UI a cloud user interface UI and a support user interface UI an order management module sales personnel operator personnel and an order database . These modules may include or be provided using one or more computers and or servers which may be general purpose computers specialized server computers server farms server clusters or any other appropriate arrangement and or combination. In one embodiment one or more of these modules can be provided by cloud management functionality or IaaS platform in cloud infrastructure system . The various modules of the cloud infrastructure system depicted in are meant for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of embodiments of the present invention. Alternative embodiments may include more or fewer modules than those shown in .

In an exemplary operation at 1 a customer using a client device such as client device or may interact with cloud infrastructure system by browsing the various services provided by cloud infrastructure system and placing an order for a subscription for one or more services offered by cloud infrastructure system . In certain embodiments the customer may access store UI or cloud UI and place a subscription order via these user interfaces.

The order information received by cloud infrastructure system in response to the customer placing an order may include information identifying the customer and one or more services offered by the cloud infrastructure system that the customer intends to subscribe to. A single order may include orders for multiple services. For instance a customer may login to cloud UI and request a subscription for a CRM service and a Java cloud service in the same order.

Additionally the order may also include one or more service levels for the ordered services. As used herein and as will be discussed in greater detail below a service level for a service determines the amount of resources to be allocated for providing the requested service in the context of the subscription such as the amount of storage amount of computing resources data transfer facilities and the like. For example a basic service level may provide a minimum level of storage data transmission or number of users and higher service levels may include additional resources.

In addition in some instances the order information received by cloud infrastructure system may include information indicative of a customer level and the time period during which the service is desired. The customer level specifies the priority of the customer making the subscription request. In one example the priority may be determined based on the quality of service that the cloud infrastructure system guarantees or promises the customer as specified by a Service Level Agreement SLA agreed to between the customer and the provider of the cloud services. In one example the different customer levels include a basic level a silver level and a gold level. The time period for a service may specify the start date and time for the service and the time period for which the service is desired e.g. a service end date and time may be specified .

In one embodiment a customer may request a new subscription via store UI or request for a trial subscription via cloud UI . In certain embodiments store UI may represent the service provider s eCommerce store front e.g. www.oracle.com store for Oracle Cloud services . Cloud UI may represent a business interface for the service provider. Consumer can explore available services and sign up for interested services through cloud UI . Cloud UI captures user input necessary for ordering trial subscriptions provided by cloud infrastructure system . Cloud UI may also be used to view account features and configure the runtime environment located within cloud infrastructure system . In addition to placing an order for a new subscription store UI may also enable the customer to perform other subscription related tasks such as changing the service level of a subscription extending the term of the subscription increasing the service level of a subscription terminating an existing subscription and the like.

After an order has been placed per 1 at 2 the order information that is received via either store UI or cloud UI is stored in order database which can be one of several databases operated by cloud infrastructure system and utilized in conjunction with other system elements. While order database is shown logically as a single database in in actual implementation this may comprise one or more databases.

At 3 the order is forwarded to order management module . Order management module is configured to perform billing and accounting functions related to the order such as verifying the order and upon verification booking the order. In certain embodiments order management module may include a contract management module and an install base module. The contract management module may store contract information associated with the customer s subscription order such as the customer s service level agreement SLA with cloud infrastructure system . The install base module may include detailed descriptions of the services in the customer s subscription order. In addition to order information the install base module may track installation details related to the services product status and support service history related to the services. As a customer orders new services or upgrades existing ones the install base module may automatically add new order information.

At 4 information regarding the order is communicated to TAS module . In one embodiment TAS module utilizes the order information to orchestrate the provisioning of services and resources for the order placed by the customer. At 5 TAS component orchestrates the provisioning of resources to support the subscribed services using the services of SDI module . At 6 TAS module provides information related to the provisioned order received from SDI module to services module . In some embodiments at 7 SDI module may also use services provided by services module to allocate and configure the resources needed to fulfill the customer s subscription order.

At 8 services module sends a notification to the customers on client devices and regarding the status of the order.

In certain embodiments TAS module functions as an orchestration component that manages business processes associated with each order and applies business logic to determine whether an order should proceed to provisioning. In one embodiment upon receiving an order for a new subscription TAS module sends a request to SDI module to allocate resources and configure those resources needed to fulfill the subscription order. SDI module enables the allocation of resources for the services ordered by the customer. SDI module provides a level of abstraction between the cloud services provided by cloud infrastructure system and the physical implementation layer that is used to provision the resources for providing the requested services. TAS module may thus be isolated from implementation details such as whether or not services and resources are actually provisioned on the fly or pre provisioned and only allocated assigned upon request.

In certain embodiments a user may use store UI to directly interact with order management module to perform billing and accounting related functions such as verifying the order and upon verification booking the order. In some embodiments instead of a customer placing an order at 9 the order may instead be placed by sales personnel on behalf of the customer such as a customer s service representative or sales representative. Sales personnel may directly interact with order management module via a user interface not shown in provided by order management module for placing orders or for providing quotes for the customer. This for example may be done for large customers where the order may be placed by the customer s sales representative through order management module . The sales representative may set up the subscription on behalf of the customer.

EM module is configured to monitor activities related to managing and tracking a customer s subscription in cloud infrastructure system . EM module collects usage statistics for the services in the subscription order such as the amount of storage used the amount data transferred the number of users and the amount of system up time and system down time. At 10 a host operator personnel who may be an employee of a provider of cloud infrastructure system may interact with EM module via an enterprise manager user interface not shown in to manage systems and resources on which services are provisioned within cloud infrastructure system .

Identity management IDM module is configured to provide identity services such as access management and authorization services in cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment IDM module controls information about customers who wish to utilize the services provided by cloud infrastructure system . Such information can include information that authenticates the identities of such customers and information that describes which actions those customers are authorized to perform relative to various system resources e.g. files directories applications communication ports memory segments etc. IDM module can also include the management of descriptive information about each customer and about how and by whom that descriptive information can be accessed and modified.

In one embodiment information managed by the identity management module can be partitioned to create separate identity domains. Information belonging to a particular identity domain can be isolated from all other identity domains. Also an identity domain can be shared by multiple separate tenants. Each such tenant can be a customer subscribing to services in the cloud infrastructure system . In some embodiments a customer can have one or many identity domains and each identity domain may be associated with one or more subscriptions each subscription having one or many services. For example a single customer can represent a large entity and identity domains may be created for divisions departments within this large entity. EM module and IDM module may in turn interact with order management module at 11 and 12 respectively to manage and track the customer s subscriptions in cloud infrastructure system .

In one embodiment at 13 support services may also be provided to the customer via a support UI . In one embodiment support UI enables support personnel to interact with order management module via a support backend system to perform support services at 14 . Support personnel in the cloud infrastructure system as well as customers can submit bug reports and check the status of these reports via support UI .

Other interfaces not shown in may also be provided by cloud infrastructure system . For example an identity domain administrator may use a user interface to IDM module to configure domain and user identities. In addition customers may log into a separate interface for each service they wish to utilize. In certain embodiments a customer who wishes to subscribe to one or more services offered by cloud infrastructure system may also be assigned various roles and responsibilities. In one embodiment the different roles and responsibilities that may be assigned for a customer may include that of a buyer an account administrator a service administrator an identity domain administrator or a user who utilizes the services and resources offered by cloud infrastructure system . The different roles and responsibilities are described more fully in below.

At a customer s subscription order is processed. The processing may include validating the order in one example. Validating the order includes ensuring that the customer has paid for the subscription and ensuring that the customer does not already have subscriptions with the same name or that the customer is not attempting to create multiple subscriptions of the same type in the same identity domain for subscription types for which this is disallowed such as in the case of a CRM service . Processing may also include tracking the status of an order for each order that is being processed by cloud infrastructure system .

At a business process associated with the order is identified. In some instances multiple business processes may be identified for an order. Each business process identifies a series of steps for processing various aspects of the order. As an example a first business process may identify one or more steps related to provisioning physical resources for the order a second business process may identify one or more steps related to creating an identity domain along with customer identities for the order a third business process may identify one or more steps for related to performing back office functions such as creating a customer record for the user performing accounting functions related to the order and the like. In certain embodiments different business processes may also be identified for processing different services in an order. For example different business process may be identified to process a CRM service and a database service.

At the business process identified for the order in is executed. Executing the business process associated with the order may include orchestrating the series of steps associated with the business process identified in step . For example executing a business process related to provisioning physical resources for the order may include sending a request to SDI module to allocate resources and configure those resources needed to fulfill the subscription order.

At a notification is sent to the customer regarding the status of the provisioned order. Additional description related to performing steps and is provided in detail in .

In one embodiment order processing module receives an order from a customer from one or more input sources . For example order processing module may directly receive an order via cloud UI or store UI in one embodiment. Alternatively order processing module may receive an order from order management module or order database . Order processing module then processes the order. In certain embodiments processing the order includes generating a customer record which includes information about the order such as a service type a service level a customer level the type of resources the amount of the resources to be allocated to the service instance and a time period during which the service is desired. As part of the processing order processing module also determines whether the order is a valid order. This includes ensuring that the customer does not already have subscriptions with the same name or that the customer is not attempting to create multiple subscriptions of the same type in the same identity domain for subscription types where this is disallowed such as in the case of a fusion CRM service .

Order processing module may also perform additional processing on the order. Processing may include tracking the status of an order for each order that is being processed by cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment order processing module may process each order to identify a number of states pertaining to the order. In one example the different states of an order may be an initialized state a provisioned state an active state an administration required state an error state and the like. An initialized state refers to the state of a new order a provisioned state refers to the state of an order once the services and resources for the order have been provisioned. An order is in an active state when the order has been processed by TAS module and a notification to that effect has been delivered to the customer. An order is in an administration required state when intervention by an administrator is needed to resolve the issue. The order is in an error state when the order cannot be processed. In addition to maintaining the order progress status order processing module also maintains detailed information about any failures encountered during process execution. In other embodiments and as will be discussed in detail below the additional processing performed by order processing module may also include changing the service level for a service in the subscription changing the services included in the subscription extending the time period of the subscription and canceling the subscription or specifying different service levels for different time periods in the subscription.

After an order has been processed by order processing module business logic is applied to determine whether the order should proceed to provisioning. In one embodiment as part of orchestrating the order business process identifier receives the processed order from order processing module and applies business logic to identify a particular business process to use for the order being processed. In one embodiment business process identifier may utilize information stored in a service catalog to determine the particular business process to be used for the order. In one embodiment and as discussed in multiple business processes may be identified for an order and each business process identifies a series of steps for processing various aspects of the order. In another embodiment and as discussed above different business processes may be defined for different types of services or combinations of services such as a CRM service or a database service. In one embodiment service catalog may store information mapping an order to a particular type of business process. Business process identifier may use this information to identify a specific business process for the order being processed.

Once a business process has been identified business process identifier communicates the particular business process to be executed to business process executor . Business process executor then executes steps of the identified business process by operating in conjunction with one or more modules in the cloud infrastructure system . In some embodiments business process executor acts as an orchestrator for performing the steps associated with a business process. For example the business process executor may interact with order processing module to execute steps in a business process that identifies workflows related to the order determines the overage of services in the order or identifies service components related to the order.

In one example business process executor interacts with SDI module to execute steps in a business process for allocating and provisioning resources for services requested in the subscription order. In this example for each step in the business process business process executor may send a request to SDI component to allocate resources and configure resources needed to fulfill the particular step. SDI component is responsible for the actual allocation of the resources. Once all the steps of the business processes of an order have been executed business process executor may send a notification to the customer of the processed order by utilizing the services of services component . The notification may include sending an email notification to the customer with details of the processed order. The email notification may also include deployment information related to the order to enable the customer to access the subscribed services.

In certain embodiments TAS module may provide one or more TAS Application Programming Interfaces APIs that enable TAS module to interact with other modules in cloud infrastructure system and for other modules to interact with TAS module . For example the TAS APIs may include a system provisioning API that interacts with SDI module via an asynchronous Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP based web services call to provision resources for the customer s subscription order. In one embodiment TAS module may also utilize the system provisioning API to accomplish system and service instance creation and deletion switch a service instance to an increased service level and associate service instances. An example of this is the association of a Java service instance to a fusion applications service instance to allow secure web service communications. The TAS APIs may also include a notification API that interacts with the services module to notify the customer of a processed order. In certain embodiments the TAS module also periodically propagates subscription information outages and notifications e.g. planned downtime to services component .

In certain embodiments TAS module periodically receives usage statistics for each of the provisioned services such as the amount of storage used the amount data transferred the number of users and the amount of system up time and system down time from EM module . Overage framework utilizes the usage statistics to determine whether over use of a service has occurred and if so to determine how much to bill for the overage and provides this information to order management module .

In certain embodiments TAS module includes an order workflow identification module that is configured to identify one or more workflows associated with processing a customer s subscription order. In certain embodiments TAS module may include a subscription order generation framework for generating subscription orders for a customer when the customer places a subscription order for one or more services offered by the cloud infrastructure system . In one embodiment a subscription order includes one or more service components responsible for providing the services requested by a customer in the subscription order.

Additionally TAS module may also interact with one or more additional databases such as a Tenant Information System TIS database to enable the provisioning of resources for one or more services subscribed by the customer while taking into consideration historical information if any available for the customer. TIS database may include historical order information and historical usage information pertaining to orders subscribed by the customer.

TAS module may be deployed using different deployment models. In certain embodiments the deployment includes a central component that interfaces with one or more distributed components.

As described above with respect to SDI task manager module translates each step specified in a business process into a series of tasks by utilizing the services of SDI connector module which may include one or more connectors for handling the deployment of tasks specified by SDI task manager module to provision one or more services related to the order request. One or more of the connectors may handle tasks that are specific to a particular service type while other connectors may handle tasks that are common across different service types. In one embodiment SDI connector module includes a set of connectors wrapper APIs that interface with one or more of the external modules shown in in cloud infrastructure system to provision the services and resources related to the order request.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq system may be configured to provide a runtime engine for orchestrating PaaS operations. Nuviaq system may provide a web service API to facilitate integration with other products and services. Nuviaq system also provides support for complex workflows in system provisioning application deployment and associated lifecycle operations and integrates with management and monitoring solutions.

In the embodiment depicted in Nuviaq system comprises a Nuviaq proxy a Nuviaq manager and a Nuviaq database . In certain embodiments Nuviaq manager provides an entry point into Nuviaq system providing secure access to PaaS operations via the web service API. Internally it tracks system state in the database and controls job execution on the workflow engine. In a public cloud Nuviaq manager may be accessed by the Tenant Provisioning system SDI and the Tenant Console to drive provisioning and deployment operations respectively.

In one embodiment Nuviaq manager executes jobs asynchronously via an internal workflow engine. A job may be a sequence of actions specific to a given PaaS workflow. Actions may be performed in order with failure in any step resulting in failure of the overall job. Many workflow actions delegate to external systems relevant to the workflow such as the EM command line interface cli . In one implementation Nuviaq manager application may be hosted in a 2 node WebLogic cluster with associated HTTP server e.g. Oracle HTTP Server or OHS instance running inside a firewall.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq proxy is the public access point to the Nuviaq API. In one embodiment only Public API may be exposed here. Requests received by proxy may be forwarded to Nuviaq manager . In one embodiment Nuviaq proxy runs outside the firewall whereas manager runs within the firewall. In one implementation Nuviaq proxy application runs on a WebLogic cluster running outside the firewall.

In certain embodiments Nuviaq database tracks various domain entities such as without limitation platform instance deployment plan application WebLogic domain jobs alerts and the like. Primary keys may be aligned with the Service Database where appropriate.

In one embodiment Platform Instance may contain all resources required for a WebLogic service for a given tenant.

Nuviaq system may rely on additional systems of cloud infrastructure system to carry out the workflows used the WebLogic cloud service. These dependencies may include dependencies on SDI IDM a virus scan system a service database CRM instances and the like. For example Nuviaq system may depend upon functions performed by an Assembly Deployer in SDI .

In certain embodiments security policies may require certain artifacts to be scanned for viruses before being deployed to an application. Cloud infrastructure system may provide a virus scan system for this purpose that provides scanning as a service for multiple components of the public cloud.

In certain embodiments a public cloud infrastructure may maintain a Service Database containing information about tenants e.g. customers and their service subscriptions. Nuviaq workflows may access to this data in order to properly configure a WebLogic service as a client to other services that the tenant also subscribes to.

Nuviaq system may depend on IDM for its security integration. In certain embodiments Java Service instances can be associated with a CRM instance. The association allows user applications deployed to their Java Service instance to access a CRM instance though Web Service calls.

Various entities may use services provided by Nuviaq system . These clients of Nuviaq system may include a Tenant Console which is an management server e.g. Oracle Management Server based user interface that customers may access to manage their applications on their platform instances several IDEs such as Oracle IDEs JDeveloper NetBeans and OEPE have been extended to offer access to application lifecycle management operations one or more Command Line Interfaces CLIs that are available to access lifecycle operations on the platform instances.

Provisioning use case for Nuviaq system A Provision Platform Instance use case is realized via the Create Platform Instance operation of the Nuviaq API. In the context of cloud infrastructure system a service instance with respect to the Nuviaq system corresponds to a Nuviaq platform instance. A platform instance is assigned a unique identifier is used on all subsequent operations related to this instance. A Platform Deployment descriptor provided to the Create Platform Instance action allows for properties to be set that modify the configuration of the platform instance to meet the subscription requirements of the tenant. These properties may include for example 

Install Update Application use case The Install Application operation deploys an application to a running WebLogic Server after validating that the application archive meets the security requirements of the Public Cloud. In one embodiment the Application Deployment descriptor provided to the Install Application action allows for properties to be set that modify the configuration of the application to meet the subscription requirements of the tenant. These properties may include for example 

 3 When services are available TAS initiates provisioning by using the services of SDI . TAS may perform business process orchestration which will execute the relevant business process to complete the provisioning aspect of the order. In one embodiment TAS may use a BPEL Business Process Execution Language Process Manager to orchestrate the steps involved in the provisioning and handle the lifecycle operations. 4 In one embodiment to provision a database service SDI may call PLSQL APIs in the CLOUD UI to associate a schema for the requesting customer. 5 After successful association of a schema to the customer SDI signals TAS and TAS send a notification to the customer that the database service is now available for use by the customer. 6 The customer may log into cloud infrastructure system e.g. using an URAL such as cloud.oracle.com and activate the service.

Accordingly in certain embodiments TAS and SDI working in cooperation are responsible for provisioning resources for one or more services ordered by a customer from a set of services offered by cloud infrastructure system . For example in one embodiment for provisioning a database service the automated provisioning flow may be as follows for a paid subscription 

 3 When services are available TAS initiates provisioning by using the services of SDI . TAS may perform business process orchestration which will execute the relevant business process to complete the provisioning aspect of the order. In one embodiment TAS may use a BPEL Business Process Execution Language Process Manager to orchestrate the steps involved in the provisioning and handle the lifecycle operations. 4 In one embodiment to provision a database service SDI may call PLSQL APIs in the CLOUD UI to associate a schema for the requesting customer. 5 After successful association of a schema to the customer SDI signals TAS and TAS send a notification to the customer that the database service is now available for use by the customer. 6 The customer may log into cloud infrastructure system e.g. using an URAL such as cloud.oracle.com and activate the service.

In some embodiments a customer may also be allowed to subscribe to a service on a trial basis. For example such a trial order may be received via cloud UI e.g. using cloud.oracle.com .

In certain embodiments cloud infrastructure system enables underlying hardware and service instances to be shared between customers or tenants. For example the database service may be provisioned as shown in in one embodiment. depicts multiple Exadata compute nodes and each providing a database instance provisioned for the database service. For example compute node provides a database instance for a database service. Each Exadata compute node may have multiple database instances.

In certain embodiments each database instance can comprise multiple schemas and the schemas may be associated with different customers or tenants. For example in database instance provides two schemas and each with its own tables. Schema may be associated with a first customer or tenant subscribing to a database service and schema may be associated with a second customer or tenant subscribing to the database service. Each tenant gets a completely isolated schema. Each schema acts like a container that can manage database objects including tables views stored procedures triggers etc. for the associated tenant. Each schema may have one dedicated tablespace with each tablespace having one data file.

In this manner a single database instance can provide database services to multiple tenants. This not only enables sharing of underlying hardware resources but also enables sharing of service instance between tenants.

In certain embodiments such a multi tenancy system is facilitated by IDM which beneficially enables multiple separate customers each having their own separate identity domains to use hardware and software that is shared in the cloud. Consequently there is no need for each customer to have its own dedicated hardware or software resources and in some cases resources that are not being used by some customers at a particular moment can be used by other customers thereby preventing those resources from being wasted. For example as depicted in a database instance can service multiple customers each with their respective identity domains. Although each such database service instance can be a separate abstraction or view of a single physical multi tenant database system that is shared among the many separate identity domains each such database service instance can have a separate and potentially different schema than each other database service instance has. Thus the multi tenant database system can store mappings between customer specified database schemas and the identity domains to which those database schemas pertain. The multi tenant database system can cause the database service instance for a particular identity domain to use the schema that is mapped to that particular identity domain.

The multi tenancy can also be extended to other services such as the Java Service. For example multiple customers can have a JAVA service instance placed within their respective identity domains. Each such identity domain can have a JAVA virtual machine which can be viewed as being a virtual slice of hardware. In one embodiment a job monitoring service e.g. Hudson can be combined with a JAVA enterprise edition platform e.g. Oracle WebLogic in the cloud to enable each separate identity domain to have its own separate virtual slice of the JAVA enterprise edition platform. Such a job monitoring service can for example monitor the execution of repeated jobs such as building a software project or jobs run by an operating system s time based job scheduler. Such repeated jobs can include the continuous building and or testing of software projects. Additionally or alternatively such repeated jobs can include the monitoring of executions of operating system run jobs that are executed on machines that are remote from the machine on which the job monitoring service executes.

According to a further embodiment TAS and SDI support a role driven notification system including support for collapsing combinations. For example according to the role driven notification system notifications from TAS are tied to roles e.g. buyer account administrator service administrator identity domain administrator etc. . Different roles may be registered to receive information about different events in the system e.g. new order processing trial termination underutilization etc. . For a given type of event different templates may be used to restrict the details for a particular role e.g. only a service administrator is provided with temporary security credentials .

Further according to the collapsing combinations embodiment if a user possesses multiple roles role combinations are considered to select collapsed templates covering all details relevant to that user. This avoids duplicate role specific notifications for the same logical event. There may also exist a hierarchy of roles which may include overlapping roles.

In some embodiments the logic to trigger a notification is decoupled from the logic used to determine who should receive the notification and the content of the notification. In one embodiment SDI and TAS implement this system using a mapping strategy for different roles and associated notifications. For example a single user might have different roles and a notification subsystem knows which notifications the single user should receive using a customized notification mapping. Based upon the roles of the user different combinations of notifications may be provided to the user.

Furthermore the SDI may return metadata about the services and the environment to TAS and TAS then uses the metadata to notify the customer and trigger a notification event.

Customer notifications may be handled by the TAS NS. TAS NS provides rich notification services tailored to the TAS environment. While individual components could easily send simple e mail messages on their own the TAS NS frees these components from having to address details of formatting localization content revision and auditing. Instead components can focus on defining the abstract notifications they need to send out and the runtime variable data that accompanies individual notifications.

Since it is desirable to send a single email notification to the relevant users e.g. a user a customer a buyer a tenant administrator a service administrator with details of all the subscribed services in a given order the TAS system waits until all service subscription responses are received from TAS module for all order payloads before it sends email notifications. It consolidates all service subscription details into one or more emails based on the distinct set of recipients and delivers them to the recipients.

A notification template is used for specific notification scenarios such as an order processed notification a trial about to terminate notification etc. These templates can be used to tailor the notification messages and actions corresponding to such events.

Further there may be a hierarchy of roles which may or may not include overlapping roles and the same user may have multiple roles. In one embodiment restrictions may be placed on what can be sent to particular roles. Also the notification system may collapse notifications into the fewest number of notifications. Further hybrid combinations may be generated and the blending of these hybrid notifications may occur before runtime based on privileges or pre registration.

Turning now to which illustrates a system for processing notifications in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment system may include the TAS module within the cloud infrastructure system which includes the notification system . Further the notification system may include a notification subsystem a metadata definition module and a role database .

Within the cloud infrastructure system overlapping roles may exist. In one embodiment overlapping roles are roles that essentially include all of the privileges of other roles. For example an identity domain administrator which generally has all of the roles of a service administrator whereas an account administrator does not have all of the roles of either a service administrator or an identity domain administrator. Thus the customer has access to the services associated with the role system for which the customer has initially signed up.

In a practical application for a given customer signed up for a service that customer may be the account administrator the identity domain administrator and the service administrator. In other words a single customer or user may have any number of overlapping roles.

In one embodiment support may need to be fairly flexibly in the software in order to accommodate for the situation where there is a very fine grained mapping of each cloud infrastructure system defined role that is literally a different person in an organization and so messages are sent out in some cases with fairly narrowed notifications. For example the account administrator should not see the passwords or probably does not care to see them or URLs for a particular service and instead the account administrator is only interested in knowing that certain customers signed up for certain services i.e. the account administrators are not concerned with the specifics of the allocations but only which customers are allocated .

On the other hand a service administrator for a particular service would desire to see the URLs the SFTP account information passwords etc. for the particular service but would not want to see that same information for another service for which he she is not the service administrator.

Therefore in order to avoid sending notifications i.e. emails SMS etc. which are not needed or desired by certain customers a layer of software is generated to handle blending collapsing or filtering restricting of notification inside the notification system . As such notifications are abstractly collapsed into the fewest possible notifications if a user has multiple roles this role information is stored in the role database . So in particular instead of getting two different notifications when the user is onboarding i.e. if the user is the account administrator and the identity domain administrator only one notification is sent. Further that notification would be a hybrid combination of the content of the two separate notifications.

In one embodiment this may be achieved by pre registering templates that match a desired layout. Accordingly a number of various combinations are registered and the software and the automation systems that are sending out the notification are triggered by the abstract events and then a notification subsystem will determine based on the recipients and the type of the templates which are generated whether or not collapsing is possible and what set of notifications to send to a particular user.

Further each role has an associated notification template. Therefore if a user is registered as both the account administrator and the identity domain administrator for a service then when notifications are generated the notification template for the account administrator and the notification the template for the identity domain administrator will be analyzed and a third notification template will be generated. This third notification template will be a combination of the other two templates and will include the information in a single notification for both roles. Further metadata for each template is maintained by the metadata definition data module to be used when determining how to blend the notifications.

As such the notification subsystem is not concerned with whether there are three templates underneath one template or N templates. The notification subsystem simply logically triggers a notification to the set of users with the particular roles with a reference to the pieces of metadata necessary to generate the blended notification. Therefore how that maps into sets of templates discreet messages or collapsed messages is hidden from the notification subsystem . Accordingly the notification event itself is decoupled from the actual templates used to fulfill the notifications.

In one embodiment registration of a template or a combination templates may be automated. For example if roles A and B exist and now a combination of the notifications for roles A and B is needed then the combination can be generated automatically. This may be done using XML to generate a template pack which is a combination of XML files and metadata files used to form the combined template. Thus new combinations or templates can be registered using that metadata format. Therefore if role A and role B exist and there is a template for role A and a template for role B but no pre registered template for a combination of role A and role B then once it is determined that a user is both role A and role B at that point a combination template for role A plus role B may be automatically generated for future use by the notification subsystem . As such the notification information for each of the notification templates is stored in XML and the association of a role with a notification template is stored in metadata.

Turning now to which illustrates a method showing processing that may be performed by a notification system within the SDI module in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At notification templates which are each associated with roles are stored. At a determination is made that a user is associated with more than one role. Then a determination is made of which of the templates are associated with the roles of the user .

Further at the templates associated with the roles of the user are combined into a new template. At based on the new template a notification is generated and the notification is sent to the user.

Referring next to which illustrates a method which showing processing that may be performed by a notification system within the SDI module in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. At a role hierarchy and a notification hierarchy are stored. A determination is made of the location of the user in the hierarchies . For example the role hierarchy may have 10 levels and the user may be at level 5. Therefore the user has 4 child roles below him her in the hierarchy. The notification hierarchy would work in a similar manner.

At all the child templates in the hierarchy up to the location of the user in the hierarchy are collapsed and a single collapsed template is generated based on the template information from each of the children and the use level of the hierarchy . At based on the collapsed template a collapsed notification is generated. Accordingly the fewest notifications will then be sent to the user based on the level in the role hierarchy of the user.
