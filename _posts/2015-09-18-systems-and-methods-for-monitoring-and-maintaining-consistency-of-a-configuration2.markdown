The present application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 12 729 524 titled Systems and Methods for Monitoring and Maintaining Consistency of a Configuration and filed on Mar. 23 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for monitoring and maintaining consistency of a configuration across a plurality of packet engines.

An appliance may be deployed in a network to filter compress accelerate or otherwise process network communications. While some appliances include a predetermined or hardwired configuration others have the capability to receive configuration commands from a user or administrator to customize various features filters policies or services of the device. Where an appliance only has a single processor or single core a configuration command may be loaded and executed on that core. Failures in executing the command due to syntax errors lack of memory programming bugs or other reasons may be communicated to the user or administrator. Accordingly whether the command succeeded or failed to execute the user or administrator knows the current live configuration of the appliance. Thus the user or administrator can determine what further commands to send.

However this may not be true in a multi core appliance. Because a command may succeed on a first core and fail on a second core the appliance may have an inconsistent configuration between multiple cores. A further command sent by the user or administrator may execute differently on the cores due to the inconsistent configuration complicating the inconsistency.

The present application is directed towards systems and methods for monitoring and maintaining consistency of a configuration across a plurality of cores or packet engines in a multi core system. A configuration manager handles communication of configuration commands to a plurality of cores or packet engines. If a command executes successfully on a first packet engine but fails on a second packet engine the configuration manager may communicate an undo command to the first packet engine. Successful execution of the undo command may restore the packet engines to a consistent configuration.

In functional parallelism approach the functions to be performed by the multi core system are divided and distributed to each core according to functionality. In some embodiments functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to functional parallelism can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input output management NW I O A secure sockets layer SSL encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol TCP functions C. This may lead to a work performance or computing load based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core may perform SSL offloading while core may perform layer or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core B may handle SSL offloading while Core D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP A VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core A because the load A on Core is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core A the amount of load A on Core A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core D because Core D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

With a separate address space a core can perform work on information and data in the core s own address space without worrying about conflicts with other cores. Each packet engine may have a separate memory pool for TCP and or SSL connections.

For example one device may comprise two or more cores and another device may comprise two or more cores. For example a multi core system may include a cluster of computing devices a server farm or network of computing devices.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

In some embodiments the RSS module uses the MICROSOFT receive side scaling RSS scheme. In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The RSS module can apply any type and form hash function such as the Toeplitz hash function. The hash function may be applied to the hash type or any the sequence of values. The hash function may be a secure hash of any security level or is otherwise cryptographically secure. The hash function may use a hash key. The size of the key is dependent upon the hash function. For the Toeplitz hash the size may be 40 bytes for IPv6 and 16 bytes for IPv4.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values.

The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. Any portion of the hash result or the hast result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. The indirection table may comprise any number of buckets for example 2 to 128 buckets that may be indexed by a hash mask.

The flow distributor in some embodiments executes within any module or program on the appliance on any one of the cores and on any one of the devices or components included within the multi core system . In some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the first core A while in other embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the NIC . In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system comprising one or more processing cores A N. In brief overview one of the cores can be designated as a control core A and can be used as a control plane for the other cores . The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Further referring to and in more detail the cores A N as well as the control core A can be any processor described herein. Furthermore the cores A N and the control core A can be any processor able to function within the system described in . Still further the cores A N and the control core A can be any core or group of cores described herein. The control core may be a different type of core or processor than the other cores. In some embodiments the control may operate a different packet engine or have a packet engine configured differently than the packet engines of the other cores.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

F. Systems and Methods for Monitoring and Maintaining Consistency of a Configuration in a Multi Core Environment

As discussed above various services on an appliance may be configured by a user or administrator including cache manager encryption engine policy engine multi protocol compression engine or packet engine as shown in or any of packet engines A N A N as shown in . In some embodiments configurations may be entered from a GUI or CLI while in others configurations may be loaded from a memory or buffer . Although the systems and methods discussed herein are described primarily with respect to packet engines one skilled in the art could apply these methods and systems to monitor and maintain a consistent configuration in any multi engine or multi core environment.

A multi core environment presents unique difficulties for maintaining consistency of a configuration across each core. For example in a single core environment a user may attempt to load a configuration command onto a single packet engine running on the core. If the attempt is successful in some embodiments returning an acknowledgement the user knows that the packet engine is configured with the new command. Similarly if the attempt is unsuccessful in some embodiments returning an error code the user knows that the packet engine is not configured with the new command. In such a case further attempts to load the command may be made with explicit and unambiguous knowledge about the configuration state of the single packet engine. However in a multi core environment it is possible that a configuration could load properly on a first packet engine A of a first core and fail to load properly on a second packet engine B of a second core. In such an event the configurations between cores are no longer consistent.

One method for managing inconsistent configurations across multiple cores is to reboot or restart the appliance or clear and reload the configurations of all packet engines. However this may be undesirable as it may interrupt networking communications and cause unwanted delays during reboot. Another method for managing inconsistent configurations is to include functionality enabling a packet engine to explicitly identify itself in an acknowledgement or error message and include functionality enabling the user to direct configuration commands to individual packet engines. This may allow a user to manually maintain a consistent configuration but at the expense of time and effort.

Another approach is to use an automatic recovery procedure in which a management system receives an error message from a first packet engine and attempts to reload the configuration command to that packet engine. If the reload procedure is successful the first packet engine will have the same configuration as other packet engines on which the command had originally loaded successfully. However if the first packet engine fails to successfully reload the configuration command the management system may be unable to recover through just a reload procedure. For example the first packet engine may have failed to load the command originally because it had run out of available memory or because a processing thread had hung or because of a hardware or software error. In such cases sending further commands to the first packet engine may accomplish nothing or may cause unpredictable and undesirable behavior.

Briefly in one embodiment of a solution to maintaining consistency of a configuration across multiple packet engines a system may send configuration commands one at a time to a plurality of packet engines. If an acknowledgement is received from each of the plurality of packet engines the system may determine that all of the packet engines have successfully loaded the configuration command and have the same configurations. Accordingly the next configuration command may be sent. However if the system receives an acknowledgement from a first packet engine indicating the command loaded successfully and an error message from a second packet engine indicating the command failed to load the system may determine that the two packet engines have inconsistent configurations. Responsive to the determination the system may send an undo command to the packet engines on which the command had loaded successfully. Because these packet engines have apparently not crashed or failed they unlike failed packet engines may be able to process this further undo command. Successfully undoing the configuration command on these packet engines will restore them to the same configuration as the packet engines on which the command failed. At this point further attempts to load the configuration command may be made from a configuration that is consistent across all packet engines. In a further embodiment if the undo command is unsuccessful the system may prevent further configuration commands from being sent to the plurality of packet engines.

Referring now to an embodiment of a system for monitoring and maintaining a consistent configuration in a multi core environment is shown. A configuration manager may be configured to communicate with each of a plurality of packet engines A N on a plurality of cores A N. In some embodiments the configuration manager may include a configuration store a configuration buffer and or a timer . The configuration manager may include components or functionality for communicating with each of a plurality of cores and or packet engines . In some embodiments each packet engine may be configured with a counter A N referred to generally as counter s and or a configuration buffer A N referred to generally as configuration buffer s .

Still referring to and in more detail the configuration manager may comprise any form of logic functions or operations to send configurations and configuration commands to one or more cores and or one or more packet engines . Additionally the configuration manager may comprise any form of logic functions or operations to receive acknowledgement and or error messages from the one or more cores and or one or more packet engines . Furthermore the configuration manager may comprise any form of logic functions or operations to maintain and monitor configuration consistency between a plurality of packet engines cores or other engines or services. The configuration manager may comprise any combination of software and or hardware. The configuration manager may comprise a library service daemon process function subroutine application or any type and form of executable instructions. Although illustrated as separate from cores A N the configuration manager may be executed by any one of cores A N. In another embodiment the configuration manager may be executed by another core or processor not shown or may be executed on another appliance server client or device in communication with the appliance comprising cores A N.

In some embodiments the configuration manager may communicate with the one or more cores and or packet engines via a dedicated communication pathway such as a serial or parallel hardware connection to the one or more cores. In other embodiments the configuration manager may communicate with the one or more cores and or packet engines via network messages that are received and processed by the packet engines. In one such embodiment the configuration manager may send a configuration command in a network packet that is received by a packet engine . For example in such an embodiment the configuration manager may send a configuration command in a TCP IP packet directed to the IP address of the appliance or a localhost address and to a port number chosen such that flow distributor will direct the configuration command to one or more packet engines . In another such embodiment the configuration manager may send a broadcast packet with IP and port selected such that flow distributor may send the packet to all packet engines. One skilled in the art may appreciate that other protocols existing or yet to be developed may be used in such an embodiment including any combination of network layer protocols such as IPv6 transport layer protocols such as UDP SCTP or UDP session layer protocols such as NFS or SMB and or application layer protocols such as FTP HTTP SNMP or SSH. Furthermore in some embodiments the configuration manager may receive acknowledgement and error messages from the packet engines in similar fashion.

In some embodiments the configuration manager may include a configuration store . Configuration store may comprise an index data table database flat file data file text file or any other type and form of structure capable of storing a series of configuration commands. In some embodiments the configuration manager may include one configuration store for each packet engine or core or may include a single configuration store for all packet engines . In some embodiments the configuration store may further comprise a live configuration representing the current configuration of the packet engines and a default or initial configuration representing a configuration to load into the one or more packet engines on reboot or restart of the appliance.

In another embodiment the configuration store may comprise a configuration consistency indicator that is set to a first value when a plurality of packet engines have a consistent configuration and a second value when the plurality of packet engines have an inconsistent configuration. In a further embodiment the configuration manager may use this indicator to determine the configuration consistency of the plurality of packet engines. For example if the packet engines are in an inconsistent state and the configuration manager crashes and or is restarted without restarting the packet engines the configuration manager may use this indicator to identify the status of the packet engines.

Similarly in some embodiments the configuration store may comprise an indicator that an undo command was unsuccessful. In such embodiments responsive to the indicator the configuration manager may prevent further configuration commands from being sent to the cores or packet engines . For example if the configuration manager receives an error message from a packet engines to which an undo command was sent the configuration manager may in some embodiments prevent further configuration commands from being sent to the packet engines until the packet engines are reconfigured or the appliance is rebooted. Accordingly in such embodiments the configuration manager may store an indicator in the configuration store or in another memory structure such that if the configuration manager crashes and or is restarted without rebooting the appliance the configuration manager may continue to prevent further configuration commands from being sent to the packet engines. Although the above indicators are described as being stored in the configuration store in some embodiments they may be stored in a second configuration store not illustrated in buffer in a registry a database a configuration table a file or in any other type and form of memory structure accessible by the configuration manager .

In some embodiments configuration manager may also include a buffer . In such embodiments buffer may comprise a memory element or structure such as a ring buffer FIFO buffer or flat file useable by the configuration manager to buffer configuration commands such as those received from a user. In many embodiments a configuration command discussed in more detail below may comprise several individual commands. For example an unset command may comprise a group of several individual set commands. If the configuration manager sent the entire group of set commands to a plurality of packet engines and then received a error message there would be ambiguity as to which set command or commands executed successfully and which command or commands failed. Accordingly in an embodiment using buffer the configuration manager may store the group of commands in buffer and communicate the commands one at a time to each of the plurality of packet engines. After receiving acknowledgement messages from each packet engine indicating the command completed successfully in these embodiments the configuration manager may then send the next command from the buffer. Additional commands received during this process may also be stored in buffer .

In many embodiments configuration manager may further comprise a timer . Timer may comprise a service daemon process function subroutine application or any type and form of executable instructions for setting and operating a timer and sending a notification on expiration of the timer. In some embodiments timer may count upwards or downwards from a first predetermined value to a second predetermined value and may count seconds milliseconds microseconds or any interval selected by an administrator. In many embodiments when the configuration manager sends a configuration command to a packet engine the packet engine will respond with an acknowledgement message or an error message. However in some embodiments the configuration manager may not receive a response. For example a response may be lost before receipt. In some embodiments the configuration command may have been lost before arriving at the packet engine such that no response message is generated by the packet engine. In other cases the packet engine may not respond due to having crashed or hung or having run out of memory. Accordingly in these embodiments the configuration manager may use timer to wait for a predetermined period such as ten seconds from transmission of the configuration command. If no response is received from the packet engine within the predetermined period the configuration manager may in some embodiments be unable to determine whether the packet engine executed the configuration command successfully or unsuccessfully. Accordingly in such embodiments the configuration manager may prevent further configuration commands from being communicated to the packet engines. In further embodiments the configuration manager may request a live configuration from the packet engine that failed to respond in the predetermined period to determine whether the command executed successfully or unsuccessfully as described in more detail below.

In some embodiments each packet engine A N may maintain a counter A N referred to generally as counter s . A counter may comprise a register a variable a registry entry a string a binary value or any type and form of value that may be incremented and decremented by the packet engine . The counter may comprise any combination of hardware and or software. Although illustrated as separate from a configuration buffer in many embodiments counter may comprise a value string or variable stored within configuration buffer . In many embodiments in response to successfully executing a configuration command each packet engine A N may increment their respective counters A N. In further embodiments each packet engine A N may decrement their respective counters A N in response to successfully executing an undo command. In such embodiments configuration manager may further comprise functionality for querying the value of each counter A N and comparing the received values. In further embodiments configuration manager may determine that packet engines A N have inconsistent configurations responsive to differences in the values of counters A N. For example if a first packet engine has a counter value of 15 indicating it has successfully executed 15 configuration commands and a second packet engine has a counter value of 14 indicating 14 successfully executed configuration commands configuration manager may determine that the first and second packet engine have inconsistent configurations. In a further embodiment configuration manager may determine that the second packet engine failed to execute the most recently transmitted configuration command. In yet a further embodiment configuration manager may send an undo command to the first packet engine to undo the most recently transmitted configuration command. In such an embodiment the first packet engine may decrement its counter in response to successfully completing the undo command. In the example described above the first packet engine and second packet engine would both have counter values of 14 indicating a consistent configuration. In some embodiments counters A N may be reset to a starting value in response to a reconfigure command an initialization command or rebooting of the appliance.

In many embodiments each packet engine may maintain a configuration buffer A N referred to generally as configuration buffer s . A configuration buffer may comprise an index data table database flat file data file text file or any other type and form of structure capable of storing a series of configuration commands. In many embodiments a configuration buffer may comprise a live configuration representing the current configuration the packet engine .

Referring now to an embodiment of a method of maintaining consistency of a configuration across a plurality of packet engines is shown. In brief overview at step a configuration manager receives a set of configuration commands. At step the configuration manager communicates a first configuration command to a plurality of packet engines. At step the configuration manager may determine if the first configuration command executed successfully on each of the plurality of packet engines. If so the configuration manager may repeat step with the next configuration command. If not at step the configuration manager may communication an undo command to one or more of the packet engines. At step the configuration manager may determine if the undo command executed successfully. If so the configuration manager may repeat step with the next configuration command. If not at step the configuration manager may prevent further configuration commands from being sent to the packet engines.

Still referring to and in more detail at step in some embodiments a configuration manager receives a set of configuration commands. Although referred to in the plural as a set of configuration commands in many embodiments the set may comprise a single configuration command. In some embodiments the configuration manager receives the command or commands from a user or administrator operating a CLI or GUI process as described above while in other embodiments the configuration manager may receive the command or commands from a service process executing batch file daemon or other application without user intervention. In many embodiments the configuration manager receives the configuration command or commands via a network connection such as an Secure Shell SSH or Remote Procedure Call RPC communication. However in other embodiments any network protocol may be used to send a configuration command to the configuration manager. In still other embodiments the configuration manager may receive the configuration command via a local connection. For example in one such embodiment the configuration manager may further comprise a CLI or GUI and a user may enter a configuration command locally to the configuration manager. In another embodiment the configuration manager may receive a configuration command from another process executing on the same appliance. In yet another embodiment the configuration manager may receive a configuration command via an inter core or broadcast message. In still another embodiment the configuration manager may load a configuration command from a storage device such as configuration store or buffer discussed above or any other storage device. For example in one such embodiment rebooting the appliance may cause the configuration manager to load an initial default or live set of configuration commands from configuration store to send to the packet engines.

At step in some embodiments the configuration manager may communicate a configuration command from the set of configuration commands to the packet engines. In many embodiments where there are a plurality of configuration commands in the set of configuration commands the configuration manager communicates the configuration commands one at a time to the packet engines and buffers the remainder of the set. In some embodiments the configuration manager may communicate the configuration command to the packet engines via an inter core communication. For example if the configuration manager is executing on a first core it may communicate the configuration command to a second core via a core to core message or inter core broadcast message. In other embodiments the configuration manager may communicate the configuration command via a network packet. Although described as a network packet in many embodiments where the configuration manager is executing on the same appliance as the packet engines such network packet may be transmitted internally to a local IP address such as 127.0.0.1 or a localhost address and so may not actually travel across a network external to the appliance. However in other embodiments the configuration manager may transmit the command via a network.

In some embodiments the configuration manager may use remote direct memory access to a memory or cache accessible by a packet engine. In other embodiments the configuration manager may communicate the command in an application layer protocol such as RPC Telnet HTTP or SSH. In many such embodiments the configuration manager may direct the communication command to a particular packet engine of the plurality of packet engines via any combination of a predetermined IP address virtual IP address port number or virtual port number. For example in one such embodiment the configuration manager may transmit the command via RPC to the IP address and port number 127.0.0.1 4000 for a first packet engine and 127.0.0.1 4001 for a second packet engine. In a further embodiment IP address and port numbers may be selected such that a flow distributor directs the packet to the desired packet engine as discussed above. In other embodiments the configuration manager may communicate a command to a specific packet engine using a different characteristic of the communicated message such as an options field a predetermined sequence ID field a predetermined source IP and or port or any other field or information present in the header of the transmitted packet.

At step in some embodiments the configuration manager may determine if the command executed successfully. In many embodiments the configuration manager may determine that the command executed successfully by receiving an acknowledgment message from a packet engine. For example in one such embodiment the configuration manager may transmit the command to the packet engine via a reliable protocol such as TCP IP. The configuration manager may then receive an acknowledgement message for the transmitted packet. In some embodiments this acknowledgement message for the transmitted packet may indicate successful execution of the command. However in other embodiments an acknowledgement message may simply indicate receipt of the command by the packet engine and a further packet may be sent by the packet engine to indicate successful execution of the configuration command. In yet other embodiments these functions could be combined by including a field flag or indicator in a packet acknowledging receipt of the configuration command wherein such field flag or indicator indicates that the packet engine successfully executed the configuration command. In still other embodiments a non reliable protocol such as UDP may be used to transmit the configuration command to the packet engine. In such embodiments the packet engine may send a packet that is not an acknowledgement packet to indicate successful execution of the configuration command. In still other embodiments the configuration manager may determine that a packet engine successfully executed the configuration command by querying the packet engine for its current or live configuration receiving the live configuration and determining if the configuration command is in the live configuration. For example if the configuration command adds an access control list to the live configuration the configuration manager may determine if the command executed successfully by identifying a corresponding access control list in the live configuration.

In some embodiments at step the configuration manager may determine that the configuration command did not execute successfully. In one such embodiment the configuration manager may receive an error message from one or more packet engines. In some embodiments the configuration manager may receive an error message via an intercore message while in others the configuration manager may receive an error message via a network packet as discussed above. In some embodiments an error message may be transmitted in a similar method as an acknowledgement message discussed above though with different information or header content indicating that the packet engine failed to execute the configuration command successfully. For example in one such embodiment a packet engine may transmit an acknowledgement packet to the configuration manager with a flag or code in an options field indicating a specified error. In another embodiment the packet engine may transmit an acknowledgement packet with a sequence number or IP ID set to a function of the sequence number or IP ID of the packet comprising the configuration command wherein the function is selected to identify the acknowledgement packet as indicating that the command did not execute successfully. For example the function may comprise reversing a most significant bit least significant bit or one or more predetermined bits. In another embodiment the acknowledgement packet could be directed to a predetermined port number to indicate successful execution and a different predetermined port number to indicate an error. In some embodiments the error message may contain a code indicating a specific error such as an out of memory condition a hung or stalled processing thread a no such command message an invalid argument or variable message a no such resource message an invalid policy message an unknown error message or any other available message to indicate an error condition. In some embodiments the configuration manager may attempt to recommunicate the configuration command to the packet engine depending on the error message. For example in one such embodiment if the packet engine indicates via an error message that it did not receive part of the configuration command then the configuration manager may resend the command to the packet engine. In other embodiments upon receiving an error message from one or more packet engines the method proceeds to step described in more detail below.

In some embodiments the configuration manager may not receive an acknowledgement message. For example if a packet engine has crashed or stalled or if a transmitted intercore or network message is lost the configuration manager may not receive an acknowledgement message within a certain time. In such a case the configuration manager may not be able to determine the configuration of the packet engine. For example if the packet engine has crashed or stalled it may not have executed the configuration command. In some embodiments the packet engine may have successfully executed the configuration command and failed to send an acknowledgement message or the acknowledgement message may have been lost in transit. Accordingly sending an undo command to the packet engine may result in unpredictable results. As discussed above with respect to timer in some such embodiments the configuration manager may wait a predetermined amount of time from communication of the configuration command to one or more packet engines. Although not shown in for clarity upon expiration of timer if the configuration manager has not received an acknowledgement message from one or more packet engines the configuration manager may skip to step and prevent further configuration commands from being sent to the packet engines. In another embodiment the configuration manager may request a live configuration from the one or more packet engines it has not received an acknowledgement message from. If the configuration manager receives a live configuration from these one or more packet engines it may compare the received configuration to the configuration store a live configuration of a packet engine that acknowledged receipt of the configuration command or any other record to identify if the command executed successfully or not. If the configuration manager is able to make this identification in some embodiments the method may proceed accordingly to steps or depending respectively on execution success or failure.

In some further embodiments not illustrated for clarity if the configuration manager detects that a packet engine successfully executed the first configuration command of the set of commands the configuration manager may repeat steps for any remaining configuration commands in the set or received commands in the buffer or steps as more configuration commands are received. Furthermore in many embodiments at step the configuration manager may communicate the first configuration command to only a first packet engine of the plurality of packet engines and buffer the configuration command. In such an embodiment if the configuration manager detects that the configuration command executed successfully on the first packet engine at step then the configuration manager may communicate the configuration command to the remaining packet engines. This may reduce the need for recovery from inoperative commands to just a single packet engine rather than the plurality. Essentially in this embodiment the first packet engine acts as a test bed for the configuration command. Accordingly steps may be executed individually for each packet engine may be executed for a first test packet engine and repeated with the command sent to all remaining packet engines or may be executed only once with the configuration command sent to all packet engines simultaneously. Furthermore steps may be repeated multiple times for each configuration command in the set of configuration commands or for each further received configuration command in the buffer as discussed above.

In a further embodiment not illustrated at step the configuration manager may store a configuration record based on the live configuration of the first packet engine. Accordingly in such an embodiment the configuration manager may update the configuration record based on the successful execution of a configuration command on the first packet engine. This may reduce the complexity of a configuration record based on all packet engines of the plurality.

At step if the configuration manager determines that a configuration command did not execute successfully on a first one or more packet engines the configuration manager may send an undo command to a second one or more packet engines. In many embodiments the configuration manager may send the undo command just to the one or more packet engines that reported successful execution of the configuration command. In this manner the configuration state of these packet engines will be restored to the state prior to executing the configuration command and will be in the same state as the packet engines that did not successfully execute the configuration command. In some embodiments the undo command may be communicated to these one or more packet engines in any of the methods discussed above in connection with steps or and may contain any combination of flags identifiers IP address virtual IP address port number virtual port number IP ID sequence ID or options such that the flow distributor directs the undo command to the one or more packet engines that successfully executed the configuration command.

In some embodiments the undo command may be an explicit undo command that directs a packet engine to undo the previously executed command. In other embodiments the undo command may be a command determined by the configuration manager to undo the previously executed command. For example in one such embodiment if the configuration command was an add command the configuration manager may create a remove or rm command with identical arguments. Similarly if the configuration command was a bind command the configuration manager may create an unbind command with identical arguments. Likewise if the configuration command was a set command the configuration manager may create a corresponding unset command. One skilled in the art may readily appreciate that certain commands may have a corresponding command that may be used to undo the executed arguments.

In other embodiments the undo command corresponding to a particular configuration command may be another configuration command. For example in one such embodiment a set command may be an undo command for a set command. If a packet engine had a specific IP of 1.2.3.4 and the configuration manager transmitted a command to set IP to 5.6.7.8 then an unset command could result in the packet engine having no IP. Accordingly in such embodiments the undo command may be a command that explicitly sets the prior configuration. In the example above the undo command would be a command to set IP to 1.2.3.4. Thus in such embodiments the configuration manager may before communicating the configuration command first get the current live configuration of the packet engine. For example the configuration manager may request the current IP of the packet engine and receive a response that it is set to 1.2.3.4. Thus the configuration manager will be able to create an undo command that comprises a set command for the prior configuration state.

In still other embodiments the configuration manager may not be able to determine an undo command. For example in one such embodiment the configuration command may be a clear configuration command or an unset command or a command with a wildcard or variable. In some such embodiments the configuration manager may skip to step and prevent further configuration commands from being sent to packet engines as discussed below. In other such embodiments the configuration manager may attempt to recover by clearing the configuration from a packet engine that did not successfully execute the command and loading a live configuration from a packet engine that did successfully execute the command.

At step the configuration manager may determine if the undo command executed successfully or unsuccessfully on the one or more packet engines. In some embodiments the configuration manager may use any of the determination and or acknowledgement or timer expiration methods and techniques described above with respect to step . If the undo command executed successfully then in some embodiments the configuration manager may repeat steps for each additional configuration command in the set of configuration commands received at step until the buffer is empty of further configuration commands.

If the configuration manager determines at step that the undo command did not execute successfully on at least one of the packet engines to which it was communicated then the packet engines may be in an inconsistent configuration that is unrecoverable. For example the packet engine may not have been able to execute the undo command due to having crashed or stalled. In some embodiments the configuration manager may attempt to resend the command to the packet engine while in other embodiments the configuration manager may attempt to reset the packet engine or clear its configuration and reload a live configuration from another packet engine. However in other embodiments the configuration manager at step may prevent further configuration commands from being sent to the packet engines essentially locking in their current inconsistent live configurations. While this means that in these embodiments there may be an inconsistent configuration between different packet engines on the appliance the configuration manager may prevent further commands from being sent which would result in unpredictable behavior due to the different starting states of each packet engine. In a further embodiment the configuration manager may send an alert or notification message to a user administrator watchdog process operating system or other process or utility or may trigger a hardware alarm or indicator on the appliance.

In a further embodiment the configuration manager may receive a command to save configuration from a user or administrator. The configuration manager may store the saved configuration in a persistent memory such as flash memory a hard disk or other non volatile memory. Upon reboot of the appliance or request from a user to reconfigure the packet engines the configuration manager may communicate commands in the saved configuration to each of the packet engines to load the last saved configuration. In some embodiments the configuration manager may communicate each command one at a time in the above discussed steps to allow for an undo procedure. However in embodiments in which a configuration command in the middle of the saved configuration causes an error this may have the effect of truncating the saved configuration. For example with a saved configuration comprising 10 configuration commands if the fifth command causes an unrecoverable error such that the configuration manager would prevent communicating further commands at step this would have the effect of shortening the configuration to just the first five commands. Therefore in some embodiments the configuration manager may ignore configuration errors during the reboot or reconfiguration sequence and repeat steps until all configuration commands have been communicated to the packet engines. The configuration manager may then proceed to step and prevent further configuration commands from being sent to the packet engines.

In further embodiment of the embodiment discussed above in which a first packet engine is used as a test bed for execution of a configuration command the configuration manager may maintain a record of a live configuration in a memory device. The configuration manager may update this live configuration with each configuration command responsive to receiving an indication of successful execution by the first packet engine. In an embodiment of the system with multiple appliances with a synchronized configuration sometimes referred to as a high availability system the configuration manager may communicate the configuration command to one or more additional appliances responsive to receiving an indication of successful execution by the first packet engine. In these embodiments the configuration manager may be referred to as executing on a master appliance and the additional appliance may be referred to as slave appliances.

Although not shown in in many embodiments the configuration manager may receive further configuration commands or sets of configuration commands while executing steps . In many such embodiments the configuration manager may buffer the further configuration commands. In one such embodiment if the configuration manager determines at step that a configuration command executed successfully and there are no remaining configuration commands in the first received set of configuration commands the configuration manager may communicate a configuration command from the further received and buffered configuration commands to the packet engines as in step .

Referring now to a further embodiment of the method of of maintaining consistency of a configuration across a plurality of packet engines is shown. In brief overview when a configuration command is received by the configuration manager step from at step the configuration manager may determine the command type. If the command is an add or bind command then at step an undo command of rm or unbind may be created. If the command is a clear config rm or unbind command then at step a null command may be created or in some embodiments no undo command may be created. In such an embodiment further steps may be skipped the method proceeding to step on . Still referring to if the command is a set command then at step A the configuration manager may obtain a live configuration from a packet engine. At step B the configuration manager may create an undo command of a set command or group of set commands comprising the obtained live configuration. If the command is an unset group that comprises a plurality of set commands then at step the configuration manager may store additional set commands after the first set command in a buffer. The method may then proceed to steps A and B. Although not illustrated for clarity in some embodiments the method may repeat steps for each additional set command or other command or commands stored in the buffer.

Still referring to and in more detail in some embodiments at step the configuration manager may determine the command type of a received set of configuration commands. As discussed above the received set of configuration commands may comprise a single configuration command or may comprise a group or set of configuration commands. In some embodiments in which the received set of configuration commands comprises a group or set of commands steps may be repeated for each command in the group or set. In many embodiments the configuration manager may determine the command type responsive to parsing or examining the command for one or more instructions and or arguments. In some embodiments the configuration command may be a command adding or modifying a compression or encryption policy binding a service to a service group or any other configuration command such as those used by NetScaler devices or listed in the NetScaler Command Reference Guide by Citrix Systems Inc. of Ft. Lauderdale Fla. or used by any other network device or appliance such as those described above in connection with appliance . Furthermore although discussed in terms of the command each command may comprise one or more arguments including policies compression types IP addresses port numbers wildcards identification strings variables or any type and form of modifier applicable to a configuration.

At steps the configuration manager may identify determine and or create a corresponding undo command for the configuration command identified at step . In one embodiment if the command is an add command then at step the configuration manager may identify or create a corresponding remove or rm command. Similarly in another embodiment if the command is a bind command the configuration manager may identify or create a corresponding unbind command. Although discussed and illustrated for clarity as add or bind commands these commands may be interpreted as commands that add elements to a configuration and accordingly may be undone by removing said elements from the configuration. Thus one skilled in the art may appreciate that this group is not restricted to merely add or bind commands but may also include enable disable alias unalias and other similar commands.

In another embodiment if the command is a clear configuration remove or unbind command then the configuration manager may not be able to identify or determine an undo command. Although discussed and illustrated for clarity as clear config rm and unbind commands these commands may be interpreted as commands that remove elements from a configuration and as such may not identify explicitly or implicitly the prior configuration. For example in one such embodiment the command may be a command to remove all compression policies that match a wildcard such as IP address 1. . . . In such a case with multiple existing compression policies for included subdomains such as a first policy for IP address 1.2.3.4 and a second policy for IP address 1.5.6.7 both policies would be removed by executing the remove command. However these policies may not be explicitly or implicitly clear from just the remove command. Accordingly at step in one such embodiment the configuration manager may create a null or empty command. In another embodiment the configuration manager may not create an undo command but may skip steps in case of unsuccessful execution of the configuration command on a packet engine and proceed to prevent further configuration commands from being sent to packet engines at step as discussed above.

In yet another embodiment if the command is a set command then the configuration manager may at step A get a live configuration from a packet engine. In some embodiments getting the live configuration from a packet engine may comprise requesting and receiving a live configuration while in other embodiments getting the live configuration may comprise directly accessing the packet engine s cache such as through remote direct memory access. In a further embodiment at step B the configuration manager may determine identify and or create an undo command corresponding to the set command using the live configuration. Again though illustrated and described as set commands this type of command may be interpreted as a command that modifies or replaces an existing entry in a live configuration. For example in one such embodiment a command that sets a packet engine s IP and port to 1.2.3.4 56 may replace an existing configuration that sets the packet engine s IP and port to 5.6.7.8 90. However the set command may not implicitly or explicitly identify the prior IP and port such as a command of set IP 1.2.3.4 port . In such an embodiment the configuration manager may first get the current IP and port number of the packet engine and identify and or create a corresponding set IP 5.6.7.8 port undo command to be used at step if necessary. In some embodiments the configuration manager may request a specific entry in the packet engine s live configuration corresponding to the set command for example the current IP address and or port number. In other embodiments the configuration manager may request the entire live configuration of the packet engine and parse the received live configuration for an entry or entries corresponding to the set command.

In still another embodiment the command may be an unset command that causes multiple configuration changes. For example an unset config command may trigger multiple set and unset configuration commands to be executed. In some embodiments the configuration manager may receive just the unset command and create the corresponding set and unset configuration commands. In other embodiments a user or administrator may enter an unset command into a CLI or GUI and another process may create the corresponding set and unset configuration commands. In some such embodiments the configuration manager may receive only the created set and unset configuration commands rather than the original unset command. In a further embodiment the created set and unset configuration commands may be grouped or identified as comprising a group. For example a field in the header of these configuration commands may be set to a group identifier. In other embodiments the header of a configuration command may include a value indicating the remaining configuration commands in the group. For example if the configuration command is a single command it may have a value of 0. In some embodiments if there are four configuration commands in a group the first may have a value of 3 the second may have a value of 2 the third may have a value of 1 and the fourth may have a value of 0. This value may be in an options field or an ID field or may be placed in any field or data structure including in a protocol layer header transport layer header network layer header or any other area. In one embodiment predetermined bits in a longer field may be used to identify the number of commands in the group. For example one or more of the most significant bits in the IP ID or sequence ID field may be used to identify the number of commands in the group while the remaining bits are used normally.

In one embodiment when the configuration manager identifies a received configuration command as being part of a group of commands using any of the methods described above the configuration manager may buffer additional commands in the group at step . In a further embodiment the configuration manager may not communicate the first command from the group until all commands in the group have been received. In yet a further embodiment if the configuration manager has not received all commands in the group within a predetermined period or on expiration of a timer the configuration manager may send an error alarm or notification to the user administrator or executing process that sent the configuration commands. Once all commands in the group have been received by the configuration manager in some embodiments the method may proceed to steps A B as discussed above. In these embodiments each command in the group of commands may be processed individually. For example in one embodiment the configuration manager may request a live configuration from a first packet engine and on receipt communicate a first set command in the group to a first packet engine. If the first packet engine sends an acknowledgement message indicating successful execution then the configuration manager may communicate the first set command to the remaining packet engines. Upon receipt of acknowledgements indicating success from all packet engines the configuration manager may communicate a second command in the group to the first packet engine. This process may in some embodiments continue as described above until all commands in the group have been successfully executed on all packet engines. However if a packet engine sends an acknowledgement message indicating failure the configuration manager may then use the received live configuration from the first packet engine to create corresponding set commands to undo the communicated set commands as discussed above at steps A B.

Referring now to an embodiment of a method of monitoring consistency of a configuration across a plurality of packet engines is shown. In brief overview at step a configuration manager may retrieve a live configuration from each of a plurality of packet engines. At step the configuration manager may compare the retrieved live configurations. At step the configuration manager may detect an inconsistency in the live configurations. At step the configuration manager may identify a difference between one or more inconsistent live configurations.

Still referring to and in more detail at step the configuration manager may retrieve live configurations from the packet engines. In some embodiments the configuration manager may request a live configuration from each packet engine and receive a transmitted live configuration while in other embodiments the configuration manager may access the cache of each packet engine to read each live configuration. In yet other embodiments the configuration manager may retrieve or request and receive the value of a counter from each packet engine wherein each packet engine increments the counter for each successfully executed configuration command. In a further embodiment the configuration manager may only retrieve the live configuration from each packet engine responsive to identifying a difference in the received values of each counter indicating an inconsistent configuration between the packet engines. In another embodiment the configuration manager may not retrieve the entire configuration but rather retrieve just a portion of the live configuration from each packet engine. In some embodiments the configuration manager may execute step in response to expiration of a timer while in other embodiments the configuration manager may execute step in response to a request from a user administrator or process executing on behalf of a user.

At step in some embodiments the configuration manager may compare the received live configurations or portions of live configurations. In one embodiment the configuration manager may compare each live configuration by individual bytes while in another embodiment the configuration manager may compare each entry string or configuration command in the live configuration. In yet other embodiments the configuration manager may parse a first configuration for a configuration command and arguments and then search each other configuration for a matching configuration command and arguments.

At step in some embodiments the configuration manager may detect an inconsistency between two or more live configurations. In one embodiment the configuration manager may detect an inconsistency responsive to the above discussed comparison. In some embodiments if the configuration manager does not detect an inconsistency the configuration manager may in some embodiments restart a timer. In other embodiments the configuration manager may report a live configuration or configurations to a user responsive to a request which may include an indication that no inconsistencies were detected.

At step in some embodiments the configuration manager may identify a difference between the inconsistent configurations. In one embodiment identifying a difference may comprise identifying a different configuration command or commands and or identifying different arguments or variables for a configuration command between a first live configuration and a second live configuration. In another embodiment identifying a difference may comprise identifying a configuration command in a first live configuration and finding no corresponding configuration command in a second live configuration.

In one embodiment the method of steps or portions thereof is repeated continuously to monitor live configurations for inconsistency. To reduce CPU utilization in one such embodiment the configuration manager may only retrieve and compare a first portion of a plurality of live configurations store any differences between the portions and then repeat the process for remaining portions. In one such embodiment monitoring the live configurations may be executed in a time sliced fashion as a background task. Because monitoring the live configurations may take more time when executed this way the live configurations may change during the comparison process. Accordingly in one further embodiment the configuration manager may restart the comparison responsive to the live configurations having changed. In another further embodiment the configuration manager may maintain an indicator of what portions of the live configuration have been compared. In such an embodiment if a previously compared portion of the live configuration has changed the configuration manager may restart the comparison at that portion. This may reduce or eliminate the need to re compare earlier portions of the live configurations. In another embodiment the comparison method of steps is only executed either in one or multiple iterations responsive to a live configuration having changed.

In a further embodiment the configuration manager may report detected inconsistencies to an administrator. In one such embodiment the configuration manager may create a report for display. In one embodiment the report may be sent to an administrator for display in a CLI or GUI or other executing application. In a further embodiment the report may comprise portions of the live configurations were inconsistencies have been detected. For example if a first configuration on a first packet engine includes an entry adding a virtual server for HTTP requests with a timeout of 5 and a second configuration on a second packet engine includes a corresponding entry with a timeout of 8 a report may include the first entry identified as being a portion of the configuration of the first packet engine and the second entry identified as being a portion of the configuration of the second packet engine. In a further embodiment the difference between the entries such as the different timeout values may be emphasized highlighted underlined emboldened presented in a different color or colors or otherwise displayed in such fashion as to call attention to the difference.
