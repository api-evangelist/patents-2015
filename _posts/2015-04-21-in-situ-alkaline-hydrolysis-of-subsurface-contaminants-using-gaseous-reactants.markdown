This invention relates to the field of hydraulic and earth engineering and more specifically to in situ contaminant removal or stabilization.

Alkaline hydrolysis is a process for treatment of contaminated soil that involves raising pH levels to cause the contaminant to break down. This process has been successfully used for contaminants located primarily relatively close to the surface. However alkaline hydrolysis has been unsuitable for treating contaminants trapped at intermediate and deeper levels of soil.

Liquid chemical applications designed to penetrate the subsurface flow downward through narrow cracks crevices and high permeability channels present in soil. The liquid chemical becomes concentrated in some areas and bypasses large portions of the soil in others. High concentrations of alkaline materials may render drinking water unsafe and cause injury or damage to humans animals and crops.

There is an unmet need in the art for a controlled method of alkaline hydrolysis that is effective for eradicating subsurface soil contamination without causing additional environmental damage.

In another embodiment of the invention a method for treating a mass of contaminated media includes the steps of removing a sample of the contaminated media administering a known quantity Mof ammonia to the sample of the contaminated media by injecting the known quantity of ammonia through the sample of the contaminated media testing the sample of the contaminated media to determine a current pH Pof the sample of the contaminated media and calculating a quantity of ammonia M needed for treatment of the contaminated media using the equation

In another embodiment of the invention a system for treating contaminated media includes an air source an ammonia source at least one injection well and a control cabinet. The air source contains air. The ammonia source contains a quantity M of the ammonia required to treat the contaminated media the quantity M calculated using the equation wherein Pis the desired pH of the contaminated media Pis the current pH of the contaminated media Ais a constant value of approximately 0.34 milligrams of the ammonia per milligram of calcium carbonate F is a safety factor of approximately 10.4 and Bis a lime buffering capacity of the contaminated media expressed in units of milligrams of calcium carbonate per kilogram of the contaminated media per unit of pH. The control cabinet is connected between the air source the ammonia source and the at least one injection well.

As used herein the term lime buffer capacity means the amount of media acidity that must be neutralized to raise media pH by one unit expressed in units of milligrams of calcium carbonate per kilogram of media per unit of pH.

As used herein the term perched water means groundwater occurring in a saturated zone separated from a main body of groundwater by unsaturated rock sediments or soil.

As used herein the term saturated or saturation means a state wherein additional water cannot be absorbed.

As used herein the term vadose zone means a zone of soil extending from the ground surface to the water table.

Air source provides air . Air conveys carrier gas ammonia and other gases in gas mixture to injection well . In the exemplary embodiment air source is a compressor and compressed air tank. In another embodiment blower propels air through system .

Optional carrier gas source contains a carrier gas including but not limited to nitrogen or other gasses. Carrier gas source supplies carrier gas as compressed gas or refrigerated liquid or through generation membrane or pressure swing adsorption processes. Carrier gas provides an additional or alternate gas to combine with ammonia to create gas mixture if air contains unacceptable levels of oxygen or other components that could create an explosion hazard or dangerous conditions.

Ammonia source for ammonia may be a tank of liquid anhydrous ammonia or a tank of compressed gaseous ammonia. In one embodiment in gas mixture combining ammonia with air and or carrier gas ammonia makes up approximately 4 to approximately 14 of gas mixture . In another embodiment ammonia concentrations ranging from approximately 15 to approximately 28 may be used if carrier gas is substituted for air to mitigate the risk of creating an explosive gas mixture. In another embodiment in gas mixture combining ammonia with air and or carrier gas ammonia makes up more than approximately 28 of gas mixture . The concentration of this embodiment may be used if there are barriers geological features or climactic conditions which mitigate the risk of ammonia or transformation products migrating to groundwater.

Injection well is a hollow tubular insert approximately 1 inch to 4 inches in diameter constructed from polymers metals or other rigid materials. Injection well extends from the surface of contaminated media S to a given treatment depth to allow delivery of gas mixture and may extend through multiple different types of contaminated media S such as both soil and groundwater. One embodiment utilizes a single injection well while other embodiments include multiple injection wells . In embodiments using multiple injection wells the distribution of injection wells depends on a pneumatic permeability K of contaminated media S.

Injection well has solid sidewalls except for at least one perforated section . Perforated section includes apertures that allow delivery of gas mixture from injection well into contaminated media S. If contaminated media is located in a multiple subsurface layers then injection well may include more than one perforated section . For example if contaminated media S were located at depths of 10 12 feet and 20 24 feet then injection well would include first and second perforated sections . A first perforated section would begin at a location 10 feet from a first end and extend 2 feet along injection well . A second perforated section would begin at a location 20 feet from an upper end and extend 4 feet along injection well .

In one embodiment injection well also includes a surface cover . Surface cover is impermeable to gas and prevents any delivered gas mixture from escaping up through contaminated media S and into the atmosphere particularly during delivery at a shallow depth.

In one embodiment injection well also includes at least one resistive heating element located on an outer surface of injection well . Resistive heating element allows heating of contaminated media S to temperatures ranging from approximately 20 degrees Celsius to approximately 70 degrees Celsius. Because ammonia is hydrophilic and has a very high solubility in water the water content of contaminated media S influences the radial distribution of ammonia from injection well . Increasing water content reduces the radial distribution of ammonia . Heating contaminated media S can decrease its water content.

Blower may be used to convey gas mixture to injection well . Blower propels air through system allowing air to convey carrier gas ammonia and other gases of gas mixture to injection well . Due to this function blower must be located upstream of carrier gas source and ammonia source or of a piping junction where carrier gas source and ammonia source are introduced. In certain embodiments blower also heats air .

This removal can utilize hand tools an auger drill or other power tools. The void will have a diameter at least as large as the outer diameter of injection well and a depth sufficient to align perforated section with the full thickness of contaminated media S.

In step method inserts at least one injection well into contaminated media S at intervals determined in step .

In optional step method performs hydraulic or pneumatic fracturing to increase the permeability of contaminated media S.

In optional step method may increase the temperature of contaminated media S. In one embodiment this step delivers heated gas such as steam or heated air to contaminated media S through injection well . In another embodiment the user runs electric current through at least one resistive heating element located on an outer surface of injection well . The final temperature of contaminated media S ranges from approximately 20 degrees Celsius to approximately 70 degrees Celsius.
