Each of these prior applications is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under Grant Numbers 5DP1OD00027605 5R37MH05938809 1R01MH087986 1R01MH085298 and 1R01DA024680 which were awarded by the National Institute of Health the Government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates generally to the discovery of pro neurogenic compounds capable of promoting neurogenesis and or reducing neuronal cell death more particularly use of such compounds as antidepressant agents.

It is now accepted that the adult vertebrate brain fosters the birth and functional incorporation of newly formed neurons Goldman and Nottebohm Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1983 80 2390 2394 Paton and Nottebohm Science 1984 225 1046 1048 Burd and Nottebohm J Comp Neurol 1985 240 143 152 . However it was long thought that no new neurons could be added to the adult mammalian brain. This dogma was challenged in the 1960 s when autoradiographic evidence of new neuron formation in the hippocampal dentate gyms olfactory bulb and cerebral cortex of the adult rat was presented Altman J. Science 1962 135 1127 1128 Altman J. J Comp Neurol 1966 128 431 474 Altman Anat Rec 1963 145 573 591 Altman and Das J. Comp. Neurol. 1965 124 319 335 Altman and Das J Comp Neurol 1966 126 337 390 . It is now accepted that within all mammalian species including humans Eriksson et al. Nat. Med. 1998 4 11 1313 1317 there are two major reservoirs of neuronal stem cells one located in the subgranular zone SGZ of the hippocampal dentate gyms and another in the subventricular zone SVZ Gross Natl. Rev. 2000 1 67 72 . Neural stem cells in the SVZ facilitate formation of new neurons that migrate rostrally to populate the olfactory bulb while neural stem cells in the SGZ produce neurons that integrate locally in the granular layer of the dentate gyms a region of the hippocampus that exhibits lifelong structural and functional plasticity.

The process of new neuron formation in the adult mouse brain can be influenced by environmental chemical and genetic variables. As demonstrated by Gage and colleagues neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain is enhanced when animals are exposed to an enriched environment Kempermann et al. Nature 1997 386 493 495 or able to exercise voluntarily van Praag et al. Nat. Neuro sci. 1999 2 266 270 . More recently anti depressant drugs have been shown to enhance levels of adult neurogenesis in animals including humans Schmidt et al. Behav Pharmacol. 2007 September 18 5 6 391 418 Boldrini et al. Neuropsychopharmacology 2009 34 2376 2389 . Among many genes reported to impact adult neurogenesis is the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 NPAS3 a central nervous system CNS specific transcription factor that has been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Kamnasaran et al. J. Med. Genet. 2003 40 325 332 Pickard et al. Am. J. Med. Genet. B. Neuropsychiatr. Genet. 2005 136B 26 32 Pickard et al. Ann. Med. 2006 38 439 448 Pickard et al. Mol. Psychiatry 2009 14 874 884 Lavedan et al. Pharmacogenomics 2008 9 289 301 . Animals missing both copies of the NPAS3 gene suffer a profound loss of adult hippocampal neurogenesis coupled with significant behavioral deficits Pieper et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005 102 14052 14057 . Knowing that impaired post natal neurogenesis elicits unfavorable phenotypic deficits it is predicted that pro neurogenic chemical compounds should exhibit favorable therapeutic benefits for a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.

Depression is one of the most prevalent and pervasive forms of mental illness that affects individuals across age and gender lines. The lifetime risk of major depression is about 12 in men and about 25 in women generally. In addition about 5 to 10 of all patients in the primary care environment are present with major depression whereas about 3 to 5 of patients are diagnosed with dysthymia. In an in patient setting however between 10 and 14 of all patients are diagnosed with major depression. Major depression is a particularly disabling and pernicious in part because it is recurring. The rate of relapse for patients with major depression is about 40 over a two year period after a first episode. The occurrence of relapse increases to about 75 within a five year period after the diagnosis of a second episode of major depression.

Depressive disorders are most commonly treated with three main classes of compounds 1 monamine oxidase inhibitors 2 heterocyclic antidepressants and 3 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs . The known and currently prescribed antidepressants are by numerous side effects. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors were the first class of antidepressants used clinically. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors including isocarboxazid phenelzine and tranylcypromine inhibit the metabolism of phenylethylamine and catabolism of dopamine serotonin and norepinephrine. As a consequence of numerous dietary restrictions associated with the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors extensive side effects including hypertension headache myoclonic jerk sleep disruption and gastrointestinal complications monoamine oxidase inhibitors are currently not used as a first line antidepressant. The tricyclic antidepressants including imipramine desipramine nortrypline amitrypline doxepin and protrypline produce a variety of anticholinergic side effects drowsiness orthostatic hypotension cardiac arrhythmias and weight gain. Although generally milder than the monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants SSRIs also produce numerous side effects. For example SSRIs including fluoxetine paroxetine fluvoxamine sertraline and citalopram are associated with gastrointestinal distress jitteriness agitation and sleep disruption.

In addition to the numerous side effects associated with traditional antidepressant medications these therapeutics are also characterized by marginal efficacy. Several studies on the efficacy of antidepressant therapy for major depression have concluded that the treatment of acute disease or maintenance therapy is associated with a 50 60 response rate. The average absolute response rate between antidepressants and placebo is about 20 25 . Consequently there is a current need for new antidepressant therapies.

In view of the sometimes severe adverse side effects and marginal efficacy of numerous antidepressant therapies there is a great need for improved pharmaceuticals that effectively treat depressive disorders without producing the side effects associated with treatments of depression. The present invention identifies those compounds that enhance or improve learning and memory as a new class of therapeutics for the treatment of depressive disorders.

This invention relates generally to compounds that promote the generation or the survival of existing neurons in the mammalian brain. For the purpose of simplicity these compounds are referred to as being pro neurogenic. In certain embodiments the compounds promote the generation or survival of neurons in the post natal mammalian brain. In certain embodiments the compounds promote the survival growth development and or function of neurons particularly CNS brain cerebral and hippocampal neurons. In certain embodiments the compounds stimulate post natal hippocampal neurogenesis which while not wishing to be bound by theory is believed to represent a therapeutic target for a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases including but not limited to schizophrenia major depression bipolar disorder normal aging epilepsy traumatic brain injury post traumatic stress disorder Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease Down syndrome spinocerebellar ataxia amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Huntington s disease stroke radiation therapy chronic stress abuse of neuro active drugs such as alcohol opiates methamphetamine phencyclidine and cocaine retinal degeneration spinal cord injury and peripheral nerve injury. In certain embodiments the compounds stimulate post natal hypothalamic neurogenesis which can provide therapeutic benefits in weight management such as physiological weight loss associated with various conditions including but not limited to normal aging chemotherapy radiation therapy stress drug abuse anorexia as well as other diseases discussed herein.

The presently disclosed embodiments also feature compositions e.g. pharmaceutical compositions that include such compounds as well as methods of making identifying and using such compounds. Other features and advantages are described in or will be apparent from the present specification and accompanying drawings.

Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled premeasured ampules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills tablets capsules losenges or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions the compound is usually a minor component from about 0.1 to about 50 by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40 by weight with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form.

The amount administered depends on the compound formulation route of administration etc. and is generally empirically determined in routine trials and variations will necessarily occur depending on the target the host and the route of administration etc. Generally the quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 1 3 10 or 30 to about 30 100 300 or 1000 mg according to the particular application. In a particular embodiment unit dosage forms are packaged in a multipack adapted for sequential use such as blisterpack comprising sheets of at least 6 9 or 12 unit dosage forms. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound.

It should be appreciated by one skilled in the art as generally known that different enantiomers may have different activity. One enantiomer can be more active than another enantiomer. Two enantiomers combined can have another level of activity that is different than either substantially pure enantiomer. Preliminary experiments suggest P7C3 S113 is more active than P7C3 S114 in pro neurogenic and or anti apoptotic activities in an in vivo assay where 12 week old adult male C57 B16 mice were treated with 10 M of either compound. It should be noted that such difference in enantiomer activity may also be observed in other compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments. It should also be noted that such activity may depend on assay mode compound concentration compound purity compound stability as well as other parameters. It is possible that when tested at a different concentration a less active enantiomer may show increased activity and vice versa.

Previously a commercial sample of P7C3 S229 was tested in the neurogenesis assay and found to be indistinguishable from vehicle when dosed intracranially as a 10 micromolar solution MacMillan et al. 2011 133 1428 1437 . Subsequently a separate sample was independently synthesized and tested analogously and found to be active. While there may be many reasons for this discrepancy without wishing to be bound by theory it has been hypothesized that possible explanations include 1 The identity of the commercial sample was not rigorously confirmed it may have been a different substance. 2 The purity of the commercial sample was not rigorously confirmed an impurity may have counteracted the pro neurogenic activity of the commercial sample. 3 P7C3 S229 displays low solubility. Slight variation in the formulation of different samples or the physical characteristics of the sample e.g. crystalline vs. amorphous solid may have resulted in differences in exposure in the in vivo experiment.

It is also believed that P7C3 S295 Example 219 based on the structure can have high biological activity e.g. in the pro neurogenic efficacy neuroprotection assay in mice models described herein . Additional experiments in vitro and in vivo are underway to further characterize the effect of P7C3 S295 in disease models described herein.

In an effort to identify compounds that might stimulate the birth of new neurons or protect newborn neurons from cell death a library of 1 000 compounds was screened using an in vivo assay. In the initial screen compounds were randomly pooled into groups often and administered intracerebroventricularly at a constant rate over seven days into the left lateral ventricle of living mice via Alzet osmotic mini pumps. Compounds were administered at a concentration of 10 M for each molecule making a total solute concentration of 100 M. After seven days of infusion at a constant rate of 0.5 L hour a total of 84 L of volume will have left the pump 0.00084 Moles and entered the cerebrospinal fluid. The average volume of a brain from a 12 week old male C57 B6 mouse in our study is 500 mm. The maximal amount of drug was estimated that could potentially be present in the brain taking the extreme and unlikely scenario of 100 absorbance of the drug into brain tissue and 0 clearance throughout the seven day infusion period. Under these conditions at the end of one week of infusion each compound would be present at 1.7 Molar concentration. Since the actual amount of chemical compound in the brain is likely to be only a fraction of this predicted level it is reasonable to estimate that compounds were administered at mid to low nanomolar concentrations.

During compound infusion animals were intraperitoneally IP injected daily with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine BrdU as a means of scoring the birth and survival of proliferating neural precursor cells in the hippocampus. Because both social interaction and voluntary exercise are known to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis mice were housed individually without access to running wheels throughout the screening period. Following the week long period of compound administration animals were perfused and sacrificed. Dissected brain tissue was fixed embedded sectioned stained with antibodies to BrdU and evaluated by light microcopy as a means of quantifying neurogenesis and survival of newborn neural precursor cells localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms on the brain hemisphere contralateral to the side of mini pump cannulation. Every fifth section throughout the entire rostral caudal extent of the hippocampus was analyzed and the total number of BrdU cells was normalized against the measured volume of the dentate gyms. Because both increased proliferation and survival of newborn neurons are important screening parameters the screen was conducted over seven days in order to cast a wide net to detect molecules that might augment either process. The choice of parameters for the screen was based on pulse chase experiments with a single injection of BrdU under identical conditions to those used in our screen which revealed that 40 of newborn cells in the dentate gyms die within the first five days of their birth . Intracranial infusions of either fibroblast growth factor 2 FGF 2 or artificial cerebral spinal fluid aCSF vehicle via the same week long protocol were employed as positive and negative controls. There was no difference in the number of BrdU labeled cells in the dentate gyms between mice subjected to surgical pump implantation and infusion with vehicle and mice having had no surgery . This confirmed the validity of the in vivo approach to assess the ability of intracerebroventricularly infused compounds to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in the contralateral hemisphere.

Considered to be important is that stimulation of neurogenesis triggered by any compound be localized to the exact region of the brain known to produce new neurons at an enhanced level in response to healthy activities such as wheel running access to an enriched environment or access to social interaction. For this reason attention was focused solely on compound pools that stimulated BrdU incorporation only in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyms. Prominent nonspecific incorporation of BrdU in ectopic regions such as CA3 CA1 cortex or striatum was presumed to reflect pathological inflammation as proliferating cells incorporate BrdU in DNA synthesis or to indicate other forms of toxicity as cells also incorporate BrdU during DNA repair. Any compound pools yielding ectopic BrdU incorporation were eliminated from the screen. For an example see .

Each of the 100 pools was tested on two independent mice. As shown in ten of the 100 test pools were observed to enhance dentate gyms specific neurogenesis to an extent roughly equivalent to FGF 2. Each pool that scored positive in the initial two test animals was subsequently re evaluated in two additional mice and all ten pools were found to exert their pro neurogenic effect with statistical significance . In order to identify single pro neurogenic compounds positive pools were broken down into their ten component molecules each of which was infused individually at two concentrations 10 M and 100 M in two mice per concentration. shows the results of break down assays on pool 7 wherein it was discovered that neurogenesis was selectively stimulated by one of the constituent chemicals of the pool compound 3 chemicals in the pool demonstrating no effect. This molecule was designated as Example 45 Compound or P7C3. In breaking down the ten positive pools eight pools yielded a single pro neurogenic compound . To ensure that the pro proliferative or neuroprotective effect on neural stem cells was not an artifact of storage conditions in the UTSWMC chemical compound library re supplied compounds were verified to by 99 pure by mass spectrometry evaluated in 4 mice each at 10 M concentration and shown to retain either pro proliferative or neuroprotective properties in neural stem cells .

Pharmacokinetic analysis of Example 45 Compound in plasma and whole brain tissue was undertaken after single IV IP and oral gavage administrations. Example 45 Compound was noted to be orally bioavailable readily able to cross the blood brain barrier and endowed with a plasma terminal half life of 6.7 hours after IP delivery. These favorable pharmacological properties facilitated a dose response experiment wherein daily oral administration of Example 45 Compound to adult mice was monitored for both brain levels of the chemical and pro neurogenic efficacy . Maximal pro neurogenic efficacy was observed at oral doses of 5 mg kg and above and graded reductions in efficacy were observed at doses of 2.5 and 1 mg kg. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of the brain levels of Example 45 Compound in the dose ranges of 1 2.5 and 5 mg kg revealed corresponding compound concentrations of 213 nM 101 ng g brain tissue 1.13 M 534 ng g brain tissue and 1.35 M 640 ng g brain tissue five hours after dosing.

In order to further study Example 45 Compound an in vivo structure activity relationship SAR study was conducted using 37 chemical derivatives of the compound for pro neurogenic activity via direct administration into the brain of adult mice via Alzet minipumps. Compounds were administered for one week at 10 uM into 4 mice per compound along with daily IP injections of BrdU. Following compound administration animals were perfused sacrificed and subjected to sectioning staining and light microscopy in order to monitor hippocampal neurogenesis localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms. Roughly 10 of the variant compounds retained pro neurogenic activity indistinguishable from the parent compound. An approximately equal number of compounds yielded slightly diminished activity yet the majority of variants were of significantly diminished activity . For example a variant of Example 45 Compound having a methoxy substitution on the aniline ring Example 62 Compound was re tested for pro neurogenic activity via direct administration into the brain of adult mice via Alzet minipumps. The compound was administered for one week at 10 M into 4 mice which were injected daily with BrdU. Following compound administration animals were perfused sacrificed and subjected to sectioning staining and light microscopy in order to monitor hippocampal neurogenesis localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms. The methoxy derivative exhibited activity comparable to Example 45 Compound. Subsequently the and enantiomers of Example 62 Compound were prepared . The two enantiomers were evaluated in the in vivo neurogenesis assay. The enantiomer of Example 62 Compound retained potent pro neurogenic activity and the enantiomer displayed diminished activity . Other derivatives have also been resynthesized and retested as described above.

The nature of the cells produced in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus was investigated when Example 45 Compound was administered as follows. Animals were exposed to oral administration of Example 45 Compound for 30 days. Brain tissue was then prepared for immunohistochemical staining with an antibody to doublecortin DCX a microtubule associated protein that serves as a marker of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by virtue of transient expression in newly formed neurons but not glial cells between the timing of their birth and final maturation Brown et al. 2003 . As shown in the relative abundance of doublecortin positive neurons increased dramatically as a function of exposure to prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound. Although this observation does not rule out the possibility that the compound might also enhance the formation of glial cells it clearly shows that Example 45 Compound enhanced the formation of cells destined to become neurons.

Example 45 Compound mediated neurogenesis was next investigated to see whether it was attributable to increased cell proliferation or protection of newborn cells from cell death during the time between their birth and eventual incorporation into the granular layer of the dentate gyrus. This was accomplished by comparing the ability of Example 45 Compound to enhance either short or long term increases in the incorporation of BrdU in the dentate gyrus . Animals exposed to orally delivered Example 45 Compound or vehicle for 30 days were administered a single pulse of BrdU via IP injection. Short term effects on neuron birth were monitored by sacrificing animals one hour post BrdU injection followed by fixation of the tissue sectioning and immunohistochemical detection of BrdU incorporation into cells localized in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus. Example 45 Compound administration did not lead to an elevation in the level of BrdU positive cells relative to vehicle in this short term assay. At one day after BrdU administration both groups still showed no statistically significant differences in number of BrdU cells in the dentate gyrus. By contrast at the 5 day time point by which time 40 of newborn cells in our assay normally die animals that received Example 45 Compound showed a statistically significant 25 increase in BrdU cells compared to the vehicle only control group. This difference between groups progressed with time such that mice that received a daily oral dose of Example 45 Compound for 30 days starting 24 hours after the pulse treatment of BrdU exhibited a 5 fold increase in the abundance of BrdU positive cells in the dentate gyrus relative to vehicle only controls. Notably in this longer term trial BrdU positive cells were observed not only along the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus where new neurons are known to be born but also within the granular layer itself. It is hypothesized that these cells represent mature neurons that have migrated into the granular layer completed the differentiation process and incorporated themselves into the dentate gyrus as properly wired neurons. Observations supportive of this interpretation will be presented in a subsequent section of this document. In summary these experiments give evidence that Example 45 Compound enhances the formation of neurons in the mature hippocampus and that its mode of action would appear to take place at some point subsequent to their birth.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described cell proliferation tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

D. Example 45 Compound Normalizes Apoptosis and Ameliorates Morphological and Electrophysiological Deficits in the Dentate Gyrus of NPAS3 Deficient Mice 

Mice lacking both copies of the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 NPAS3 suffer a profound impairment in adult neurogenesis Pieper et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005 102 14052 14057 . By evaluating BrdU incorporation in a short term assay of neurogenesis by sacrificing animals 1 hours after BrdU pulse it was observed that NPAS3 deficient animals have no detectable deficit in the birth of neurons in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms . This is in contrast to our earlier observations of profoundly diminished BrdU labeling in the dentate gyms of NPAS3 deficient animals when BrdU is administered for a longer period of time 12 days Pieper et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005 102 14052 14057 . Knowing that the NPAS3 transcription factor is required for proper expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 FGFR1 in the hippocampus Pieper et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005 102 14052 14057 it is possible that impediments in growth factor signaling might impair the trophic environment critical for the survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyms. As an initial test of this hypothesis brain tissue prepared from NPAS3 deficient animals was compared with that of wild type littermates for the presence of cleaved caspase 3 CCSP3 positive cells in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms. A statistically significant 2 fold increase in CCSP3 positive apoptotic cells was observed in the dentate gyms of NPAS3 deficient animals . This enhanced rate of programmed cell death is likely to account at least in part for the nearly complete elimination of adult neurogenesis in mice lacking the NPAS3 transcription factor Pieper et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005 102 14052 14057 .

In addition to this quantitative deficit in adult neurogenesis abnormalities have been observed in both the morphology and electrophysiology of granular neurons of the dentate gyms of NPAS3 deficient animals. Relative to wild type animals Golgi Cox staining revealed severe attenuation in dendritic branching and spine density of dentate gyms granular neurons of NPAS3 deficient animals . By contrast no genotype dependent differences in these measures were observed in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Equivalently specific deficits were observed by electrophysiologic recordings of NPAS3 deficient animals compared with wild type littermates . Whole field recordings of excitatory postsynaptic potentials fEPSP revealed significant deficits in NPAS3 deficient animals relative to wild type littermates. In the dentate gyms stimulating and recording electrodes were positioned in the outer molecular layer which is innervated by axons of the perforant pathway originating from the entorhinal cortex. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus stimulation and recording electrodes were positioned in the stratum radiatum which is innervated by the Schaffer collateral axons of CA3 pyramidal cells. Stimulus intensity was increased in 5 A increments the slope of the decreasing part of field potentials was measured and fEPSP was quantified relative to the amplitude of the fiber volley which represents firing of action potentials in pre synaptic axons. This analysis revealed aberrant hyper excitability of synaptic transmission in npas3 mice both in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyms and in the CA1 region .

Armed with these genotype and region specific deficits in both neuron morphology and electrophysiological activity whether prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound might favorably repair either deficit in NPAS3 deficient animals was tested. Before embarking on this effort it was first confirmed that Example 45 Compound was capable of enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis in NPAS3 deficient mice by demonstrating that Example 45 Compound enhances both BrdU incorporation as well as expression of doublecortin in newborn neurons in the dentate gyms of npas3 mice . Knowing that formation of the dentate gyms initiates in the late pre natal mouse embryo around embryonic day 14 Stanfield and Cowan 1988 The development of the hippocampal region. In Cerebral Cortex E. G. Jones and A. Peters eds. New York Plenum Press pp. 91 131 animals were exposed to Example 45 Compound for as extended a period of time as possible in order to give the compound the best possible chance for exhibiting favorable effects. Following oral gavage of pregnant female mice 14 day embryos were recovered dissected and processed by acetonitrile water extraction so that Example 45 Compound levels could be measured in the embryonic brain. Daily administration of 20 mg kg of Example 45 Compound to pregnant females yielded appreciable levels of the compound in the brain tissue of developing embryos. It was similarly observed that oral administration of the compound to lactating females led to delivery of Example 45 Compound to the brain tissue of weanling pups. In both cases LC MS based quantitation of Example 45 Compound revealed levels of compound accumulation at or above the 1.35 M limit required to support adult neurogenesis . Finally it was observed that daily IP administration of Example 45 Compound to weaned pups at 20 mg kg was sufficient to yield brain levels of Example 45 Compound at or above the level required to enhance adult neurogenesis.

Female mice heterozygous at the NPAS3 locus were mated to heterozygous males. Two weeks post mating females were given a daily oral gavage of either 20 mg kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle only formula. Dosing was continued throughout the last trimester of pregnancy as well as the two week post natal period of lactation. Following weaning pups were given a daily IP dose of either 20 mg kg Example 45 Compound or vehicle control. At about 7 weeks of age mice were switched to oral gavage delivery of the same dose of Example 45 Compound. When mice were 3 months of age they were sacrificed and brain tissue was dissected and subjected to either Golgi Cox staining or electrophysiological recording. As shown in prolonged exposure to Example 45 Compound robustly repaired morphological deficits in the dendritic branching of granular neurons of the dentate gyrus in NPAS3 deficient mice. Moreover as shown in the electrophysiological deficit in the dentate gyms of NPAS3 deficient mice was also corrected following prolonged exposure of mice to Example 45 Compound. The corresponding electrophysiological deficit in CA1 region of the hippocampus however was not affected underscoring the specificity of Example 45 Compound to improving functioning of the dentate gyms in this animal model.

It is also notable that relative to vehicle only controls administration of Example 45 Compound did not affect any aspect of the health of mothers embryos weanlings or young adult mice. Gross histology of brain tissue was normal in both compound and vehicle treated animals and there was no evidence of neuronal cell loss or degenerative changes cytoplasmic eosinophilia vacuolization or nuclear pyknosis . The only morphological change other than normalization of dendritic arborization of granular neurons of the dentate gyms was a compound dependent increase in the thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyms itself . The thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus is roughly 40 less in NPAS3 deficient animals than wild type littermates. Prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound through late embryonic development early post natal development and two months post weaning significantly corrected this deficit without affecting the thickness of other hippocampal layers in NPAS3 deficient mice .

Recognizing that the reduced thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyrus in NPAS3 deficient animals could be attributed to elevated levels of apoptosis of newborn hippocampal neural precursor cells the effect of Example 45 Compound treatment on apoptosis in the hippocampus of NPAS3 deficient animals was examined through immunohistochemical staining of cleaved caspase 3 CCSP3 . As shown in 12 days of treatment with orally delivered Example 45 Compound 20 mg kg to adult NPAS3 deficient animals significantly reduced CCSP3 staining in the dentate gyms whereas vehicle treatment had not effect. It is thereby proposed that Example 45 Compound facilitated repair of the granular layer of the dentate gyms in NPAS3 deficient mice by ameliorating a genotype specific exacerbation of programmed cell death.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described apoptosis tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Extensive evidence pioneered by the laboratory of Xiaodong Wang has shown that an intrinsic pathway leading to programmed cell death emanates from mitochondria Liu et al. Cell 1996 86 147 157 Yang et al. Science 1997 275 1129 1132 . With the help of the Wang lab assays were established to test whether Example 45 Compound might protect mitochondria from calcium induced dissolution Distelmaier et al. Cytometry A 2008 73 129 138 . Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester TMRM is a cell permeant cationic red orange fluorescent dye that is readily sequestered by active mitochondria. When loaded with TMRM dye vehicle only treated cells released the dye within 15 minutes of exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187. By contrast dye release was prevented in cells exposed to as little as 10 ng of Example 45 Compound . As with in vivo neurogenesis assay as well as the in vitro protection from A mediated toxicity of cultured cortical neurons preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential in this assay was observed only with the enantiomer of Example 62 Compound .

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described mitochondrial integrity tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

A chemical compound sharing structural similarity to Example 45 Compound is 2 3 4 5 Tetrahydro 2 8 dimethyl 5 2 6 methyl 3 pyridyl ethyl 1H pyrido 4 3 b indole . An anti histamine trade named Dimebon was anecdotally noticed over the decades to ameliorate symptoms of dementia O Brien Lancet Neurol. 2008 7 768 769 Burns and Jacoby Lancet 2008 372 179 180 . More recently an American biotechnology company designated Medivation initiated clinical trials to formally test whether Dimebon might improve the symptoms of patients suffering from Alzheimer s disease. The results of FDA sponsored phase 2 clinical trials in Alzheimer s disease were recently published reporting favorable response rates Doody et al. Lancet 2008 372 207 215 . Example 45 Compound and Dimebon were compared in three functional assays. The in vivo test for effects on hippocampal neurogenesis revealed activity for both compounds with Example 45 Compound exhibiting between 10 and 30 fold higher level of potency and a ceiling of efficacy roughly 40 higher than the anti histamine drug . Dimebon has been implicated in protecting mitochondria Bachurin et al. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2001 939 425 435 Bachurin et al. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2003 993 334 344 discussion 345 349 . Therefore Dimebon was compared with Example 45 Compound in the calcium induced mitochondrial dissolution assay. Both compounds were observed to be active and it was again observed that the relative potency of Example 45 Compound was superior to Dimebon . Protection of mitochondrial membrane permeability was lost for Example 45 Compound between the 10 and 1 nM doses whereas that of Dimebon was lost between 10 and 1 M.

Example 45 Compound and Dimebon were tested for binding to the H1 histamine receptor. While Dimebon displayed high affinity for this receptor IC5010 M .

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described binding activity tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Next aged Fisher rats were used as a means of performing behavioral tests capable of assessing the potential benefits of Example 45 Compound on hippocampus dependent learning. It is well established that normal rodent aging is associated with attenuation of hippocampal neurogenesis Kuhn et al. J. Neurosci. 1996 16 2027 2033 Driscoll et al. Neuroscience 2006 139 1173 1185 . Reduced neurogenesis in aged rats is likely related to increased neuronal apoptosis in the aged rat brain Martin et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2002 277 34239 34246 Kim et al. Exp. Gerontol. 2010 45 357 365 . These changes have been hypothesized to contribute to cognitive decline as a function of terminal aging.

It was first evaluated whether Example 45 Compound would enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in aged rats as it does in adult mice. Rats were injected with a daily IP dose of either 10 mg kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle coinjected with a daily dose of BrdU and then sacrificed after 7 days for immunohistochemistry. As shown in compound treated animals revealed a 500 increase in BrdU labeling in the dentate gyms relative to vehicle treated controls. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to doublecortin likewise revealed a robust compound specific enrichment in this marker of newborn neurons. Having observed proneurogenic efficacy of Example 45 Compound in this short term assay it was then tested whether prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound might ameliorate age related decline in cognition by subjecting 18 month old rats to daily administration of either i 0 mg kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle only for 2 months. Animals of both groups were further subjected to weekly IP administration of BrdU 50 mg kg for later immunohistochemical measurements of hippocampal neurogenesis. As a control both Example 45 Compound and vehicle treated groups were confirmed to display equal ability to physically participate in the task and learn the task as shown by decreased latency times to find the hidden platform over the 5 day training period both before and after 2 months of treatment . Moreover neither swim speed nor locomotor activity varied with age or treatment paradigm.

After 2 months of compound or vehicle administration cognitive ability was assessed blind to treatment group by removing the goal platform. Animals of the Example 45 Compound treated group retained a statistically significant improvement in ability to navigate to the region of the missing platform as evidenced by performance in the probe test. As shown in when the platform was removed from the maze rats treated with Example 45 Compound crossed the precise location previously containing the platform significantly more often than vehicle treated rats. Furthermore Example 45 Compound treated rats spent a higher percentage of time in the general goal area defined as the quadrant previously containing the platform than vehicle treated rats 35.5 2.2 for Example 45 Compound treated 28.1 2.6 for vehicle treated Student s t Test p

After behavioral testing animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemical detection of BrdU and CCSP3. As shown in the dentate gyms of rats exposed to Example 45 Compound showed a 3 fold higher level of BrdU positive neurons than that of the vehicle group. Moreover Example 45 Compound treated animals showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of CCSP3 positive cells relative to vehicle controls . Unexpectedly administration of Example 45 Compound helped rats maintain stable body weight with aging in contrast to vehicle treated rats whose weight declined steadily with age . Example 45 Compound mediated effects on body weight were independent of food intake and treatment of aged rats with Example 45 Compound had no effect on postfasting blood glucose levels . Next it was tested whether Example 45 Compound mediated preservation of body weight in aged rats operates via central or peripheral modes of action.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described in vivo tests in rats or other animal models can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Positioned immediately below the thalamus and forming the floor and lower lateral walls of the third ventricle the hypothalamus consists of multiple groups of cells that regulate the autonomic nervous system and also control motivational behaviors via extensive neuronal connections to the pituitary gland thalamus midbrain and cerebral cortex. These functions include water balance biological rhythms feeding and drinking drive sexual activity pituitary gland function and temperature regulation. Neural stem cells in the adult brain reside in the wall of the third ventricle and proliferate in response to various stimuli and formation of new neurons in the hypothalamus has also been observed in the hypothalamic parenchyma. Administration of trophic factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor enhances neurogenesis in the rodent hypothalamus. Furthermore newborn neurons in the adult hypothalamus integrate into existing hypothalamic neural circuits and express neuronal markers such as POMC phosphorylated signal transducer of activator of transcription neuropeptide Y ocytocin and vasopressin. During hypothalamic development POMC expressing progenitor cells differentiate into two populations of cells with antagonistic roles expressing either POMC or neuropeptide Y that exert opposite effects in regulating energy balance. It is thus proposed that differential regulation of postnatally generated neurons in the hypothalamus might form the basis of developing new treatments to regulate food intake behavior. This hypothesis is supported by observations that acute ablation of new hypothalamic neurons leads to severe anorexia and weight loss.

It was evaluated whether P7C3 might augment hypothalamic neurogenesis by administering either vehicle or P7C3 10 mg kg twice daily i.p. to nine week old male C57BL 6 mice starting two days before implantation of 7 day Alzet osmotic minipumps model 1007d loaded with BrdU 1 mg kg . Pumps were connected to a cannula that delivered BrdU at a constant rate into the left lateral ventricle for the seven day period during which time animals continued to receive either vehicle or P7C3. Pumps were surgically removed at the conclusion of their 7 day operating period and mice were allowed to survive for 4 more weeks during which time they continued to receive either vehicle or P7C3. At the end of the 4 week period mice were deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal i.p. injection of mouse anesthetic cocktail and transcardially perfused with 4 paraformaldehyde PFA in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 . Brains were then dissected and post fixed overnight at 4 degrees Celsius in 4 PFA and cryoprotected in 30 sucrose in PBS. Fixed brains were embedded in O.C.T and cut at 20 micrometer thickness with a cryostat. Every third section was immunohistochemically stained for BrdU Accurate rat anti Brdu 1 400 per our standard procedures. Anti rat Dylight 596 was used to visualize BrdU incorporation. As can be seen from treatment with P7C3 markedly enhances hypothalamic neurogenesis in the rodent brain with a significantly increased amount of BrdU positive staining.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described hypothalamic neurogenesis tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Because P7C3 and its derivatives and analogs can enhance hypothalamic neurogenesis compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments can be useful for regulating hypothalamic functions such as water balance biological rhythms feeding and drinking drive sexual activity pituitary gland function and temperature regulation. For example given P7C3 s role in maintaining stable body weight in aging rats compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments can provide therapeutic benefits to patients experiencing physiological weight loss for various reasons such as normal aging radiation treatment chemotherapy anorexia cachexia diabetes stress substance abuse dementia stroke cancer infection as well as other diseases and or conditions.

Since P7C3 ameliorates the death of newborn neurons in the dentate gyms in living mice it is possible that its function might relate to mitochondrial integrity. Assays were established to test whether P7C3 might protect cultured U20S cells from calcium induced mitochondrial dissolution Distelmaier et al. Cytometry A 2008 73 129 138 . Tetramethylrhodamine methylester TMRM dye is sequestered by active mitochondria and when loaded with TMRM vehicle treated cells released the dye within 15 rain of exposure to the calcium ionophor A23187. By contrast dye release was fully prevented in cells exposed to as little as 10 nM of P7C3 . Compounds known to be less active in vivo were also less active in this assay not shown . Preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential in this assay was observed for the R enantiomer of P7C3 OMe Example 1b but not the S enantiomer Example 1a . Finally protection of mitochondrial membrane permeability was observed at an enhanced level for a compound variant P7C3A20 Example 6a which also exhibited a high level of proneurogenic activity . Derivatives that have less proneurogenic activity than P7C3 such as Example 33 and Example 21 displayed less protective effect in preserving mitochondrial integrity at the tested doses in cultured primary cortical neurons.

It was also examined whether Example 45 Compound preserves mitochondrial membrane potential in cultured primary cortical neurons . Cortical neurons cultures from rats on embryonic day 14 were loaded with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester TMRM dye after 6 days of maturation. The top panels no calcium ionophore show that the dye alone did not affect the health of neurons. The remaining panels are from cells that were exposed to the calcium ionophore A23187 at time zero. With vehicle alone cortical neuron mitochondrial membrane potential was rapidly lost after exposure to the ionophore. Escalating doses of Example 45 Compound preserved mitochondrial membrane potential following exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187 in a dose dependent manner with full protection achieved at 1 mM. The less active compound Example 33 was less effective in preserving mitochondrial membrane potential at any dose tested. Results shown are representative of 10 fields analyzed in each of 2 experimental runs for all conditions.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described mitochondrial tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Recognizing that reduced thickness of the npas3 dentate gyms granular layer could be attributed to increased apoptosis of proliferating neural precursor cells the effect of Example 45 Compound P7C3 treatment on apoptosis in the hippocampus of npas3 mice was examined through immunohistochemical staining of CCSP3. As shown in after 12 days of orally delivered Example 45 Compound 20 mg kg to adult npas3 mice a statistically significant reduction in CCSP3 staining was observed in the dentate gyms. It is thereby proposed that Example 45 Compound facilitates repair of the granular layer of the dentate gyms in npas3 mice by overcoming a genotype specific enhancement in apoptosis.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described mice model and other animal model can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

K. Example 45 Compound P7C3 Provides Therapeutic Benefit in Animal Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ALS 

ALS also known as Lou Gehrig s disease is an adult onset typically between ages 40 70 rapidly progressive and fatal disease caused by selective degeneration of upper cortical layer V within the primary motor cortex and lower spinal cord motor neurons the nerve cells in the central nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. An estimated 5000 people in the United States are diagnosed with ALS every year. This disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body and patients with ALS ultimately lose their ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement. The earliest parts of the body affected in ALS reflect those motor neurons that are damaged first. About 75 of patients experience onset of symptoms in their arms or legs manifested as difficulty with manual dexterity or ambulation while about 25 experience bulbar onset of ALS difficulty speaking clearly or swallowing. A small proportion of patients have respiratory onset of ALS in the form of weakness of the intercostal muscles that support breathing. Regardless of the region of onset muscle weakness and atrophy invariably spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Most patients develop a constellation of symptoms that includes difficulty moving dysphagia difficulty swallowing dysarthria difficulty speaking or forming words and classical manifestations of loss of upper motor neurons muscular spasticity hyperreflexia and overactive gag reflex and lower motor neurons muscular weakness muscle atrophy muscle cramps and fasciculations . Sensory nerves and the autonomic nervous system are usually spared though may be involved in some patients. About 20 of ALS patients also develop frontotemporal lobar dementia FTLD while 30 50 of patients develop subtle cognitive changes that can be observed with detailed neuropsychological testing. Around 15 45 of patients with ALS also experience what is called pseudobulbar affect a form of emotional lability in which patients manifest intermittent bouts of uncontrollable laughter crying or smiling. This symptom domain is thought to be related to degeneration of bulbar upper motor neurons resulting in exaggerated motor expressions of emotion. Although disease progression varies between individuals most patients are eventually unable to stand or walk get in or out of bed on their own or use their hands and arms. Difficulty chewing and swallowing further leads to progressive weight loss and increased risk of choking and aspiration pneumonia. Towards the end stages of disease as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles weaken most patients require ventilator support. Individuals with ALS most commonly die of respiratory failure or pneumonia within 2 5 years of diagnosis.

Ninety five percent of ALS cases occur sporadically SALS with no identifiable cause or family history of the disease. The remaining 5 of cases are inherited known as Familial ALS FALS . Because FALS and SALS are clinically and neuropathologically similar the pathogenesis of these forms of ALS may converge on a common pathogenic pathway. Approximately 20 of FALS and 3 of SALS cases are associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the SOD1 gene on chromosome 21 and about 150 different mutations dispersed throughout this gene have been identified in FALS. SOD1 encodes cytosolic Cu Zn superoxide dismutase an antioxidant enzyme that protects cells by converting superoxide a toxic free radical generated through normal metabolic activity of mitochondria to hydrogen peroxide. Unchecked free radicals accumulate and damage both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA as well as proteins within cells. In ALS linked to mutations in SOD1 cytotoxicity of motor neurons appears to result from a gain of toxic SOD1 function rather than from loss of dismutase activity. Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying toxicity are unclear mutation induced conformational changes in SOD1 are known to lead to misfolding and subsequent cytotoxic aggregation of mutant SOD1 in cell bodies and axons. Aggregate accumulation of mutant SOD1 is thought to disrupt cellular functions and precipitate neuron death by damaging mitochondria proteasomes protein folding chaperones or other proteins.

Transgenic animal models of mutant SOD1 are currently used for research into the pathogenic mechanisms thought to broadly underlie ALS such as G93A SOD1 mutant mice. Mice hemizygous for the G93A SOD1 transgene express 18 2.6 copies of a form of SOD1 found in some patients with FALS a substitution of glycine to alanine at codon 93 . This was the first mutant form of SOD1 to be expressed in mice and is the most widely used and well characterized mouse model of ALS. Superoxide dismutase activity in these mice is left intact such that the pathogenic effect of the mutant transgene appears to be gain of function as is thought to occur in human patients. In these mice death of motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and loss of myelinated axons in ventral motor roots leads to paralysis and muscle atrophy. Upper cortical motor neurons in these mice also die as the disease progresses and protein aggregates of mutant SOD1 are found only in diseased tissues with greater amounts being detected during motor neuron degeneration. Around 100 days of age G93A SOD1 mice become paralyzed in one or more limbs with paralysis due to loss of motor neurons from the spinal cord. This paralysis rapidly spreads throughout the body culminating in 50 death when mice are 128.9 9.1 days old.

P7C3 was intraperitoneally administered to female G93A SOD1 transgenic mice using a treatment paradigm of 10 mg kg P7C3 i.p. twice a day compared to vehicle starting at 40 days of age. This treatment scheme was selected based on standard protocols for initial proof of concept screens in these mice. To control for transgene copy number mice are sibling matched between treatment groups as per standard protocol. After initiation of P7C3 or vehicle treatment date of onset of illness is determined by peak weight and initial progression of disease is defined as the day at which mice fall to 10 below their maximum weight. Mice are also assessed daily by a standard determination of neurological severity score with a score of 2 or worse for two consecutive days serving as an additional marker of illness progression. This score is determined blind to treatment group with the scoring system described in the legend for the figure. As shown in P7C3 treatment slows disease progression in G93A SOD1 mice in terms of delaying the time point at which mice drop to 10 below their maximum weight. Treatment with P7C3 also significantly delays the age at which G93A SOD1 mice attain a neurological severity score of 2 another marker of disease progression as shown in . Furthermore P7C3 treatment significantly improved performance in the accelerating rotarod task as the disease progressed in these mice as shown in indicating a slowing of progression of motor impairment in the disease process. This protective effective of P7C3 on motor performance in G93A SOD1 mice is also observed in the ink footprint analysis of walking gait as shown in .

Parkinson s disease PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra which project to the striatum to control normal movement. Though it is one of the most common nervous system disorders of the elderly the cause of PD remains uncertain. Symptoms early in the disease are movement related including shaking rigidity slowness of movement and difficulty with walking gait. More advanced stages of the disease are typically associated with cognitive and behavioral problems including dementia. The early motor symptoms are partially managed by administration of drugs that enhance dopaminergic signaling. However as the disease progresses and the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra continue to die patients reach a point at which these drugs become ineffective at treating the symptoms and additionally produce the complication of dyskinesia. Effectively preventing the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra would therefore be an ideal treatment approach for patients with PD.

MPTP 1 methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine is a potent neurotoxin that selectively kills dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of both mice and monkeys causing a clinical picture resembling PD. The MPTP toxicity model can therefore be used to study the death of dopaminergic neurons with the goal of developing new treatments for PD based on neuroprotective strategies found to be effective in these neurons. To determine if P7C3A20 might be neuroprotective in the substantia nigra the well characterized and popular MPTP administration regimen was employed as developed by Tatton and Kish 1997 77 1037 1048 and Jakson Lewis et al. 2007 2 141 151. Here 12 week old wild type male C57BL 6 mice were treated for 3 days with P7C3A20 10 mg kg i.p. twice daily or vehicle and on the fourth day a five day regimen of 30 mg kg day i.p. free base MPTP was initiated. During this five day period of MPTP administration the mice continued to receive P7C3A20 or vehicle. Mice continued to receive the same dose of P7C3A20 or vehicle every day for 21 more days at which point they were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with 4 paraformaldehyde. Brains were post fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde at 4 degrees Celsius overnight and then cryoprotected with 30 sucrose in phosphate buffered saline. Fixed brains were cut at 30 microns with a sliding microtone and every 4th section spaced 120 microns apart was stained with antibodies directed against tyrosine hydroxylase TH Abcam rabbit anti TH 1 2500 . TH positive cells were counted in the substantia nigra area. As shown in and treatment with P7C3A20 significantly attenuates MPTP mediated killing of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. These observations suggest that P7C3A20 and related compounds may form the basis of new neuroprotective strategies for preventing or slowing the progression of Parkinson s disease.

Huntington s disease HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by the insidious and progressive development of mood disturbances behavioral changes involuntary choreiform movements ceaseless and complex writhing movements of the limbs and cognitive impairment. HD has a prevalence of about 1 in 10 000 people in the U.S. and is caused by a polyglutamine expansion of greater than 36 repeats in the N terminus of the protein huntingtin Htt . There are currently no treatments that delay the appearance or progression of this disease. HD is pathologically characterized by a dramatic loss of neurons in the striatum and cerebral cortex and therapeutic strategies to protect these neurons from dying might provide new treatment options for patients. The physical symptoms of HD typically have their onset between 35 44 years of age though onset has been reported to occur at times ranging from infancy to old age. The exact way in which HD affects an individual varies and can differ even between members of the same family but symptoms progress predictably in most cases. The earliest symptoms include a general lack of coordination and unsteady gait and as the disease advances uncoordinated and jerky body movements become more apparent. More advanced stages are typically accompanied by an observable decline in mental abilities associated with behavioral and psychiatric problems such as anxiety severe depression blunted affect egocentrism aggression and compulsive behaviors such as alcoholism gambling or hypersexuality. Over time physical abilities are gradually impeded until coordinated movement becomes very difficult and mental abilities generally decline into dementia. Complications such as pneumonia heart disease eating difficulties leading to weight loss and malnutrition and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy to around twenty years after onset of symptoms. There is no cure for HD and full time care is required in later stages of disease.

Htt is a large cytoplasmic protein that interacts with over 100 other proteins and appears to have multiple biological functions. The behavior of mutated Htt mHtt protein is not completely understood but it is known to be toxic to neurons. Damage mainly occurs in the striatum but in later stages other areas of the brain are also attacked such as the cerebral cortex. As neuronal cell death progresses symptoms associated with the functions of the affected brain areas appear. For example planning and modulating movement are the main functions of the striatum and difficulties with these tasks are frequent initial symptoms of HD. Disease initiation and progression are thought to involve in large part a conformational change in the mHtt protein due to the polyglutamine expansion altered protein protein interactions abnormal protein aggregation in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and proteolysis which in turn may lead to transcriptional dysregulation excitotoxicity mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. In addition to a role for a gain of new toxic properties of mHtt in HD pathology there is increasing evidence that loss of wild type Htt function also contributes to pathogenesis. For example an essential role of Htt in mitotic spindle formation and mammalian neurogenesis has recently been identified.

One animal model of HD that can be employed for screening potential therapeutic agents is R6 2 transgenic mice. These mice express a mutant exon 1 of the human huntingtin gene engineered to include an approximately 145 155 CAG repeat expansion. R6 2 mice phenocopy much of the neuropathology striatal and cortical neuron cell death and behavioral manifestations of clinical HD. They display progressive motor and cognitive impairments ubiquitinated nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions of mutant Htt weight loss decreased striatal and brain size altered levels of neurotransmitters and their receptors and premature death. They exhibit motor deficits as early as 5 6 weeks of age display overt behavioral abnormalities at 8 9 weeks and typically die between 11 and 13 weeks of age. R6 2 mice also display significantly lower levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis relative to wild type littermates even before onset of symptoms.

In one hypothesis P7C3 and its derivates may enhance the formation of neurons in the mature hippocampus by preventing death rather than promoting proliferation of these cells. As such P7C3 is proneurogenic by virtue of its neuroprotective activity. It is also possible that P7C3 and its derivates prevents cell death and promotes cell proliferation. It was evaluated whether P7C3 might provide therapeutic benefit in R6 2 mice. P7C3 10 mg kg i.p. twice daily starting at 6 weeks of age or vehicle were administered to 40 female R6 2 mice. As shown in 50 of vehicle treated R6 2 mice die at approximately 15 weeks of age and treatment with P7C3 delays animal death by about three weeks. At 14 weeks of age R6 2 mice treated with P7C3 showed improved general condition score and appearance as shown in as compared to vehicle treated littermates. General condition score was determined by a 3 point scoring system that was conducted blind to genotype and treatment group score of 0 fur looks groomed normal posture no hunch clear eyes alert score of 1 fur beginning to stick up slight hunch score of 2 piloerection fur sticking up unkempt fur hunch in back or neck area crusty eyes . Death was monitored twice daily and defined as either when animals were found dead or when they were unable to right themselves after being placed on their backs with movement subsequently initiated by gentle prodding for 30 seconds. By general appearance of coat condition grooming and spontaneous activity in the home cage R6 2 mice treated with P7C3 also appear qualitatively better than VEH treated R6 2 mutant mice not shown .

Parkinson s disease PD is an incurable and progressive neurodegenerative disorder of predominantly idiopathic origin that is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta SNc a region of the brain that controls motor activity by projecting dopaminergic axons to the striatum Lees A. J. Hardy J. Revesz T 2012 Parkinson s disease. 373 2055 2066 . Early symptoms in PD are primarily movement related including shaking rigidity brady and hypo kinesia tremor and difficulty walking. More advanced stages of PD are associated with cognitive and behavioral problems including dementia. Current treatment strategies for PD consist primarily of partial management of early motor symptoms with drugs that enhance dopaminergic signaling such as L DOPA or dopamine receptor agonists. Unfortunately as greater numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc die these drugs fail to alleviate symptoms and additionally produce dyskinesia. There is thus a significant unmet need for new pharmacologic strategies to slow the progression of PD such as drugs capable of blocking the death of SNc dopaminergic neurons.

We have previously reported the identification of an aminopropyl carbazole P7C3 discovered via an unbiased in vivo screen for small molecules capable of enhancing postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. P7C3 displays enantiomeric selective stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential and enhances neurogenesis by blocking apoptosis of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus Pieper A.

Prolonged oral or intraperitoneal i.p. administration of P7C3 to rodents safely improves hippocampal functioning.

Through an in vivo structure activity relationship SAR study we have identified analogs of P7C3 displaying either increased or decreased activity. In particular a chemical variant known as P7C3A20 was observed to have greater potency and efficacy than P7C3. P7C3A20 differs from P7C3 by virtue of replacing the hydroxyl group at the chiral center of the linker with a fluorine and the addition of a methoxy group to the aniline ring. This analog displays a more favorable toxicity profile than P7C3 with no hERG channel binding histamine receptor binding or toxicity to HeLa cells. We have also found that Dimebon an antihistaminergic drug long deployed in Russia that is claimed to have anti apoptotic and mitochondrial protective properties displays modest efficacy in the same biologic assays employed to discover and characterize P7C3 and P7C3A20. The chemical structure of Dimebon is related to the P7C3 class of aminopropyl carbazoles yet its rank order of activity relative to chemical derivatives of P7C3 is very low. Here we report that the neuroprotective activity of these agents extends beyond promoting long term survival of newborn cells in the adult hippocampus. Specifically we show that the most active variants of P7C3 exhibit robust protection of mature dopaminergic neurons in both mouse and worm models of neurodegeneration and propose that substituted carbazoles may represent attractive chemical scaffolds for the optimization of therapeutic agents for the treatment of Parkinson s disease.

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice is an approximately month long process during which time the majority of newborn cells die as they transition through a differentiation gauntlet lasting about 1 month before surviving cells become functionally wired into the central nervous system. We have previously found that approximately 40 of these newborn cells die within the first week following their birth in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. P7C3 was originally discovered through a week long in vivo screen designed to identify small molecules that might enhance either proliferation or survival of newborn hippocampal neural precursor cells. Subsequent bromodeoxyuridine BrdU pulse chase labeling studies revealed that P7C3 does not affect neural precursor proliferation but instead augments survival of newborn cells by blocking apoptosis. P7C3A20 was found to be active at lower doses and to have a higher ceiling of efficacy CoE than P7C3 in this 7 day in vivo assay whereas Dimebon was shown to be substantially less potent and efficacious than P7C3.

In order to more carefully compare the neuroprotective efficacy of these compounds in abetting hippocampal neurogenesis we conducted dose response studies in a 30 day BrdU pulse chase survival assay . Briefly newborn cells were labeled with a single intraperitoneal i.p. injection of BrdU 150 mg kg followed by daily treatment with the three test compounds beginning the following day. After 30 days of compound administration mice were transcardially perfused with 4 paraformaldehyde brains were dissected and immunohistochemical detection of BrdU followed by standard microscopic imaging and normalization for dentate gyms volume was used to quantify the number of surviving cells. As shown in P7C3A20 increased neuron survival by almost 100 at the lowest dose tested 5 mg kg day . By contrast neither P7C3 nor Dimebon exhibited any effect at this dose. At the next higher dose 10 mg kg day P7C3 and Dimebon showed 65 and 15 neuroprotective efficacy respectively whereas P7C3A20 showed neuroprotective ceiling of efficacy CoE of about 175 . All three compounds exhibited their maximal individual CoEs at the two highest doses tested 20 or 40 mg kg day with P7C3A20 s CoE being highest 230 increase in survival P7C3 s CoE being intermediate 130 increase in survival and Dimebon s CoE being the lowest 30 increase in survival .

Efficacy Assays for P7C3 P7C3A20 and Dimebon for Protection from MPTP Toxicity to Dopaminergic Neurons in Mice.

The protective efficacy of the three test compounds for newborn hippocampal neurons in the 30 day survival assay prompted us to investigate whether they might also have neuroprotective efficacy in mature neurons outside of the hippocampus. To investigate this hypothesis we utilized the 1 methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine MPTP model of neuronal cell death. MPTP is a potent toxin that selectively kills neurons in the substantia nigra of both rodents and primates causing clinical manifestations resembling PD Fukuda T. 2001 Neurotoxicity of MPTP. 21 323 332 . MPTP is lipophilic and readily crosses into the brain where it is metabolized by monoamine oxidase B in glial cells into the highly toxic cation 1 methyl 4 phenylpyridinium MPP . MPP is selectively concentrated in SNc dopaminergic neurons by virtue of its high affinity for the plasma membrane dopamine transporter and toxicity is further potentiated by binding of MPP to melanin in these cells creating a depot mechanism that maintains prolonged high intracellular concentrations of MPP. MPTP toxicity is routinely used to study the death of dopaminergic neurons as a possible means of discovering new treatments for PD based on neuroprotective strategies found to be effective in this model.

We compared the protective efficacy of our agents in the Tatton and Kish model of MPTP administration which induces prolonged apoptotic death of SNc dopaminergic neurons lasting about 3 weeks after a short course of daily MPTP administration. Mice were treated daily for 5 days with 30 mg kg day free base MPTP. On the sixth day 24 hours after receiving the fifth and final dose of MPTP daily treatment with P7C3 P7C3A20 Dimebon or vehicle was initiated. This testing paradigm ensured that any observed activity of P7C3 or its analogs could be attributed to neuroprotective effects and not to disruption of MPTP uptake or metabolism. Dose response studies were conducted in which mice received twice daily doses of each compound or vehicle for the ensuing 21 days . Treatment groups consisted of 15 animals each. At the end of the 21 day treatment period mice were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with 4 paraformaldehyde and fixed brains were sectioned through the striatum and SNc at 30 M intervals. Every fourth section spaced 120 M apart was stained with antibodies specific to tyrosine hydroxylase TH Abcam rabbit anti TH 1 2500 . The TH enzyme catalyzes the conversion of the amino acid L tyrosine to L 3 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine L DOPA which serves as the precursor for dopamine. TH staining thus provides a means to immunohistochemically identify dopaminergic neurons. By counting the number of TH cells in the SNc we were able to assess the neuroprotective efficacy of the three chemicals following MPTP exposure. All microscopic analysis was performed by two investigators blind to treatment group.

As has been observed by others MPTP administration reduced the number of TH neurons in the SNc by about 50 VEH . This neurotoxicity was blocked to varying degrees by both P7C3 and P7C3A20. P7C3 enhanced survival by about 40 over VEH at a dose of 5 mg kg day and the highest dose of P7C3 20 mg kg day afforded almost 60 protection relative to vehicle. By contrast the 20 mg kg day dose of P7C3A20 preserved the number of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc to about 85 of that seen in normal mice not exposed to MPTP. At every dose tested P7C3A20 provided superior protection to P7C3. Both CoE and potency of P7C3A20 were greater than P7C3 with the onset of P7C3A20 efficacy 30 over VEH at a dose of 1 mg kg day. Dimebon failed to confer any measurable degree of protection from MPTP at any dose.

In addition to allowing quantification of dopaminergic cells in the SNc TH staining is also routinely employed to visualize the integrity of dopaminergic axonal protections from SNc cell bodies into the striatum. shows that the highest dose of P7C3A20 20 mg kg day almost completely blocked depletion of dopaminergic axons in the striatum after MPTP exposure. The highest dose of P7C3 also revealed qualitatively notable protection. By contrast Dimebon offered no protection of dopaminergic axons in the striatum corresponding to its lack of neuroprotective efficacy in the SNc. As shown in LC MS MS quantification of brain and blood levels of P7C3A20 and P7C3 confirmed that the neuroprotective efficacy for each compound correlated with brain and blood levels for each chemical. Notably P7C3A20 displayed significantly greater protective efficacy than P7C3 in spite of the fact that P7C3A20 accumulated in brain tissue at less than one tenth the concentration of P7C3. Dimebon which displayed no neuroprotective efficacy in the MPTP model of dopaminergic neuron cell death showed comparable levels of brain accumulation to P7C3A20.

Efficacy Assays of P7C3 P7C3A20 and Dimebon for Protection from MPP Toxicity to Dopaminergic Neurons in

Genes metabolic signaling pathways neurotransmitters and receptor pharmacology are highly conserved between and vertebrates and exposure of to MPP has been reported to selectively kill dopaminergic neurons and impair mobility. To investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of P7C3A20 P7C3 and Dimebon from MPP toxicity in we monitored dopaminergic cell death in a transgenic strain of worms in which dopaminergic neurons fluoresce green by virtue of GFP expression driven by the dopaminergic neuron specific promoter dat 1. As shown in incubation of synchronized L1 larvae for 40 hours with 5 mM MPP elicited virtually complete destruction of all four cephalic sensilla dopaminergic dendrites. For this assessment GFP fluorescence was observed in 20 worms per group and was performed in triplicate. Cephalic sensilla dopaminergic dendrites were observed under 40 magnification AMG Evos fl microscope and GFP signal was followed from the nerve ring to the tip of the nose following established protocols. If any part of a dendrite was absent as evidenced by loss of GFP signal it was counted as degraded. All analyses were performed blind to treatment group.

Co treatment of MPP exposed worms with 10 M P7C3A20 conferred 80 protection. By comparison the neuroprotective efficacy of the same dose of P7C3 was only about 50 . Neuroprotective efficacy of both agents was diminished as the chemical dose was gradually reduced. By these measures P7C3A20 showed greater potency than P7C3 with an onset of neuroprotective efficacy of 30 at the 0.1 M dose. By comparison P7C3 did not show efficacy 35 until administered at 1.0 M. Administration of Dimebon at the highest dose 10 M failed to protect dopaminergic neurons in worms from MPP induced toxicity.

As a behavioral measure of toxicity worm mobility was assessed 32 hours after MPP exposure. To quantify worm locomotion video representations were recorded for 10 seconds at 4 magnification using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope. Each video segment consisted of 160 frames and the head of each worm 10 worms per group repeated in triplicate was manually tracked in each frame using Imera software. The body length of each worm was also measured by Imera software. The ratio of distance traveled to body length was used to determine the movement index defined as locomotion as previously established Wang J. et al. 2009 An ALS linked mutant SOD1 produces a locomotor defect associated with aggregation and synaptic dysfunction when expressed in neurons of e10003350 . As shown in locomotion was reduced in by 50 after 32 hours of exposure to 5 mM MPP. Co incubation of MPP exposed worms with 10 M P7C3A20 conferred 80 preservation of locomotion while 10 M P7C3 protected to about 60 of normal levels. Dimebon offered no protective efficacy in this behavioral assay.

Correlation of Efficacy of New Analogs of P7C3 in the In Vivo Hippocampal Neurogenesis Assay with Neuroprotective Efficacy in MPTP Mediated Dopaminergic Cell Death.

Over the past two years we have conducted a comprehensive structure activity relationship SAR study in order to improve the potency efficacy and physical properties of the P7C3 series of molecules as well as to eliminate real or perceived chemical liabilities. To date we have synthesized over 300 analogs of P7C3 all of which have been evaluated by primary screening in the in vivo hippocampal neurogenesis assay. Our efforts include but are not limited to eliminating the bromines and aniline ring increasing biologic activity decreasing lipophilicity eliminating toxicities such as hERG channel binding increasing solubility and reducing molecular weight. Here we show the results of evaluation of 8 of these new analogs in both the hippocampal neurogenesis assay 4 mice for each compound and the MPTP protection assay 10 mice for each compound . All analyses were conducted blind to treatment group.

With respect to the original P7C3 scaffold P7C3 S7 differs by replacing the aniline NH with a sulfide linker P7C3 S8 differs by replacing the aniline phenyl ring with a pyrimidine and P7C3 S25 differs by replacing the aniline moiety with a dimethyl pyrazole . As shown in all of the eight test molecules crossed the blood brain barrier. P7C3 S7 and P7C3 S25 were active in both the hippocampal neurogenesis assay and the MPTP protection assay. By contrast P7C3 S8 was devoid of activity in both assays. We also compared the efficacy of members of a new enantiomeric pair in these assays. P7C3 S40 and P7C3 S41 differ from P7C3 by replacing the aniline NH with an oxygen linker . P7C3S40 and P7C3S41 are the R and S single enantiomers respectively and shows that neuroprotective activity in both assays resides exclusively in the S enantiomer. P7C3 S54 differs from P7C3 mainly by the addition of a methyl group to the central carbon of the propyl linker and additionally has an OMe group on the aniline ring . This analog was observed to retain neuroprotective activity in both assays. P7C3 S165 differs from P7C3 by replacing the aniline and carbinol fragments with a carboxylic acid a change that dramatically increases polarity . Encouragingly neuroprotection was observed in both assays .

Finally P7C3 S184 differs from P7C3 by replacing the bromines on the carbazole with chlorines and by replacing the aniline with a naphthyl amine . This molecule was inactive in both in vivo assays. P7C3 S184 has been reported as a 3 secretase BACE1 inhibitor Asso V. et al. 2008 alpha naphthylaminopropan 2 ol derivatives as BACE1 inhibitors. 3 1530 1534 . BACE1 is an aspartate proteolytic enzyme that catalyzes the formation of A peptide from amyloid precursor protein which has been proposed as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer s disease. By analyzing BACE1 inhibition with multiple molecules in our P7C3 series we have found no correlation between neuroprotective efficacy in our in vivo models and BACE1 inhibition data not shown .

The results of a target agnostic unbiased screen of 1 000 chemically diverse drug like compounds led to the identification of an aminopropyl carbazole endowed with the capacity to enhance adult neurogenesis. This compound designated P7C3 was found to act by blocking the death of newborn neurons in the dentate gyms of adult mice. Here we have sought to answer a simple question. If P7C3 is capable of preventing the death of newborn neurons during hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice this compound may also prevent death of existing neurons in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. More specifically we have administered MPTP to mice as a means of killing dopamine neurons. Fully 24 hours after removal of the toxin mice were treated with varying doses of one of three compounds for a period of three weeks. Thereafter mice were sacrificed and assayed for evidence of neuroprotective efficacy. As a second related animal model of neuron death worms were co treated with MPP and varying doses of P7C3 P7C3A20 and Dimebon as a means of assessing neuroprotective activity.

The three compounds chosen for extensive testing P7C3 its structurally related analog P7C3A20 and Dimebon were selected by virtue of the knowledge that they demonstrate distinct pro neurogenic activities. Among dozens of chemical analogs of P7C3 evaluated in the study first reporting this category of pro neurogenic compounds P7C3A20 displayed the highest potency and ceiling of pro neurogenic efficacy. In addition to the P7C3 and P7C3A20 chemicals we included Dimebon in the present study for two reasons. First even though P7C3 and Dimebon both contain three ring heterocycles Dimebon was found to display significantly diminished levels of potency and efficacy relative to P7C3 in our original study. Its pro neurogenic activity in the hippocampus of adult mice was observed only at relatively high doses and its ceiling of efficacy was clearly diminished relative to both P7C3 and P7C3A20. Likewise when tested for its ability to protect mitochondrial membrane integrity following exposure of cultured cells to a calcium ionophore Dimebon exhibited a protective potency between 100 and 1 000 fold lower than P7C3. Second Dimebon has been the subject of extensive clinical studies in both Alzheimer s disease and Huntington s disease. Despite early indications of efficacy in a phase 2 trial for Alzheimer s disease Doody R. S. et al. 2008 Effect of Dimebon on cognition activities of daily living behaviour and global function in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer s disease a randomised double blind placebo controlled study. 372 207 215 Dimebon failed in two independent phase 3 trials. By testing the properties of these three compounds in the present study of neuroprotective efficacy one having a very favorable efficacy profile as a pro neurogenic chemical P7C3A20 another having an intermediate efficacy profile P7C3 and a third having a far more modest efficacy profile Dimebon we sought to determine whether this hierarchy of activities might be preserved.

Encouragingly we observe that the A20 chemical variant of P7C3 displays significant neuroprotective efficacy in the MPTP model of dopaminergic neuron cell death in both rodents and worms. P7C3 the original compound discovered in the unbiased screen of 1 000 drug like chemicals for pro neurogenic activity displayed a lower level of neuroprotective activity in the mouse and worm models of dopaminergic neuron death than P7C3A20. By contrast Dimebon showed no protective activity in either assay. Although others have recently demonstrated that treatment of an Alzheimer s disease mouse model TgCRND8 mice with Dimebon improves memory and lowers accumulation of insoluble A 42 in the brain Dimebon appears too weakly active to afford neuroprotection in the models of Parkinson s disease that we have utilized.

We conclude that P7C3 and P7C3A20 protect dopaminergic neurons from MPTP induced cell death with a hierarchy of activity that is analogous to their abilities to protect newborn hippocampal neurons from cell death. If correct this interpretation offers the possibility that the relatively straightforward assay we have employed to monitor the activities of hundreds of chemical variants of P7C3 wherein adult neurogenesis is monitored over a seven day period following direct administration of test compounds into the adult mouse brain may represent a trusted surrogate for the refinement of drug like chemicals having broad neuroprotective activity. Indeed we hereby observe that an unbiased blinded analysis of nine analogs of P7C3 confirms this correlation. Five of these molecules showed significant efficacy in our standard in vivo hippocampal neurogenesis assay and these same five molecules also showed significant neuroprotective efficacy from MPTP mediated neurotoxicity to dopaminergic neurons. The four analogs that were inactive in the in vivo neurogenesis likewise showed no efficacy in the in vivo MPTP neurotoxicity assay. Taken together these results show that the relatively rapid evaluation of new molecules in the in vivo neurogenesis assay is predictive of their neuroprotective efficacy in the MPTP assay.

Ongoing SAR efforts with our P7C3 series of molecules using the in vivo neurogenesis assay appears to qualify as a rapid and accurate way to guide the refinement of this series of molecules into a neuroprotective drug for Parkinson s disease. In this context several of the analogs shown in represent potential improvements to P7C3. We have been primarily concerned with the presence of an aniline ring as this functionality can be associated with toxicity. Encouragingly three of the analogs P7C3S7 S41 and S165 lack aniline rings and display potency equal to or greater than P7C3 in both in vivo assays. We further note that P7C3 was originally identified as a racemic mixture and that racemic mixtures may require additional characterization for clinical development. P7C3S41 and P7C3S165 address this limitation because the former is a single enantiomer while the latter lacks stereochemistry altogether. Finally we have sought to reduce the polarity and molecular weight of these neuroprotective compounds. P7C3S165 is significantly lighter than P7C3 mw 383 Da vs 474 Da for P7C3 and by virtue of the carboxylic acid substantially more polar. These results suggest that it should be possible to further improve the physical properties of these analogs in efforts to optimize derivatives suitable for clinical testing.

Consistent with the interpretation that the activity of P7C3 analogs in the in vivo neurogenesis assay correlates with neuroprotective efficacy in mature neurons are the results of assays of P7C3 P7C3A20 and Dimebon in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this model using mice expressing a high level of a human transgene encoding a mutated variant of the gene encoding human Cu Zn superoxide dismutase we have observed the same hierarchy of activities wherein P7C3A20 is active P7C3 is intermediately active and Dimebon is inactive. If the more active variants of this class of compounds indeed possess neuroprotective properties and if we can rely on the relatively rapid in vivo assay of enhanced neurogenesis in order to rank order compounds for structure activity relationship SAR scoring it should be possible to optimize variants with the goal of selecting an appropriately qualified chemical to advance for human testing. To date no safely tolerated neuroprotective chemical is available for the treatment of any of a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Based upon the observations reported herein we propose that a properly optimized variant of the P7C3 class of pro neurogenic neuroprotective chemicals may offer promise for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.

Day Survival Assay of Newborn Hippocampal Neurons Because both social activity and voluntary exercise enhance hippocampal neurogenesis mice were individually housed without access to running wheels throughout the entire procedure beginning one week prior to bromodeoxyuridine BrdU Sigma Aldrich labeling of newborn cells. Throughout the study mice had ad libitum access to food and water. BrdU was injected intraperitoneally at 150 mg kg i.p. and 24 hours later administration of test compounds or vehicle was initiated. P7C3 and P7C3A20 were dissolved in 5 dextrose pH 7.0 with 2.5 DMSO and 10 Cremaphor EL Sigma C5135 . Dimebon was dissolved in normal saline. Compounds were compared to their respective controls and were tested at 2.5 5 10 and 20 mg kg twice daily i.p. for 30 days. The injection site was alternated between right and left sides. Each group consisted of six 12 week old adult male C57 Bl 6 mice. Animals were monitored daily for general health and weight loss. Cage changes were performed per routine scheduling. After 30 days of compound administration mice were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with 4 paraformaldehyde at pH 7.4 and their brains were processed for immunohistochemical detection of incorporated BrdU in the dentate gyms. Dissected brains were immersed in 4 paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 degrees Celsius then cryoprotected in sucrose before being sectioned with a Leica SM2000R sliding microtome coronally into 40 M thick free floating sections. Unmasking of BrdU antigen was achieved through incubating tissue sections for two hours in 50 formamide 2 SSC at 65 degrees Celsius followed by five minute wash in 2 SSC and subsequent incubation for thirty minutes in 2M HCl at 37 degrees Celsius. Sections were processed for immunohistochemical staining with mouse monoclonal anti BrdU 1 100 Roche . Diaminobenzidine was used as a chromagen and tissue was counter stained with hematoxylin to aid in visualization of the neuroanatomy. Images were analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse 90i motorized research microscope with Plan Apo lenses coupled with Metamorph Image Acquisition software Nikon . Quantification of all staining was done blind to treatment group. The number of BrdU cells in the entire dentate gyrus was quantified by counting BrdU cells within the dentate gyrus in every fifth section throughout the entire hippocampus and then normalizing for dentate gyms volume. P7C3 S7 S8 S40 S41 S54 S165 and A20 were synthesized as previously described. P7C3 S184 was synthesized as previously described by Asso et al. 2008 alpha naphthylaminopropan 2 ol derivatives as BACE1 inhibitors. 3 1530 1534.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis C57BL 6 mice treated with MPTP and then dosed IP with compound for 21 days were utilized for pharmacokinetic PK analysis of total P7C3 P7C3A20 and Dimebon levels in plasma and brain. In a separate set of experiments designed to test the ability of new P7C3 analogs to cross the blood brain barrier C57BL 6 mice were dosed IP a single time with compounds at 10 mg kg. P7C3 P7C3A20 and Dimebon were formulated for administration as described above. Analogs were formulated in 5 Dextrose pH 7.4 containing 5 DMSO and 10 Cremophor EL with the exception of P7C3 S8 which required 10 DMSO and 20 Cremophor EL dissolved in 5 Dextrose for delivery. Six hours after the final compound dose animals were given an inhalation overdose of COand whole blood and brain collected. Plasma was prepared from blood and was stored along with the brain tissue at 80 C. until analysis. Brain homogenates were prepared by homogenizing the tissues in a 3 fold volume of PBS. Total brain homogenate volume was estimated as volume of PBS added plus volume of brain in mL. One hundred mL of either plasma or brain homogenate was processed by addition of a two or four fold excess of methanol or acetonitrile containing formic acid and an internal standard IS N benzylbenzamide Sigma Aldrich lot 02914LH to precipitate plasma or tissue protein and release bound drug. The final formic acid concentration was 0.1 and the final IS concentration was 25 ng ml. Extraction conditions were optimized prior to PK analysis for efficient and reproducible recovery over a three log range of concentrations. The samples were vortexed 15 sec incubated at room temp for 10 and spun 2 16 100 g in a standard refrigerated microcentrifuge. The supernatant was then analyzed by LC MS MS. Standard curves were prepared by addition of the appropriate compound to plasma or brain homogenate. A value of 3 above the signal obtained in the blank plasma or brain homogenate was designated the limit of detection LOD . The limit of quantitation LOQ was defined as the lowest concentration at which back calculation yielded a concentration within 20 of the theoretical value and above the LOD signal. LOQ values for plasma and brain ranged from 0.5 to 500 ng ml but were well below the concentrations measured at 6 hours for all of the compounds. Compound levels were monitored by LC MS MS using an AB Sciex Framingham Mass. 3200 Qtrap mass spectrometer coupled to a Shimadzu Columbia Md. Prominence LC. The compounds were detected with the mass spectrometer in MRM multiple reaction monitoring mode by following the precursor to fragment ion transition 474.9 337.8 for P7C3 pos. mode M H 507.0 204.1 for P7C3A20 pos. mode M H 320.3 277.3 for Dimebon pos. mode M H 381.9 80.7 for P7C3 S165 neg. mode M H 519.0 338.0 for P7C3 S54 pos. mode M H 536.0 536.0 redundant MRM for P7C3 S7 neg mode M HCOO 520.0 520.0 for P7C3 S41 neg mode M HCOO 520. 1 520.1 for P7C3 S40 neg mode M HCOO 477. 1 138.2 for P7C3 S8 pos. mode M H 478.0 153.2 for P7C3 S25 pos. mode M H and 435.2 248.2 for P7C3 S184 pos. mode M H . The IS N benzylbenzamide was monitored using a 212.1 91.1 transition pos. mode M H . An Agilent Santa Clara Calif. XDB C18 column 50 4.6 mm 5 micron packing was used for chromatography with the following conditions Buffer A dH20 0.1 formic acid Buffer B methanol 0.1 formic acid 0 1. 5 min 0 B 1.5 2.5 min gradient to 100 B 2.5 3.5 min 100 B 3.5 to 3.6 min gradient to 0 B 3.6 to 4.5 min 0 B. Chromatography conditions were identical for all compounds except the initial and final concentration of Buffer B which was set to 0 for P7C3 and P7C3A20 and 3 for Dimebon and all of the other P7C3 analogs.

Maintenance of were grown at 20 degrees Celsius on nematode growth medium NGM agar in 60 mm Petri plates according to standard protocols. Worms were fed the nutrient rich strain HB101.

Assessment of MPTP Mediated Neurotoxicity to Murine SNc Neurons 15 adult male C57Bl 6 mice were individually housed for one week and then injected daily for 5 days with 30 mg kg day i.p. free base MPTP Sigma . On day 6 24 hours after receiving the fifth and final dose of MPTP daily treatment with P7C3 P7C3A20 Dimebon or vehicle was initiated. Mice were housed in disposable caging and protective gear and precautions were implemented for handling MPTP in accordance with UT Southwestern Medical Center policy. Dose response studies were conducted in which mice received twice daily doses of each compound or vehicle by intraperitoneal injection for the following 21 days after which mice were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with 4 paraformaldehyde. Brains were dissected fixed overnight in 4 paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected in sucrose for freezing by standard procedures. Frozen brains were sectioned through the striatum and SNc at 30 uM intervals and every fourth section spaced 120 M apart was stained with antibodies directed against tyrosine hydroxylase TH Abcam rabbit anti TH 1 2500 . Diaminobenzidine was used as a chromagen and tissue was counter stained with hematoxylin to aid in visualization of the neuroanatomy. Images were analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse 90i motorized research microscope with Plan Apo lenses coupled with Metamorph Image Acquisition software Nikon . TH neurons were counted with Image J software NIH in every section by 2 blinded investigators and results were averaged and multiplied by the sectioning interval to determine the total number of TH neurons per SNc.

Assessment of MPP Dopaminergic Neuron Toxicity in Synchronized L1 larvae were plated into each well of a 12 well plate approximately 400 larvae per well containing PBS Vehicle or compounds with or without 5 mM MPP iodide Sigma freshly diluted in PBS. DMSO was used as vehicle VEH and the concentration in treatment groups was maintained below 1 . The assay solution 500 ml was incubated for 40 hrs at 20 degrees Celsius. The worms were then washed in dHO and supernatant was aspirated. To examine dopaminergic neuron toxicity worms were anesthetized 0.1 tricaine 0.01 tetramizole for 5 min and then transferred to microscope slides and coverslipped. Pictures were taken at 40 magnification AMG Evos fl microscope . Each experiment was conducted in triplicate with 10 20 worms counted per condition. For quantification investigators were blind to treatment condition. Quantification was done by observing all four cephalic sensilla CEP dendrites per standard protocol. Briefly GFP fluorescence was visualized from the nerve ring to the tip of the nose and if any portion of a dendrite was absent then it was counted as being degenerated.

Locomotion Analysis of A video based assay was used to assess the swim speed distance traveled and length of worms. After exposure to MPP for 32 hrs worms were washed resuspended in M9 buffer 500 ul and transferred to microscope slides. A 10 second movie was recorded at 4 magnification using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope. Each movie consisted of 160 frames and the distance traveled by the head of each worm was manually tracked in each frame using Imera software. This software was also used to measure the length of the worm body. The ratio of movement distance to body length was used as a movement index and defined as locomotion per standard protocols.

O. Neuroprotective Efficacy of Aminopropyl Carbazoles in a Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS also known as Lou Gehrig s disease is a relatively rare adult onset rapidly progressive and fatal disease that involves degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons Tandan R Bradley W. G. 1985 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Part 1. Clinical features pathology and ethical issues in management. 18 271 280 . This disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body and patients with ALS ultimately lose all voluntary movement. The earliest parts of the body affected in ALS reflect those motor neurons that are damaged first. Regardless of the region of onset however muscle weakness and atrophy invariably spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Although disease progression varies between individuals most patients are eventually unable to stand or walk get in or out of bed on their own or use their hands and arms. Difficulty with chewing swallowing and breathing leads to progressive weight loss and increased risk of choking and aspiration pneumonia. Towards the end stages of disease as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles weaken most patients require ventilator support. Individuals with ALS most commonly die of respiratory failure or pneumonia within 2 5 years of diagnosis. There are no current treatments for ALS.

Approximately 20 of inherited cases of ALS and 3 of sporadic cases are associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the SOD1 gene on chromosome 21 and about 150 different mutations dispersed throughout the gene have been identified thus far. SOD1 encodes cytosolic Cu Zn superoxide dismutase an antioxidant enzyme that protects cells by converting superoxide a toxic free radical generated through normal metabolic activity of mitochondria to hydrogen peroxide. Unchecked free radicals damage both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA as well as proteins within cells. In ALS linked to mutations in SOD1 cytotoxicity of motor neurons appears to result from a gain of toxic SOD1 function rather than from loss of dismutase activity. Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying toxicity are unclear mutation induced conformational changes in SOD1 lead to misfolding and subsequent aggregation of mutant SOD1 in cell bodies and axons. Aggregate accumulation of mutant SOD1 is thought to disrupt cellular functions and precipitate neuron death by damaging mitochondria proteasomes protein folding chaperones or other proteins.

Transgenic animal models of mutant SOD1 such as G93A SOD1 mutant mice are currently used for research into the pathogenic mechanisms thought to broadly underlie ALS. Mice hemizygous for the G93A SOD1 transgene express 18 2.6 copies of a form of SOD1 found in some patients with inherited ALS a substitution of glycine to alanine at codon 93 . This was the first mutant form of SOD1 to be expressed in mice and is the most widely used and well characterized mouse model of ALS. Superoxide dismutase activity in these mice is intact and the pathogenic effect of the mutant transgene appears to be gain of function as is thought to occur in human patients. Death of motor neurons in these mice occurs in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and is associated with paralysis and muscle atrophy. Around 100 days of age G93A SOD1 mice characteristically experience the onset of paralysis in one or more limbs due to loss of spinal cord motor neurons. Paralysis spreads rapidly throughout the body culminating in death of 50 of the mice within seven weeks of disease onset.

We have previously reported the identification of a proneurogenic neuroprotective aminopropyl carbazole P7C3 discovered through a target agnostic in vivo screen of postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis Pieper et al. 2010 Discovery of a Proneurogenic Neuroprotective Chemical. 142 39 51 . Prolonged administration of P7C3 to mice suffering from pathologically high levels of neuronal apoptosis in the dentate gyrus safely restored hippocampal structure and function with no observable physiologic side effects. Furthermore extended administration of P7C3 to aged rats impeded hippocampal cell death and preserved cognitive ability as a function of terminal aging.

We have synthesized and characterized a variant of P7C3 known as P7C3A20 which has greater potency and pro neurogenic efficacy than the parent compound. P7C3A20 differs structurally by replacement of the hydroxyl group at the chiral center of the linker with a fluorine and the addition of a methoxy group to the aniline ring. P7C3A20 also displays a more favorable toxicity profile than P7C3 with no hERG channel binding histamine receptor binding or toxicity to HeLa cells. We have also found that Dimebon an antihistaminergic drug that is chemically related to P7C3 and reported to have anti apoptotic and mitochondrial protective properties displays modest efficacy in the same biologic assays employed to discover and characterize P7C3 and P7C3A20. However it does so with substantially less potency and ceiling of efficacy CoE .

Armed with three related chemicals one having very high pro neurogenic activity P7C3A20 one having intermediate activity P7C3 and one having only modest activity Dimebon we initiated efficacy studies in two animal models of neurodegenerative disease. We report above evidence of significant neuroprotective activity of P7C3A20 in a rodent model of Parkinson s disease PD . P7C3 exhibited intermediate activity in the PD animal model and Dimebon showed no evidence of efficacy. The correlative activities of chemicals tested in the neurogenesis and PD assays were extended to eight additional analogs of P7C3. In every case derivatives of P7C3 that were active in the neurogenesis assay were also active in the animal model of PD and inactive variants were inactive in both assays.

Here we have employed the same approach to score the activities of P7C3A20 P7C3 and Dimebon in a model of neuron death outside of the brain. To address this question we utilized G93A SOD1 mutant mice a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS characterized by spinal motor neuron death associated with decreased motor functioning. As was observed for the rodent model of PD we hereby report robust activity of P7C3A20 in the G93A SOD1 mouse model of ALS intermediate activity for P7C3 and no activity for Dimebon.

As an initial test of efficacy in this disease model we intraperitoneally administered P7C3 to female G93A SOD1 transgenic mice using a treatment paradigm of 20 mg kg day P7C3 with vehicle administered to siblings starting at 40 days of age. This treatment scheme was selected based on standard protocols for initial proof of concept screens in G93A SOD1 mutant mice. To control for transgene copy number mice were sibling matched between treatment groups as per standard protocol and quantitative PCR was performed to ensure that the copy number was maintained within the normal range. After initiation of P7C3 or vehicle treatment date of onset of illness was determined by peak weight and initial progression of disease was defined as the day at which mice fell to 10 below their maximum weight. Mice were also assessed daily by a standard measure of neurological severity score ranging from 0 4 with a higher number reflecting greater neurologic impairment. In addition to weight loss a score of 2 or greater for two consecutive days was also employed as an indication of disease progression.

P7C3 treatment slowed disease progression in G93A SOD1 mice as indicated by delaying the time point at which mice dropped to 10 below their maximum weight. Treatment with P7C3 also delayed the age at which G93A SOD1 mice advanced to a neurological severity score of 2. Furthermore P7C3 treatment improved performance in the accelerating rotarod task as a function of disease progression indicating a slowing of progression of motor impairment. This effect of slowing disease progression did not translate into increased survival of the animals which is consistent with other interventions that have ameliorated disease symptoms in rodent models of ALS without improving survival.

Comparison of the Efficacy of Administration of P7C3A20 P7C3 and Dimebon at Disease Onset for Blocking Spinal Motor Neuron Cell Death in G93A SOD1 Mutant Mice.

Based on the promising results of early day 40 administration of P7C3 to G93A SOD1 mutant mice we next sought to determine whether P7C3A20 P7C3 or Dimebon could protect ventral horn spinal motor neurons when administered at the expected time of disease onset day 80 . We initiated administration of either P7C3 P7C3A20 or Dimebon each at a dose of 20 mg kg day and analyzed motor neuron cell survival by staining lumbar spinal sections for choline acetyltransferase ChAT . ChAT the enzyme that synthesizes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine serves as a marker for spinal cord motor neurons. All sections were counted blind to treatment group in order to quantify motor neuron survival and five mice for each treatment group were analyzed at 90 100 110 and 120 days. Each treatment group was compared to its own sibling matched group that received the corresponding vehicle.

As shown in the wild type bar represents the average number of spinal motor neurons in 110 day old vehicle treated wild type littermate mice. Because survival of motor neurons did not differ between the various vehicle treatment groups within any given time point the results were combined for ease of presentation. For animals expressing the G93A SOD1 transgene the number of spinal cord motor neurons steadily declined between days 90 and 120 . At every time point treatment with P7C3A20 provided significant protection from spinal motor neuron cell death . Treatment with Dimebon revealed a rate of motor neuron loss indistinguishable from vehicle treatment groups. P7C3 by contrast provided intermediate protection on days 100 p 0.048 and 110 p 0.01 . By the time mice reached 120 days of age however the P7C3 treated group showed the same degree of motor neuron cell loss as vehicle and Dimebon treated groups. Representative immunohistological staining of spinal cord sections is shown in from each of the five mice examined on day 110. Taken together these results demonstrate that daily administration of P7C3A20 starting at disease onset effectively blocks spinal motor neuron cell death in G93A SOD1 mutant mice. P7C3 was active by these measures but to a lesser extent than P7C3A20 whereas Dimebon was completely devoid of neuroprotective activity.

Having observed evidence of compound mediated protection of spinal cord motor neurons we next sought to determine whether motor performance might also be protected in these mice. Motor performance was monitored by the accelerating rotarod task standardly employed for evaluation of rodent models of ALS. We again initiated administration of P7C3 P7C3A20 or Dimebon on day 80 at 20 mg kg day starting with no less than 20 mice per treatment group. Each animal in each group had its own sibling matched vehicle control and testing was conducted blind to treatment group. Rotarod training was initiated on day 50 for 2 days and repeated weekly testing was conducted every 7 days thereafter. Each mouse was subjected to four trials of 600 seconds each with a 20 minute recovery break between each trial. The latency time to fall was averaged across all 4 trials.

As shown in performance in all treatment groups was equal at weeks 10 and 11. Treatment with the test compounds was initiated midway between weeks 11 and 12 on day 80 and at week 12 there were no significant differences between groups. By week 13 however P7C3A20 treated mice showed significantly better performance p 0.019 than the corresponding vehicle treatment group. In subsequent weeks both P7C3 and Dimebon as well as all vehicle groups continued to decline at a steady pace in performance in this task with P7C3A20 treated mice performing significantly better at each time point. Rotarod data were not collected beyond week 16 because too few animals survived to this time point for valid comparison across groups.

As noted with early initiation of administration day 40 of P7C3 this intervention improved rotarod performance but did not extend survival of the mice. Also despite improvement in rotarod performance in P7C3A20 treated mice when daily treatment was initiated on day 80 we did not observe any delay in other measures of disease progression neurological score or weight loss . This observation may reflect the increased challenge for efficacy associated with administering compounds at the time of disease onset. Taken together our results show that administration at the time of disease onset of the most potent member of the P7C3 series of neuroprotective drugs P7C3A20 significantly improves performance of G93A SOD1 mice in the accelerating rotarod test. Both P7C3 and Dimebon were insufficiently active to preserve motor function in the accelerating rotarod task at 20 mg kg day when administration was initiated at the time of disease onset.

Comparison of the Efficacy of Administration of P7C3A20 P7C3 and Dimebon at Disease Onset for Preserving Walking Gait in G93A SOD1 Mutant Mice.

Analysis of walking gait offers a second means of assessing motor limb strength and coordination in rodent models of ALS. We conducted this analysis in the same mice used for the accelerating rotarod task at three time points 90 118 and 132 days. Briefly the front paws of each test mouse were dipped in orange tempera paint and the back paws in blue tempera paint. Mice were then directed into a bisected PVC tube placed on top of artists easel paper such that the mouse was prompted to walk through the tunnel for a distance of 30 inches leaving a trail of pawprints on the paper. Key parameters of the pawprints were then manually measured as described in Methods. These parameters included front and back stride length front and back width and front to back paw distance .

Twenty total measurements 10 on each side for each parameter were recorded per mouse and 20 mice per group were evaluated at the 90 and 118 day time points. All measurements were conducted blind to treatment group. Front and back widths showed no difference as a function of treatment group or disease progression until day 132 at which point P7C3A20 treatment was observed to preserve back width. Three of the measured parameters back stride back front distance and front stride showed significant improvement as a function of treatment with P7C3A20 earlier in the disease process whereas none of these parameters in the walking gait analysis at 20 mg kg day were significantly improved by treatment with P7C3 or Dimebon .

Back stride is defined as the distance between each successive back paw print on a single side and one of the first features of disease in G93ASOD1 mutant mice is the onset of hind limb muscle weakness. As the disease progresses mice are unable to move their hind limbs as much with each step and back stride distance decreases. This was evident on day 118 in which P7C3 Dimebon and all vehicle treatment groups showed reduced back stride length . Back stride measure was significantly p 0.0016 preserved to a near normal level in P7C3A20 treated mice . Front stride is analogously defined as the distance between each successive front paw print on a single side and as the disease progresses this measure also shortens as a consequence of the reduced hind limb stride that prevents the mouse from moving as great a distance with each step. Compromised front stride length thus confirms the deficit associated with back stride length and we observed that on day 118 this measure was indeed reduced in P7C3 Dimebon and all vehicle treatment groups yet preserved to almost normal levels in P7C3A20 treated mice .

On day 132 there were insufficient numbers of mice in the P7C3 VEH and Dimebon VEH groups that could participate in the task due to complete paralysis of one or more limbs in the majority of the original test group. In the A20 VEH group however there were still ten P7C3A20 mice that were able to walk across the paper. Here we observed that improvements in back stride and front stride were preserved but there was no longer a difference in back front distance. Back front distance is defined as the distance between a back pawprint and the front pawprint on the same side. Early on as the disease progresses in this animal model of ALS the back front distance steadily increases because the front limbs are able to extend normally but the hindlimbs are not strong enough to formulate proper steps that should result in the back paw landing on top of the front paw print. It is evident in that as assayed on day 118 treatment with P7C3A20 attenuated this increase in back front distance. On day 132 however the differences between VEH and P7CA20 treated mice in back front distance were lost. At this stage the disease was sufficiently advanced that this measure reflects the additional complication of front limb weakness such that the mice were unable to extend their front limbs normally. As a result the back front distance declined and there were no differences between P7C3A20 and its sibling matched vehicle group. Taken together our results of gait analysis demonstrate that treatment with P7C3A20 at the time of disease onset helps preserve walking gait in the G93A SOD1 mouse model of ALS.

LC MS MS quantification of brain and blood levels of P7C3 P7C3A20 and Dimebon confirmed that all three compounds were able to enter both the brain and spinal cord . Notably P7C3A20 displayed significantly greater protective efficacy compared to the other two compounds despite the fact that P7C3A20 accumulated in spinal cord tissue at less than one twentieth the concentration of P7C3. Dimebon which displayed no protective efficacy in G93A SOD1 mice showed comparable levels of spinal cord accumulation to P7C3A20. These results parallel findings observed in evaluation of the neuroprotective efficacy of these same three compounds in MPTP treated mice.

The results of an unbiased screen of 1 000 chemically diverse drug like compounds led to the identification of an aminopropyl carbazole endowed with the capacity to enhance adult neurogenesis. This compound designated P7C3 was found to act by blocking the death of newborn neurons in the dentate gyms of adult mice. We have also found that P7C3 P73A20 and other active analogs protect dopamingergic neurons of the substantia nigra from MPTP induced neurotoxicity. Here we have sought to determine whether this class of pro neurogenic compounds might also block nerve cell death outside of the brain.

We selected P7C3 P7C3A20 and Dimebon for testing because they display distinct levels of pro neurogenic neuroprotective activity when assayed for protection from apoptotic cell death of either newborn hippocampal neurons or following MPTP toxicity to mature dopaminergic neurons. P7C3A20 displays the highest potency and ceiling of efficacy amongst these three molecules. We evaluated Dimebon because of extensive studies in human clinical trials and its relative similarity in chemical structure to P7C3. When tested for its ability to protect mitochondrial membrane integrity following exposure of cultured cells to a calcium ionophore Dimebon exhibited a protective potency between 100 and 1 000 fold lower than P7C3. Similarly modest activity was observed when Dimebon was assayed in our standard model of hippocampal neurogenesis. The reduced potency and efficacy of Dimebon has been further revealed in its inability to protect dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra from MPTP toxicity. Finally Dimebon has been extensively studied in human clinical trials of both Alzheimer s disease and Huntington s disease. Although early indications in a phase 2 trial suggested that Dimebon might be efficacious for Alzheimer s disease the drug failed in two independent phase 3 trials. By testing the properties of these three related compounds in the present study of protective efficacy in an animal model of ALS we sought to determine whether the hierarchy of activities amongst these three molecules might be preserved.

Encouragingly we observe that P7C3A20 significantly blocks death of spinal motor neurons in the G93A SOD1 mouse model of ALS. Importantly this protective effect is observed when administration of the compound is initiated at the time of disease onset and it correlates with preservation of muscle strength and coordination as assessed through the accelerating rotarod test and analysis of walking gait. P7C3 offered intermediate protection from cell death when administered at the time of disease onset. Administration of P7C3 for a prolonged period of time by initiating treatment much earlier day 40 did preserve motor function as assayed by the accelerating rotarod task. Dimebon offered no protection in any of these measures. Although efficacy of Dimebon in an animal model of Alzheimer s disease TGCRND8 mice has recently been reported this drug appears too weakly active to afford any protection in the G93A SOD1 mutant mouse model of ALS.

We conclude that P7C3A20 and P7C3 display a hierarchy of activities analogous to their abilities to protect newborn hippocampal neurons from cell death to block MPTP mediated killing of mature dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and to protect spinal motor neurons from dying in G93A SOD1 mutant mice. These collective observations give evidence that the relatively straightforward assay of monitoring adult hippocampal neurogenesis over a seven day period following direct administration of new analogs of P7C3 into the adult mouse brain may represent a trusted surrogate for the refinement of drug like chemicals having neuroprotective activity. Over the past two years we have conducted a comprehensive structure activity relationship SAR study in order to improve the chemical scaffold of the P7C3 series of molecules. To date we have synthesized over 250 analogs of P7C3 all of which have been evaluated in the in vivo hippocampal neurogenesis assay. Our goal in these efforts to foster the discovery of a neuroprotective drug is to maximize neuroprotective efficacy and alleviate real or perceived vulnerabilities in the chemical structures. These efforts include but are not limited to eliminating the carbazole bromines eliminating the aniline ring increasing biologic activity decreasing lipophilicity eliminating any toxicities including hERG channel binding increasing solubility and reducing molecular weight. By use of the in vivo hippocampal neurogenesis assay these ongoing SAR efforts with P7C3 analogs may offer an effective way to guide optimization of this series of molecules towards a neuroprotective drug candidate.

No safely tolerated neuroprotective chemical is available for the treatment of any form of neurodegenerative disease including Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Based upon the observations reported herein we propose that a properly optimized variant of the P7C3 class of pro neurogenic neuroprotective chemicals may represent a viable candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.

Analysis of motor neuron survival in the spinal cord After transcardial perfusion with 4 paraformaldehyde PFA lumbar spinal cord was dissected and post fixed overnight in 4 PFA cryoprotected in 30 sucrose at 4 degrees Celsius and then embedded in OCT and sectioned on a Thermo Fisher cryostat HM550 at 30 M thickness. Every seventh section was immunohistochemically stained with goat anti choline acetyltransferase ChAT Millipore . Briefly sections were incubated in 1 HOfor 45 minutes at room temperature rinsed in tris buffered saline TBS treated with 0.1 Triton TBS and then blocked for 60 minutes in 3 BSA 5 donkey serum 0.3 triton 100 in TBS. Sections were then incubated in goat anti ChAT 1 100 in the same blocking solution overnight at 4 degrees Celsius. The next day sections were rinsed in TBS and incubated with donkey anti goat biotin 1 200 Jackson Immune . Signal was amplified with an ABC kit from Vector Labs and diaminobenzidine was used as a chromagen. Immunostained tissue was then photographed at 4 using a Nikon Eclipse 90i motorized microscope and the number of ChAT positive neurons was counted in a blinded manner by two investigators followed by normalization for ventral horn volume.

Rotarod Beginning on day 50 mice were trained on the accelerating rotarod using Colombia Instruments Rotamex 5. Training consisted of mice being placed on a rotarod moving at 5 rpm for 300 seconds. Mice were trained to stay on the rotarod for the entire 300 seconds. If a mouse fell it was placed back on the rotarod and the 300 second trial was started again. Training took place on two consecutive days. On day 52 mice ran their first full rotarod test as described in Current Protocols for Neuroscience. The rotarod began at 4 rpm and accelerated to 40 rpm over 600 seconds increasing by 1.25 rpm every 20 seconds. The time to fall was automatically recorded. Each run was separated by 20 minutes to allow the mice to rest and each mouse participated in 4 runs. Mice were run every seven days until the time at which they were unable to stay on the rotarod for more than 10 seconds for 3 trials.

Pawprint Analysis Five measurements were taken front and back stride front and back width and front to back distance as described in Current Protocols for Neuroscience. 20 total measures were taken for each measurement. Front and back stride were collected as a straight line from paw print to the following paw print. Front to back distance was collected as a straight line from back paw print to corresponding front paw print. Correspondence was based on closest front footprint. Width from paw print was measured by drawing a line at a 90 degree angle from the line connecting the stride previous and the paw being analyzed. The distance was recorded as length of line from paw to the stride line opposite the paw print. Mice attaining a score of three were eliminated from analysis as measurements could not be taken for a foot not being used in forward motion.

Pawprints were recorded at 90 118 and 132 days of age. A 6 inch by 42 inch PVC pipe cut in half lengthwise was placed on top of a piece of easel paper 27 30 . Each mouse had paws covered in non toxic tempera paint orange front blue back and was placed at one end of the pipe. The mouse ran quickly to the other end of the pipe when released and the procedure was repeated until 10 clear back and front prints were made for each side while the subject was running. Pawprints were scanned using a hand scanner and then visualized for measurement in Nikon Metamorph software. Measurements were based on established guidelines.

Neurological Scoring Neurological score was performed every day starting with compound treatment at 80 days and was determined as follows 0 full extension of hind legs away from lateral midline when the test mouse was suspended by its tail and could hold this for 2 seconds suspended 2 3 times 1 collapse or partial collapse of leg extension towards lateral midline weakness or trembling of hind legs during tail suspension 2 toes curl under at least twice during walking of 12 inches or any part of foot drags along cage bottom table 3 rigid paralysis or minimal joint movement foot not being used for forward motion and 4 mouse cannot right itself within 30 seconds from either side. Upon reaching a score of 2 animals were given a fresh Petri dish with wet food in the dish daily. When mice achieved a score of 4 for two consecutive days they were euthanized.

Weight Data Mice were weighed daily starting on the day of initiation of compound administration in order to assess disease progression and readjust compound dosage. A digital balance with a step of 0.01 g was used and mice were placed in a small plastic container on the scale when weighed. Weight was taken between 11 am and 1 pm every day.

Major depression remains insufficiently treated in our society. To facilitate the development of more efficacious antidepressant agents the neurobiology underlying the antidepressant actions of the gut hormone ghrelin have been investigated. In mice endogenous ghrelin elevation protects against development of severe depressive like behavior following chronic social defeat stress CSDS and also produces an antidepressant like response to caloric restriction. It is now shown that ghrelin receptor Ghsr null mice suffer from marked impairments in hippocampal neurogenesis after CSDS and after caloric restriction. Notably the neuroprotective compound P7C3 wields an antidepressant like effect in Ghsr null mice and the more potent analog P7C3 A20 additionally demonstrates antidepressant efficacy in wild type mice. Thus augmenting hippocampal neurogenesis with the P7C3 class of neuroprotective compounds may represent a new strategy for treating depression.

The orexigenic gut hormone ghrelin induces feeding by activating growth hormone secretagogue receptors Ghsr ghrelin receptor in the hypothalamus caudal brainstem and elsewhere in the central nervous system. Within the hippocampus and ventral tegmental area Ghsr mediates ghrelin s enhancement of reward related behaviors cue potentiated feeding hippocampal spine synaptic density and memory retention. Ghrelin additionally confers neuroprotective efficacy in models of kainic acid hippocampal toxicity spinal cord motor neuron excitotoxicity dopaminergic neuron toxicity and oxygen glucose deprivation in hypothalamic and cortical neurons. Notably ghrelin also exerts antidepressant efficacy in people and various rodent models. Ghsr polymorphism has been associated with major depression in humans and administration of ghrelin improves mood in some patients with major depression. In mice raising ghrelin levels either directly through acute injection or indirectly via caloric restriction elicits an antidepressant response in the forced swim test FST a common screening tool used in rodents to identify new candidate antidepressant drugs. Additionally sustained elevations of plasma ghrelin occur in mice exposed to CSDS which is a model of prolonged psychosocial stress that features aspects of major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder and Ghsr null mice exhibit more severe depressive like behavior after CSDS than wild type littermates. Psychosocial stress also leads to increased plasma ghrelin in humans. Thus stress associated activation of ghrelin signaling pathways may serve a protective function against depression.

The mechanism by which ghrelin confers antidepressant efficacy has previously eluded the field although clues in the literature point to involvement of the hippocampus. Several studies have correlated changes in hippocampal neurogenesis and cell survival in the dentate gyrus DG with regulation of depressive like behavior. Furthermore antidepressant drugs and environmental factors that elevate mood such as exercise environmental enrichment and social interaction increase hippocampal neurogenesis. By contrast negative regulators of neurogenesis and cell survival such as chronic stress old age drugs of abuse and social isolation are associated with depressed mood. Additionally ablation of neurogenesis decreases the efficacy of some antidepressant drugs in rodent models. It also has been reported that ghrelin potently stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis within the DG. In considering this evidence linking neurogenesis with depressive like behavior as well as the role of ghrelin in hippocampal neurogenesis and distribution of Ghsr expression in the hippocampus it is hypothesized that the antidepressant efficacy of ghrelin might be related to its proneurogenic effect. If so both Ghsr null mice and even wild type mice with intact ghrelin signaling may be protected from stress induced depression by therapeutic strategies that augment hippocampal neurogenesis.

Reported here are the results of experiments that utilized the P7C3 series of neuroprotective compounds and Ghsr null mice to test the hypotheses. More specifically the aim was to directly attribute the exaggerated impairment in hippocampal neurogenesis as a cause of the marked depressive like behavior in Ghsr null mice. Demonstrating whether the depressive like behavior so easily induced in Ghsr null mice by chronic stress due to their lack of responsiveness to the proneurogenic effects of stress induced ghrelin could be minimized by administration of P7C3 class of compounds with known neuroprotective efficacy would prove this cause and effect linkage. Indeed the P7C3 class of compounds were shown to block the impairments in hippocampal neurogenesis induced by stress and Ghsr deficiency. Regarding the behavioral effects of the P7C3 class an even more far reaching efficacy than had initially been expected was observed. Notably not only did P7C3 wield an antidepressant like effect in the highly sensitive Ghsr null mice but also the more potent P7C3 A20 analog additionally demonstrated antidepressant efficacy in wild type littermates. These observations prompted direct comparisons regarding proneurogenic efficacy between the P7C3 class of compounds and several marketed antidepressant agents. The P7C3 class of compounds was shown to elevate the magnitude of hippocampal neurogenesis with significantly greater efficacy than a wide spectrum of currently available antidepressant drugs representing the major classes currently prescribed to patients. More specifically in addition to P7C3 and P7C3 A20 only four out of fourteen marketed antidepressant medications that we tested significantly increased hippocampal neurogenesis. In particular the norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine and the tricyclic antidepressants clomipramine and desipramine increased hippocampal neurogenesis by about 49 52 75 and 102 over vehicle respectively. Of those only clomipramine and desipramine were statistically as effective at P7C3 and none was statistically as effective as the highly active P7C3 A20 molecule. The remaining antidepressant medications tested including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine citalopram fluoxetine and sertraline the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant mirtazapine the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine and the tricyclic antidepressants nortriptyline and imipramine did not affect the magnitude of neurogenesis in the assay utilized.

As a general conclusion the observations made herein regarding ghrelin s antidepressant like effects ghrelin receptor expression and action in the hippocampus and exacerbations in both depressive like behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis impairment in Ghsr null mice suggested that the P7C3 class of neuroprotective compounds similar to the naturally occurring proneurogenic hormone ghrelin might indeed have antidepressant actions that might be most obvious in the highly sensitive Ghsr null mouse model. Indeed it is demonstrated herein that the P7C3 class of neuroprotective compounds reduced depressive like behavior in mice by augmenting ghrelin induced hippocampal neurogenesis. Furthermore the direct comparison between the proneurogenic efficacies of the P7C3 class of compounds and several marketed antidepressant agents led to another unexpected discovery if augmentation of hippocampal neurogenesis is crucial for the manifestation of antidepressant efficacy of both endogenous substances such as ghrelin and exogenous compounds as the current studies confirm then the P7C3 class could potentially surpass the efficacy of currently prescribed antidepressant drugs.

The CSDS model of chronic psychosocial stress exposes male mice to repeated bouts of social subordination by an older and larger aggressor mouse for 5 min per day over 10 days. At the conclusion of this exposure the stressed mouse typically shows significantly reduced social interaction SI with a novel mouse mimicking stress induced social avoidance and depression in humans. When male Ghsr null mice were exposed to CSDS they spent significantly less time interacting with a novel mouse compared to wild type littermates consistent with previous reports. To determine whether this more severe depression phenotype correlated with effects on hippocampal neurogenesis brain tissue was harvested from both CSDS exposed and non CSDS exposed mice and performed immunohistochemistry for Ki67 a marker of proliferating cells in the DG subgranular zone SGZ where newborn neural precursor cells proliferate. The ventral posterior and dorsal anterior regions of the DG were separately analyzed due to evidence that the ventral DG specifically regulates mood while the dorsal DG is more involved in learning and memory. Whereas both wild type and Ghsr null mice displayed an equally significant reduction in the number of Ki67 cells after CSDS in the dorsal DG panel a CSDS exposure elicited a significantly greater reduction in Ki67 cells in the ventral DG of Ghsr null mice than in wild type littermates panels b f .

Because the vast majority of newborn hippocampal neural precursor cells in mice die by apoptosis and pharmacologically inhibiting apoptosis has been demonstrated to augment hippocampal neurogenesis it was tested whether apoptosis of newborn neural precursor cells might also be affected by CSDS. Therefore adjacent tissue sections were immunohistochemically stained for activated caspase 3 AC3 a marker of apoptotic cells. While CSDS had no effect on AC3 cell numbers in the dorsal DG panel a the ventral DG of all animals displayed a significant elevation after CSDS. This selective increase in AC3 cells in the ventral DG was even more pronounced in Ghsr null mice panels b l .

Taken together these results demonstrate that proliferation of newborn hippocampal neurons throughout the dentate gyms is decreased in both wild type and Ghsr null littermates after CSDS with an added effect of elevated cell death localized to the ventral DG. This net reduction in ventral DG neurogenesis is significantly more pronounced in Ghsr null mice and thus parallels the exacerbated depression like behavior observed after CSDS in Ghsr null mice as compared to wild type littermates. Localization of this ghrelin effect to the ventral DG may be related to higher baseline Ghsr expression within the ventral DG relative to the dorsal DG as demonstrated by quantitative RT PCR of hippocampal tissue punches taken from unstressed wild type mice and to the previously described role for the ventral DG in regulating mood.

It was next investigated whether protecting neural precursor cells from CSDS associated apoptosis might help protect against the depressive like phenotype. To test this idea P7C3 was utilized a neuroprotective aminopropyl carbazole that elevates hippocampal neurogenesis by blocking apoptosis without affecting the proliferation rate of hippocampal neural precursor cells in the dentate gyms. A twice daily schedule of intraperitoneal P7C3 injections 20 mg kg d in divided doses was initiated two days prior to CSDS and continued throughout the 10 day procedure for both wild type and Ghsr null littermates. Throughout the 10 days of CSDS the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine BrdU 50 mg kg i.p. was administered daily to label newborn cells panel a . Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis of plasma and brain P7C3 concentrations revealed that similar compound levels were achieved in wild type and Ghsr null mice .

Similar to the above Ki67 results immunohistochemical examination of brain tissue from these mice revealed that CSDS reduced the number of BrdU cells in both vehicle treated wild type and Ghsr null mice throughout the DG with a more significant reduction in the ventral DG of Ghsr null mice panels b c f i l q . In both wild type and Ghsr null mice P7C3 administration during CSDS preserved normal levels of neurogenesis throughout both dorsal and ventral regions of the DG panels b c f k . In parallel vehicle treated mice displayed an elevation of AC3 cells only in the ventral DG after CSDS an outcome associated with a more significant increase in Ghsr null mice panels d e and blocked by P7C3 administration panels e k . Thus P7C3 blocked CSDS associated reductions in both cellular proliferation and survival in the DG with greater statistical significance in the ventral DG of Ghsr null mice.

Of note P7C3 administration did not significantly augment BrdU or AC3 immunoreactivity in the DG of non stressed control animals a finding that differs from the original discovery of P7C3 panels a d . This may be attributed to changes in experimental technique. In particular the original screen by which P7C3 was discovered utilized singly housed 12 week old adult male mice completely deprived of environmental enrichment. This design was employed to maintain basal neurogenesis at a consistently low level for purposes of the discovery screen. By contrast the current group of non stressed control animals consisted of younger 8 weeks of age mice that were group housed in the same cage with a member of the same strain across a perforated divider under conditions of normal environmental enrichment all of which elevate baseline hippocampal neurogenesis.

Next P7C3 and two chemical analogs were employed to investigate whether P7C3 mediated preservation of ventral DG neurogenesis during CSDS might correlate with an antidepressant like behavioral effect. The analog P7C3 A20 Example 45 substitutes a fluoride at the hydroxyl position in the linker region of the molecule conferring greater neuroprotective efficacy than P7C3 as demonstrated recently in animal models of Parkinson s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Conversely the analog P7C3 S184 Example 178 replaces bromines on the carbazole moiety with chlorines and the aniline moiety with a naphthyl amine leaving the analog completely devoid of neuroprotective activity. In CSDS exposed wild type mice P7C3 treatment had no significant effect on depression like behavior panels a c . However in Ghsr null mice both P7C3 and P7C3 A20 showed antidepressant efficacy reflected by increased time spent in the interaction zone and reduced time spent in the corners of the testing chamber panels b d . The more highly active analog P7C3 A20 also significantly reduced the amount of time spent in the corners for wild type mice after CSDS panel c . The inactive analog P7C3 S184 had no effect on stress induced depressive like behavior in either genotype panels a d . Neither P7C3 nor the two tested analogs influenced social interaction test performance in non CSDS exposed control mice . Thus P7C3 displayed antidepressant efficacy in stressed Ghsr null mice while the more highly active analog P7C3 A20 exhibited antidepressant efficacy both in stressed Ghsr null mice and in their more resilient stressed wild type littermates.

Prolonged caloric restriction in wild type mice elicits an antidepressant like response in the FST decreased immobility whereas this effect is not observed in Ghsr null mice. To investigate whether this might be related to differences in apoptosis in the DG similar to that observed above following CSDS Ghsr null and wild type littermates were exposed to ad libitum food access vs. 60 caloric restriction for 10 days. Five days prior to this exposure and throughout the 10 day feeding period mice received either P7C3 or vehicle. On Day 16 FST performance was assessed followed by sacrifice of the animals for quantification of AC3 cells in the DG panel a . Surprisingly the number of AC3 cells after caloric restriction was reduced throughout the DG in wild type mice yet was increased in Ghsr null mice panels b c f p . In caloric restricted wild type mice P7C3 did not further reduce the number of AC3 cells panels b c whereas in Ghsr null mice P7C3 blocked the increase in apoptosis observed after caloric restriction panels b c .

With respect to behavior caloric restriction significantly decreased immobility in the FST in vehicle treated wild type mice but not in vehicle treated Ghsr null mice as previously demonstrated with non injected caloric restricted mice panels d e . While P7C3 administration had no further effect on reducing immobility in caloric restricted wild type mice it did significantly decrease immobility in caloric restricted Ghsr null mice. Thus the anti apoptotic efficacy of P7C3 within the DG of Ghsr null mice restores the antidepressant like effect of caloric restriction to that observed in wild type mice panels d e .

The neuroprotective efficacies of both P7C3 and P7C3 A20 were next compared to currently marketed antidepressant medications using screening conditions identical to those by which P7C3 was originally discovered. This experiment was based on the antidepressant actions of P7C3 and P7C3 A20 characterized here and the dependence on hippocampal neurogenesis for behavioral efficacy of some marketed antidepressant medications in mice. Continuous and direct intracerebroventricular infusion of P7C3 or P7C3 A20 over a one week period of time into the left lateral ventricle markedly augmented hippocampal neurogenesis by about 100 or 160 respectively as reflected by increased BrdU labeling in the DG . By contrast only four out of fourteen antidepressant medications tested significantly increased DG BrdU labeling over that observed with vehicle. In particular the norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine and the tricyclic antidepressants clomipramine and desipramine increased DG neurogenesis by about 49 52 75 and 102 over vehicle respectively. Of those only clomipramine and desipramine were statistically as effective at P7C3 in inducing BrdU incorporation and none was statistically as effective as the highly active P7C3 A20 molecule. The remaining antidepressant medications tested including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine citalopram fluoxetine and sertraline the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant mirtazapine the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine and the tricyclic antidepressants nortriptyline and imipramine did not affect the magnitude of neurogenesis in this one week assay. Thus the proneurogenic efficacy of the new P7C3 class of compounds is superior to that noted for a wide spectrum of antidepressant drugs representing the major classes currently prescribed to patients. If indeed as the current studies confirm augmentation of hippocampal neurogenesis is crucial for the manifestation of antidepressant efficacy of both endogenous substances such as ghrelin and exogenous compounds administered to patients then the rapidity and magnitude of proneurogenic efficacy offered by highly active members of the P7C3 class suggest that this chemical scaffold may serve as a basis for developing new antidepressants with superior efficacy to those currently available to patients suffering from depressive illness.

Despite the multitude of antidepressant drugs currently offered to patients major depression remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in our society. Thus there is a great need to further understand the mechanisms underlying depression in order to develop new treatments. To that end impaired hippocampal neurogenesis has been identified as a general contributing factor to the depression associated with chronic psychosocial stress in the mouse models. Furthermore effects seen in Ghsr null mice suggest that hippocampal neuroprotection is a primary mechanism by which stress induced elevations in ghrelin protect against what would otherwise be worsened stress associated depression. These new insights led us to test the antidepressant efficacy of the P7C3 class of neuroprotective compounds in the animal models of depression.

Here it was demonstrated for the first time that the P7C3 class of neuroprotective agents elevates hippocampal neurogenesis more acutely and with greater magnitude than a wide variety of existing antidepressant medications representative of the major classes currently prescribed to patients. Indeed the exacerbated depression like behavior and decrease in neurogenesis observed in CSDS exposed Ghsr null mice was blocked by P7C3. Notably even baseline depression like behavior observed in CSDS exposed wild type mice was minimized by P7C3 A20 a well characterized more highly active analog of P7C3. Absence of a behavioral response to P7C3 S184 a P7C3 analog that lacks neuroprotective efficacy further supports specificity of the neuroprotective properties of P7C3 and P7C3 A20 in conferring antidepressant efficacy. Furthermore the inability of Ghsr null mice to mount an antidepressant response to caloric restriction was also linked to acquired deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis and both this and behavior were restored to normal through treatment of Ghsr null animals with P7C3. It is thus proposed that the P7C3 class of neuroprotective compounds provides a basis for developing a new class of antidepressant medications.

The results here further suggest that individuals with depression associated with insufficient ghrelin responses might be effectively treated by strongly neuroprotective agents as embodied by the P7C3 class. For instance individuals who have undergone Roux en Y gastric bypass weight loss surgery have a higher rate of suicide than the general population. As most studies have demonstrated either decreased or unchanged plasma ghrelin levels following Roux en Y gastric bypass neuroprotection by the P7C3 class of compounds may substitute for that lacking due to the atypical ghrelin response. The role of impaired hippocampal neurogenesis also needs to be investigated as a contributory factor to other forms of depression besides those associated with chronic psychosocial stress or defective ghrelin signaling in order to further determine the extent of applicability of specifically augmenting hippocampal neurogenesis to treat depression. It is believed that the chemical scaffold represented by P7C3 and P7C3 A20 will provide a basis for optimizing and advancing a new class of pharmacologic agents for treatment of depression.
