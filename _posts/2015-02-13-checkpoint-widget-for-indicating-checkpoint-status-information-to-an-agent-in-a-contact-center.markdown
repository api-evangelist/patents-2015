title: Checkpoint widget for indicating checkpoint status information to an agent in a contact center
abstract: A real-time speech analytics system (“RSTA system”) detects speech in a specific context during a call involving a contact center agent and a remote party. Upon detecting the speech, an event message is generated by the RTSA system and transmitted to a checkpoint and alert reporting module, which is configured update a checkpoint widget. The checkpoint widget provides visual information as to the status of the checkpoints encountered during the call and is displayed using a computer display associated with a workstation used by the agent handling the call. As checkpoints are encountered during the call, the checkpoint indicators in the widget are modified to reflect occurrence of the checkpoint. Each checkpoint indicator may have text associated with it, informing the user of the nature of checkpoint. The checkpoint widget may be displayed to the agent and/or a supervisor, allowing ready determination of the status of the call.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 572 957 filed on Dec. 17 2014 entitled Dynamic Display of Real Time Speech Analytics Agent Alert Indications in a Contact Center. 

The field of the invention generally pertains to contact centers and specifically how a real time speech analytics RTSA system that is configured to indicate certain types of call status information to a contact center agent by using a checkpoint widget that displays checkpoints detected during a call.

Contact centers employ agents to interact with called parties for a variety of purposes such as debt collection telemarketing soliciting donations or providing customer service. For a variety of applications there may be various state or federal regulations governing how the interaction may occur. In addition the contact center may have various policies that govern how the agent is to conduct the call. The agent is expected to comply with the appropriate regulations and policies but in fact this may be difficult depending on the particular circumstances. This is because the agent may be involved in various campaigns governed by different regulations and policies. The agent may be temporarily distracted during a call and may not recall all the applicable regulations.

For example depending on the particular circumstances the agent may be required to ensure that the certain information is provided to the remote party or respond in a certain way when provided with information by the remote party. In the past one way of ensuring that the agent complied with the applicable regulations or policies was to record the call involving the agent. The call would then be reviewed by an experienced agent who would identify or rank the agent s performance. It is not uncommon for a very small sample of such calls involving an agent to be reviewed i.e. perhaps a fraction of 1 of the calls. Further such a review may occur days or weeks after the call was initially recorded. This approach could only identify a deficiency in an agent s performance long after the call was completed. There may have been hundreds of calls made by the agent before any feedback is provided to the agent. Thus any errors in the agent s call handling practice may go uncorrected for some time.

Agents may have a genuine desire to improve their performance but they may not be aware that they have made a mistake. They may be distracted nervous or simply unaware that they overlooked an opportunity to improve their performance or were non compliant in a particular circumstance. Real time feedback is typically more effective in modifying human behavior and delayed review of the agent s performance may serve to entrench undesirable agent habits.

One technology that can be applied to monitor and identify an agent s non compliance involves the use of real time speech analytics. This technology can monitor and understand the speech and the context of the speech as it occurs in conversation between the agent and remote party. Unlike speech recognition the speech is analyzed for a particular conversation relative to a particular framework or context. In other words in order for the speech analysis to detect a non compliance condition there must first be a framework defined to compare the speech against. This may be complicated in that the particular framework to use may depend on various factors and may not be deduced from the speech itself. For example an agent providing customer service may respond to a called party by saying I cannot tell you that. This may be an appropriate answer if the called party inquires about the agent s email address for personal correspondence but the same response may not be an appropriate answer if the called party seeks the email address for directing a customer complaint. Thus analyzing the speech during a call is highly dependent on the context in which the speech occurs. That is merely recognizing a word s may not be sufficient.

Thus systems and methods required to be defined to effectively and quickly determine whether an agent is compliance with various regulations and contact center policies. It is with respect to these and other considerations that the disclosure herein is presented.

Technologies are generally presented herein pertaining to systems methods and non transitory computer readable media for presenting the status of checkpoints during a voice call handled by an agent in a contact center. This information may be displayed by creating a checkpoint widget that comprises various checkpoint status indicators each corresponding to a checkpoint. Upon detecting the speech in the appropriate context defined for that checkpoint the corresponding checkpoint status indicator is updated. This allows the agent and or supervisor to quickly ascertain the checkpoint status for a call during the call. The checkpoint widget may have different formats and text may be displayed in conjunction with each checkpoint to inform the user of the nature of the checkpoint.

Various embodiments for practicing the technologies disclosed herein are described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some but not all embodiments of the technologies are shown. Indeed the embodiments disclosed herein are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements and should not be construed as limiting or precluding other embodiments applying the teachings and concepts disclosed herein. As will be evident there are a number of variations on the embodiments disclosed herein but which are based on similar concepts and goals. Like numbers in the drawings refer to like elements throughout.

The following terms are to be given the following meanings in this specification when used in the appropriate context. Further the terms defined herein are not necessarily applicable to any parent patent application s from which priority is claimed or which are incorporated by reference. Any examples included in a definition are not intended to be exclusive or limiting but merely illustrative.

Alert a.k.a. alert indication information related to a condition detected during a call between an agent and remote party. In most contexts herein reference to an alert involves a RTSA alert which is a particular form of an alert that reports information in real time related to a speech condition during the call. An RTSA alert is typically related to detecting unexpected speech or failing to detect expected speech. If reference is made to an alert that is not an RTSA alert then this will be clear from the context.

Alert Bubble an icon displaying a numerical value representing the number of alerts reported during a current call for a particular agent. Typically the alert bubble icon is displayed once an alert is reported and remains displayed for the duration of the call. The numerical value indicated by an alert bubble may be incremented during the call if another alert is reported.

Alert Details information that provides additional details about one or more alerts. This may be displayed in a message box alert details box usually comprising only text but which may incorporate icons and or colors. The Alert Details are usually displayed in response to a user selecting a particular Alert Bubble. In such cases the Alert Details may be displayed until explicitly closed or may be displayed for a set time.

Alert Overlay a message box which may incorporate various icons and different colors that indicate information about a currently reported alert. The icons and or colors may be used to report a type or severity of the alert. The alert overlay typically is displayed in a transient manner e.g. for a few seconds before disappearing.

Agent Icon an icon used on a graphical user interface comprising text information identifying an agent and possibly their status typically along with an image of that agent. The image may be a picture drawing or other symbol of that agent.

Call Handler System CHS or simply Call Handler a component in a contact center that processes communications. The communications may include communications that are inbound or outbound relative to the contact center and may encompass a variety of communication technologies. A call handler system frequently handles voice oriented calls but may handle other types of communications.

Call Leg a portion of a call typically between two pieces of equipment. Call legs may be concatenated or joined to form an end to end call between two individuals. Call legs are typically bi directional in their capability to convey voice but not necessarily as a call leg may convey voice from one party to another but not in the reverse direction.

Campaign a set of calls processed in a contact center by a call handler in a common manner or for a common purpose.

Checkpoint a point during a voice call that is associated with the expected or possible occurrence of a speech event.

Checkpoint Occurrence the occurrence of an expected or possible speech event that is identified as corresponding to a checkpoint.

Checkpoint Indicator a.k.a. checkpoint status indicator one of the typically several visual elements of a checkpoint widget representing a checkpoint of a voice call.

Checkpoint Indicator Text text associated with a checkpoint indicator on a checkpoint widget that informs the reader of the nature of the checkpoint.

Checkpoint Indicator Status a particular state of a checkpoint indicator which typically reflects whether or not the checkpoint has occurred.

Checkpoint Chronological Order the relative order in time when checkpoints are expected to occur during a call. This is not necessarily the same as when the checkpoints actually occur since not all checkpoints may actually occur during a call may occur in an unexpected order or may occur in an order which cannot be accurately predicted. A checkpoint widget may illustrate checkpoints in chronological order.

Compliance Score a numerical score allocated in conjunction with one or more detected speech conditions that is associated with a compliance requirement. This could be allocated on a per instance basis or on a cumulative basis for a particular agent.

Event a.k.a. speech event detection by an RTSA system of a keyword uttered in the speech typically involving one of an agent or remote party in a voice call. Events are typically reported and hence reporting an event is indicating the occurrence of the event.

Event Configuration providing information necessary for the RTSA system to detect an event. This would include e.g. indicating the keywords that the RTSA is to detect and report out as an event message. Various labels could be defined and associated with reporting an event and defining such labels could be part of the event configuration process.

Event Message the message sent by the RTSA system reporting detection of an event. This may also called an alert message when referring to reporting a speech condition associated with an alert.

Keyword a word set of words or phrase and its associated context in which the detection thereof is reported as an event by an RTSA system. Also called a topic. 

NPA NXX A portion of a telephone number where the NPA represents the numbering plan area commonly called the area code and the NXX represents the central office code. The NPX NXX was historically associated with a geographic location but since the NPA NXX may be associated with a wireless number or may have been ported the geographical location of a particular NPA NXX may not be readily ascertained without requiring additional information.

Positivity Score a numerical score allocated in conjunction with a detected speech condition where the score reflects the extent of an agent s favorable or desirable behavior or potentially undesirable behavior . This could be allocated on a per instance basis or on a cumulative basis for a particular agent.

Real Time Speech Analytics RTSA the processing of speech in real time to determine a context and the words spoken. RTSA is distinguished from speech recognition which only recognizes a spoken word and does not determine a context in which the word occurs.

Real Time Speech Analytics System RTSA System a speech analytics system capable of providing real time analysis of speech in a defined context. This may be employed in a contact center to detect and report on various speech conditions between an agent and a remote party that may occur during a call.

Speech Condition a condition involving the speech on a call between two parties pertaining to either 1 the detected presence of specific speech or 2 the absence of specific speech. Typically though not always this involves speech involving the agent. Typically this is also associated with a particular context e.g. other information associated with the speech.

Transient Alert Indication an alert indication that is provided in a transient manner wherein information is displayed and then removed after a time period without any user interaction. The time period typically is configurable and may range from less than a second to the duration of the call. Typically the duration is set to be less than 10 30 seconds.

Tabular Manner having a characteristic of a table format comprising rows and columns with each cell formed thereby comprising text and which may also incorporate different colors and or icons.

Topic a particular instance of a speech condition that a RTSA system is configured to detect and report. This is reported by the RTSA system to the checkpoint and alert reporting module via an alert message. The topic may be identified by a name for ease of human reference. Thus e.g. welcome greeting detected may be the name of a topic associated with detecting a word or phrase identified as a welcome greeting. Also referred to as a keyword. 

Time line in conjunction with a checkpoint widget a visual element indicating the passage of time in a widget.

Widget also called Checkpoint Widget a collection of visual elements displayed on a computer screen which may comprise text icons and symbols representing one or more checkpoints that are indicated by corresponding checkpoint indications also called checkpoint status indicators that reflect whether the checkpoint occurred. The widget is configurable so as to be capable of indicating which checkpoints have occurred and thus may change over time.

Widget Instance a depiction of a widget at a particular time. The widget has the ability to indicate whether checkpoints have been detected during a call and thus can change over time. Thus representation of a widget by a diagram or figure inherently depicts a static representation of the widget at a specific point in time.

Workstation a computer configured to handle agent related contact center functions in contact center. In one embodiment this may be a specialized computer based component configured to handle voice calls or process information related to such voice calls. The workstation comprises a display often a computer display and may but not always comprise a telephone device.

Voice Call communications involving human recognizable speech which may involve various forms of technologies including conventional telephony digitized voice ISDN VoIP etc.

Contact centers must comply with various federal and state regulations that govern how certain types of calls may be conducted. These regulations may provide a spectrum of guidelines as to how certain types of calls are to be conducted. For example broad guidelines may prohibit an agent involved in a debt collection call from making intimidating statements to the debtor. On the other hand other guidelines may be very specific in that they require the agent involved in a debt collection call provide certain information e.g. make certain statements to the debtor such as indicating that the purpose of the call is to collect a debt. Further many contact centers have other policies such as prohibiting agents from using curse words with a remote party mandating a welcome greeting or requiring the agent to ask the party at the end of the call whether there are any outstanding questions or issues that need to be addressed.

Compliance with these regulations may require the agent to convey certain information or to refrain from making certain statements. Usually compliance with the regulations requires the agent to behave in a certain manner. In various circumstances the agent s behavior may depend on what the remote party says. Obviously a contact center cannot control what the remote party does or does not say on a call with the agent and rather focuses on the agent s conduct. Thus depending on the context including based on what the remote party says the agent is expected to provide certain information or refrain from using certain speech. These may be broadly referred to as speech conditions. 

In the past detection of undesirable speech conditions was largely performed by humans. This may have been performed by reviewing call recordings and manually evaluating whether the agent complied with certain regulations. In addition such evaluation may have been performed in real time by a supervisor by using a barge in or other conferencing capability whereby the supervisor could listen to or monitor the conversation. Regardless of whether the activity was done in real time or in non real time the process was labor intensive in that it required a knowledgeable and experienced person to perform the evaluations. However some of the activity is by its nature menial. For example monitoring the speech for a curse word uttered by the agent does not require any particular experience and can be a tedious exercise. Further it could be often overlooked since not all calls were recorded and reviewed.

Speech analytics systems SAS are now able to detect programmed speech conditions and more recently can perform this in real time. Thus a real time speech analytics system RTSA system is an effective labor saving technology that can provide real time analysis of many conversations of agents in a contact center on a non stop basis. RTSA is more sophisticated than mere speech recognition in that it allows more sophisticated contexts to be defined. For example it can detect when an agent responds inappropriately to a certain question posed by the remote party as opposed to merely recognizing a particular word or phrase.

For example it may be possible to detect using speech recognition when the agent states the words I can t tell you. This may be a valid answer if the agent is asked by an individual for confidential information e.g. his annual salary or home address. On the other hand if the remote individual asks their current balance or due date for the next payment such an answer is inappropriate. Speech analytics can detect the context of the speech and apply rules for generating an alert which mere speech recognition systems cannot.

Thus SAS can alleviate the need for a supervisor or similar person to analyze each call serially. Obviously requiring a supervisor to monitor each call limits the number of calls from agents that can be monitored. Thus using a SAS makes it now possible for all calls of all agents to be continuously monitored for compliance and other aspects.

This raises an issue of how a supervisor is expected to analyze the results from a RTSA system. There are a number of speech conditions that may be detected during a call and it may be quite burdensome and overwhelming for a supervisor to be able to review the results from all calls especially if the results are provided non stop in real time. For example a contact center may have dozens or hundreds of agents that are making a number of calls. Providing real time results of each speech condition detected could easily overwhelm a supervisor.

The results from the RTSA system that are provided to a supervisor are referred to as alerts or more specifically RTSA alerts. RTSA alerts report detection of a particular speech condition. Usually the alert relates to speech from the agent not from the remote party. However the speech condition reported with respect to the agent may be based on a context that takes into account speech from the remote party. For example once an agent engaged in a debt collection call is informed by the debtor that they are represented by a lawyer any further attempts by the agent to collect the debt should cease. Thus detecting an attempt to collect a debt is a concern only if the party has informed the agent that they have retained a lawyer. Consequently reporting this speech condition relates to the agent but the context involves speech from both the remote party and the agent.

The alert may report a negative or undesirable speech condition which may be a violation of a policy or regulation. In addition the alert may report a positive or desirable speech condition which may reflect that the agent is in conformance with a policy or regulation. Thus the supervisor reviewing alerts may receive either positive or negative alerts. These may be used in evaluating the performance of an agent. Typically these are compiled into a numerical value called a score of some type e.g. a compliance score .

Supervisors reviewing such alerts may require various types of information in order to quickly assess a RTSA alert. For example since supervisors may be receiving or reviewing alerts in real time they may find it beneficial that the alerts are formatted so they can quickly evaluate whether a particular alert is a positive or negative alert. A negative alert may represent a compliance violation and depending on the context may require immediate intervention by the supervisor. A quick and easy method of distinguishing between a positive and negative alert is by color code on the alert indication. An alert indication may be associated with one color for positive alerts such as green and another color for negative alerts such as red. Other colors may be used to reflect other categories. Ascertaining the color of a visual indication can be done very quickly and easily and much quicker than having to read e.g. text.

Further a visual indication of the severity of the alert is useful. This allows the supervisor to focus their attention on the severe versus minor violations. Again this can be reflected by different color shades or hues used on the alert indication. Thus a dark red could be interpreted as more severe than a light red. In another embodiment an icon may be included in the alert to indicate a severity. This may involve various levels of colors line thicknesses shapes or sizes. Thus a small exclamation point may represent one level of severity and a greater severity level may be reflected by e.g. a larger font different color or by concatenating two such marks e.g. . In addition in other embodiments a sound level may optionally be used to indicate a severity. This may involve different sounds or different levels of the same sound. Sounds may be defined to merely attract attention e.g. a whistle or chirp convey urgency or a warning e.g. a claxon sound or some other characteristic.

The alert itself may also include text based information to provide additional details. Text based information obviously requires the intended recipient usually the contact center supervisor or manager to read and understand the information in order to evaluate its significance. Thus text based information may be used by a supervisor to augment the color icon information if they so desire. In other words the supervisor may select a particular alert based on the color or severity and then review the associated text.

In addition the supervisor needs to be able to quickly review current alert information past historical alert information as well as trends. This allows the supervisor to quickly evaluate whether a problem is transient ongoing or developing into a worse situation. This must be provided with minimal interaction and distraction with the supervisor given the potentially large number of alerts that may be received.

While alerts provide particular information related to a call to a supervisor or agent the depiction of events that have occurred may also be presented to a supervisor or agent via a checkpoint widget or simply widget . The widget depicts the occurrence of certain events that have been designated as checkpoints . A checkpoint is a point during a voice call that is associated with the expected or possible occurrence of a speech event. A checkpoint is defined by an event e.g. detection of a particular speech related occurrence that has been labeled as a checkpoint typically reflecting its importance in some way. By defining certain keywords as checkpoints this allows a filter to be defined that can distinguish some events from others e.g. non checkpoint events from event checkpoints . As checkpoints are detected during a call checkpoint indicators on the widget that is displayed are modified to reflect the occurrence of the corresponding keyword. The widget provides a very easy to understand indication of the status of a call with respect to which checkpoints have occurred. The call status may thus be ascertained faster and easier than reviewing the alert history for a given agent.

Merely indicating when a certain event occurred during a call does not reflect a checkpoint. This is because in part knowing whether an event occurs during a call cannot be ascertained until after that particular call has occurred. Thus indicating when a certain event has occurred is different from indicating events that are expected or may occur during a call. In the later case these can defined before a call occurs whereas indicating events that have occurred cannot be indicated before the call occurs. Thus checkpoints should not be confused with technologies that merely visually indicate what speech has been detected during a call as opposed to indicating speech that is expected or which may occur.

Associating a given alert to a given agent is necessary for various reasons. If there is a negative speech condition detected and reported the supervisor requires knowledge of which agent was involved not that there simply was a negative alert reported from among a set of agents. There may be e.g. a hundred agents. Obviously providing corrective action for an agent requires knowing which agent is involved. The association of an agent with an alert can occur in various ways. Two main ways include tabular and graphical.

First it is important to distinguish that the tabular format for reporting alerts is not the same as table based reports. Reports are well known in contact centers and provide tables of various statistics for agents which can be organized in different ways. However the information is presented as a static summary. Frequently such reports convey information in a non interactive non real time format which requires presenting all available information on the table and if not presented the information is not readily available. Thus a conventional report format makes it difficult to provide the various levels of detail which may or may not be required depending on the circumstances.

In contrast alert indications are dynamically presented in real time according to the concepts and technologies presented herein. Thus the tabular format is not the same as a table based report. In the tabular format each alert is indicated in a column on a table with the name of the agent or functional equivalent identifier indicated in a corresponding column. Thus one format may list the alert in a row in the table along with the agent s name in another column in that row. The use of such tabular reports is well known in contact centers but such information is typically not real time summaries of information. The tabular format as with the graphical format may provide real time information and may allow the ability to drill down and obtain further detailed information. This is not possible in a static report.

A graphical form is well suited for quick association of an alert to an agent by the supervisor. Thus the graphical form is well adapted to real time indications and evaluations. This can be done by associating an alert to a map of a particular work location of the agent and or including a pictorial image or icon of the agent. One embodiment involves a work location map typically referred to as a floor plan map. This may represent a floor diagram of the contact center. The floor plan map is typically applicable to contact centers that maintain a physical presence as opposed to contact centers that support work at home or virtual agents . In a floor plan map a layout of the various agent positions is shown and a particular agent may be identified by highlighting or otherwise identifying a particular location on the floor plan map. Typically the location is associated with their workspace or cubicle location.

The other graphical approach involves a series of agent icons which represent an agent. Each agent may have a picture or other icon associated with their image along with their name for quick identification. A series of agent icons may be presented in a grid or a matrix of rows and columns which allows easy identification of a particular agent. These can be grouped in various ways including alphabetically by name by workgroup location experience skill set experience etc.

The alert may contain the appropriate text and icon information such that the supervisor can identify the nature of the alert quickly and identify the agent that the alert is associated with by the relative positioning of the alert indication. In either the tabular or graphical form the RTSA alert may be overlaid on the tabular floor plan map or over the appropriate agent icon or position to identify the agent involved. The alert is positioned to be approximate to the appropriate graphical image associated with the agent. This may be accomplished by overlaying the alert on a portion of the graphical image or the surrounding space associated that graphical image. Other embodiments may use a pointer or other graphical indicator to link the alert to the appropriate agent. In various embodiments the name and or image of the corresponding agent may be shown.

Typically the alert indication is displayed in a transient manner. That is the alert indication is displayed for a limited amount of time. If the alert indication was permanently displayed there would eventually be a number of alert indications that would cover the display screen and interfere with reviewing the information. This would make it very difficult to ascertain which alert indications were current recent or important.

In various embodiments an alert count is maintained on the tabular floor plan or agent icon showing a cumulative number of alerts received. This allows the supervisor to review which agents are incurring alerts which allows the supervisor to evaluate conditions even if they do not witness the transient alert indication.

Since the call center may handle calls originating from a calling party or initiated to a called party the term party without any further qualification refers to a person associated with a call processed by the call center where the call is either received from or placed to the party. The term calling party if used will generally refer to a party communicating with the call center but in many cases this usage is exemplary. Thus use of the term calling party is not intended to limit the concepts to only inbound calls or voice calls unless the context dictates such. Reference to the term remote party encompasses either a calling or called party.

Depending on the embodiment inbound voice calls may originate from calling parties using a variety of different phone types. For instance a calling party may originate a call from a conventional analog telephone connected to a public switched telephone network PSTN using an analog plain old telephone service POTS line . The calls may be routed by the PSTN and may comprise various types of facilities including but not limited to T trunks SONET based fiber optic networks ATM networks etc. Various types of routers switches bridges gateways and other types of equipment may be involved in the processing of the calls.

Inbound voice calls may also originate from a mobile phone device such as a smart phone tablet or other mobile device which wirelessly communicates with a mobile service provider MSP . The voice calls may be routed to the PSTN using an integrated services digital network ISDN interface or other types of interfaces that are well known to those skilled in the art. In particular embodiments the MSP may also route calls as packetized voice referred to herein as voice over IP VoIP to an Internet provider using Internet based protocols. For convenience unless indicated otherwise the term trunk refers to any type of facility or providing voice calls to or from the call center regardless of the type of protocol or technology used. Specifically a trunk is not limited to time division multiplexing TDM technology.

Inbound voice calls may also originate from a calling party employing a so called IP phone VoIP phone or soft phone . In one embodiment this device may comprise a computing device such as a laptop computing tablet or other electronic device which interfaces with a headphone microphone combination also referred to as a headset . An IP phone may use a digital voice control protocol and may process packetized voice data according to various Internet based voice protocols such as session initiated protocol SIP . The call may be conveyed by other types of Internet providers such as a cable company providing Internet access services over a coaxial cable facility . Those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of protocols and facilities may be used to convey voice calls.

The term telephone call as used herein is generally synonymous with a voice call unless indicated otherwise. Further the term telephone call may encompass a voice call originating from any type of device such as a soft phone a conventional telephone a mobile phone or other device known in the art. The term call as used herein may encompass an active instance of two way communication an attempt to establish two way communication or a portion of the two way communication. For example a user at a conventional telephone can dial a telephone call in an attempt to establish two way communication and a call can be said to exist even prior to establishment of a two way connection. In another example a call may be put on hold and a portion of the call may be referred to as a call leg existing between the caller and certain equipment. A call may comprise a number of concatenated call legs which may involve various components at their end points as known to those skilled in the art. A call leg may also be unidirectional or bidirectional with respect to the ability to convey speech. In certain contexts which will be made explicit the call may encompass communications other than voice for example text email video chat facsimile etc.

In various embodiments inbound calls from calling parties to the call center may be received at a call handler which could be in one embodiment an automatic call distributor ACD . In particular embodiments the call handler may be a specialized switch for receiving and routing inbound calls under various conditions. Further the call handler may be embodied as a dedicated form of equipment readily available from various manufacturers or the call handler may be a so called soft switch comprising a suitable programming module executed by a processing device to perform the necessary functions. The call handler may route an incoming call over call center facilities to an available agent. Depending on the embodiment the facilities may be any suitable technology for conveying the call including but not limited to a local area network LAN wide area network WAN ISDN or conventional TDM circuits. In addition the facilities may be the same or different from the facilities used to transport the call to the call handler .

In various embodiments calls may be routed over facilities to an agent for servicing. That is for example the party may speak with an agent to receive customer service. The physical area at which the agent sits is often referred to as an agent position and these positions are often grouped into clusters managed by a supervisor who may monitor calls and the agents productivity. An agent typically uses a specially configured computing device such as a computer and a voice device that is adapted for various contact center functions associated with processing communications. The combination of computing device and voice device may be referred to as a workstation. Thus for these particular embodiments the workstation collectively has a data capability and a voice capability although separate devices may be used. In some instances workstation may be used in reference to either the data or voice capability at the agent s position. For example routing the call to the agent s workstation means routing a call to one of the voice devices at the agent s position. Similarly routing the call to the agent means routing a call to the appropriate equipment at an agent s position.

In particular embodiments the voice device used by an agent may be a soft phone device exemplified by a headset connected to the computer . The soft phone device may be a virtual telephone implemented in part by an application program executing on the computer . Further the phone may also comprise an Internet Protocol IP based headset or a conventional phone . Use of the term phone is intended to encompass all these types of voice devices used by an agent unless indicated otherwise.

Agents typically log onto their workstations prior to handling calls. This allows the call center to know which agents are available for handling calls. In particular embodiments the call handler may also maintain data of an agent s skill level that may be used to route a specific call to the agent or group of agents having the same skill level. In particular instances if a suitable agent is not available to handle a call the call handler may queue the call for the next available agent. As can be expected various algorithms may be employed to process calls in an efficient manner.

In various embodiments two types of signaling information may be provided with an inbound call that may be used by the call handler in processing the call. The first type of signaling information indicates the telephone number dialed by the calling party and is frequently referred to as DNIS derived from the Dialed Number Identification Service associated with this capability. For example in particular instances a call center may provide various services such as sales customer service technical support etc. each of which may be associated with a different telephone number e.g. multiple toll free 800 numbers . In these instances the call handler may use the DNIS to determine the purpose of the call and potentially identify a group of agents having the appropriate skill level to handle the call. Thus in various embodiments the call handler may prioritize and route calls to an agent based on the required skill level. Skills based routing may be a rule based set of instructions that the call handler uses to handle calls. Depending on the embodiment skills based routing may be implemented by the call handler or by the call handler interacting with a computer telephone integrated CTI server not shown .

The second type of signaling information that may be provided with an inbound call is the calling telephone number often referred to as automatic number identification or ANI. In particular embodiments the call handler and or CTI server may use the ANI of an incoming call to retrieve caller information from a data store and provide the data to an agent s workstation computer over facilities along with routing the call to the agent s workstation phone . Further in particular embodiments the ANI may also be used to ascertain a party s status e.g. a Gold Level customer warranting premium service determine whether consent has been received by a party for particular services or actions and or to facilitate the call handler routing the call to a select group of agents. Depending on the embodiment the data store may include one or more databases storing different information such as for example records of caller information. Further the data store may be integrated with the call handler or segregated as a standalone medium or media.

In various embodiments the call handler may place a call in a queue if there are no suitable agents available and or it may route the call to an interactive voice response system e.g. server IVR not shown to play voice prompts. In particular embodiments these prompts may be in a menu type structure and the IVR may collect and analyze responses from the party in the form of dual tone multiple frequency DMTF tones and or speech. In addition the IVR may be used to further identify the purpose of the call such as for example prompting the party to enter account information or otherwise obtain information used to service the call. Further in particular embodiments the IVR may interact with other components such as the CTI server or the data store to retrieve or provide information for processing the call. In other configurations the IVR may be used to only provide announcements.

Depending on the embodiment the interaction between the various components shown may involve using a local area network LAN . However other configurations are possible such as but not limited to using a wide area network wireless network router bridge direct point to point links etc.

In particular embodiments when an agent is interacting with a called or calling party the agent may use his workstation computer to further interact with other enterprise computing systems such as for example a customer relationship management CRM server not shown . A CRM server may be used to integrate information from various enterprise business systems to facilitate the agent servicing the call. In addition the CRM server may provide a variety of applications.

In addition to receiving inbound communications including for example voice calls emails text messages and facsimiles the call center may also originate communications to a called party referred to herein as outbound communications. In some embodiments the call handler may be a dialer such as a predictive dialer to originate outbound calls at a rate designed to meet various criteria. The predictive dialer may then connect an agent at a workstation with the outbound call after the remote party answers. Similar to the other components within the call center architecture depending on the embodiment the dialer may comprise one or more software modules executing on a processing device hardware platform.

In various embodiments the call handler is typically configured to dial a list of telephone numbers to initiate outbound calls. Thus in some embodiments the call handler may include functionality for originating calls and if so this functionality may be referred to as a private automatic branch exchange PBX or PABX . Further in other embodiments the call handler may directly interface with voice trunks using facilities to the PSTN and or Internet providers for originating calls. After the calls are originated a transfer operation by the call handler may connect the call with an agent or a queue or in some instances the IVR. In various embodiments the call handler may make use of one or more algorithms to determine how and when to dial a list of numbers so as to minimize the likelihood of a called party being placed in a queue while maintaining target agent utilization.

Also shown is a Speech Analytics System SAS which may be a real time speech analytics RTSA system . This typically monitors the speech during a call and is able to monitor both the agent s and the remote party s speech. This is typically accomplished by using a conference bridge in the call handler with a conference leg to the RTSA system although the RTSA only listens to the speech and does not interject any speech into the conference bridge. The RTSA typically interfaces with the LAN to communicate with other components including the call handler and a checkpoint and alert reporting module .

The RTSA is configured to detect certain speech conditions. These are also known as topics or keywords since it refers to speech in a particular context. Thus the RTSA can be configured to detect an agent s response to a particular question asked by the remote party or ensure that the agent properly introduced themselves at the beginning of the call. The RTSA can be configured to detect each speech condition and report its detection which is a form of a RTSA alert. To distinguish the alert generated by the RTSA as opposed to an alert generated by the checkpoint alert reporting module the alert generated by the RTSA is referred to herein as an alert message. This is merely to avoid confusion. A variety of protocol formats may be used and reference to an alert message should not be construed as limiting the communication from the RTSA to a single message. The messages generated by the RTSA may also be called event messages that indicate detection of a speech condition. Generally an alert message refers to an event message that is used to generate an alert whereas event message will refer to a RTSA message that corresponds to a speech condition associated with a checkpoint. It is possible that a event message may also be used to generate an alert but use of these different names may aid in the reader understanding whether alerts or checkpoints are being referred to.

The topics detected by the RTSA are typically associated with a name for administrative convenience. As noted earlier the RTSA can be configured to detect the agent providing a greeting at the beginning of a call. This topic could be given the name of welcome. Thus the welcome topic relates to detecting the agent s greeting. Similarly a closing topic could detect a particular closing speech condition. Thus the names provide an easy reference to a particular speech condition that the RTSA is configured to detect.

The RTSA reports each detected topic to the checkpoint and alert reporting module CARM . In one embodiment the CARM may comprise a processor and associated computer instructions and may reside in the call handler the RTSA or a separate dedicated processing system. The CARM in turn is configured to inform an agent and or administrator often at a computer or computer although other processing devices may be involved e.g. tablets smart phones etc. . The CARM processes the alert and or event message from the RTSA and generates the appropriate indication to the administrator. As will be seen the CARM may map an alert message to a variety of alert indication formats depending on various criteria. The CARM may also present and update a checkpoint widget to the agent and or supervisor.

Although a number of the above components may be referred to as a server each may be also referred to in the art as a computing device unit or system. A server may incorporate a local data store and or interface with an external data store. Use of the word server does not require the component to interact in a client server arrangement with other components although that may be the case. Further the above components may be located remotely from or co located with other components. Furthermore one or more of the components may be implemented on a single processing device to perform the functions described herein. For example in various embodiments one or more functionalities of the call handler or other component may be combined into a single hardware platform executing one or more software modules. In addition the call center architecture may be provided as a hosted solution where the call processing functionality is provided as a communication service a so called communication as a service or CaaS to a call center operator. Thus there is no requirement that the servers identified above actually be located or controlled by a call center operator.

In addition depending on the embodiment the agent positions may be co located in a single physical call center or multiple physical call centers. The agents may be remotely located from the other components of the call center and may also be remotely located from each other sometimes referred to as a virtual call center. In particular instances a virtual call center may describe a scenario in which agents work at home using their own computers and telephones as workstations. In some configurations a single physical location of the call center may not be readily identifiable. For instance this may occur when the call processing functions are provided as a service in a hosted cloud computing environment and the agents positions are in their individual residences. It is even possible for the supervisor to be remotely located e.g. work at home and such an arrangement does not negate the existence of the call center.

Those skilled in art will recognize represents one possible configuration of a call center architecture and that variations are possible with respect to the protocols facilities components technologies and equipment used. For example various algorithms and queuing arrangements may be defined to efficiently process and or place calls.

Turning next to additional detail is provided regarding how a particular call is analyzed by the RTSA system. In this illustration a three way call is established and shown as a dotted line. One call leg of the three way call involves the telephone of the remote party which is connected through the PSTN to the call handler . The call handler effectively provides a conference capability illustrated as a three way bridge although a variety of technologies can be used to provide such functionality or similar functionality of joining call legs together. Another call leg is established to the computer of an agent so that the agent and remote party can converse. Finally the call handler also establishes a third call leg to the RTSA . This allows the RTSA to listen and monitor the speech between the agent and remote party. Unlike a conventional three way call the RTSA may not be able to interject speech into the conference or if the bridge does allow it the RTSA typically does not provide speech into the conference. Consequently the call leg to the RTSA may be either bi directional or unidirectional.

The RTSA is configured to recognize the presence or absence of certain keywords which may be individual words or sets of words including phrases. Thus the RTSA may send an alert message based on the real time detected speech or lack thereof detected in a certain context. This alert message is received by the CARM which converts the message into an alert or update the checkpoint widget . In the context used herein an alert by itself without qualifying the word message is information designed to ultimately inform a person with minimal processing whereas an alert message refers to information designed to be further processed by a module. Thus the RTSA provides alert messages typically in a particular format to the CARM which then provides suitable alerts in a desirable form effective for human processing. The CARM may also store alert or checkpoint information in a checkpoint and alert data database .

The CARM processes the message received from the RTSA in order to provide a more useful and effective form of alert notification to the appropriate personnel or to update the checkpoint widget. The CARM may interface with a LAN for sending particular information to display devices in a more user friendly manner. For example the CARM may send RTSA alerts or update a checkpoint widget to a supervisor s workstation which the supervisor views. In other embodiments the CARM may send the RTSA alerts to a mobile device such as to a tablet which may have a Wi Fi interface. Other devices such as smart phone may be used by the supervisor.

Various embodiments of the concepts are reflected in the process flows contained in the figures. The logical operations described herein may be implemented 1 as a sequence of computer implemented acts or one or more program modules running on a computing system and or 2 as interconnected machine logic circuits or circuit modules within the computing system. The implementation is a matter of choice dependent on the performance and other requirements of the computing system. Accordingly the logical operations described herein are referred to variously as states operations structural devices acts or modules. These operations structural devices acts and modules may be implemented in software in firmware in special purpose digital logic and any combination thereof. Greater or fewer operations may be performed than shown in the figures and described herein. These operations may also be performed in a different order than those described herein.

The CARM receives the RTSA alert messages from the RTSA and processes this information in order to generate the RTSA alerts intended for human consumption. A high level process flow is shown in . The process flow begins with receiving the alert message from the RTSA in operation . This could be conveyed on a direct link or by using a LAN as shown in . The message can be provided using a variety of formats and the content is intended to be processed by the CARM. Typically the message provides information about the RTSA topic or keyword that was detected also referred to as the speech condition. This typically includes information such as the time of the detection of the speech condition an identifier of the particular call and in some embodiments information identifying the agent. Depending on how the RTSA topic is defined additional information may also reflect whether a topic e.g. keyword was detected during a call or its absence was noted during a call. In various embodiments the message does not convey information as to the severity impact or individuals to be notified. As can be appreciated the exact information conveyed in the alert message may vary in different embodiments. Typically the information at least identifies the speech condition detected on a specific call.

Next the CARM retrieves a current alert counter for that active call for that agent in operation . This counter reflects the current cumulative number of alerts received for that call and is incremented in operation . This count may be also stored in the agent s alert count in a database previously identified so that cumulative statistics may be maintained for the agent. In some embodiments cumulative counts for the number of alerts received during a call for an agent are maintained and may also be cumulatively maintained for the shift of the agent and or for an extended time period e.g. two weeks quarterly annually . This allows easy reference by a supervisor to evaluate the progress or trending pattern of the agent over time or view a snapshot of the agent s performance during the call or during their shift.

The current alert counter is then displayed in operation over an agent icon in an Alert Bubble which may be a circle encasing the numerical value. This is a static indication since it always appears in conjunction with the agent icon. The agent icon is a graphical representation of an agent. As will be seen there are other GUI formats which can be used in lieu of agent icons but the illustration herein is based on using agent icons.

The next steps are focused on displaying a dynamic alert indication. This may be displayed in a transient manner typically over or adjacent to the agent icon. First a display timer is started in operation . This timer defines how long the RTSA alert is displayed over the agent icon. This value is typically set between 1 and 15 seconds which is long enough to capture the attention of an individual looking at the agent icons and perhaps allows them to read the text provided with it but not too long that the cumulative display of RTSA alerts begins to clutter the display of agent icons. Other timer values may be used and the range of 1 15 seconds reflects a typical range and not any sort of limit. Short or longer range values may be used.

Next the RTSA alert is displayed in operation . The particular format of the RTSA alert may depend on the content of the RTSA message received from the RTSA. The format may reflect different colors icons fonts and text which may be based on the type and severity of the alert message. The CARM may use an alert mapping table discussed below to map an alert message to various colors fonts icons and text that is to be displayed. Reference to an alert mapping table is intended to encompass other types of data structures or mechanisms that may be used to perform the mapping function. Thus reference to the alert mapping table should not be interpreted as requiring a table structure in all embodiments.

The RTSA alert is usually displayed until the display timer expires. Hence in operation a decision reflects whether the timer has expired. If not the process loops back to operation which has the effect of maintaining the display. Once the timer expires in operation the process continues by removing the alert overlay from the display in operation . The process is completed at that point.

The steps that occur in operation that map the alert message into the RTSA alert for human review may greatly vary from embodiment to embodiment. The procedures defined herein reflect one approach which allows certain alert information to be quickly conveyed and subsequently reviewed in greater depth by a supervisor in a contact center. The potential for a large number of RTSA alerts which depends on the number of agents involved in simultaneous calls and the number of speech conditions detected can greatly vary. Thus the need to provide an effective synopsis of the relevant information depends on each embodiment. For example some RTSA alerts may inform of compliance violations that could result in legal liability to a contact center operator. Such violations need to be easily distinguished by the supervisor from other less critical RTSA alerts.

The user viewing the agent icon may choose to view additional information about the alert or other historical alerts associated with that particular agent. This may be accomplished by the user selecting the alert bubble or agent icon using a pointing device e.g. mouse joystick cursor control touch screen stylus etc. In one embodiment the user may select the alert bubble or the agent icon at any time including during the transient display of the alert indication over the agent icon. In another embodiment the user may select the agent icon after the display of the transient alert indication ceases. In this case the alert count shown in the alert bubble is displayed and informs the user that there was a prior alert indication received and that further information is available. This process flow is shown in .

Turning to the process flow begins with receiving an input from the user requesting additional alert details in operation . A determination is made for the selected agent whether there are in fact any reported alert indications for that specific agent. If the alert count is zero indication there are no prior alert indications then the process terminates as there is no further information to display. If however the alert count is non zero e.g. a positive number then there is additional alert information to be displayed. The appropriate information may be retrieved from a database an alert log or from memory. The alert details are provided in operation to the user. This may be displayed using a variety of formats. The information may be displayed until an input is received closing the alert detail box in operation . Thus if no such input is received the process loops back to display the alert detailed in operation . Once the input is received to close the alert detail box then the alert detail box is closed in operation . At that point the process is completed.

One format for displaying RTSA alerts involves overlaying a RTSA alert on an agent icon. Typically a grid of agent icons are viewed or presented at any given time. Before this aspect is reviewed further it is appropriate to illustrate one embodiment of an agent icon.

Turning to a representative agent icon is shown. This is a box containing information that is designed to identify an agent and provide high level status information. For the purpose of identifying the relevant agent each agent icon may include an image of the agent which may be a picture icon or caricature of the agent. If an image is not available a generic outline profile may be used. In addition a name of the agent is provided. This allows the supervisor to quickly associate the face and name of the agent for identification purposes.

A variety of status indicators may be provided. In this embodiment an indication of the call campaign is indicated. In this example the agent is fielding customer service calls. The agent state is reflected which may be connected paused waiting or logged off. Other states may be defined. Briefly connected means the agent is connected on a call pause means the agent is not on a call nor available to receive a call waiting means the agent is ready to receive another call and logged off means the agent has logged off of the call handler. A timer reflects how long that agent has been in that state. For logged off this value may be set to zero or null. Thus in agent Mary Thompson is currently engaged in a customer service call and has been doing so for the last two minutes and thirty four seconds.

Other information shown may include an agent station number which may reflect a particular workspace location physical telephone or logical phone being used by the agent. In addition a group indicator may be used to indicate what group the agent is assigned to. It is possible for example that there may be multiple groups assigned to the same campaign.

The select option icon allows a supervisor to select various functions that can be performed for that agent. These include barge in joining the call monitor to listen to the call or log off the agent to make the agent unavailable for further calls . Other functions may be defined.

Finally the agent icon may include a color portion shown in the figure as a shade of gray although in practice various colors may be used. The color may reflect the state of the agent which can provide an easier means of identifying an agent s state as opposed to reading text . Further the colors can also reflect other states such as being monitored or a specific activity while in the paused state. Other embodiments may use different shadings hatching patterns etc.

A collection of agent icons may be assembled on a screen of a workstation or tablet. One embodiment is shown in . In this figure the screen is referred to as having a grid layout of agent icons because the agent icons are typically arranged in rows and columns e.g. a grid . Typically a subset of all the available agent icons are shown on a single screen which necessitates navigation controls for selecting an appropriate page. Further tools may be provided such as a sorting icon or a filter icon for searching and or sorting through the agent icons.

In one embodiment the RSTA alerts are dynamically overlaid on the grid of agent icons. Specifically a RTSA alert for a particular agent is overlaid on the corresponding agent icon. One embodiment of a RSTA alert is shown in . In the agent icon for Mary Thompson is shown. However overlaid is the RTSA alert . In this embodiment the RTSA alert is partially transparent so that portions of the underlying image may still be seen. In other embodiments as will be seen the RTSA alert may be opaque so that the underlying image is not seen.

Each RTSA alert will cause an alert bubble to appear. In this embodiment the alert bubble is a circle although in other embodiments other shapes may be used. In some embodiments just a number may be present. The number a.k.a. a count represents the cumulative number of alerts for that agent during the current call. In other embodiments the number may be defined with respect to the current shift in the last hour the past week etc. In this embodiment it is assumed that the number is based on the current call. Thus in this is the first alert reported for the current call involving this agent.

An alert icon is provided which provides a ready indication of whether the alert reflects a positive or negative condition. Recall that alerts may reflect the detection of a speech condition or the absence of a speech condition. Depending on how the speech condition is identified the reporting of the condition could be a positive occurrence. For example agents may be trained to thank the caller at the end of a call and consequently detecting this speech condition would be viewed as a positive occurrence. In this example the agent has done so and consequently a positive icon is shown.

The RTSA alert may also include text that informs the reader on the specifics of the alert. For example text may be provided that reflects a date time and call identifier for the speech condition that was detected. A time into the current call may be indicated. This allows identification of the speech should verification be desired. Further text may reflect the particular RTSA topic that was detected. Finally a color background may be used to indicate the particular type of alert severity of alert etc. For example a positive condition may include a green background whereas a negative condition may incorporate a red background. Other colors or visual patterns may be used.

The RTSA alert may appear by fading in over the agent icon for the duration of a display timer and then may fade out upon the expiration of the timer. The use of a background color and an icon allows the viewer to readily ascertain the relative importance of the alert even if the supervisor does not read the text and only sees the RTSA alert for a fraction of a second. Further the alert bubble provides a simple means to review which agents are encountering a large number of alerts. This provides an easy to use mechanism allowing the supervisor to evaluate an alert.

The alert icon in this embodiment is a warning icon reflecting that a negative speech condition was detected. This may be accompanied by a red background color . The alert also includes text that reflects the date time and call the time into the call the topic detected and in this case additional information related to additional actions namely that an escalation has been initiated . This may reflect a notification was sent to another individual regarding the presence of the alert.

In various embodiments the viewer may select the alert bubble by selecting the alert bubble icon. Depending on the technology involved this may involve the user using a mouse to position a cursor over the alert bubble or using some other pointing device. In it is assumed that a touch screen is being used on a tablet and the user may select the bubble alert by touching it with his finger . Selecting the alert bubble will cause a pop up window to appear as shown in . This pop up window includes text associated with the prior alerts. A more detailed view of the pop up window is shown in

Turning to the pop up window may include text portions that reflect the text with prior alerts. The agent may chose to read and mark these as having been reviewed. Separate controls may be presented allowing the agent to review all of the alerts for the agent or only those unread. In addition another portion of the pop up window includes a positivity score and a compliance score . These scores provide a summary of the current standing on the agent s performance relative to customer service e.g. positivity and compliance. These scores are assigned to each detected RTSA topic and allow a weighting of the relative importance of the detected speech conditions.

Other graphical formats may be used for displaying a RTSA alert. One such format involves a graphical depiction of an office layout or floor plan. The floor plan represents the locations of the workspaces of the various agents. One such representation is shown in . In the floor plan layout a quadrant of workspaces and are defined. Each workspace has e.g. a chair and a workstation used by an agent. The quadrant of workspaces may be in turn replicated as needed. In the floor plan shown a total of sixteen agent workspaces are shown.

Each agent may be assigned a workspace location and the supervisor may associate a workspace location on the floor plan with a particular agent. Thus when a RTSA alert is displayed over a work location the supervisor can then associate the alert with the agent. One embodiment of a dynamically displayed RTSA alert is shown in . In this figure the RTSA alert is overlaid at the workspace of the agent. The alert bubble is displayed as well along with the agent s name and picture . The positioning of the agent s name and picture facilitates identification of the agent by the supervisor in addition to placing the RTSA alert over that agent s workspace. This may be useful for some embodiments where agents may share a workspace for different shifts or days during the week. The RTSA alert is temporarily displayed and will fade out after the display timer expires.

The supervisor can select the workspace to review additional information regarding the alert. This can be accomplished by using a pointing device as disclosed before. Once the workspace is selected the alert text box shown in may be displayed. This allows the supervisor to read additional details of the latest or other previous alerts. The supervisor can close the alert text box when completed. This allows the supervisor to then view other RTSA alerts or select other workspace locations for investigation.

The prior embodiments illustrate application of various graphical formats for displaying the overlaid RTSA alerts. It is also possible to use a tabular format for displaying overlaid RTSA alerts. The use of tabular format operates in concept similar to the graphical format except that a spreadsheet like format may be employed. One embodiment is shown in . In the table comprises various columns with various identifiers. Included is a column for the agent s name and a column for the number of current RTSA alerts. This represents the number of current alerts for the call that the agent is currently connected to. In addition another column for the number of cumulative RTSA alerts is shown. This represents the number of alerts associated with that agent since the beginning of a time period such as in the past hour since the start of their shift for the week etc.

In this embodiment the dynamically displayed RTSA alert comprises an icon which may be temporarily displayed. This draws attention to the supervisor viewing the table that a RTSA alert has been reported. In other embodiments additional information may be presented regarding the alert it severity etc.

If the supervisor desires to view further information the supervisor may again use a pointing device such as a mouse joystick or stylus to select the cell for that agent to receive additional information. A touch screen could also be used. Once selected additional alert information may be presented as shown in . In the alert text window is presented which provides the additional information. The supervisor can then close the alert text window when viewing is completed.

No doubt that one skilled in the art may be able to devise variations on the concepts and technologies disclosed above in light of the present disclosure. There are a variety of graphical formats that can be used for defining the contents of agent icons how they are arranged and how RTSA alerts are defined and displayed. For example other floor plan configurations are readily possible that could be used including using rows and other workspace cluster formations. With respect to using a tabular based presentation interface the tabular arrangement can be displayed as a real time dashboard and may incorporate or display other information in real time.

Turning to the table in a number of columns are presented. The first column is the RTSA Topic column which functions as an index. Although represented as text it usually is a numerical value corresponding to a particular speech condition. For example the Welcome Greeting topic or keyword refers to the RTSA system detecting the presence of an appropriate greeting by the agent upon answering the call. Upon detecting this RTSA topic an alert is formatted as defined by the various other characteristics.

For example the second column defines a color to be used when displaying the RTSA alert. In the case of the Welcome Greeting topic it is a green color. Further the next column indicates the appropriate icon to use which is illustrated as a checkmark. In practice again the value in the table would be a numerical value corresponding to that icon. There may be a correlation between the icon used and the level of severity associated with the event. There may be a number of different types of alerts which correlated to a warning severity level each of which may have a different number of points associated therewith. Thus different actions could be defined to occur at different severity levels. Thus a warning severity may correlate to displaying a certain icon and text to an agent or supervisor whereas a severe severity level may entail a different action. Typically there are a few number of severity levels defined e.g. typically 5 or less .

The fourth column indicates to whom the alert should be sent to. In this case it is sent to the supervisor according to the configured way e.g. using an agent icon grid tabular format etc. . Other alerts may result in another message e.g. a text message being sent to a team leader or other individual. The fifth column defines the text that should be displayed with the particular alert. This is in a human readable form and in the example shown the text indicates Greeting Detected .

The next two columns represent positivity score points and compliance score points . These represent mechanisms to allocate a weight to the detected speech condition. This allows the supervisor to review a cumulative score that represents how well the agent is performing. The categories and definition of these scores can vary significantly from embodiment to embodiment but they represent a numerical value associated with certain speech conditions that reflects a current and or aggregate performance metric of the agent.

The indication of a severity level may also be included which may be separate from the number of points provided with a detected speech condition. The number of points may reflect a granularity which is not possible or appropriate with defining various severity levels. For example a scale of 1 to 100 allows various points to be allocated to various conditions and it would not be practical to define 100 different severity levels. Typically there are a few levels e.g. five or less severity levels which may correlated to certain colors icons etc. The score allows a separate and independent approach for measuring speech conditions separate from defining severity levels.

The positivity score may be allocated to speech conditions which represent good behavior. By allocating a negative score a bad behavior can be represented. In one embodiment these speech conditions can be linked to customer service goals. For example the alert mapping table allocates positivity score points for providing a welcome greeting and providing a proper wrap up e.g. thanking the customer and asking if there are any other questions they may assist with . On the other hand points are subtracted if the agent states a curse word during the call. Thus the cumulative number of positivity points can be used to evaluate how well the agent is performing in these aspects.

Similarly the compliance score points may be allocated on matters that relate to compliance issues. These may be assigned to detecting compliance related speech conditions. For example the alert mapping table allocates negative compliance points for two topics. Specifically 20 points are allocated whenever the lawyer retained topic is detected and the agent continues to collect the debt and 100 points when the mini Miranda speech condition is not detected. The lawyer retained topic may be defined as detecting attempts by the agent to continue collecting a debt when the party has informed the agent that they have retained a lawyer. In this case the agent should cease any attempts to collect a debt and attempting to do so may be a violation of a regulation. The mini Miranda speech condition reflects that the agent should inform the party that the purpose of the call is to collect a debt. Thus the mini Miranda should be stated shortly after the call is answered. Violation of this condition may be a serious compliance violation and the allocation of 100 points may represent that it is considered a more serious violation than the lawyer retained violation. Consequently the agent s compliance with various regulations may be gauged by examining their net compliance score.

There may be other score types defined based on the goals desired by the contact center to monitor and evaluate a particular type of agent behavior. For example a number of RTSA topics could be defined as up selling. These topics could detect speech conditions that reflect when the agent is offering the customer additional items to go with a purchase. Points could be allocated for asking the customer if a matching belt is desired to go along with a purchase of shoes. Points could be allocated for asking if the customer would like another item in a different color etc. A cumulative up selling score could be maintained for measuring an agent s effectiveness in this category. Thus there may be a variety of score types that may be maintained for an agent.

The alert mapping table also shows a checkpoint column which indicates whether the RTSA topic or keyword is defined as a checkpoint or not. In one embodiment a binary flag can indicate whether the keyword is defined as a checkpoint. In the embodiment shown in the wrap up and Mini Miranda topics are defined as a checkpoint. In other embodiments there may be a number of checkpoint categories defined. Thus there could be a set of checkpoints for compliance purposes another for positivity purposes etc. Each of the checkpoints may be displayed using a specific graphical user interface element in the form of a checkpoint widget to the agent or to a supervisor. In such embodiments the checkpoint column may have one of several identifiers indicated as opposed to a binary flag. Or in other embodiments there could be different checkpoint column types indicated. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various data structures and methods could be used to indicate whether the keyword correlates to a checkpoint.

Other columns may be defined in the alert mapping table. These can provide other characteristics associated with how the RTSA alert could be provided. Particularly urgent or significant speech conditions that are detected may be associated with a providing a sound in addition to presenting an icon. Or the RTSA alert could result in a supplemental message delivered to the agent s workstation an immediate text message sent to a supervisor etc. Other graphical user interface techniques for drawing attention could be used for example an RTSA alert could be mapped to a blinking or flashing icon. In other embodiments a set of points could be deposited into a virtual account maintained for the agent which is then used by the contact center management when scheduling agents. These points could be used to give priority to the agent for future work scheduling decisions. For example the agent with the best compliance score could be given priority for requesting the day off for the next upcoming holiday. Thus there may be a variety of additional characteristics defined for how a topic is mapped to an alert indication.

Further other data structures and names than above disclosed table may be used. Thus the alert mapping table refers to any form of data structure and or process that maps a RTSA message from a RTSA system to a form designed for human review whether it may be a list linked tables a database rule process etc. The alert mapping table could also be referred to as a checkpoint and alert data structure or similar name if the structure also contains information related to checkpoints.

As discussed above an event message received from an RTSA system may be processed so as to result in dynamically displaying an alert on a supervisor s processing device. It is also possible to process event messages from an RTSA system to provide information regarding the progress of the call with respect to a set of checkpoints. A checkpoint is a point during a voice call that is associated with the expected or possible occurrence of a speech event. This could be analogized as indicating the occurrence of certain expected benchmarks during a call. Typically there are a chronological series of checkpoints for a call associated with a particular campaign. Frequently different campaigns will have different checkpoints which reflect the expected flow of the conversation between the parties. For example a debt collection campaign call will typically involve a point in the call where the agent asks if the remote party can make a payment. In contrast a non profit campaign call soliciting donations will typically involve a point in the call where the agent asks whether the remote party wishes to make a donation. Making a payment is different from making a donation and these could be defined as different checkpoints for these different campaigns. Thus the RTSA system would likely be configured to recognize different keywords for these different campaigns.

It is even possible for a given call of a particular campaign to have different types of checkpoints identified. Thus a series of checkpoints could be defined to ensure that the agent is courteous. There could be a welcome and closing checkpoint for each call and then a separately defined set of compliance checkpoints during the call. Thus there is great flexibility in defining which keywords would be considered to be a checkpoint.

To convey the occurrence of a checkpoint it is useful to provide a collection of visual elements displayed on a computer screen which may comprise text icons and symbols that represent the set of chronological checkpoints associated with the call. These elements may indicate whether the checkpoint occurred. This collection of visual elements indicating which checkpoints have occurred is referred to herein as a widget. Specifically because the widget provides information about checkpoints during a call it may be referred to more specifically as a call checkpoint widget checkpoint widget. For purposes of brevity it will be simply referred to as a widget. 

The display of a widget may be provided on the workstation of an agent or a supervisor which provides the viewer with a quick easy to comprehend indicator of the status of the various checkpoints during a call. Each checkpoint is associated with a checkpoint indicator on the widget and each checkpoint indicator may also be accompanied by text that informs the reader of the nature of the checkpoint. The checkpoint indicator may also referred to as a checkpoint status indicator because the indicator usually indicates a status of the corresponding checkpoint during a particular call. The text associated with the checkpoint indicator may be referred to as the checkpoint indicator text. Returning to the above example of a debt collection call there may be a checkpoint indicator reflecting whether the agent has asked for payment. The checkpoint indicator text could be Ask for Payment. Similarly for the non profit solicitation call referred to above the checkpoint indicator text could be Ask for Donation. The text of the checkpoint indicator is defined by the contact center administrator prior to processing of calls and can be any text which conveys the purpose of the checkpoint.

One instance of a widget is shown in . This widget is associated with a debt collection call campaign. As evident unique widgets could be defined for a variety of campaigns such as solicitation calls surveys customer service etc. The widget is characterized by a plurality of checkpoint indicators . Each checkpoint indicator is associated with a checkpoint which is a point during a voice call associated with the expected or possible occurrence of a speech event. The checkpoint indicators are arranged in a chronological i.e. the expected order of occurrence by being overlaid onto time line . Based on convention movement from left to right on the time line reflects the passage of time. Although the checkpoint indicators are shown equidistant on the time line this does not necessarily mean that the occurrence of the checkpoints themselves are equidistant over time. Typically the fact that checkpoint indicator is positioned to the left of checkpoint indicator indicates that it is expected to occur before checkpoint indicator . Thus the instance of the widget shown in has five checkpoint indicators correlating to five expected instances of speech that are expected to be detected.

Because the widget may be updated over time e.g. as the call progresses and checkpoints are detected the depiction of the widget in is necessarily a snapshot in time as the widget would be displayed over time. Thus this depiction is referred to as an instance of the widget.

In this embodiment each checkpoint indicator is associated with checkpoint indicator text . The first text is Recording Disclaimer. This checkpoint indicator text is typically defined by an administrator prior to processing of calls. The text is merely a short label that reflects the speech expected with the checkpoint in order to inform the user of the nature of the checkpoint represented. In this example involving debt collection campaign calls the calls are recorded and the agent is expected to indicate to the remote party that the call is being recorded. This recording disclaimer text reflects that the agent is expected to provide some sort of disclaimer of the call recording to the remote party.

Similarly the Mini Miranda text associated with the checkpoint indicator reflects a requirement for debt collection calls that the agent inform the remote party that this is a debt collection call. This disclaimer is referred to as a Mini Miranda in the debt collection industry. Thus the checkpoint indicator reflects whether the agent has provided an appropriate mini Miranda statement to the remote party.

Similarly the Verify Contact text associated with the checkpoint indicator reflects the requirement for the agent to verify that they are speaking with the debtor and not with some other member of the household. The Ask for Payment text is associated with a separate checkpoint indicator and reflects the requirement that the agent ask the debtor to make a payment. Thus this checkpoint indicator is encountered when the agent has asked the debtor for payment. Finally the Thank Customer text is associated with the last checkpoint indicator which reflects that the agent should thank the remote party at the end of the call.

It can be appreciated that the checkpoint indicators are shown in a chronological order that reflects the order typically encountered in most calls. The recording disclaimer must be provided at the beginning of the call and the mini Miranda should be provided before any substantive discussion of the debt. Similarly the remote party should be verified before any substantive discussion of the debt. At some point after these three checkpoint indicators the agent should ask for payment of the debt and it is typically at the end of the call that the agent thanks the customer. In other embodiments it is possible that there are different possibilities as to when the checkpoints occur on a given call. This depends on how the checkpoints are defined type of call etc. Whether this is possible may impact the choice of format of the widget as will be seen.

Further the thickened portion reflects that this checkpoint was in the past. Further the second checkpoint indicator is overlaid with an X perhaps using a red color. This reflects that this checkpoint was not detected. In other words the widget reflects the agent did not properly provide the mini Miranda statement to the remote party on this call. The X may not be determined until the next checkpoint is detected. Next the third checkpoint indicator occurs. Based on the text this checkpoint reflects whether the agent has verified the remote party s name. Since this checkpoint indicator has been modified the checkpoint has been detected.

At this point in time the widget indicates that the next checkpoint indicator is associated with the agent asking for payment. The thin thickness of line indicates that the call has not yet progressed to this point of the call. In other embodiments a marker may be shown associated with the current expected checkpoint or the last detected checkpoint.

It is possible that the agent may first confirm the contact s name and once confirmed then provide the person with the mini Miranda statement. If so then the second checkpoint indicator may be changed so that the X is removed and instead a green circle indicator may be shown. This widget format is well suited when there is a fixed and certain chronological sequence of checkpoints expected during the call. If the checkpoints occur in a non predictable order then other widget formats may be used or the indicator may not be marked with an X .

The widget shown in illustrates that a number of checkpoints can be expected during the call. The widget indicates in real time which checkpoints have or have not occurred as the call progresses. This provides an easy to comprehend status of the call allowing an agent or supervisor to quickly view and understand how the call is progressing. While in theory this could provide the same information as the RTSA alerts previously discussed the widget provides a quicker and easier to use format indicating how an agent is doing on a call. Specifically there is no need to select a view of the history of the alerts. Further the RTSA alerts reflect additional information about keywords which are not necessary defined as checkpoints which requires the user to manually filter out those RTSA alerts which are not defined as checkpoints. Further requiring the agent to view RTSA alerts in real time may be distracting to the agent.

Although not shown in each checkpoint indicator text could also include or have displayed adjacent to it information regarding the corresponding points e.g. a score associated with successfully detecting the checkpoint or which could be deducted if not detected . For example could indicate that 10 points are allocated when properly providing the disclaimer 20 points are provided for properly providing the mini Miranda statement etc. A real time point counter could be also displayed which provides the agent with a real time quantitative indication of how well they are conforming to the contact center policies and regulations based on the occurrences of checkpoints. This can serve to motivate the agent to improve their performance.

The determination of whether the status of a particular checkpoint should be marked e.g. as checkpoint indicator as to indicate whether the checkpoint has not yet occurred has occurred or was skipped may be associated with further information maintained in conjunction with the checkpoint that is referred to as checkpoint relativity information CRI . The CRI provides information that specifies when a first checkpoint should occur if at all relative to other checkpoints in order to determine if that checkpoint was omitted. For example the agent may be expected to verify the identity of the person answering the call which is the Verify Contact checkpoint and may also be expected to provide the mini Miranda statement which is the mini Miranda checkpoint. In some embodiments the mini Miranda must occur before verifying the contact in other embodiments the order may not matter as long as both of these occur before the agent discusses the debt or asks for payment. Further both the mini Miranda checkpoint and Verifying Contact checkpoints should occur after the agent provides the recording disclaimer. In order to know whether the agent omitted providing the speech corresponding to a particular checkpoint it is necessary to know when that checkpoint is expected to occur relative to other checkpoints. In summary it may not be known that a checkpoint was skipped until a subsequent checkpoint is detected.

In this example the Recording Disclaimer must be the first checkpoint encountered. If it is provided after any other checkpoint then the disclaimer is not effective. Next the mini Miranda or Verify Contact checkpoint should occur perhaps in either order or with a specific order. However because the fourth checkpoint reflects the agent asking for payment it should always occur after both the Verify Contact and the mini Miranda checkpoints. If the Ask for Payment checkpoint occurs before both the mini Miranda or Verify Contact checkpoints then a checkpoint has been skipped. Finally the Thank Customer checkpoint should always be the last checkpoint.

How the CRI is defined for the checkpoints may impact how these checkpoints are indicated on the widget. If the Recording Disclaimer is defined to be first checkpoint then detecting any other checkpoint means that the Recording Disclaimer was not properly provided and the checkpoint indicator can then be marked as not properly occurring or having been skipped.

However in regard to the mini Miranda and Verify Contact checkpoints these can occur in either order so that detecting one does not necessarily mean the other has been skipped. However if that missing checkpoint is not provided by the time before the Ask for Payment checkpoint has been detected then the agent has failed to provide the requisite speech. Thus it is evident that the CRI is necessary in order to know how and when to properly mark the checkpoint indicators on the widget as having not been detected yet or not having been provided at all.

The CRI may take various forms and may indicate for example whether a checkpoint must be the first second third etc. checkpoint detected. The CRI may indicate whether a first checkpoint must occur before or after another checkpoint or set of checkpoints. The logic and means by which the appropriate relationship among the checkpoints can be defined may vary according to embodiments. Further CRI may be stored in some manner in the alert table of detailing the CRI for each of the checkpoints or using a separate data structure. However stored the CRI allows a greater degree of control in determining how to ascertain a missing checkpoint or process an out of order checkpoint during a call.

It is possible to further indicate on the widget or in a separate portion of the window information about the CRI. This could take the form of a symbol which indicates whether the checkpoint must occur first or must be preceded by certain other checkpoints. This can be graphically illustrated using various diagrammatic structures that convey a required relative order.

In addition to marking a checkpoint as not being properly provided in the above circumstance other actions may occur when a checkpoint has been determined to have been skipped. It is possible to display a pop up window to the agent providing compliance information generate a report message transfer a call join another party to the call initiate a message over a web based application programming interface write data to a log etc. This allows tracking reporting or other actions to occur in response to determining a checkpoint was overlooked by the agent.

Turing to another format of a checkpoint widget is shown. As can be appreciated one skilled in the art could develop a number of different widget formats in light of the present specification to graphically illustrate the progress and status of various checkpoints during a call. In this embodiment a screen shot is shown that may be presented to an agent during a call. The screen shot may be presented to the agent on a workstation comprising a computer and may involve using a number of various technologies including as a web page thin client application on the workstation or an application executing on the workstation.

A first section may include account information of the person the agent is communicating with. This may provide account information such as the remote party s name account type balance due address etc. Also shown is another screen section that comprises the widget with checkpoints. In this embodiment the checkpoints are arranged as a series of checkboxes and text in a list format. There is an implied time line reflecting the passage of time in a downward manner e.g. the first checkpoint associated with the first line is expected to occur before the second checkpoint in the second line etc .

The first checkpoint checkbox is shown as checked denoting that it has occurred. That is the recording disclaimer provided by the agent was detected and reported by the RTSA system. The second checkpoint does not show the checkpoint checked and this reflects that the mini Miranda statement was not detected as being provided by the agent. The third checkpoint has its corresponding checkbox shown as checked which reflects that the agent has verified the contact e.g. verified the name of the person contacted . The fourth checkpoint and the fifth checkpoint have not been reported as being detected.

If the agent were to provide the mini Miranda then the second checkpoint checkbox may be then checked. This particular format may be more suited to calls in which the chronological order of checkpoints is not as predictable. Furthermore it is also possible to also indicate for each checkpoint the number of points each checkpoint may contribute to a total score associated with the call. It is also possible to define the CRI so that it can be easily determined if a checkpoint was skipped during a call and then somehow signify this on the checkbox such as displaying an X .

The widgets illustrated in B and A illustrate checkpoints that are normally expected to occur on a call. It is also possible to use a widget to depict the occurrence of a checkpoint that is unexpected during a call. These may include undesirable events detected by the RTSA system which reflect the occurrence of undesirable speech. This may include asking for inappropriate information providing a discourteous response or using inappropriate language. It is possible to depict such checkpoints in a transient manner such as shown in . In other embodiments the checkpoint could be added to the widget after it is detected potentially using a different font size or color to indicate that the checkpoint indicator was added during the call.

Turning to the same screen shot is shown but with an added icon and text . This comprises a warning symbol and text that reflects the speech condition that was detected for this checkpoint. This allows feedback to the agent to reinforce speech that is not desired for whatever reason. In this embodiment the icon and text remains displayed until the agent acknowledges the alert. Further the icon and text are only displayed once the checkpoint has been detected. In other embodiments the alert could be displayed for a predefined time period. In other embodiments the information may be logged into a file recording the agent s checkpoints or a notification message could be sent to the agent s supervisor or team leader. The functional operation of this type of checkpoint begins to become very similar to the operation of an alert.

A sliding viewing tool or simply slider can be manipulated by the user using a mouse and moved sideways. As the slider moves it displays the checkpoint indicator text over the corresponding checkpoint box. For example in the slider is positioned over checkpoint box 5 and the corresponding checkpoint indicator text is Verify Contact. If the user desires to see the checkpoint indicator text for checkpoint indicator 1 or for any other one then the user can use a pointer mouse or other device to select and move the slider to the appropriate contact indicator where the checkpoint indicator text will appear.

Although illustrate various types of checkpoint widgets no doubt other variations can be defined which indicate which checkpoints have been encountered during a particular call. Thus the embodiments disclosed herein are not intended to be exhaustive but merely illustrative of the different types of widgets that can be presented.

Prior to processing calls and indicating their current status it is necessary to define the speech events are to be detected and reported by the RTSA system for a given campaign. These events may be then processed by the CARM to generate the appropriate modifications to the widget being displayed. As indicated previously it is not necessary that every reported speech event corresponds to a checkpoint. Many reported events are used to score the agent s performance or otherwise measure the agent s compliance but are not necessarily defined to be a checkpoint. The definition of which events are defined as checkpoints is based on various business and operational factors. For example a contact center operator may encourage agents to provide a friendly welcome greeting when the remote party answers the call. This greeting may be e.g. a phrase good morning my name is . . . . The contact center operator may define good morning as a keyword or topic that is to be detected and reported. The agent may even receive points going towards their compliance or performance scores. However the agent s failure to provide such a greeting may not be deemed a serious violation and this keyword may not be defined as a checkpoint. Consequently even thought this keyword may be reported as an event and scored it does not necessarily appear on the widget because it is not defined as a checkpoint though it may be defined as an alert.

At some point during the process the user may also define one of several formats that are to be used for the widget. As one skilled in the art would appreciate in light of the present specification there are various graphical formats that can be used to construct the widget. A system may provide a single default widget format or may allow the user to select which of several formats to use. The user may select the format in operation if such an option is provided.

Once the keyword has been identified and indicated as a checkpoint an embodiment of the process for handling a call is depicted in . In the flow begins with retrieving the next call record from a dialing list in operation . The call record typically includes or allows access to information such as shown in such as the remote party s number and account information.

This information and other information may be used to populate certain portions of the agent s screen as indicated in operation . Part of the populating of the agent s screen includes displaying a checkpoint widget in the selected format. At this stage the widget will be displayed in an initial state with none of the checkpoints indicated as having occurred see e.g. . In some embodiments this may involve displaying the text associated with each checkpoint indicator.

Next the call is originated in operation . Once the call is answered event messages may be received at the CARM from the RTSA system. The process flow shown in presumes that at least one event is received from the RTSA system in operation as will usually be the case . The event message reports the detection of a previously defined keyword in the speech by the agent on the voice call.

Since not all events will be necessarily indicated as checkpoints a test is made in operation as to whether this particular event is indicated as a checkpoint. If it is then an update to the widget being displayed occurs in operation . As explained previously this may involve modifying the shading color or adding a visual element to the widget. Since the checkpoints are different the appropriate checkpoint correlated with the event message must be updated.

If the call is over in operation the process is done. Typically the widget will be reset to its initial state for the next call. If the call is not over then a test is made in operation to determine if another event is received. If so the process loops back to determining whether the event is indicated as a checkpoint in operation . If no event is received but the call is still active then the process loops back to operation to see if the call is completed.
