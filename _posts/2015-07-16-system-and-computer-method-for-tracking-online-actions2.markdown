title: System and computer method for tracking online actions
abstract: System and computer-implemented method of dynamically modifying a user interface and displaying a circular meter with a selectable slider. The identity of the UI is extracted from the UI and looked up in a table to determine two scores associated with the UI. A UI-specific score indicates how many actions a user has taken with the UI, and a total score indicates how many actions a user has taken with all UIs that the user has permitted to track. A graphic having two concentric circular meters is combined with the UI to produce a composite UI that is displayed to the user as the user is interacting with the UI. The meters fill up in opposite directions, and a slider on one of the meters can be slid clockwise or anti-clockwise to permit the user to make a selection based on the two scores.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

Aspects of the present disclosure relate generally to systems and methods of improving interactions with a machine using an electronic human machine interface and an electronic display.

Online users or users of smartphone or tablet apps as they are called today take various types of intentional actions on websites or computer systems they access over a computer network such as the Internet. Owners or operators of websites or computer systems accessed by the users have very limited visibility if any into a user s overall online interactions with that owner or operator s website or computer system let alone other websites or computer systems owned or operated by others. Relatedly online users or users of apps lack a mechanism for informing an owner or operator of a website or computer system the frequency or extent of that user s online activities generally or with that owner or operator s website or computer system. Web browser or app users also lack a mechanism for viewing at a glance their historical activities with a particular owner or operator or generally with multiple owners or operators across a computer network. Aspects of the present disclosure solve these and other problems and fulfill these and other needs.

Having this enhanced visibility would improve the computer network by making interactions between users and operators more meaningful and efficient. Millions of online transactions and activities are conducted every day with little if any historical context or understanding about the value of the user who accesses a particular computer system or service.

According to an aspect of the present disclosure a computer implemented method is disclosed of dynamically modifying an electronic user interface downloaded for display on one or more electronic video displays. The method includes capturing using an electronic computer a plurality of physical inputs made via one or more human machine interface devices. Each of the inputs is indicative of a human machine action taken on one or more software applications and associated with an electronic user account of a human user. The human machine action includes receiving an electronic representation of a physical input of a selectable element on an electronic user interface featuring one or more items. The electronic user account includes a name of the human user. The method further includes associating using the computer each of the plurality of inputs with a corresponding point value where an extent of the point value is a function of at least a type of the respective human machine action associated with the respective one of the inputs to produce a plurality of point values calculating using the computer a total score based on all of the corresponding point values associated with the plurality of physical inputs calculating using the computer for each of a plurality of existing electronic user interfaces an interface specific score that is based on at least some of the point values associated with the corresponding one of the plurality of existing electronic user interfaces dynamically generating using the computer a composite electronic user interface from at least 1 a selected one of the existing electronic user interfaces downloaded from an external computer server over a computer network selected user interface and 2 the interface specific score corresponding to the selected user interface.

The dynamically generating includes extracting from the selected user interface or the external computer server at least identification information of the selected user interface to determine which of the interface specific scores to select retrieving using the computer the total score and the selected interface specific score that corresponds to the selected user interface determined by the extracting and featuring a dynamically changing graphical representation with the existing electronic user interface the dynamically changing graphical representation featuring a first graphical element representing the selected interface specific score corresponding to the selected user interface and a second graphical element representing the total score to produce the composite electronic user interface that includes at least a portion of the existing electronic user interface and the dynamically changing graphical representation. The computer implemented method further including causing the composite electronic user interface to be displayed on one of the one or more electronic video display devices.

The extracting can further extracts an attribute of an item portrayed on the selected user interface wherein the attribute includes a number indicative of a value of the item. The identification information extracted from the selected user interface can include an identity of a creator or owner of the content portrayed on the selected user interface or an operator of the selected user interface. The attribute can further include any one or more of an image of the item a quantity of a desired number of the items a size of the item a color of the item or an expiration of the item. The extracting can include connecting to the external server via an application programming interface API and requesting through the API the identification information and the attribute.

The computer implemented can further include dynamically generating using the computer a second composite electronic user interface from at least 1 a second selected one of the existing electronic user interfaces downloaded from a second external computer server over a computer network second selected user interface and 2 the interface specific score corresponding to the second selected user interface. The dynamically generating the second composite electronic user interface includes extracting from the second selected user interface or the second external computer server at least identification information of the second selected user interface to determine a second one of the interface specific scores to select retrieving using the computer the total score and the selected second interface specific score that corresponds to the second selected user interface and dynamically changing the graphical representation on the second existing electronic user interface such that the first graphical element represents the second selected interface specific score corresponding to the second selected user interface and the second graphical element represents the total score to produce the second composite electronic user interface that includes at least a portion of the second existing electronic user interface and the dynamically changed graphical representation. The computer implemented method further includes causing the second composite electronic user interface to be displayed on any of the one or more electronic video display devices.

The computer implemented method further includes monitoring using the computer a frequency that the plurality of physical inputs are made and enhancing the extent of the point value as a function of the frequency such that point values are accumulated toward the total score at a faster rate as the frequency increases. The type of the human machine action can include 1 completing an electronic transaction to cause an item to be conveyed to a physical location as directed by the human user associated with the user account 2 submitting an electronic review for an item portrayed on an electronic user interface 3 sharing information about an item on a social media networking user interface or 4 storing information about an item for later retrieval for completing an electronic transaction involving the stored item.

Prior to the step of dynamically generating each of the existing electronic user interfaces can be unmodified by the claimed method. The one or more software applications can include an electronic web browser used on a computing device operated by the user or a dedicated software application used on a computing device operated by the user. The computing device can be a personal computer a portable tablet computer a portable smartphone or a portable laptop computer.

The dynamically generating can further include adding to the composite electronic user interface a selectable element that in response to being selected via the one or more human machine interface devices causes the composite electronic user interface as displayed on the electronic video to include attributes of the item including its value. The computer implemented method can further include dynamically changing the second graphical element as the total score increases as a result of accumulating additional point value associated with additional physical inputs on the one or more software applications and updating the composite electronic user interface to cause any of the one or more electronic video displays device to display the dynamically changed second graphical element in real time.

The computer implemented method can further include receiving via the one or more human machine interface devices a physical input representing a reduction in the value of the item receiving via the electronic network interface device an indication whether the reduction is accepted responsive to the reduction being accepted the computer determining whether the reduction exceeds a threshold and if so reducing the interface specific score to produce a reduced score causing to be displayed on the electronic video display device a new value based on the value and the reduction and the electronic computer communicating over the computer network to complete an electronic transaction on the composite user interface using the new value to cause the item to be conveyed to a physical location as directed by the human user associated with the user account.

The threshold can be commensurate with the interface specific score such that the higher the interface specific score the higher the threshold thereby allowing a higher reduction to be requested the higher the interface specific score. The computer implemented method can further include determining based on at least the interface specific score a selected one of a plurality of levels where each of the levels defines a range of permissible reductions and a range of protected reductions. The range of permissible reductions can be bounded by a minimum reduction that can be requested to reduce the value of the item and by a maximum reduction that can be requested to reduce the value of the item. The range of protected reductions can be bounded by a minimum protected reduction that can be requested to reduce the value of the item without causing a reduction in the interface specific score or in the total score and by a maximum protected reduction that can be requested to reduce the value of the item without causing a reduction in the interface specific score or in the total score. The range of permissible reductions and the range of protected reductions can increase with each level of the plurality of levels.

The dynamically changing graphical representation can be portrayed on the electronic video display as an overlay relative to the existing electronic user interface or is embedded into the existing electronic user interface. The graphical representation can include an avatar. The computer implemented method can further include communicating via an electronic network interface device the reduction to the external computer server.

The first graphical element can have a first elongated curved shape following a first generally curved path and be at least partially filled with a first visually distinguishable indicia in a clockwise or anti clockwise direction along the first generally curved path. An extent of the first visually distinguishable indicia can be commensurate with the selected one of the plurality of interface specific scores. The second graphical element can have a second elongated curved shape following a second generally curved path concentric with the first generally curved path and be at least partially filled with a second visually distinguishable indicia in the other of the clockwise or anti clockwise direction along the second generally curved path. The first visually distinguishable indicia can be visually distinguishable from the second visually distinguishable indicia. An extent of the second visually distinguishable indicia can be commensurate with the total score.

The computer implemented method can further include causing to be displayed on the composite electronic user interface a selectable graphical element on the second graphical element wherein the selectable graphical element is made to appear on the electronic video display device to slide along the second elongated curved shape as the selectable graphical element is being continuously selected and as the selectable graphical element is slid along the second elongated curved shape the second visually distinguishable indicia that fills the second elongated curved shape to one side of the selectable graphical element changes to a third visually distinguishable indicia that is distinct from the second visually distinguishable indicia and receiving via the one or more human machine interface devices a selection using the selectable graphical element on the second elongated curved shape where a release of the selectable graphical element is detected by the one or more human machine interface devices.

A third section of the second graphical element can be adjacent to the first section of the second graphical element filled with the second visually distinguishable indicia. The third section can be filled with a fifth visually distinguishable indicia distinct from the second visually distinguishable indicia. The first generally curved path and the second generally curved path can share the same loci.

The computer implemented method can further include changing the second visually distinguishable indicia to another visually distinguishable indicia in response to the second score exceeding a first threshold level.

Additional aspects of the present disclosure will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the detailed description of various embodiments which is made with reference to the drawings a brief description of which is provided below.

While this disclosure is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail example implementations of the inventions and concepts herein with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the inventions and concepts and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the disclosed implementations to the examples illustrated. For purposes of the present detailed description the singular includes the plural and vice versa unless specifically disclaimed the words and and or shall be both conjunctive and disjunctive the word all means any and all the word any means any and all and the word including means including without limitation. 

A computer system that includes an electronic database is communicatively coupled to the computer either directly or through the computer network . In the example shown the electronic database is coupled to the computer through the computer network but it can also be coupled through another computer network or through one of the external computer servers such as through an application program interface API as that term is understood in the computer and software programming arts. The reference number refers to an electronic computer such as a server that includes or is communicatively coupled to a database that stores information in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. The database can be incorporated into the computer . The modules and components shown in show an exemplary configuration but those skilled in the art will appreciate that other configurations can be used to carry out the aspects of the present disclosure. The particular configurations of the modules and components are not pertinent to these aspects.

A software module can refer to computer readable object code that executes a software sub routine or program which corresponds to instructions executed by any microprocessor or microprocessing device to perform described functions acts or steps. Any of the methods or algorithms or functions described herein can include non transitory machine or computer readable instructions for execution by a an electronic processor b an electronic controller and or c any other suitable electronic processing device. Any algorithm software module software component software program routine sub routine or software application or method disclosed herein can be embodied as a computer program product having one or more non transitory tangible medium or media such as for example a flash memory a CD ROM a floppy disk a hard drive a digital versatile disk DVD or other electronic memory devices but persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the entire algorithm and or parts thereof could alternatively be executed by a device other than an electronic controller and or embodied in firmware or dedicated hardware in a well known manner e.g. it may be implemented by an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a programmable logic device PLD a field programmable logic device FPLD discrete logic etc. .

Two external computer servers are shown in but of course there can be many more coupled to the computer network in the computer system . A reference number without a letter can refer to either or both items to which it refers. Thus the reference number can refer to the computer server a or the computer server or both the computer servers and . The term external means that the computer server is external to the computer e.g. housed in a separate housing and a physical distance from the computer or it can refer to being operated or owned by an owner or operator different from an owner or operator of the computer and or the electronic database . For convenience when referring to the database herein it is understood as described above that the database can include or be coupled to an electronic computer such as a server which is owned or operated by a different owner or operator from the owner of operator of the external computer servers .

A very basic flow involving an electronic user interface is shown in but described in more detail in later figures. However for the sake of introducing these concepts an existing user interface UI can be conventionally requested by the software application associated with the computer . The software application can be a web browser or a standalone software application that is operable to access the computer network and to make requests from and send information to the external computer server . For example the standalone software application can be an app as that term is popularly known that runs on a smartphone or tablet device. For convenience and ease of discussion the software application will be assumed to be a web browser but of course the present disclosure is not limited to use of a web browser. The web browser requests from an external computer server that an existing UI be downloaded to the computer . The term existing means that the UI has not yet been modified by the aspects of the present disclosure. The owner or operator of the external computer server has already created and stored the existing UI and made it available for download such as over the Internet in response to requests from client devices such as the computer . Thus another term to use for existing is unmodified in the sense that the UI is downloaded in an unmodified form from the external computer server through the computer network to a conventional communications interface of the computer .

The existing UI is downloaded from the computer server to the computer and is interpreted by the web browser which would conventionally cause any graphical objects defined in the UI to be displayed on the electronic video display . However broadly speaking the existing UI is modified by the present disclosure to produce a composite UI that is displayed on the electronic video display . To do so the same software application or another software application such as a web browser extension interacts with a score calculation module and an extraction module to add graphical and optionally selectable elements to the existing UI or to supplement the existing UI with additional graphical and optionally selectable elements. It is important to emphasize that although the score calculation module and the extraction module are shown in the computer as previously emphasized is a functional diagram and these modules can be associated with the computer server that is operably coupled or incorporates the database . The modules are shown associated with the computer for convenience because they interact with the software application s executed by the computer but their physical location is not pertinent to the present disclosure. The details of the score calculation module and the extraction module are explained in more detail in connection with later figures.

Without limiting the present disclosure the following table illustrates examples of how many points can be assigned to each action type 

The database also stores and keeps track of a total score which is the sum of all the UI specific scores . The total score is a metric of the user s overall clout. There is a similar table for every user. Only one is shown here but a user can be identified through a user account that the user accesses such as with conventional login credentials to confirm the user s identity and authorization to have the user s actions tracked. In this way the user is in control of which activities are tracked. Many online users have a disinclination to allow owners or operators of websites to track their activities. The present disclosure puts that power in the hands of the user so that the user decides which actions are tracked but not by the owner or operator of the UIs the user visits but rather by a third party owner or operator that the user trusts. To consent to be tracked the user can install and run a browser extension that integrally works with a web browser that downloads the existing UI or the user can install and run an app on a smartphone or tablet which can be a browser or other customized app with browser capabilities. Tracking can be turned on or off by the user through the browser extension or app. When turned on the database keeps track of the user s actions characterizes the type of each action assigns the corresponding point value to each type of action tallies the specific UI scores and keeps a running tally of the user s total score across all UIs.

The algorithm associates using the computer each of the inputs with a corresponding point value such as shown in the table in . An extent of the point value is a function of at least a type of the respective human machine action associated with the respective one of the inputs again such as shown and described in connection with . Different point values are associated with different types of human machine actions.

The algorithm calculates using the computer a total score based on all of the corresponding point values associated with the physical inputs . The algorithm calculates using the computer for each of multiple existing electronic user interfaces such as the UI an interface specific score that is based on at least some of the point values associated with the corresponding one of the existing electronic user interfaces . The algorithm dynamically generates using the computer a composite electronic user interface from at least 1 a selected one of the existing electronic user interfaces downloaded from an external computer server over the computer network and 2 the UI specific score corresponding to the selected UI . To dynamically generate the composite UI the algorithm extracts from the selected user interface or the external computer server at least identification information of the selected user interface to determine which of the interface specific scores to select . The algorithm can optionally also extract from the selected user interface or the external computer server an attribute of an item portrayed on the selected user interface . The attribute as explained in connection with can include a number indicative of a value of the item which can be a product or service for example.

To dynamically generate the composite UI the algorithm retrieves using the computer the total score and the selected UI specific score that corresponds to the selected user interface determined by the extracting in block . The algorithm features a dynamically changing graphical representation with the existing electronic user interface . The dynamically changing graphical representation features a first graphical element representing the selected UI specific score corresponding to the selected user interface and a second graphical element representing the total score to produce the composite UI that includes at least a portion of the existing electronic UI and the dynamically changing graphical representation . The algorithm causes the composite electronic UI to be displayed on one of the electronic video display device s .

The following figures use any of the aspects described above in connection with the foregoing . These figures and accompanying description lay out some of the foundational aspects of the present disclosure which the following figures show as mere exemplars of the many implementations contemplated by the present disclosure.

The second graphical element has a second elongated curved shape following a second generally curved path concentric with the first generally curved path and is at least partially filled with a second visually distinguishable indicia in the clockwise or anti clockwise direction along the second generally curved path. The first generally curved path and the second generally curved path can share a common loci. The first visually distinguishable indicia is visually distinguishable from the second visually distinguishable indicia meaning for example they have different colors color patterns etc. and are otherwise visually distinguishable from one another as displayed on the video display . An extent of the second visually distinguishable indicia is commensurate with the total score the UI specific score being a subset of the total score . The extent of the color refers to how much of the graphical element is filled in with the color. The graphical elements visually resemble a circular shaped meter that is filled in gradually with a color in a clockwise or anti clockwise direction. In this example one meter fills in an anti clockwise direction as the user accumulates points associated with the specific UI while the other meter fills in a clockwise direction. Also shown in the frame or window is indicia indicating a level that the user has achieved based on the total score accumulated. In this example the starting level is bronze and as will be described in later figures the user accumulates more points sufficient to exceed a first level threshold to be upgraded to a second level called silver in this example. The following table illustrates an example of different levels and the total or UI specific points the user needs to accumulate to unlock additional benefits. Although example level names are provided as bronze silver etc. the levels can be identified by any other indicia such as by numbers e.g. Level 1 Level 2 and so forth.

As the user accumulates more points either total points or UI specific points the user can request higher reductions in the value e.g. price of an item e.g. product or service offered for purchase on a UI and starting at the silver level enjoys a range of reductions for which no points will be lost. As will be explained below the level of points enjoyed by the user is an indication of that user s purchasing clout but the user can exceed the clout by asking for a higher reduction in the value at the risk of losing points and even dropping to a lower level. Again the user is in complete control of how the user accumulates points and how many points the user may be willing to sacrifice to procure a steeper discount off the value of an item.

Returning to although the level is shown in text as bronze in the example alternately the colors selected for the graphical elements can also indicate the level of points the user has achieved. For example in the silver level the color of one or both of the graphical elements can be various shades of a gray or silver color whereas in the gold level the color of one or both graphical elements can change to a gold or yellow color. The user s current total score is also displayed on the frame which in this example is 4635 points which is just shy of the 5000 threshold needed to be upgraded from the bronze level to the silver level according to the example table shown above. Here the user is purchasing items in this example tickets to a sports game using an existing UI . In the frame the user s identification information extracted from the user account is auto filled or auto populated into the fields required by the owner or operator of the existing UI to complete a purchase transaction of the items tickets in an auto filled area on the frame . In this example the user is receiving a 10 discount off the value of the tickets of 98 for a total of 89. The user entry area shown below the auto filled area includes credit card fields for input by the user to complete the electronic transaction. Thus the frame includes some auto filled fields extracted from the existing UI and auto populated with information supplied by the user and stored in the user account and some fields that the user is required to complete. The frame also shows an indication that 89 points will be added to the user s UI specific and total score upon completion of the purchase of the tickets.

In the user is now interacting with a different existing UI like the UI and this time the UI offers an item that corresponds to a taxi service. A composite UI is shown that includes the existing UI and a frame or window that includes a graphical representation of the scores . In this example the total score indicated by the second graphical element is slightly more filled in compared to the total score shown by the second graphical element in because 89 points have been added to the user s total score based on the purchase of the tickets on the UI . The color in the second graphical element is added in a clockwise direction. The first graphical element shows the user a visual indication e.g. a colorized arc of the number of points accumulated for the owner or operator of the UI that offers the taxi service. Here the user has taken more actions to use the taxi service on the UI than to purchase tickets on the UI . So the UI specific score represented by the first graphical element is filled in an anti clockwise direction to a greater extent than the UI specific score for the first graphical element shown in . The amount that the color fills the circular meter can be commensurate with a maximum total points threshold or it can be automatically adjusted as a function of all the other UI specific scores . For example if the UI specific scores range from 1 1500 but then eventually shift to range from 1000 50 000 the amount extent of color that fills the meter can be a function of the maximum UI specific score which will usually increase as a trend and a maximum total points threshold which can be reset each time a new maximum UI specific score is achieved. The amount extent of color that fills the meter can be adjusted in similarly. For example until the user achieves the highest Black level of points the maximum number of points threshold for the total score can be set at 200 000. So if the user has 50 000 points then the meter is filled 25 of the entire circle.

Also displayed in is an adjusted total score of 4724 which is the sum of 4635 points from plus the 89 points added through the purchase of the tickets on the UI bringing the new total score to 4724 even closer to the threshold between the bronze and silver levels. Again these illustrations intend to show how the user can take actions on different existing UIs such as different websites and accumulate different UI specific points that are tallied for each specific UI and displayed on the composite UI . One more example is shown in where a composite UI includes an existing UI that differs from the UI and the UI and a frame or window displaying simultaneously with the existing UI on the same screen on the video display a graphical representation that includes the UI specific score for the UI and the user s total score . In this example the graphical representation shows that the UI specific meter barely fills the entire circle which means that of the three UIs this user has taken the fewest actions in connection with the UI . The total score meter graphically represents the total score of 4972 points which is also displayed in the frame . The color filling the total score meter advances slightly in the clockwise direction from to because 248 points were added to the user s total score thanks to the purchase of the taxi service which was captured by the database and added to the user s total score bringing the user within 38 points of achieving silver level status.

In the user has selected an item to purchase on the UI and the computer can extract from the UI at least image of the item and a value e.g. price for the item . In the extracted value is now shown on the frame of the composite UI along with the extracted photo of the item . A second graphical representation is shown on the UI which allows the user to purchase the item for the price offered by the merchant of the UI or make a counteroffer using the composite UI . The frame also displays a meter showing the UI specific score as a color filling the meter as shown along with the number of points which in this example is 125. Thus the user has accumulated 125 points with this UI through various prior actions taken with the owner or operator of this UI . The user s UI specific score and or the user s level is commensurate with the extent of a discount or reduction the user can request and realistically be accepted by the merchant of the UI . In this example the item is a shirt product that can be purchased for 24.99 from the owner or operator e.g. merchant of the UI . The frame displays selectable elements which can be selected by the user using the HMI device to accept the offer make a counter offer or add the item to the user s wish list which if taken would add one point to the user s UI specific score for the UI and the user s total score according to the example Table 1 shown above .

In the user is taking a different type of action on an existing UI . In the type of action is a purchase but in the user is about to write and submit a review for an item featured on the UI . According to the example Table 1 shown above the user will receive 10 points for submitting a review of an item featured on the UI . In this example the composite UI has extracted a photo of the item from the UI and displayed it on the UI . The user has written a review by inputting text into a text entry object on the UI and submitted the review to the website associated with the UI . The frame shows that 10 points have been added to the user s total score bringing the user s total score from 4997 to 5007 which according to Table 2 upgrades the user from the bronze level to the silver level which is also shown in the frame of . The color that fills the first graphical element is advanced slightly in an anti clockwise direction to indicate that 10 points have been added to the UI specific score for the UI . The color that fills the second graphical element is also advanced slightly in a clockwise direction to indicate that 10 points have also been added to the total score for the user. The updated total score of 5007 is shown in the frame .

In the user is taking another type of action on an existing UI which is different from the purchase action taken in or the review action taken in . In the user has shared an item featured on the UI on a UI that can be for example a social networking website or electronic social network with other users of that social networking website featured in the UI . The composite UI also includes a graphical representation having a first graphical element that shows the number of points accumulated by the user through actions taken on the social networking website along with the user s total points represented graphically in the second graphical element . By submitting the review the user accumulates an additional 5 points according to Table 2 above increasing the user s total score from 5007 to 5012 which is shown in the composite UI shown in . When the review is submitted the respective colors that fill the first and second graphical elements advances slightly to fill each of the graphical elements accordingly.

In the user has slid the slider well beyond the threshold to request a maximum discount of 25 off the price of 1299. As the user slides the slider beyond the threshold the color of the first graphical element begins to change to another color in the section which enlarges or fills in more as the slider is slid further away from the threshold. In this example the user risks losing 325 of the 1200 points if the user obtains the item at a 25 reduction off the price displayed on the UI . The dot represented by represents the average offer of all previously accepted offers for this UI . As the slider crosses the threshold between the two sections of the second graphical element of the graphical representation the section of the first graphical element begins to grow filling in a clockwise direction against the direction that the first graphical element normally grows when points are being added. The juxtaposition and shifting of the colors relative to the slider position allow the user to quickly adjust parameters visually without reference to any numbers. The encroachment of the second section into the first graphical element shows the user graphically how much the user stands to lose in exchange for achieving the requested reduction of 25 off the price for the item . A warning can be displayed in the frame of the composite UI to warn the user how many points the user risks losing here 325 points . The user can submit the offer requesting the reduction of 25 by selecting the selectable element which bears indicia Send Your Offer. 

Instead of showing two colors initially in the sections the entire total score meter can be shown in an initial color and then as the slider is slid past the threshold beyond which points begin to be deducted the second section can change to another. When the user releases the slider such as shown in the second section is completely filled with another color. But this second section does not change color until the slider is slid across the threshold. The selection by the user is indicated when the HMI device detects a release of the selectable graphical element such as when the user lets go of a mouse button or takes a finger away from a touchscreen overlaying the video display . Alternately when the HMI device includes a gesture sensing system including a digital camera a finger gesture made by the user can be detected to adjust the slider. For example the gesture sensing system can detect when the user mimics a rotation motion with the thumb and forefinger of an invisible air knob in either the clockwise or anti clockwise direction as if turning a physical knob and the computer can cause the slider to move in the direction of rotation detected from the gesture.

In the composite UI reports to the user that the offer for a 25 reduction in the value of the item has been submitted to the owner or operator of the UI . The computer generates an electronic record to be communicated back to the external server hosting the UI or to another backend server through an API operated by the owner or operator of the UI . The electronic record includes the item and the requested reduction in the form of a percentage discount e.g. 25 or in the form of a reduced value e.g. 974.25 . No information regarding the user is communicated to the UI . The electronic record may include one or both of the user s UI specific score associated with the UI and the total score . This allows the owner or operator merchant to evaluate the anonymous user s purchasing clout and how much the merchant may value this anonymous user s action and future actions. Again preferably the user s identity is not conveyed to the merchant although the merchant may know the user s identity through the user s other interactions with the merchant s UI e.g. such as through the use of cookies locally stored objects or other persistently stored objects that include information about the user .

In another example the slider can be shown on the first graphical representation instead of the second graphical representation such as shown in . Here the user moves the slider along the first graphical representation to increase or decrease the extent of a reduction in the value of the item that the users wishes to request. In another example a second slider not shown in addition to the slider can be shown on the first graphical representation corresponding to the UI specific score allowing the user to manipulate either or both sliders to request reductions in the item of interest.

Returning to the offer is submitted by the computer as an electronic record to the merchant selling the item on the UI . In the merchant has decided to accept the requested reduction of 25 and this is conveyed on the frame of the composite UI . The graphical representation shows the updated points for the UI specific score associated with the UI and for the total score . Here the user gained 975 points thanks to the purchase of the item and according to Table 2 above the user accumulates 1 point for every 1 spent but in this example can lose 325 points in exchange for requesting a discount that exceeded what the user could request at the silver level. Alternately the user can lose points 325 in this example only if the offer is rejected by the merchant selling the item on the UI . The two graphical elements of the graphical representation are updated accordingly. Comparing the first graphical element corresponding to the UI specific score associated with the UI has shrunk by an amount commensurate with reducing 1200 points by 325 points while the second graphical element has increased commensurate with adding 975 325 points to 5012 points. The updated total score for this user is increased from 5012 to 5662 5012 975 325 .

In the composite UI shows an example checkout process. The checkout process can alternately be conventionally carried out on the UI but in this example the composite UI completes the electronic transaction between the user and the merchant. Again the identity of the user can remain anonymous to the merchant in this example. The area of the frame is auto populated in a similar manner as described in connection with above. A user entry area requires entry by the user of information necessary to complete the electronic transaction again in a similar manner as described in connection with . A selectable element allows the user to complete the electronic transaction on the frame of the composite UI . The computer assembles an electronic record including the purchase amount and the item and sends the same to the merchant for accounting and reconciliation and processing. The processing can include the merchant s sending the item when the item is a tangible item to a physical address of the user.

As mentioned above instead of the slider appearing on the second graphical element it can instead appear on the first graphical element . In a slider is shown on the first graphical element which graphically shows the user s UI specific score associated with the UI . Here a dot or other indicia on the first graphical element shows where the current offer of 8 off would fall on the curved meter representing the first graphical element .

First the example table that can be represented in the database is shown at the top of . Here four different merchants are shown along with their respective merchant scores reflecting the number of points the user has accumulated with each merchant. The points are broken down in the next five columns according to the type of action taken that resulted in the point accrual. Thus for example the user has earned merchant specific points for submitting reviews for items available for purchase at the merchant John Shirts. The total score is also indicated which is the sum of the merchant specific points listed in the rows above the total score column.

The next set of charts illustrate a point trend over time for each of the first three merchants and the chart is a point trend over time of the total score. The x axis is time but not necessarily on a linear scale and the y axis is number of points earned for that merchant by the user different users would of course have different point trends . The last chart shows two curves . This chart graphically illustrates how the user can earn points faster based on frequency of actions. In this example two frequency thresholds are established. The x axis is time and the y axis for the curve is a number of actions which can be seen over a time period on the x axis. As the user achieves a certain frequency of actions e.g. more than 50 actions per week the first frequency threshold is crossed which enables the user to earn extra points greater than those in Table 1. For example the user can start earning double the number of points listed in Table 1. If the user achieves an even higher frequency of actions e.g. more than 100 actions per week the second frequency threshold is crossed which enables the user to earn even more points than when the first frequency threshold was crossed. For example the user can start earning triple the number of points listed in Table 1. But when the frequency of actions dips below either or both of the thresholds the extra points will drop off accordingly. Acceleration of earned points will also cause the user to reach the next level of points as summarized in Table 2 above. The charts are for ease of discussion and are not necessarily displayed to the user although they can be.
